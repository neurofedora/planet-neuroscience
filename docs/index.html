<p>by Amadeus Maes, Mauricio Barahona, Claudia Clopath</p>

Learning to produce spatiotemporal sequences is a common task that the brain has to solve. The same neural substrate may be used by the brain to produce different sequential behaviours. The way the brain learns and encodes such tasks remains unknown as current computational models do not typically use realistic biologically-plausible learning. Here, we propose a model where a spiking recurrent network of excitatory and inhibitory biophysical neurons drives a read-out layer: the dynamics of the driver recurrent network is trained to encode time which is then mapped through the read-out neurons to encode another dimension, such as space or a phase. Different spatiotemporal patterns can be learned and encoded through the synaptic weights to the read-out neurons that follow common Hebbian learning rules. We demonstrate that the model is able to learn spatiotemporal dynamics on time scales that are behaviourally relevant and we show that the learned sequences are robustly replayed during a regime of spontaneous activity.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/hPSUoC3dZgU" width="1" />

<p>by Simon D. Angus, Jonathan Newton</p>

For almost four decades, cooperation has been studied through the lens of the prisoner’s dilemma game, with cooperation modelled as the play of a specific strategy. However, an alternative approach to cooperative behavior has recently been proposed. Known as collaboration, the new approach considers mutualistic strategic choice and can be applied to any game. Here, we bring these approaches together and study the effect of collaboration on cooperative dynamics in the standard prisoner’s dilemma setting. It turns out that, from a baseline of zero cooperation in the absence of collaboration, even relatively rare opportunities to collaborate can support material, and robust, levels of cooperation. This effect is mediated by the interaction structure, such that collaboration leads to greater levels of cooperation when each individual strategically interacts with relatively few other individuals, matching well-known characteristics of human interaction networks. Conversely, collaboratively induced cooperation vanishes from dense networks, thus placing environmental limits on collaboration’s successful role in cooperation.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/hY3eRymbwKc" width="1" />

In pathology, tissue images are evaluated using a light microscope, relying on the expertise and experience of pathologists. There is a great need for computational methods to quantify and standardize histological observations. Computational quantification methods become more and more essential to evaluate tissue images. In particular, the distribution of tumor cells and their microenvironment are of special interest. Here, we systematically investigated tumor cell properties and their spatial neighborhood relations by a new application of statistical analysis to whole slide images of Hodgkin lymphoma, a tumor arising in lymph nodes, and inflammation of lymph nodes called lymphadenitis. We considered properties of more than 400, 000 immunohistochemically stained, CD30-positive cells in 35 whole slide images of tissue sections from subtypes of the classical Hodgkin lymphoma, nodular sclerosis and mixed cellularity, as well as from lymphadenitis. We found that cells of specific morphology exhibited significant favored and unfavored spatial neighborhood relations of cells in dependence of their morphology. This information is important to evaluate differences between Hodgkin lymph nodes infiltrated by tumor cells (Hodgkin lymphoma) and inflamed lymph nodes, concerning the neighborhood relations of cells and the sizes of cells. The quantification of neighborhood relations revealed new insights of relations of CD30-positive cells in different diagnosis cases. The approach is general and can easily be applied to whole slide image analysis of other tumor types.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/uCnNctQlb8g" width="1" />

For women with access to healthcare and early detection, breast cancer deaths are caused primarily by metastasis rather than growth of the primary tumor. Metastasis has been difficult to study because it happens deep in the body, occurs over years, and involves a small fraction of cells from the primary tumor. Furthermore, within-tumor heterogeneity relevant to metastasis can also lead to therapy failures and is obscured by studies of bulk tissue. Here we exploit heterogeneity to identify molecular mechanisms of metastasis. We use “organoids”, groups of hundreds of tumor cells taken from a patient and grown in the lab, to probe tumor heterogeneity, with potentially thousands of organoids generated from a single tumor. We show that organoids have the character of biological replicates: within-tumor and between-tumor variation are of similar magnitude. We develop new methods based on population genetics and variance components models to build between-tumor and within-tumor statistical tests, using organoids analogously to large sibships and vastly amplifying the test power. We show great efficiency for tests based on the organoids with the most extreme phenotypes and potential cost savings from pooled tests of the extreme tails, with organoids generated from hundreds of tumors having power predicted to be similar to bulk tests of hundreds of thousands of tumors. We apply these methods to an association test for molecular correlates of invasion, using a novel quantitative invasion phenotype calculated as the spectral power of the organoid boundary. These new approaches combine to show a strong association between invasion and protein expression of Keratin 14, a known biomarker for poor prognosis, with <i>p</i> = 2 × 10<sup>−45</sup> for within-tumor tests of individual organoids and <i>p</i> &lt; 10<sup>−6</sup> for pooled tests of extreme tails. Future studies using these methods could lead to discoveries of new classes of cancer targets and development of corresponding therapeutics.

<p>Gaze holding in the horizontal and vertical directions is separately controlled via the oculomotor neural integrators, the prepositus hypoglossi nucleus (PHN) and the interstitial nucleus of Cajal (INC), respectively. Our previous <i>in vitro</i> studies demonstrated that transient, high-frequency local stimulation of the PHN and the INC increased the frequency of spontaneous EPSCs that lasted for several seconds. The sustained EPSC response of PHN neurons was attributed to the activation of local excitatory networks primarily mediated via Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable AMPA (CP-AMPA) receptors and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated nonselective cation (CAN) channels. However, the contribution of CP-AMPA receptors to the activation of INC excitatory networks appeared to be small. In this study, we clarified the mechanisms of excitatory network activation in the PHN and INC using whole-cell recordings in rat brainstem slices. Although physiological and histological analyses showed that neurons that expressed CP-AMPA receptors existed not only in the PHN but also in the INC, the effect of a CP-AMPA receptor antagonist on the sustained EPSC response was significantly weaker in INC neurons than in PHN neurons. Meanwhile, the effect of an NMDA receptor antagonist on the sustained EPSC response was significantly stronger in INC neurons than in PHN neurons. Furthermore, the current and the charge transfer mediated via NMDA receptors were significantly larger in INC neurons than in PHN neurons. These results strongly suggest that these excitatory networks are activated via different synaptic mechanisms: a CP-AMPA receptor and CAN channel-dependent mechanism and an NMDA receptor-dependent mechanism in horizontal and vertical integrators, respectively.</p>

Abstract<p>Circadian rhythms are 24-hour cycles in physiology regulated by the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in the brain, where daily cues act on SCN neurons to alter clock timing. Cannabinoid signaling modulates SCN neuronal activity, though the mechanism remains unclear. We propose that neuronal activity generates endocannabinoid release, activating astrocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, which releases adenosine and activates adenosine-1 receptors (A1Rs) on the presynaptic axon terminals, decreasing GABA release. We demonstrated, in mice, that activation of cannabinoid-1 receptors (CB1R) with the agonist WIN 55,212-2 (WIN) reduced the miniature GABA receptor-mediated postsynaptic current (mGPSC) frequency by a mechanism that requires astrocytes and A1R. WIN activated an intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling pathway in astrocytes. Activating this intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> pathway with DREADDs also decreased the mGPSC frequency and required A1R activation. The frequency of spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> events, including those induced by depolarization of a postsynaptic SCN neuron, was reduced by blocking CB1R activation with AM251, demonstrating neuronal endocannabinoid signaling modulates astrocytic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in the SCN. Finally, daytime application of WIN or adenosine phase advanced the molecular circadian clock, indicating that this cannabinoid signaling pathway is vital for the timing of circadian rhythms.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Astrocytes are a critical component of the neural network in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) required for the generation of precise circadian rhythms. We hypothesized that postsynaptic SCN neurons recruit astrocytes via endocannabinoid signaling to modulate presynaptic GABA release. We demonstrate, using a combination of approaches including whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology, GCaMP6 calcium imaging in astrocytes, pharmacology, and manipulation of intracellular signaling cascades using DREADD technology, that SCN neurons release cannabinoids that activate astrocyte intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling pathways to modulate GABA neurotransmission via adenosine. In addition to unraveling this novel signaling cascade in the SCN, we demonstrate that both CB1 receptor activation and adenosine phase advance the molecular circadian clock, suggesting an important role for astrocytes in modulating clock timing.</p>

Ventral tegmental area (VTA) and Locus Coeruleus (LC) are canonically described as the main sources of dopamine (DA) and noradrenaline (NA) with dissociate functions. A comparison of diverse studies shows that these neuromodulators largely overlap in multiple domains such as shared biosynthetic pathway and co-release from the LC terminals, convergent innervations, non-specificity of receptors and transporters, and shared intracellular signaling pathways. DA–NA interactions are mainly studied in prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, yet it can be extended to the whole brain given the diversity of catecholamine innervations. LC can simultaneously broadcast both dopamine and noradrenaline across the brain. Here, we briefly review the molecular, cellular, and physiological overlaps between DA and NA systems and point to their functional implications. We suggest that DA and NA may function in parallel to facilitate learning and maintain the states required for normal cognitive processes. Various signaling modules of NA and DA have been targeted for developing of therapeutics. Understanding overlaps of the two systems is crucial for more effective interventions in a range of neuropsychiatric conditions.</p>

<p>The corticospinal tract (CST) plays an important role in controlling voluntary movement. Because the CST has a long trajectory throughout the brain toward the spinal cord, many axon guidance molecules are required to navigate the axons correctly during development. Previously, we found that double-knockout (DKO) mouse embryos lacking the heparan sulfate endosulfatases, Sulf1 and Sulf2, showed axon guidance defects of the CST owing to the abnormal accumulation of Slit2 protein on the brain surface. However, postnatal development of the CST, especially the pyramidal decussation and spinal cord projection, could not be assessed because DKO mice on a C57BL/6 background died soon after birth. We recently found that Sulf1/2 DKO mice on a mixed C57BL/6 and CD-1/ICR background can survive into adulthood and therefore investigated the anatomy and function of the CST in the adult DKO mice. In Sulf1/2 DKO mice, abnormal dorsal deviation of the CST fibers on the midbrain surface persisted after maturation of the CST. At the pyramidal decussation, some CST fibers located near the midline crossed the midline, whereas others located more laterally extended ipsilaterally. In the spinal cord, the crossed CST fibers descended in the dorsal funiculus on the contralateral side and entered the contralateral gray matter normally, whereas the uncrossed fibers descended in the lateral funiculus on the ipsilateral side and entered the ipsilateral gray matter. As a result, the CST fibers that originated from 1 side of the brain projected bilaterally in the DKO spinal cord. Consistently, microstimulation of 1 side of the motor cortex evoked electromyogram responses only in the contralateral forelimb muscles of the wild-type mice, whereas the same stimulation evoked bilateral responses in the DKO mice. The functional consequences of the CST defects in the Sulf1/2 DKO mice were examined using the grid-walking, staircase, and single pellet-reaching tests, which have been used to evaluate motor function in mice. Compared with the wild-type mice, the Sulf1/2 DKO mice showed impaired performance in these tests, indicating deficits in motor function. These findings suggest that disruption of Sulf1/2 genes leads to both anatomical and functional defects of the CST.</p>

<p>Tonotopic differences in the structure and physiological function, e.g., synapse number, membrane properties, Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependence of exocytosis and vesicle pool replenishment of inner hair cells (IHCs) along the longitudinal cochlear axis have recently been discovered, suggesting different gene expression patterns of IHCs. To determine whether IHCs present different gene expression patterns along the longitudinal cochlear axis, apical and basal IHCs were collected separately using the suction pipette technique from adult mouse cochleae for RNA-seq and genome-wide transcriptome analysis. We found 689 annotated genes showed more than 2-fold increase in expression. Interestingly, 93.4% of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was upregulated in apical IHCs. Although a subset of genes that related to IHC machinery and deafness were found to be differentially expressed, a gradient of gene expression was indeed detected in Ocm, Pvalb, Prkd1, Fbxo32, Nme2, and Sncg, which may play putative roles in the Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffering and survival regulation. The expression of these genes was validated by real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) or immunostaining. We conclude that IHCs from different mouse cochlear longitudinal position have different gene expression profiles. Our data might serve as a valuable resource for exploring the molecular mechanisms underlying different biological properties as well as the survival regulation of IHCs.</p>

<p>Up to 50% of traumatic brain injury (TBI) survivors demonstrate persisting and late-onset anxiety disorders indicative of limbic system dysregulation, yet the pathophysiology underlying the symptoms is unclear. We hypothesize that the development of TBI-induced anxiety-like behavior in an experimental model of TBI is mediated by changes in glutamate neurotransmission within the amygdala. Adult, male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent midline fluid percussion injury or sham surgery. Anxiety-like behavior was assessed at 7 and 28 days post-injury (DPI) followed by assessment of real-time glutamate neurotransmission in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) using glutamate-selective microelectrode arrays. The expression of anxiety-like behavior at 28 DPI coincided with decreased evoked glutamate release and slower glutamate clearance in the CeA, not BLA. Numerous factors contribute to the changes in glutamate neurotransmission over time. In two additional animal cohorts, protein levels of glutamatergic transporters (Glt-1 and GLAST) and presynaptic modulators of glutamate release (mGluR2, TrkB, BDNF, and glucocorticoid receptors) were quantified using automated capillary western techniques at 28 DPI. Astrocytosis and microglial activation have been shown to drive maladaptive glutamate signaling and were histologically assessed over 28 DPI. Alterations in glutamate neurotransmission could not be explained by changes in protein levels for glutamate transporters, mGluR2 receptors, astrocytosis, and microglial activation. Presynaptic modulators, BDNF and TrkB, were significantly decreased at 28 DPI in the amygdala. Dysfunction in presynaptic regulation of glutamate neurotransmission may contribute to anxiety-related behavior and serve as a therapeutic target to improve circuit function.</p>

<p>The spillover effect of brand scandals commonly exists, and this effect will damage the image of the company, industry or even country in which the scandal occurred. Most previous studies on the brand scandal spillover effect have mainly focused on the corporate and industry levels. However, with the development of brand internalization and media technology, the spillover effect at the country level is becoming increasingly common. In the current study, we conducted an event-related potentials study to explore the spillover effect of brand scandals on the country level as well as its underlying neural basis. Specifically, we compared consumers’ attitudes toward countries of origin with different stereotypes during different types of brand scandals. When a competence scandal took place in a competence stereotype country, a larger P2 mean amplitude was elicited compared to a warmth stereotype country. When a morality scandal took place in a warmth stereotype country, a larger LPP mean amplitude was induced compared to a competence stereotype country. We explain the current results based on expectancy violations theory. When competence scandals take place in competence stereotype countries, there will be a greater degree of violation of expectations compared with that in warmth stereotype countries, which leads to a negative evaluation of the country of origin. When morality scandals take place in warmth stereotype countries, people had a stronger negative emotional arousal when morality scandals happened in the warmth stereotype country.</p>

<p>Repetitive traumatic brain injury (rTBI) is a major health care concern that causes substantial neurological impairment. To better understand rTBI, we introduced a new model of rTBI in mice induced by sudden rotation in the coronal plane combined with lateral translation delivered twice at an interval of 24 h. By routine histology, histological examination of Prussian blue-stained sections revealed the presence of microbleed in the corpus callosum and brain stem. Amyloid precursor protein (β-APP) and neurofilament heavy-chain (NF-200) immunohistochemistry demonstrated axonal injury following rTBI. Swelling, waving, and enlargement axons were observed in the corpus callosum and brain stem 24 h after injury by Bielschowsky staining. Ultrastructural studies by electron microscopy provided further insights into the existence and progression of axonal injury. rTBI led to widespread astrogliosis and microgliosis in white matter, as well as significantly increased levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin (IL)-1β. rTBI mice showed a significantly increased loss of righting reflex (LRR) duration within each time point compared with that of sham animals, which was under 15 min. rTBI mice exhibited depression-like behavior at 1 month. rTBI mice also demonstrated deficits in MWM testing. These results suggested that this model might be suitable for investigating rTBI pathophysiology and evaluating preclinical candidate therapeutics.</p>

Background<p>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and diabetes mellitus (DM) often coexist in patients because having one of these conditions increases risk for the other. These two diseases share several pathophysiological mechanisms, such as specific inflammatory signaling pathways, oxidative stress, and cell apoptosis. It is still unclear exactly which mechanisms associated with DM are responsible for increased AD risk. Studies have found that even transient elevation of brain Aβ levels can allow T2DM to slightly disrupt the neural milieu in a way that encourages pathologies associated with the onset of memory deficits and AD. A recent study argues that a potential common pathogenetic mechanism underlying both DM and AD is evidenced by the cooccurrence of amyloid brain legions and deposits containing both tau and Aβ in pancreatic β cells. Given these links, an investigation detailing disease mechanisms as well as treatment options for patients with cooccurring DM and AD is urgently needed. The biological effects of resveratrol relevant to DM and AD treatment include its abilities to modulate oxidative stress and reduce inflammation. A rat model of DM and concomitant AD was created for this study using intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin and hippocampal injection of Aβ1–40 to characterize resveratrol’s potential protective action.</p>Results<p>Resveratrol significantly increased the Sirt1 expression, inhibited the memory impairment, the increased acetylcholinesterase, malondialdehyde, interleukin-1β and interleukin 6 levels, and the decreased levels of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione in this rat model of diabetes and concomitant AD. The Sirt 1 inhibitor EX527 partially reversed the effects of resveratrol.</p>Conclusion<p>This study suggests that resveratrol may have a neuroprotective action through activation of Sirt1 signaling in diabetes and AD with concurrent onset.</p>

<p>Physical activity (PA) promotes neurogenesis and has neuroprotective effects on the brain, bolstering the structural and functional resources necessary for improved cognitive functioning. Intraindividual variability (IIV) in cognitive performance is linked to neuropsychological structure and functional ability. Despite evidence of the neurogenerative and neuroprotective effects of PA, limited investigation into the link between PA and IIV has been conducted. Across three studies we investigate the effect of PA on IIV in reaction time (RT) on three modified Flanker Tasks. The International PA Questionnaire was used to evaluate PA while the Attention Network Test (ANT) and two additional modified Flanker Tasks were used to assess executive control and attentional performance. RT coefficients of variation (RTCV) were calculated for each participant by dividing the standard deviation by the mean RT for each stimuli condition. Analysis revealed that basic RT was not associated with PA nor was PA predictive of IIV on the modified Flanker Tasks. However, three consistent findings emerged from analysis of the ANT. First, RTCV and moderate PA were positively related, such that more self-reported moderate PA was associated with greater IIV. Conversely, RTCV and vigorous PA were negatively related. Finally, when controlling for the effects of PA on IIV in young adults, variability decreases as age increases. In sum, PA is predictive of IIV on attentional and executive control tasks in young adults, though only at particular intensities and on certain tasks, indicating that task type and cognitive load are important determinants of the relationship between PA and cognitive performance. These findings are consistent with prior literature that suggests that the role of PA in young adults is reliant on specific interventions and measures in order to detect effects more readily found in adolescent and aging populations.</p>

<p>Space generally overshadows time in the construction of theories in cognitive neuroscience. In this paper, we pivot from the spatial axes to the temporal, analyzing fMRI image series to reveal structures in time rather than space. To determine affinities among global brain patterns at different times, core concepts in network analysis (derived from graph theory) were applied temporally, as relations among brain images at every time point during an fMRI scanning epoch. To explore the temporal structures observed through this adaptation of network analysis, data from 180 subjects in the Human Connectome Project were examined, during two experimental conditions: passive movie viewing and rest. The temporal brain, like the spatial brain, exhibits a modular structure, where “modules” are intermittent (distributed in time). These temporal entities are here referred to as themes. Short sequences of themes – motifs – were studied in sequences from 4 to 11 s in length. Many motifs repeated at constant intervals, and are therefore rhythmic; rhythms, converted to frequencies, were often harmonic. We speculate that the structure and interaction of these global oscillations underwrites the capacity to experience and navigate a world which is both recognizably stable and noticeably changing at every moment – a temporal world. In its temporal structure, this brain-constituted world resembles music.</p>

<p>Brain computer interfaces (BCI) for the rehabilitation of motor impairments exploit sensorimotor rhythms (SMR) in the electroencephalogram (EEG). However, the neurophysiological processes underpinning the SMR often vary over time and across subjects. Inherent intra- and inter-subject variability causes covariate shift in data distributions that impede the transferability of model parameters amongst sessions/subjects. Transfer learning includes machine learning-based methods to compensate for inter-subject and inter-session (intra-subject) variability manifested in EEG-derived feature distributions as a covariate shift for BCI. Besides transfer learning approaches, recent studies have explored psychological and neurophysiological predictors as well as inter-subject associativity assessment, which may augment transfer learning in EEG-based BCI. Here, we highlight the importance of measuring inter-session/subject performance predictors for generalized BCI frameworks for both normal and motor-impaired people, reducing the necessity for tedious and annoying calibration sessions and BCI training.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00583">Simultaneous Knockdown of Sprouty2 and PTEN Promotes Axon Elongation of Adult Sensory Neurons</a></h4>

<p>Sprouty2 (Spry2) and phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) are both well-established regulators of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling, and knockdown of Spry2 or PTEN enhances axon regeneration of dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons. The major role of Spry2 is the inhibition of the rat sarcoma RAS/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway, whereas PTEN acts mainly as an inhibitor of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway. In non-neuronal cells, Spry2 increases the expression and activity of PTEN, and PTEN enhances the amount of Spry2 by the inhibition of the microRNA-21 (miR-21) that downregulates Spry2. Applying dissociated DRG neuron cultures from wild-type (WT) or Spry2 deficient mice, we demonstrate that PTEN protein was reduced after 72 h during rapid axonal outgrowth on the laminin substrate. Furthermore, PTEN protein was decreased in DRG cultures obtained from homozygous Spry2−/− knockout mice. Vice versa, Spry2 protein was reduced by PTEN siRNA in WT and heterozygous Spry2+/− neurons. Knockdown of PTEN in DRG cultures obtained from homozygous Spry2−/− knockout mice promoted axon elongation without increasing axonal branching. Activation of Akt, but not ERK, was stronger in response to PTEN knockdown in homozygous Spry2−/− DRG neurons than in WT neurons. Together, our study confirms the important role of the signaling modulators Spry2 and PTEN in axon growth of adult DRG neurons. Both function as endogenous inhibitors of neuronal growth factor signaling and their simultaneous knockdown promotes axon elongation more efficiently than the single knockdown of each inhibitor. Furthermore, Spry2 and PTEN are reciprocally downregulated in adult DRG neuron cultures. Axon growth is influenced by multiple factors and our results demonstrate that the endogenous inhibitors of axon growth, Spry2 and PTEN, are co-regulated in adult DRG neuron cultures. Together, our data demonstrate that combined approaches may be more useful to improve nerve regeneration than targeting one single inhibitor of axon growth.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00579">Fast and Efficient Differentiation of Mouse Embryonic Stem Cells Into ATP-Responsive Astrocytes</a></h4>

<p>Astrocytes are multifunctional cells in the CNS, involved in the regulation of neurovascular coupling, the modulation of electrolytes, and the cycling of neurotransmitters at synapses. Induction of astrocytes from stem cells remains a largely underdeveloped area, as current protocols are time consuming, lack granularity in astrocytic subtype generation, and often are not as efficient as neural induction methods. In this paper we present an efficient method to differentiate astrocytes from mouse embryonic stem cells. Our technique uses a cell suspension protocol to produce embryoid bodies (EBs) that are neurally inducted and seeded onto laminin coated surfaces. Plated EBs attach to the surface and release migrating cells to their surrounding environment, which are further inducted into the astrocytic lineage, through an optimized, heparin-based media. Characterization and functional assessment of the cells consists of immunofluorescent labeling for specific astrocytic proteins and sensitivity to adenosine triphosphate (ATP) stimulation. Our experimental results show that even at the earliest stages of the protocol, cells are positive for astrocytic markers (GFAP, ALDH1L1, S100β, and GLAST) with variant expression patterns and purinergic receptors (P2Y). Generated astrocytes also exhibit differential Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients upon stimulation with ATP, which evolve over the differentiation period. Metabotropic purinoceptors P2Y<sub>1</sub>R are expressed and we offer preliminary evidence that metabotropic purinoceptors contribute to Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients. Our protocol is simple, efficient and fast, facilitating its use in multiple investigations, particularly in vitro studies of engineered neural networks.</p>

<p>Polymorphism of the cholesterol-24S-hydroxylase (CYP46A1) gene is thought to be a risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). A single nucleotide polymorphism (T/C) in intron 2, rs754203, has been confirmed to be implicated in AD. Rs754203 is located in the long intronic non-coding RNA (LincRNA) sequence, which has previously been shown to be involved in the pathology of many diseases. Thus, the present study aimed to investigate the role of LincRNA in the CYP46A1 gene expression and related AD pathology. SH-SY5Y cells with overexpressed TT or CC genotype CYP46A1 were used. Through RT-PCR, Western blot and ELISA assays, we found that LincRNA can affect the CYP46A1 gene expression and the production of 24-OHC and Aβ. Overexpression of LincRNA can significantly inhibit CYP46A1 expression and 24-OHC production, as well as increasing the Aβ expression level. Silencing of LincRNA confirmed the role that it plays in the regulation of CYP46A1, as well as the production of 24-OHC and Aβ. In addition, this effect was stronger in the A type LincRNA than in the G type LincRNA. Results from dual luciferase assays show that LincRNA inhibited the activity of the CYP46A1 gene promoter. This study indicates a possible novel role of LincRNA and provides a new way to look into the relationship between CYP46A1 polymorphism and AD pathology. This may identify a novel pathway through which to explore AD therapy.</p>

<p>The integrity of the frontal areas of the brain, specifically the prefrontal cortex, are critical to preserve cognition and mobility in late life. Prefrontal cortex regions are involved in executive functions and gait control and have been related to the performance of dual-tasks. Dual-task performance assessment may help identify older adults at risk of negative health outcomes. As an alternative to neuroimaging techniques that do not allow assessment during actual motion, functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a non-invasive technique that can assess neural activation through the measurement of cortical oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin levels, while the person is performing a motor task in a natural environment as well as during cognitive tasks. The aim of this review was to describe the use of fNIRS to study frontal lobe hemodynamics during cognitive, motor and dual-tasks in older adults. From the 46 included publications, 20 studies used only cognitive tasks, three studies used motor tasks and 23 used dual-tasks. Our findings suggest that fNIRS detects changes in frontal activation in older adults (cognitively healthy and mild cognitive impairment), especially while performing cognitive and dual-tasks. In both the comparison between older and younger adults, and in people with different neurological conditions, compared to healthier controls, the prefrontal cortex seems to experience a higher activation, which could be interpreted in the context of proposed neural inefficiency and limited capacity models. Further research is needed to establish standardized fNIRS protocols, study the cerebral hemodynamic in different neurological and systemic conditions that might influence cortical activation and explore its role in predicting incident health outcomes such as dementia.</p>

<p>Individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) have worse gait performance compared to cognitive healthy individuals (CHI). The discrepancy between imagined and performed timed up and go test (TUG), known as the TUG delta time, is a marker of brain gait control impairment in individuals with MCI. The study aims to examine the association between the TUG delta time and brain gray matter (GM) volumes in CHI and individuals with MCI. A total of 326 participants, 156 CHI and 170 MCI, with TUG delta time and a brain T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were selected in this cross-sectional study. Individuals with MCI were older and had greater (i.e., worst performance) performed TUG and TUG delta time compared to CHI. The GM volume association with TUG delta time was examined in CHI and MCI assuming that increased TUG delta time would be associated with locally decreased GM volumes. No significant association was found in CHI, whereas TUG delta time was negatively associated with the GM volume of the right medial temporal lobe in individuals with MCI.</p>

Yeast vacuole fusion requires R-SNARE, Q-SNAREs, and HOPS. A HOPS SM-family subunit binds the R- and Qa-SNAREs. We now report that HOPS binds each of the four SNAREs. HOPS catalyzes fusion when the Q-SNAREs are not pre-assembled, ushering them into a functional complex. Co-incubation of HOPS, proteoliposomes bearing R-SNARE, and proteoliposomes with any two Q-SNAREs yields a rapid-fusion complex with 3 SNAREs in a <i>trans</i>-assembly. The missing Q-SNARE then induces sudden fusion. HOPS can 'template' SNARE complex assembly through SM recognition of R- and Qa-SNAREs. Though the Qa-SNARE is essential for spontaneous SNARE assembly, HOPS also assembles a rapid-fusion complex between R- and QbQc-SNARE proteoliposomes in the absence of Qa-SNARE, awaiting Qa for fusion. HOPS-dependent fusion is saturable at low concentrations of each Q-SNARE, showing binding site functionality. HOPS thus tethers membranes, recognizes the R-SNARE, and recognizes Qa or Qb/Qc SNAREs, assembling R+Qa or R+QbQc rapid fusion intermediates.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/53456">Specific depletion of the motor protein KIF5B leads to deficits in dendritic transport, synaptic plasticity and memory</a></h4>

The kinesin I family of motor proteins are crucial for axonal transport, but their roles in dendritic transport and postsynaptic function are not well-defined. Gene duplication and subsequent diversification give rise to three homologous kinesin I proteins (KIF5A, KIF5B and KIF5C) in vertebrates, but it is not clear whether and how they exhibit functional specificity. Here we show that knockdown of KIF5A or KIF5B differentially affects excitatory synapses and dendritic transport in hippocampal neurons. The functional specificities of the two kinesins are determined by their diverse carboxyl-termini, where arginine methylation occurs in KIF5B and regulates its function. KIF5B conditional knockout mice exhibit deficits in dendritic spine morphogenesis, synaptic plasticity and memory formation. Our findings provide insights into how expansion of the kinesin I family during evolution leads to diversification and specialization of motor proteins in regulating postsynaptic function.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/52695">TGFβ signaling is critical for maintenance of the tendon cell fate</a></h4>

Studies of cell fate focus on specification, but little is known about maintenance of the differentiated state. In this study we find that the mouse tendon cell fate requires continuous maintenance <i>in vivo</i> and identify an essential role for TGFβ signaling in maintenance of the tendon cell fate. To examine the role of TGFβ signaling in tenocyte function the TGFb type II receptor (<i>Tgfbr2</i>) was targeted in the Scleraxis-expressing cell lineage using the <i>ScxCre</i> deletor. Tendon development was not disrupted in mutant embryos, but shortly after birth tenocytes lost differentiation markers and reverted to a more stem/progenitor state. Viral reintroduction of <i>Tgfbr2</i> to mutants prevented and even rescued tenocyte dedifferentiation suggesting a continuous and cell autonomous role for TGFβ signaling in cell fate maintenance. These results uncover the critical importance of molecular pathways that maintain the differentiated cell fate and a key role for TGFβ signaling in these processes.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/51921">Emergence of social cluster by collective pairwise encounters in <i>Drosophila</i></a></h4>

Many animals exhibit an astonishing ability to form groups of large numbers of individuals. The dynamic properties of such groups have been the subject of intensive investigation. The actual grouping processes and underlying neural mechanisms, however, remain elusive. Here, we established a social clustering paradigm in <i>Drosophila</i> to investigate the principles governing social group formation. Fruit flies spontaneously assembled into a stable cluster mimicking a distributed network. Social clustering was exhibited as a highly dynamic process including all individuals, which participated in stochastic pair-wise encounters mediated by appendage touches. Depriving sensory inputs resulted in abnormal encounter responses and a high failure rate of cluster formation. Furthermore, the social distance of the emergent network was regulated by <i>ppk</i>-specific neurons, which were activated by contact-dependent social grouping. Taken together, these findings revealed the development of an orderly social structure from initially unorganised individuals via collective actions.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/51701">Development of a confinable gene drive system in the human disease vector <i>Aedes aegypti</i></a></h4>

<i>Aedes aegypti</i> is the principal mosquito vector for many arboviruses that increasingly infect millions of people every year. With an escalating burden of infections and the relative failure of traditional control methods, the development of innovative control measures has become of paramount importance. The use of gene drives has sparked significant enthusiasm for genetic control of mosquitoes; however, no such system has been developed in <i>Ae. aegypti</i>. To fill this void, here we develop several CRISPR-based split gene drives for use in this vector. With cleavage rates up to 100% and transmission rates as high as 94%, mathematical models predict that these systems could spread anti-pathogen effector genes into wild populations in a safe, confinable and reversible manner appropriate for field trials and effective for controlling disease. These findings could expedite the development of effector-linked gene drives that could safely control wild populations of <i>Ae. aegypti</i> to combat local pathogen transmission.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/51419">Bottom-up and top-down neural signatures of disordered multi-talker speech perception in adults with normal hearing</a></h4>

In social settings, speech waveforms from nearby speakers mix together in our ear canals. Normally, the brain unmixes the attended speech stream from the chorus of background speakers using a combination of fast temporal processing and cognitive active listening mechanisms. Of &gt;100,000 patient records,~10% of adults visited our clinic because of reduced hearing, only to learn that their hearing was clinically normal and should not cause communication difficulties. We found that multi-talker speech intelligibility thresholds varied widely in normal hearing adults, but could be predicted from neural phase-locking to frequency modulation (FM) cues measured with ear canal EEG recordings. Combining neural temporal fine structure processing, pupil-indexed listening effort, and behavioral FM thresholds accounted for 78% of the variability in multi-talker speech intelligibility. The disordered bottom-up and top-down markers of poor multi-talker speech perception identified here could inform the design of next-generation clinical tests for hidden hearing disorders.

Far-red absorbing chlorophylls are constitutively present as chlorophyll (Chl) <i>d</i> in the cyanobacterium <i>Acaryochloris marina</i>, or dynamically expressed by synthesis of Chl <i>f</i>, red-shifted phycobiliproteins and minor amounts of Chl <i>d</i> via far-red light photoacclimation in a range of cyanobacteria, which enables them to use near-infrared-radiation (NIR) for oxygenic photosynthesis. While the biochemistry and molecular physiology of Chl <i>f</i>-containing cyanobacteria has been unraveled in culture studies, their ecological significance remains unexplored and no data on their in situ activity exist. With a novel combination of hyperspectral imaging, confocal laser scanning microscopy, and nanoparticle-based O<sub>2</sub> imaging, we demonstrate substantial NIR-driven oxygenic photosynthesis by endolithic, Chl <i>f</i>-containing cyanobacteria within natural beachrock biofilms that are widespread on (sub)tropical coastlines. This indicates an important role of NIR-driven oxygenic photosynthesis in primary production of endolithic and other shaded habitats.

In pursuit of therapeutics for human polyomaviruses, we identified a peptide derived from the BK polyomavirus (BKV) minor structural proteins VP2/3 that is a potent inhibitor of BKV infection with no observable cellular toxicity. The thirteen-residue peptide binds to major structural protein VP1 with single-digit nanomolar affinity. Alanine-scanning of the peptide identified three key residues, substitution of each of which results in ~1000 fold loss of binding affinity with a concomitant reduction in antiviral activity. Structural studies demonstrate specific binding of the peptide to the pore of pentameric VP1. Cell-based assays demonstrate nanomolar inhibition (EC<sub>50</sub>) of BKV infection and suggest that the peptide acts early in the viral entry pathway. Homologous peptide exhibits similar binding to JC polyomavirus VP1 and inhibits infection with similar potency to BKV in a model cell line. Lastly, these studies validate targeting the VP1 pore as a novel strategy for the development of anti-polyomavirus agents.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50342">Receptor-based mechanism of relative sensing and cell memory in mammalian signaling networks</a></h4>

Detecting relative rather than absolute changes in extracellular signals enables cells to make decisions in fluctuating environments. However, how mammalian signaling networks store the memories of past stimuli and subsequently use them to compute relative signals, i.e. perform fold change detection, is not well understood. Using the growth factor-activated PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, we develop computational and analytical models, and experimentally validate a novel mechanism of relative sensing in mammalian cells. This mechanism relies on a new form of cellular memory, where cells effectively encode past stimulation levels in the abundance of cognate receptors on the cell surface. We show the robustness and specificity of the relative sensing for two physiologically important ligands, epidermal growth factor (EGF) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), and across wide ranges of background stimuli. Our results suggest that similar mechanisms of memory and fold change detection are likely to be important across diverse signaling cascades and biological contexts.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/48092">T-cell co-stimulation in combination with targeting FAK drives enhanced anti-tumor immunity</a></h4>

Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK) inhibitors are currently undergoing clinical testing in combination with anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitors. However, which patients are most likely to benefit from FAK inhibitors, and what the optimal FAK/immunotherapy combinations are, is currently unknown. We identify that cancer cell expression of the T-cell co-stimulatory ligand CD80 sensitizes murine tumors to a FAK inhibitor and show that CD80 is expressed by human cancer cells originating from both solid epithelial cancers and some hematological malignancies in which FAK inhibitors have not been tested clinically. In the absence of CD80, we identify that targeting alternative T-cell co-stimulatory receptors, in particular OX-40 and 4-1BB in combination with FAK, can drive enhanced anti-tumor immunity and even complete regression of murine tumors. Our findings provide rationale supporting the clinical development of FAK inhibitors in combination with patient selection based on cancer cell CD80 expression, and alternatively with therapies targeting T-cell co-stimulatory pathways.

Animals exhibit innate and learned preferences for temperature and humidity - conditions critical for their survival and reproduction. Here, we leveraged a whole adult brain electron microscopy volume to study the circuitry associated with antennal thermosensory and hygrosensory neurons, which target specific ventroposterior (VP) glomeruli in the Drosophila melanogaster antennal lobe. We have identified two new VP glomeruli, in addition to the five known ones, and the projection neurons (VP PNs) that relay VP information to higher brain centres, including the mushroom body and lateral horn, seats of learned and innate olfactory behaviours, respectively. Focussing on the mushroom body lateral accessory calyx (lACA), a known thermosensory neuropil, we present a comprehensive connectome by reconstructing neurons downstream of heating- and cooling-responsive VP PNs. We find that a few lACA-associated mushroom body intrinsic neurons (Kenyon cells) solely receive thermosensory inputs, while most receive additional olfactory and thermo- or hygrosensory PN inputs in the main calyx. Unexpectedly, we find several classes of lACA-associated neurons that form a local network with outputs to other brain neuropils, suggesting that the lACA serves as a general hub for thermosensory circuitry. For example, we find DN1 pacemaker neurons that link the lACA to the accessory medulla, likely mediating temperature-based entrainment of the circadian clock. Finally, we survey strongly connected downstream partners of VP PNs across the protocerebrum; these include a descending neuron that receives input mainly from dry-responsive VP PNs, meaning that just two synapses might separate hygrosensory inputs from motor neurons in the nerve cord.

ABSTRACT<p>The first retinal synapse, photoreceptor-&gt;bipolar cell (BC), is both anatomically and functionally complex. Within the same synaptic region, a change in presynaptic glutamate release is sensed by both ON BCs (DBCs) via the metabotropic glutamate receptor 6 (mGluR6), and OFF BCs (HBCs) via ionotropic glutamate receptors to establish parallel signaling pathways that preferentially encode light increments (ON) or decrements (OFF), respectively. The synaptic structural organization of ON and OFF-type BCs at the photoreceptor terminal differs. DBCs make an invaginating synapse that contains a diverse but incompletely understood complex of interacting proteins (signalplex). HBCs make primarily flat contacts that contain an apparent different set of proteins that is equally uncharacterized. LRIT3 is a synaptic protein known to be essential for ON pathway visual function. In both male and female mice, we demonstrate that LRIT3 interacts with and is required for expression of Nyctalopin, and thus TRPM1 at all DBC dendritic tips, but DBC signalplex components are not required for LRIT3 expression. Using whole-cell and multi-electrode array electrophysiology and glutamate imaging, we demonstrate that the loss of LRIT3 impacts both ON and OFF signaling pathway function. Without LRIT3, excitatory input to type 1 BCs is reduced, as are the visually evoked responses of many OFF retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). We conclude that the absence of LRIT3 expression disrupts excitatory input to OFF BCs and, thus disrupts the normal function of OFF RGCs.</p><p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> At the first visual synapse, photoreceptor cells signal to two distinct BC populations, one characterized by a depolarizing response to light onset (ON or DBCs), the other by a hyperpolarizing response (OFF or HBCs). The DBC light response depends on a G protein-coupled metabotropic glutamate receptor and associated protein complex, known as the DBC signalplex. Loss of function mutations in signalplex proteins lead to loss of scotopic visual function, and causes congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB) in humans. Here we show how the loss of LRIT3, a previously identified signalplex protein, not only prevents functional assembly of the DBC signalplex, but also alters visual function through both ON and OFF signaling pathways.</p>

<p>Canids display a vast diversity of social organizations, from solitary-living
to pairs to packs. Domestic dogs have descended from pack-living gray wolf-like
ancestors. Unlike their group living ancestors, free-ranging dogs are
facultatively social, preferring to forage solitarily. They are scavengers by
nature, mostly dependent on human garbage and generosity for their sustenance.
Free-ranging dogs are highly territorial, often defending their territories
using vocalizations. Vocal communication plays a critical role between inter
and intraspecies and group interaction and maintaining their social dynamics.
Barking is the most common among the different types of vocalizations of dogs.
Dogs have a broad hearing range and can respond to sounds over long distances.
Domestic dogs have been shown to have the ability to distinguish between
barking in different contexts. Since free-ranging dogs regularly engage in
various kinds of interactions with each other, it is interesting to know
whether they are capable of distinguishing between vocalizations of their own
and other groups. In this study, a playback experiment was used to test if dogs
can distinguish between barking of their own group member from a non-group
member. Though dogs respond to barking from other groups in territorial
exchanges, they did not respond differently to the self and other group barking
in the playback experiments. This suggests a role of context in the
interactions between dogs and opens up possibilities for future studies on the
comparison of the responses of dogs in playback experiments with their natural
behavior through long-term observations.

<p>We summarize the argument in Friston (2013,
https://doi.org/10.1098/rsif.<a href="http://export.arxiv.org/abs/2013.0475">2013.0475</a>) and highlight some technical errors. We
also discuss how these errors affect the similar Friston (2014,
https://doi.org/10.1109/JPROC.<a href="http://export.arxiv.org/abs/2014.23062">2014.23062</a>51). The errors call into question the
purported interpretation that the internal coordinates of every system with a
Markov blanket will appear to engage in Bayesian inference. In particular, we
identify three formal errors in the main argument of Friston (2013): The first
concerns the rewriting of the equations of motion of systems with Markov
blankets which turns out not to be equivalent. We prove the non-equivalence
with a counterexample that exhibits a Markov blanket but does not satisfy the
rewritten equations. Our counterexample also invalidates the corresponding (but
more general) rewritten equations in the more recent Friston (2019,
<a href="http://export.arxiv.org/abs/1906.10184">arXiv:1906.10184v1</a> ). The second error is the lack of a proof of the existence
of the free energy as claimed by the Free Energy Lemma. The third is the
assumption that a non-negative function whose gradient vanishes at some point
necessarily has a minimum at that point and that its value at this minimum is
zero. However, if the function is constant, which is the case here, its
gradient vanishes everywhere, it has no minimum at any point, and its value can
be arbitrarily large. The interpretation in terms of Bayesian inference hinges
on this point, and we hence conclude that it is unjustified.

<p>Neural computation is associated with the emergence, reconfiguration and
dissolution of cell assemblies in the context of varying oscillatory states.
Here, we describe the complex spatio-temporal dynamics of cell assemblies
through temporal network formalism. We use a sliding window approach to extract
sequences of networks of information sharing among single units in hippocampus
and enthorinal cortex during anesthesia and study how global and node-wise
functional connectivity properties evolve along time. First, we find that
information sharing networks display, at any time, a core-periphery structure
in which an integrated core of more tightly functionally interconnected units
link to more loosely connected network leaves. However the units participating
to the core or to the periphery substantially change across time-windows.
Second, we find that discrete network states can be defined on top of this
continuously ongoing liquid core-periphery reorganization. Switching between
network states results in a more abrupt modification of the units belonging to
the core and is only loosely linked to transitions between global oscillatory
states. Third, we characterize different styles of temporal connectivity that
cells can exhibit within each state of the sharing network. While inhibitory
cells tend to be central, we show that, otherwise, anatomical localization only
poorly influences the patterns of temporal connectivity of the different cells.
Cells can also change temporal connectivity style when the network changes
state. Altogether, these findings reveal that the sharing of information
mediated by the intrinsic dynamics of hippocampal and enthorinal cortex cell
assemblies have a rich spatiotemporal structure, which could not have been
identified by more conventional time- or state-averaged analyses of functional
connectivity.

<p>Multi-pitch perception is investigated in a listening test using 30
recordings of musical sounds with two tones played simultaneously, except for
two gong sounds with inharmonic overtone spectrum, judging roughness and
separateness as the ability to tell the two tones in each recording apart. 13
sounds were from a Western guitar playing all 13 intervals in one octave, the
other sounds were mainly from non-Western instruments comparing familiar with
unfamiliar instrument sounds for Western listeners. Additionally the sounds
were processed in a cochlear model transferring the mechanical basilar membrane
motion into neural spikes followed by a post-processing simulating different
degrees of coincidence detection. Separateness perception showed a clear
distinction between familiar and unfamiliar sounds, while roughness perception
did not. By correlating perception with simulation different perception
strategies were found. Familiar sounds correlated strongly positive with high
degrees of coincidence detection, where only 3-5 periodicities were left, while
unfamiliar sounds correlated with low coincidence levels. This corresponds to
an attention to pitch and timbre respectively. Additionally, separateness
perception shows an opposite correlation between perception and neural
correlates between familiar and unfamiliar sounds. This correlates with the
perceptional finding of the distinction between familiar and unfamiliar sounds
with separateness.

<p>We present a use of modern data-based machine learning approaches to suppress
self-sustained collective oscillations typically signaled by ensembles of
degenerative neurons in the brain. The proposed hybrid model relies on two
major components: an environment of oscillators and a policy-based
reinforcement learning block. We report a model-agnostic synchrony control
based on proximal policy optimization and two artificial neural networks in an
Actor-Critic configuration. A class of physically meaningful reward functions
enabling the suppression of collective oscillatory mode is proposed. The
synchrony suppression is demonstrated for two models of neuronal populations --
for the ensembles of globally coupled limit-cycle Bonhoeffer-van der Pol
oscillators and for the bursting Hindmarsh--Rose neurons.

<p>Neurofeedback-guided motor-imagery training (NF-MIT) has been proposed as a promising intervention following upper limb motor impairment. In this intervention, paretic stroke patients receive online feedback about their brain activity while conducting a motor-imagery (MI) task with the paretic limb. Typically, the feedback provided in NF-MIT protocols is an abstract visual signal based on a fixed trial. Here we developed a self-paced NF-MIT paradigm with an embodiable feedback signal (EFS), which was designed to resemble the content of the mental act as closely as possible. To this end, the feedback was delivered via an embodiable, anthropomorphic robotic hand (RH), which was integrated into a closed-looped EEG-based brain-computer interface (BCI). Whenever the BCI identified a new instance of a hand-flexion or hand-extension imagination by the participant, the RH carried out the corresponding movement with minimum delay. Nine stroke patients and nine healthy participants were instructed to control RH movements as accurately as possible, using mental activity alone. We evaluated the general feasibility of our paradigm on electrophysiological, subjective and performance levels. Regarding electrophysiological measures, individuals showed the predicted event-related desynchronization (ERD) patterns over sensorimotor brain areas. On the subjective level, we found that most individuals integrated the RH into their body scheme. With respect to RH control, none of our participants achieved a high level of control, but most managed to control the RH actions to some degree. Importantly, patients and controls achieved similar performance levels. The results support the view that self-paced embodiable NF-MIT is feasible for stroke patients and can complement classical NF-MIT.</p>

<p>Touching is a fundamental human behavior used to evaluate objects in the external world. Many previous studies have used tactile stimulation to conduct psychological and psychophysiological experiments. However, most of these studies used solid material, not water stream, as an experimental stimulus. To investigate water perception, or to easily control the temperature of an experimental stimulus, it is important to be able to control the water stimulus. In this study, we investigated the usability of water as an experimental stimulus for electroencephalography (EEG) experiments and report the basic EEG response to water stimulus. We developed a tactile stimulation device using a water stream to study EEG responses, with the ability to control the stimulus onset timing. As stimuli, we selected two types of water stream, normal and soft, based on a psychological experiment to confirm a difference of subjective feeling induced by these water streams. We conducted a typical oddball task using the two different water streams and recorded EEG waveforms from 64 electrodes while participants touched the water streams. We calculated P300 at the Pz electrode, alpha asymmetry at the frontal electrodes, and alpha suppression at the parietal area. As a result, we observed typical P300 differentiation based on the stimulus proportion (target 20% and standard 80%). We observed a weaker alpha suppression when participants touched the soft water stream compared to the normal shower. These results demonstrate the usability of water stream in psychophysiological studies and suggested that alpha suppression could be a candidate to evaluate comfort of water stream.</p>

<p>The resting state fMRI time series appears to have cyclic patterns, which indicates presence of cyclic interactions between different brain regions. Such interactions are not easily captured by pre-established resting state functional connectivity methods including zero-lag correlation, lagged correlation, and dynamic time warping distance. These methods formulate the functional interaction between different brain regions as similar temporal patterns within the time series. To use information related to temporal ordering, cyclicity analysis has been introduced to capture pairwise interactions between multiple time series. In this study, we compared the efficacy of cyclicity analysis with aforementioned similarity-based techniques in representing individual-level and group-level information. Additionally, we investigated how filtering and global signal regression interacted with these techniques. We obtained and analyzed fMRI data from patients with tinnitus and neurotypical controls at two different days, a week apart. For both patient and control groups, we found that the features generated by cyclicity and correlation (zero-lag and lagged) analyses were more reliable than the features generated by dynamic time warping distance in identifying individuals across visits. The reliability of all features, except those generated by dynamic time warping, improved as the global signal was regressed. Nevertheless, removing fluctuations &gt;0.1 Hz deteriorated the reliability of all features. These observations underscore the importance of choosing appropriate preprocessing steps while evaluating different analytical methods in describing resting state functional interactivity. Further, using different machine learning techniques including support vector machines, discriminant analyses, and convolutional neural networks, our results revealed that the manifestation of the group-level information within all features was not sufficient enough to dissociate tinnitus patients from controls with high sensitivity and specificity. This necessitates further investigation regarding the representation of group-level information within different features to better identify tinnitus-related alternation in the functional organization of the brain. Our study adds to the growing body of research on developing diagnostic tools to identify neurological disorders, such as tinnitus, using resting state fMRI data.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/53944">Loss of centromere function drives karyotype evolution in closely related <i>Malassezia</i> species</a></h4>

Genomic rearrangements associated with speciation often result in chromosome number variation among closely related species. <i>Malassezia</i> species show variable karyotypes ranging between 6 and 9 chromosomes. Here, we experimentally identified all 8 centromeres in <i>M. sympodialis</i> as 3 to 5 kb long kinetochore-bound regions spanning an AT-rich core and depleted of the canonical histone H3. Centromeres of similar sequence features were identified as CENP-A-rich regions in <i>Malassezia furfur</i> with 7 chromosomes, and histone H3 depleted regions in <i>Malassezia slooffiae</i> and <i>Malassezia globosa</i> with 9 chromosomes each. Analysis of synteny conservation across centromeres with newly generated chromosome-level genome assemblies suggests two distinct mechanisms of chromosome number reduction from an inferred 9-chromosome ancestral state: (a) chromosome breakage followed by loss of centromere DNA and (b) centromere inactivation accompanied by changes in DNA sequence following chromosome-chromosome fusion. We propose AT-rich centromeres drive karyotype diversity in the <i>Malassezia</i> species complex through breakage and inactivation.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/53473">Mechanisms of substrate recognition by a typhoid toxin secretion-associated muramidase</a></h4>

Typhoid toxin is a virulence factor for the bacterial pathogen <i>Salmonella</i> Typhi, which causes typhoid fever in humans. After its synthesis by intracellular bacteria, typhoid toxin is secreted into the lumen of the <i>Salmonella</i>-containing vacuole by a secretion mechanism strictly dependent on TtsA, a specific muramidase that facilitates toxin transport through the peptidoglycan layer. Here we show that substrate recognition by TtsA depends on a discrete domain within its carboxy terminus, which targets the enzyme to the bacterial poles to recognize YcbB-edited peptidoglycan. Comparison of the atomic structures of TtsA bound to its substrate and that of a close homolog with different specificity identified specific determinants involved in substrate recognition. Combined with structure-guided mutagenesis and <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> crosslinking experiments, this study provides an unprecedented view of the mechanisms by which a muramidase recognizes its peptidoglycan substrate to facilitate protein secretion.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/52651">Altered corticolimbic connectivity reveals sex-specific adolescent outcomes in a rat model of early life adversity</a></h4>

Exposure to early-life adversity (ELA) increases the risk for psychopathologies associated with amygdala-prefrontal cortex (PFC) circuits. While sex differences in vulnerability have been identified with a clear need for individualized intervention strategies, the neurobiological substrates of ELA-attributable differences remain unknown due to a paucity of translational investigations taking both development and sex into account. Male and female rats exposed to maternal separation ELA were analyzed with anterograde tracing from basolateral amygdala (BLA) to PFC to identify sex-specific innervation trajectories through juvenility (PD28) and adolescence (PD38;PD48). Resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) was assessed longitudinally (PD28;PD48) in a separate cohort. All measures were related to anxiety-like behavior. ELA-exposed rats showed precocial maturation of BLA-PFC innervation, with females affected earlier than males. ELA also disrupted maturation of female rsFC, with enduring relationships between rsFC and anxiety-like behavior. This study is the first providing both anatomical and functional evidence for sex- and experience-dependent corticolimbic development.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/51131">The kinesin-5 tail domain directly modulates the mechanochemical cycle of the motor domain for anti-parallel microtubule sliding</a></h4>

Kinesin-5 motors organize mitotic spindles by sliding apart microtubules. They are homotetramers with dimeric motor and tail domains at both ends of a bipolar minifilament. Here, we describe a regulatory mechanism involving direct binding between tail and motor domains and its fundamental role in microtubule sliding. Kinesin-5 tails decrease microtubule-stimulated ATP-hydrolysis by specifically engaging motor domains in the nucleotide-free or ADP states. Cryo-EM reveals that tail binding stabilizes an open motor domain ATP-active site. Full-length motors undergo slow motility and cluster together along microtubules, while tail-deleted motors exhibit rapid motility without clustering. The tail is critical for motors to zipper together two microtubules by generating substantial sliding forces. The tail is essential for mitotic spindle localization, which becomes severely reduced in tail-deleted motors. Our studies suggest a revised microtubule-sliding model, in which kinesin-5 tails stabilize motor domains microtubule-bound states by slowing ATP-binding resulting in high-force production at both homotetramer ends.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50770">YAP1 and TAZ negatively control bone angiogenesis by limiting hypoxia-inducible factor signaling in endothelial cells</a></h4>

Blood vessels are integrated into different organ environments with distinct properties and physiology (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml#bib2">Augustin and Koh, 2017</a>). A striking example of organ-specific specialization is the bone vasculature where certain molecular signals yield the opposite effect as in other tissues (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml#bib10">Glomski et al., 2011</a>; <a href="https://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml#bib18">Kusumbe et al., 2014</a>; <a href="https://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml#bib34">Ramasamy et al., 2014</a>). Here, we show that the transcriptional coregulators Yap1 and Taz, components of the Hippo pathway, suppress vascular growth in the hypoxic microenvironment of bone, in contrast to their pro-angiogenic role in other organs. Likewise, the kinase Lats2, which limits Yap1/Taz activity, is essential for bone angiogenesis but dispensable in organs with lower levels of hypoxia. With mouse genetics, RNA sequencing, biochemistry, and cell culture experiments, we show that Yap1/Taz constrain hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1α) target gene expression in vivo and in vitro. We propose that crosstalk between Yap1/Taz and HIF1α controls angiogenesis depending on the level of tissue hypoxia, resulting in organ-specific biological responses.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/47654">Membrane interactions of the globular domain and the hypervariable region of KRAS4b define its unique diffusion behavior</a></h4>

The RAS proteins are GTP-dependent switches that regulate signaling pathways and are frequently mutated in cancer. RAS proteins concentrate in the plasma membrane via lipid-tethers and hypervariable side-chain interactions in distinct nano-domains. However, little is known about RAS membrane dynamics and the details of RAS activation of downstream signaling. Here we characterize RAS in live human and mouse cells using single molecule tracking methods and estimate RAS mobility parameters. KRAS4b exhibits confined mobility with three diffusive states distinct from the other RAS isoforms (KRAS4a, NRAS, and HRAS); and although most of the amino acid differences between RAS isoforms lie within the hypervariable region, the additional confinement of KRAS4b is largely determined by the protein's globular domain. To understand the altered mobility of an oncogenic KRAS4b we used complementary experimental and molecular dynamic simulation approaches to reveal a detailed mechanism.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/47293"><i>tec-1</i> kinase negatively regulates regenerative neurogenesis in planarians</a></h4>

Negative regulators of adult neurogenesis are of particular interest as targets to enhance neuronal repair, but few have yet been identified. Planarians can regenerate their entire CNS using pluripotent adult stem cells, and this process is robustly regulated to ensure that new neurons are produced in proper abundance. Using a high-throughput pipeline to quantify brain chemosensory neurons, we identify the conserved tyrosine kinase <i>tec-1</i> as a negative regulator of planarian neuronal regeneration. <i>tec-1</i>RNAi increased the abundance of several CNS and PNS neuron subtypes regenerated or maintained through homeostasis, without affecting body patterning or non-neural cells. Experiments using TUNEL, BrdU, progenitor labeling, and stem cell elimination during regeneration indicate <i>tec-1</i> limits the survival of newly differentiated neurons. In vertebrates, the Tec kinase family has been studied extensively for roles in immune function, and our results identify a novel role for <i>tec-1</i> as negative regulator of planarian adult neurogenesis.

Age-related changes in sleep patterns have been linked to cognitive decline. Specifically, age is associated with increased fragmentation of sleep and wake cycles. Yet it remains unknown if improvements in sleep architecture can ameliorate cellular and cognitive deficits. We evaluated how changes in sleep architecture following sleep restriction affected hippocampal representations and memory in young and old mice. Following training in a hippocampus dependent object/place recognition task, control animals were allowed to sleep normally, while experimental animals underwent 5 hr of sleep restriction (SR). Interestingly, old SR mice exhibited proper object/place memory, similarly to young control mice, whereas young SR and old control mice did not. Successful memory correlated with the presence of two hippocampal cell types: 1) 'Context' cells, which remained stable throughout training and testing, and 2) 'Object' cells, which shifted their preferred firing location when objects were introduced to the context and moved during testing. As expected, EEG analysis revealed more fragmented sleep and fewer initial spindles in old controls than young controls during the post-training sleep period. However, following the acute SR session old animals displayed more consolidate NREM and increased spindle count, while young mice did not significantly display changes in sleep architecture. These results indicate that consolidation of NREM sleep and increases in spindle numbers serve to ameliorate age-related memory deficits and allow hippocampal representations to adapt to changing environments.

The Developing Human Connectome Project (dHCP) is an Open Science project which provides the first large sample of neonatal functional MRI (fMRI) data with high temporal and spatial resolution. This data enables mapping of intrinsic functional connectivity between spatially distributed brain regions under normal and adverse perinatal circumstances, offering a framework to study the ontogeny of large-scale brain organisation in humans. Here, we characterise in unprecedented detail the maturation and integrity of resting-state networks (RSNs) at normal term age in 337 infants (including 65 born preterm). First, we applied group independent component analysis (ICA) to define 11 RSNs in term-born infants scanned at 43.5-44.5 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA). Adult-like topography was observed in RSNs encompassing primary sensorimotor, visual and auditory cortices. Among six higher-order, association RSNs, analogues of the adult networks for language and ocular control were identified, but a complete default mode network precursor was not. Next, we regressed the subject-level datasets from an independent cohort of infants scanned at 37-43.5 weeks PMA against the group-level RSNs to test for the effects of age, sex and preterm birth. Brain mapping in term-born infants revealed areas of positive association with age across four of six association RSNs, indicating active maturation in functional connectivity from 37 to 43.5 weeks PMA. Female infants showed increased connectivity in inferotemporal regions of the visual association network. Preterm birth was associated with striking impairments of functional connectivity across all RSNs in a dose-dependent manner; conversely, connectivity of the superior parietal lobules within the lateral motor network was abnormally increased in preterm infants, suggesting a possible mechanism for specific difficulties such as developmental coordination disorder which occur frequently in preterm children. Overall, we find a robust, modular, symmetrical functional brain organisation at normal term age. A complete set of adult-equivalent primary RSNs is already instated, alongside emerging connectivity in immature association RSNs, consistent with a primary-to-higher-order ontogenetic sequence of brain development. The early developmental disruption imposed by preterm birth is associated with extensive alterations in functional connectivity.

Acetylcholine release in the hippocampus plays a central role in the formation of new memory representations by facilitating synaptic plasticity. It is also proposed that memory formation requires acetylcholine to enhance responses in CA1 to new sensory information from entorhinal cortex whilst depressing inputs from previously encoded representations in CA3, but this influential theory has not been directly tested. Here, we show that excitatory inputs from entorhinal cortex and CA3 are depressed equally by synaptic release of acetylcholine in CA1. However, greater depression of feedforward inhibition from entorhinal cortex results in an overall enhancement of excitatory-inhibitory balance and CA1 activation. Underpinning the prioritisation of entorhinal inputs, entorhinal and CA3 pathways engage distinct feedforward interneuron subpopulations and depression is mediated differentially by presynaptic muscarinic M3 and M4 receptors respectively. These mechanisms enable acetylcholine to prioritise novel information inputs to CA1 during memory formation and suggest selective muscarinic targets for therapeutic intervention.

In the field of songbird neuroscience, researchers have used playback of aversive noise bursts to drive changes in song behavior for specific syllables within a bird's song. Typically, a short (~5-10 msec) slice of the syllable is selected for targeting and the average spectrum of the slice is used as a template. Sounds that are sufficiently close to the template are considered a match. If other syllables have portions that are spectrally similar to the target, false positive errors will weaken the operant contingency. We present a gradient descent method for template optimization that increases the separation in distance between target and distractors slices, greatly improving targeting accuracy. Applied to songs from five adult Bengalese finches, the fractional reduction in errors for sub-syllabic slices was 51.54{+/-}22.92%. At the level of song syllables, we use an error metric that controls for the vastly greater number of distractors vs. target syllables. Setting 5% average error (misses + false positives) as a minimal performance criterion, the number of targetable syllables increased from 3 to 16 out of 61 syllables. At 10% error, targetable syllables increased from 11 to 26. By using simple and robust linear discriminant methods, the algorithm reaches near asymptotic performance when using 10 songs as training data, and the error increases by &lt;2.3% on average when using only a single song for training. Targeting is temporally precise, with average jitter of 3.33 msec for the 16 accurately targeted syllables. Because the algorithm is concerned only with the problem of template selection, it can be used as a simple and robust front end for existing hardware and software implementations for triggered feedback.

Secondary brain injury following subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is the critical contributor to the mortality of SAH patients. The underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. In this study, we utilized a mice model of SAH to investigate whether FoxO4 is related to the brain injury after SAH and identified its upstream regulator Akt. Experimental SAH was induced in adult male mice by prechiasmatic cistern injection. Brain FoxO4 protein levels in cytoplasm and nucleaus were examined in the sham-operated controls, and in mice 1h, 6h, 12h, 24h, 3d, and 5d after SAH induction. The Akt inhibitor LY294002 was administered by intracerebroventricular infusion to determine its effects on FoxO4. Moreover, the expression of FoxO4 was also investigated in neurons incubated with hemoglobin in vitro , which was also dertermined after inhibition of Akt. FoxO4 protein expression in the nuclei increased remarkably after SAH. The Akt inhibitor LY294002 induced more FoxO4 nuclear localization after SAH in vivo and in vitro . Our results suggest the activation of FoxO4 after SAH and which was inhibited by the increased phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt).

Mesenchymal stem cells are one of the promising tissue specific stem cell source for neural tissue regeneration applications. Previous studies on human mesenchymal stem cell (hMSC) derived neurons have been limited and not statisfactory in terms of neuronal activity. In this study, we analysed the functionality of bone marrow hMSCs differentiated into neural protein expressing cells by a single step cytokine based induction protocol. Neurons from both primary hMSCs and hMSC cell line displayed spontaneous activity ([≥]75%) as demonstrated by Ca ++  imaging. Furthermore, when electrically stimulated, hMSC induced neurons (hMd-Neuron) matched the response of a typical neuron in the process of maturation. Our results reveal that enriched neurothrophic factors enhance differentiation capacity of bone marrow hMSCs into high yielding functional neurons with spontaneous activity and mature into electrophysiologically active state. hMd-Neurons have the potential to be used as a tool for disease modelling of neuropathologies and neural differentiation studies.

Alpha blocking, a phenomenon where the alpha rhythm is reduced by attention to a visual, auditory, tactile or cognitive stimulus, is one of the most prominent features of human electroencephalography (EEG) signals. Here we identify a simple physiological mechanism by which opening of the eyes causes attenuation of the alpha rhythm. We fit a neural population model to EEG spectra from 82 subjects, each showing different degrees of alpha blocking upon opening of their eyes. Although it is notoriously difficult to estimate parameters from fitting such models, we show that, by regularizing the differences in parameter estimates between eyes-closed and eyes-open states, we can reduce the uncertainties in these differences without significantly compromising fit quality. From this emerges a parsimonious explanation for the spectral changes between states: Just a single parameter, pei, corresponding to the strength of a tonic, excitatory input to the inhibitory population, is sufficient to explain the reduction in alpha rhythm upon opening of the eyes. When comparing parameter estimates across different subjects we find that the inferred differential change in pei for each subject increases monotonically with the degree of alpha blocking observed. In contrast, other parameters show weak or negligible differential changes that do not scale with the degree of alpha attenuation in each subject. Thus most of the variation in alpha blocking across subjects can be attributed to the strength of a tonic afferent signal to the inhibitory cortical population.

p.p1 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica; color: #000000} Most neuronal models are based on the assumption that ion concentrations remain constant during the simulated period, and do not account for possible effects of concentration variations on ionic reversal potentials, or of ionic diffusion on electrical potentials. Here, we present what is, to our knowledge, the first multicompartmental neuron model that accounts for electrodiffusive ion concentration dynamics in a way that ensures a biophysically consistent relationship between ion concentrations, electrical charge, and electrical potentials in both the intra- and extracellular space. The model, which we refer to as the electrodiffusive Pinsky-Rinzel (edPR) model, is an expanded version of the two-compartment Pinsky-Rinzel (PR) model of a hippocampal CA3 neuron, where we have included homeostatic mechanisms and ion-specific leakage currents. Whereas the main dynamical variable in the original PR model is the transmembrane potential, the edPR model in addition keeps track of all ion concentrations (Na+, K+, Ca2+, and Cl-), electrical potentials, and the electrical conductivities in the intra- as well as extracellular space. The edPR model reproduces the membrane potential dynamics of the PR model for moderate firing activity, when the homeostatic mechanisms succeed in maintaining ion concentrations close to baseline. For higher activity levels, homeostasis becomes incomplete, and the edPR model diverges from the PR model, as it accounts for changes in neuronal firing properties due to deviations from baseline ion concentrations. Whereas the focus of this work is to present and analyze the edPR model, we envision that it will become useful for the field in two main ways. Firstly, as it relaxes a set of commonly made modeling assumptions, the edPR model can be used to test the validity of these assumptions under various firing conditions, as we show here for a few selected cases. Secondly, the edPR model is a supplement to the PR model and should replace it in simulations of scenarios in which ion concentrations vary over time. As it is applicable to conditions with failed homeostasis, the edPR model opens up for simulating a range of pathological conditions, such as spreading depression or epilepsy.

Humans are extremely efficient in rapidly and flexibly converting complex symbolic instructions into novel behaviors. Previous evidence and theoretical models suggest that the implementation of a novel instruction requires the reformatting of its declarative content into an action-oriented code optimized for the execution of the instructed behavior. While neuroimaging research focused on identifying the brain areas involved in such process, its temporal profile and electrophysiological characteristics remain unknown. In the present study, we recorded EEG while we asked participants to either simply maintain declaratively the content of novel S-R mappings for recognition or to proactively prepare for their implementation. By means of time-frequency analyses, we isolated the oscillatory features specifically associated with the proceduralization of the encoded instruction. Before the onset of the implementation target, we observed stronger delta/low-theta activity over frontal electrodes and a significant suppression in mu and beta activity over central electrodes. On the contrary, activity in the alpha band showed no differences between the two tasks. Together, these results support the crucial role attributed to prefrontal regions in orchestrating complex task setting and further extend on it by characterizing the temporal and frequency profile of this process. Moreover, we highlight the critical involvement of motor activity in the proactive preparation for novel instruction implementation.

While segregation and integration of neural information in the neocortex are thought to be important for human behavior and cognition, the neural substrates enabling their dynamic fluctuations remain elusive. To tackle this problem, we aim to identify specific network features of the connectome (the complete set of structural brain connections) that are responsible for the emergence of dynamic fluctuations between segregated and integrated patterns in human resting-state fMRI functional connectivity. The contributions of network features to the dynamic fluctuations were examined by constructing randomly rewired surrogate connectome data in which network features of interest were selectively preserved, and then by assessing the magnitude of fluctuations simulated with these surrogates. Our analysis demonstrates significant contributions from spatial geometry and network topology of the connectome, as well as from localized structural connections involving visual areas. By providing a structural account of dynamic fluctuations in functional connectivity, this study offers new insights into generative mechanisms driving temporal changes in segregation and integration in the brain.

Ceftriaxone is an antibiotic that reliably attenuates the reinstatement of cocaine-seeking after extinction while preventing the nucleus accumbens (NA) core glutamate efflux that drives reinstatement. However, when rats undergo abstinence without extinction, ceftriaxone attenuates context-primed relapse but NA core glutamate efflux still increases. Here we sought to determine if the same would occur when relapse is prompted by both context and discrete cues (context+cues) after cocaine abstinence. Male rats self-administered intravenous cocaine for 2 hr/day for 2 weeks. Cocaine delivery was accompanied by drug-associated cues (light+tone). Rats were then placed into abstinence with daily handling but no extinction training for two weeks. Ceftriaxone (200 mg/kg IP) or vehicle was administered during the last 6 days of abstinence. During a context+cue relapse test, microdialysis procedures were conducted. Rats were perfused at the end of the test for later Fos analysis. A separate cohort of rats was infused with the retrograde tracer cholera toxin B in the NA core and underwent the same self-administration and relapse procedures. Ceftriaxone increased baseline glutamate and attenuated both context+cue-primed relapse and NA core glutamate efflux during this test. Ceftriaxone reduced Fos expression in regions sending projections to the NA core (prefrontal cortex, basolateral amygdala, ventral tegmental area) and specifically reduced Fos in prelimbic cortex and not infralimbic cortex neurons projecting to the NA core. Thus, when relapse is primed by drug-associated cues and context, ceftriaxone is able to attenuate relapse by preventing NA core glutamate efflux, likely through reducing activity in prelimbic NA core-projecting neurons.

Synaptogenesis is essential in forming new neurocircuits during development, and this is mediated in part by astrocyte-released thrombospondins (TSPs) and activation of their neuronal receptor, 2{delta}-1. Here, we show that this developmental synaptogenic mechanism is utilized during cocaine experience to induce spinogenesis and the generation of AMPA receptor-silent glutamatergic synapses in the adult nucleus accumbens (NAc). Specifically, cocaine administration activates NAc astrocytes, and preventing this activation blocks cocaine-induced generation of silent synapses. Furthermore, knockout of TSP2, or pharmacological inhibition or viral-mediated knockdown of 2{delta}-1, prevents cocaine-induced generation of silent synapses. Moreover, disrupting TSP2-2{delta}-1-mediated spinogenesis and silent synapse generation in the NAc occludes cue-induced cocaine seeking after withdrawal from cocaine self-administration and cue-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking after drug extinction. These results establish that silent synapses are generated by an astrocyte-mediated synaptogenic mechanism in response to cocaine experience and embed critical cue-associated memory traces that promote cocaine relapse.

Reinforcement learning enables the brain to learn optimal action selection, such as go or not go, by forming state-action and action-outcome associations. Does this mechanism also optimize the brain's willingness to learn, such as learn or not learn? Learning to learn by rewards, i.e., reinforcement meta-learning, is a crucial mechanism for machines to develop flexibility in learning, which is also considered in the brain without empirical examinations. Here, we show that humans learn to learn or not learn to maximize rewards in visuomotor learning tasks. We also show that this regulation of learning is not a motivational bias but is a result of an instrumental, active process, which takes into account the learning-outcome structure. Our results thus demonstrate the existence of reinforcement meta-learning in the human brain. Because motor learning is a process of minimizing sensory errors, our findings uncover an essential mechanism of interaction between reward and error.

Nervous systems contain sensory neurons, local neurons, projection neurons and motor neurons. To understand how these building blocks form whole circuits, we must distil these broad classes into neuronal cell types and describe their network connectivity. Using an electron micrograph dataset for an entire Drosophila melanogaster brain, we reconstruct the first complete inventory of olfactory projections connecting the antennal lobe, the insect analogue of the mammalian olfactory bulb, to higher-order brain regions in an adult animal brain. We then connect this inventory to extant data in the literature, providing synaptic-resolution holotypes both for heavily investigated and previously unknown cell types. Projection neurons are approximately twice as numerous as reported by light level studies; cell types are stereotyped, but not identical, in cell and synapse numbers between brain hemispheres. The lateral horn, the insect analogue of the mammalian cortical amygdala, is the main target for this olfactory information and has been shown to guide innate behaviour. Here, we find new connectivity motifs, including: axo-axonic connectivity between projection neurons; feedback and lateral inhibition of these axons by local neurons; and the convergence of different inputs, including non-olfactory inputs and memory-related feedback onto lateral horn neurons. This differs from the configuration of the second most prominent target for olfactory projection neurons: the mushroom body calyx, the insect analogue of the mammalian piriform cortex and a centre for associative memory. Our work provides a complete neuroanatomical platform for future studies of the adult Drosophila olfactory system.

We propose a new model of the saltatory conduction in myelinated axons. This conduction of the action potential in myelinated axons does not agree with the conventional cable theory, though the latter has satisfactorily explained the electrosignaling in dendrites and in unmyelinated axons. By the development of the wave-type concept of ionic plasmon-polariton kinetics in axon cytosol we have achieved an agreement of the model with observed properties of the saltatory conduction. Some resulting consequences of the different electricity model in the white and the gray matter for nervous system organization have been also outlined.

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To determine the clinical and molecular features in patients with ALS4 and mutations in the senataxin (<i>SETX</i>) gene, and to develop tools for evaluating <i>SETX</i> variants.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Our study involved 32 patients, including 31 with mutation in <i>SETX</i> at c.1166 T&gt;C (p.Leu389Ser) and one with mutation at c.1153 G&gt;A (p.Glu385Lys). Clinical characterization of the patients included neurological examination, blood tests, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and dual‐energy X‐ray absorptiometry (DEXA). Fibroblasts and motor neurons were obtained to model the disease and characterize the molecular alteration in senataxin function.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We report key clinical features of ALS4. Laboratory analysis showed alteration of serum creatine kinase and creatinine in the Leu389Ser ALS4 cohort. MRI showed increased muscle fat fraction in the lower extremities which correlates with disease duration (thigh fat fraction R<sup>2</sup> = 0.35, p = 0.01, lower leg fat fraction R<sup>2</sup> = 0.49, p &lt; 0.01). DEXA measurements showed lower extremities are more affected than the upper extremities (average fat Z‐scores of 2.1 and 0.6, respectively). A cellular assay for SETX function confirmed that like the Leu389Ser mutation, the Glu385Lys variant leads to a gain of senataxin function and thus a decrease in R‐loops.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We identified clinical laboratory and radiological features of ALS4, and hence they should be monitored for disease progression. The molecular characterization of R‐loop levels in patient‐derived cells provides insight into the disease pathology and assays to evaluate the pathogenicity of candidate mutations in the <i>SETX</i> gene.</p>

The Fem family of genes influences sex determination and/or the development of sex-specific characteristics in a wide variety of organisms. Here, we describe the first mutational analysis of the Fem-1 gene of Drosophila melanogaster. The amino acid sequence of the two Drosophila Fem-1 transcripts are moderately conserved compared to that of both Fem-1 in C. elegans and the two Fem-1 transcripts in humans, with multiple ankyrin repeats. Using two transposon-induced mutations of Drosophila Fem-1, we observed striking defects in adult courtship behavior that are attributed to defects in male courting as opposed to female receptivity. Specifically, viable Fem-1 mutant males courted Fem-1 females more vigorously with an increased amount of chasing and singing than pairs of control flies. Nevertheless, Fem-1 males did not copulate at a higher frequency than controls. The above courtship defects persisted when Fem-1 males courted control females, but no phenotypes were observed when control males courted Fem-1 females. Our results indicate that Drosophila Fem-1 may interact with other genes involved in courtship and sex determination. Additional analyses of these Fem-1 alleles will help address the nature of these mutations, deepen our molecular understanding of courtship, and contribute to the evolutionary relationships among this highly conserved gene family.

Tauopathies are prevalent, invariably fatal brain diseases for which no cure is available. Tauopathies progressively affect the brain through cell-to-cell transfer of tau protein amyloids, yet the spreading mechanisms are unknown. Here we show that the cellular prion protein (PrPC) facilitates the uptake of tau aggregates by cultured cells, possibly by acting as an endocytic receptor. In mouse neuroblastoma cells, we found that tau amyloids bind to PrPC; internalization of tau fibrils was reduced in isogenic cells devoid of the gene encoding PrPC. Antibodies against N-proximal epitopes of PrPC impaired the binding of tau amyloids and decreased their uptake. Surprisingly, exposure of chronically prion-infected cells to tau amyloids reduced the accumulation of aggregated prion protein; this effect lasted for more than 72 hours after amyloid removal. These results point to bidirectional interactions between the two proteins: whilst PrPC mediates the entrance of tau fibrils in cells, PrPSc buildup is greatly reduced in their presence, possibly because of an impairment in the prion conversion process.

Orchestrating the ensemble of muscle contractions necessary for coordinated movements requires the interaction of cerebellar, thalamic and cerebral structures, but the mechanisms underlying the integration of information remain largely unknown. Here we investigated how excitatory inputs from cerebellar nuclei (CN) and primary motor cortex layer VI (M1 L6) neurons may regulate together the activity of neurons in the mouse ventrolateral (VL) thalamus. Using dual-optogenetic stimulation and whole-cell recordings in vitro we were able to specifically activate the CN and M1 pathways and study their differential impact. We found that VL spiking probability is effectively determined by a pause in CN stimuli, whereas VL membrane potential can be modulated subthreshold by M1 L6 input. Upon mild depolarization of the VL membrane potential, repetitive CN stimulation evokes at best single action potential firing, whereas more negative membrane potentials increase VL spiking probability. Moreover, whereas high-frequency cerebellar activity attenuates thalamic spiking, pauses in cerebellar activity re-activate thalamic spiking. In contrast, facilitating inputs from cerebral cortex modulate thalamo-cortical spike transfer via fluctuations in the membrane potential. The fine-tuning by cerebellar and cerebral activity allows the motor thalamus to operate as a low-pass filter for cerebellar activity, generating sparse but precisely timed outputs for the cerebral cortex.

Different brain regions can be grouped together, based on cross-sectional correlations among their cortical characteristics; this patterning has been used to make inferences about ageing processes. However, cross-sectional brain data conflates information on ageing with patterns that are present throughout life. We characterised brain cortical ageing across the 8th decade of life in a longitudinal ageing cohort, at ages [~]73, [~]76, and [~]79 years, with a total of 1,376 MRI scans. Volumetric changes among cortical regions of interest (ROIs) were more strongly correlated (average r = 0.805, SD = 0.252) than were cross-sectional volumes of the same ROIs (average r = 0.350, SD = 0.178). We identified a broad, cortex-wide, dimension of atrophy that explained 66% of the variance in longitudinal changes across the cortex. Our modelling also discovered more specific fronto-temporal and occipito-parietal dimensions, that were orthogonal to the general factor and together explained an additional 20% of the variance. The general factor was associated with declines in general cognitive ability (r = 0.430, p &lt; 0.001) and in the domains of processing speed (r = 0.383, p &lt; 0.001) and memory (r = 0.372, p &lt; 0.001), but not with visuospatial ability (r = 0.143, p = 0.151). Individual differences in brain cortical atrophy with ageing are manifest across three broad dimensions of the cerebral cortex, the most general of which is linked with declines in both processing speed and memory. Longitudinal approaches will prove invaluable for distinguishing lifelong patterns of brain-behaviour associations from patterns that are specific to aging.

The spatial structure of an evolving population affects the balance of natural selection versus genetic drift. Some structures amplify selection, increasing the role that fitness differences play in determining which mutations become fixed. Other structures suppress selection, reducing the effect of fitness differences and increasing the role of random chance. This phenomenon can be modeled by representing spatial structure as a graph, with individuals occupying vertices. Births and deaths occur stochastically, according to a specified update rule. We study <i>death-Birth</i> updating: An individual is chosen to die and then its neighbors compete to reproduce into the vacant spot. Previous numerical experiments suggested that amplifiers of selection for this process are either rare or nonexistent. We introduce a perturbative method for this problem for weak selection regime, meaning that mutations have small fitness effects. We show that fixation probability under weak selection can be calculated in terms of the coalescence times of random walks. This result leads naturally to a new definition of effective population size. Using this and other methods, we uncover the first known examples of transient amplifiers of selection (graphs that amplify selection for a particular range of fitness values) for the death-Birth process. We also exhibit new families of “reducers of fixation”, which decrease the fixation probability of all mutations, whether beneficial or deleterious.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/VIgN6AScWdM" width="1" />

<p>by Josef Tkadlec, Andreas Pavlogiannis, Krishnendu Chatterjee, Martin A. Nowak</p>

The fixation probability of a single mutant invading a population of residents is among the most widely-studied quantities in evolutionary dynamics. Amplifiers of natural selection are population structures that increase the fixation probability of advantageous mutants, compared to well-mixed populations. Extensive studies have shown that many amplifiers exist for the Birth-death Moran process, some of them substantially increasing the fixation probability or even guaranteeing fixation in the limit of large population size. On the other hand, no amplifiers are known for the death-Birth Moran process, and computer-assisted exhaustive searches have failed to discover amplification. In this work we resolve this disparity, by showing that any amplification under death-Birth updating is necessarily <i>bounded</i> and <i>transient</i>. Our boundedness result states that even if a population structure does amplify selection, the resulting fixation probability is close to that of the well-mixed population. Our transience result states that for any population structure there exists a threshold <i>r</i><sup>⋆</sup> such that the population structure ceases to amplify selection if the mutant fitness advantage <i>r</i> is larger than <i>r</i><sup>⋆</sup>. Finally, we also extend the above results to <i>δ</i>-death-Birth updating, which is a combination of Birth-death and death-Birth updating. On the positive side, we identify population structures that maintain amplification for a wide range of values <i>r</i> and <i>δ</i>. These results demonstrate that amplification of natural selection depends on the specific mechanisms of the evolutionary process.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/c0_gkrtm8d4" width="1" />

<p>by Melanie Gerken, Sergej Kakorin, Kamel Chibani, Karl-Josef Dietz</p>

Cells contain a thiol redox regulatory network to coordinate metabolic and developmental activities with exogenous and endogenous cues. This network controls the redox state and activity of many target proteins. Electrons are fed into the network from metabolism and reach the target proteins via redox transmitters such as thioredoxin (TRX) and NADPH-dependent thioredoxin reductases (NTR). Electrons are drained from the network by reactive oxygen species (ROS) through thiol peroxidases, e.g., peroxiredoxins (PRX). Mathematical modeling promises access to quantitative understanding of the network function and was implemented by using published kinetic parameters combined with fitting to known biochemical data. Two networks were assembled, namely the ferredoxin (FD), FD-dependent TRX reductase (FTR), TRX, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase) pathway with 2-cysteine PRX/ROS as oxidant, and separately the FD, FD-dependent NADP reductase (FNR), NADPH, NTRC-pathway for 2-CysPRX reduction. Combining both modules allowed drawing several important conclusions of network performance. The resting H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> concentration was estimated to be about 30 nM in the chloroplast stroma. The electron flow to metabolism exceeds that into thiol regulation of FBPase more than 7000-fold under physiological conditions. The electron flow from NTRC to 2-CysPRX is about 5.32-times more efficient than that from TRX-f1 to 2-CysPRX. Under severe stress (30 μM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) the ratio of electron flow to the thiol network relative to metabolism sinks to 1:251 whereas the ratio of e<sup>-</sup> flow from NTRC to 2-CysPRX and TRX-f1 to 2-CysPRX rises up to 1:67. Thus, the simulation provides clues on experimentally inaccessible parameters and describes the functional state of the chloroplast thiol regulatory network.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/je4rA2iFbGs" width="1" />

Pathogen timetrees are phylogenies scaled to time. They reveal the temporal history of a pathogen spread through the populations as captured in the evolutionary history of strains. These timetrees are inferred by using molecular sequences of pathogenic strains sampled at different times. That is, temporally sampled sequences enable the inference of sequence divergence times. Here, we present a new approach (RelTime with Dated Tips [RTDT]) to estimating pathogen timetrees based on a relative rate framework underlying the RelTime approach that is algebraic in nature and distinct from all other current methods. RTDT does not require many of the priors demanded by Bayesian approaches, and it has light computing requirements. In analyses of an extensive collection of computer-simulated datasets, we found the accuracy of RTDT time estimates and the coverage probabilities of their confidence intervals (CIs) to be excellent. In analyses of empirical datasets, RTDT produced dates that were similar to those reported in the literature. In comparative benchmarking with Bayesian and non-Bayesian methods (LSD, TreeTime, and treedater), we found that no method performed the best in every scenario. So, we provide a brief guideline for users to select the most appropriate method in empirical data analysis. RTDT is implemented for use via a graphical user interface and in high-throughput settings in the newest release of cross-platform MEGA X software, freely available from http://www.megasoftware.net.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/pQiuHUzZKK0" width="1" />

Abstract
<p>The neurohypophysis (NH), located at the posterior lobe of the pituitary, is a major neuroendocrine tissue, which mediates osmotic balance, blood pressure, reproduction, and lactation by means of releasing the neurohormones oxytocin (OXT) and arginine-vasopressin (AVP) from the brain into the peripheral blood circulation. The major cellular components of the NH are hypothalamic axonal termini, fenestrated endothelia and pituicytes, the resident astroglia. However, despite the physiological importance of the NH, the exact molecular signature defining neurohypophyseal cell types and in particular the pituicytes, remains unclear. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq), we captured seven distinct cell types in the NH and intermediate lobe (IL) of adult male mouse. We revealed novel pituicyte markers showing higher specificity than previously reported. Bioinformatics analysis demonstrated that pituicyte is an astrocytic cell type whose transcriptome resembles that of tanycyte. Single molecule <i>in situ</i> hybridization revealed spatial organization of the major cell types implying intercellular communications. We present a comprehensive molecular and cellular characterization of neurohypophyseal cell types serving as a valuable resource for further functional research.</p>

Abstract
<p>Two-photon fluorescence microscopy has been used extensively to probe the structure and functions of cells in living biological tissue. Two-photon excitation generates fluorescence from the focal plane, but also from outside the focal plane, with out-of-focus fluorescence increasing as the focus is pushed deeper into tissue. It has been postulated that the two-photon depth limit, beyond which results become inaccurate, is where in-focus and out-of-focus fluorescence are equal, which we term the balance depth. Calculations suggest that the balance depth should be at ~600 µm in mouse cortex. Neither the two-photon depth limit nor the balance depth have been measured in brain tissue. We found the depth limit and balance depth of two-photon excitation in mice with GCaMP6 indicator expression in all layers of visual cortex, by comparing near-simultaneous two-photon and three-photon excitation. Two-photon and three-photon results from superficial locations were almost identical. two-photon results were inaccurate beyond the balance depth, consistent with the depth limit matching the balance depth for two-photon excitation. However, the two-photon depth limit and balance depth were at 450 µm, shallower than predicted by calculations. Our results were from tissue with a largely homogenous distribution of fluorophores. The expected balance depth is deeper in tissue with fewer fluorophores outside the focal plane and our results therefore establish a superficial bound on the two-photon depth limit in mouse visual cortex.</p>

Abstract<p>The auditory brainstem compares sound-evoked excitation and inhibition from both ears to compute sound source location and determine spatial acuity. Although alterations to the anatomy and physiology of the auditory brainstem have been demonstrated in Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) it is not known whether these changes cause spatial acuity deficits in FXS. To test the hypothesis that FXS-related alterations to brainstem circuits impair spatial hearing abilities, a reflexive prepulse inhibition (PPI) task, with variations in sound (gap, location, masking) as the prepulse stimulus, was used on <i>Fmr1</i> knockout mice and B6 controls. Specifically, <i>Fmr1</i> mice show decreased PPI compared to wildtype during gap detection, changes in sound source location, and spatial release from masking with no alteration to their overall startle thresholds compared to wildtype. Lastly, <i>Fmr1</i> mice have increased latency to respond in these tasks suggesting additional impairments in the pathway responsible for reacting to a startling sound. This study further supports data in humans with FXS that show similar deficits in PPI.</p><p><b>Significance Statement:</b> This is the first study to characterize auditory spatial acuity in a mouse model of FXS. We saw minor differences in <i>Fmr1</i> mice compared to B6 mice in several measures of auditory acuity as measured by inhibition of the startle response. <i>Fmr1</i> mice had increased latency to startle for almost all conditions compared to B6 mice suggesting altered timing to acoustic cues. These experiments further show that, consistent with patient report and anatomical/physiological data, the auditory system is altered in a mouse model of FXS, though with some potential compensation leading to a subtle behavioral impact.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To evaluate the dose‐response relationship of daridorexant, a new dual orexin receptor antagonist, on sleep variables in subjects with insomnia disorder.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Adults (≤64 years) with insomnia disorder were randomized (1:1:1:1:1:1) to receive daily oral placebo, daridorexant (5, 10, 25, or 50 mg), or 10 mg zolpidem for 30 days. The primary efficacy outcome was the change in wake time after sleep onset from baseline to Days 1&amp;2. Secondary outcome measures were change in latency to persistent sleep from baseline to Days 1&amp;2, change in subjective wake time after sleep onset and subjective latency to sleep onset from baseline to Week 4. Safety was also assessed.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Of 1005 subjects screened, 359 (64% female) were randomized and received ≥1 dose. A significant dose‐response (Multiple Comparison Procedure‐Modelling, two‐sided p&lt;0.001) was found in the reduction of wake after sleep onset and latency to persistent sleep from baseline to Days 1&amp;2 with daridorexant. These reductions were sustained through to Days 28&amp;29 (p=0.050 and p=0.042, respectively). Similar dose‐dependent relationships were observed for subjective wake after sleep onset and subjective latency to sleep onset. The incidence of treatment‐emergent adverse events was 35%, 38%, 38%, and 34% in subjects treated with 5, 10, 25, and 50 mg daridorexant, respectively, compared with 30% for placebo, and 40% for 10 mg zolpidem.

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25682?af=R">Synaptic changes in Parkinson's disease assessed with in‐vivo imaging</a></h4>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Parkinson's disease is characterized by motor and non‐motor symptoms, reduced striatal dopamine signaling and loss of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra. It is now known that the pathological process in Parkinson's disease may begin decades before the clinical diagnosis and include a variety of neuronal alterations in addition to the dopamine system.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This study examined the density of all synapses with synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A (SV2A) in Parkinson's disease subjects with mild bilateral disease (N=12) and matched normal controls (N=12) using <i>in vivo</i> high‐resolution PET imaging as well as <i>post mortem</i> autoradiography in an independent sample with Parkinson's disease (N=15) and normal controls (N=13) in the substantia nigra and putamen.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A group‐by‐brain region interaction effect (F<sub>10,22</sub> = 3.52, p = 0.007) was observed in the primary brain areas with <i>in vivo</i> SV2A binding. Post hoc analyses revealed that Parkinson's disease group exhibited lower SV2A in the substantia nigra (‐45%; p &lt; 0.001), red nucleus (‐31%; p = 0.03) and locus coeruleus (‐17%; p = 0.03). Exploratory analyses also revealed lower SV2A binding in clinically relevant cortical areas. Using autoradiography, we confirmed lower SV2A in the substantia nigra (‐17%; p &lt; 0.005) and nonsignificant findings in the putamen (‐4%; p = 0.06).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This work provides the first evidence of synaptic loss in brainstem nuclei involved in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease in living patients. SV2A imaging holds promise for understanding synaptic changes central to the disease.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Sensory dysfunction is a common consequence of many forms of neurological injury, including stroke and nerve damage. Rehabilitative paradigms that incorporate sensory retraining can provide modest benefits, but the majority of patients are left with lasting sensory loss. We have developed a novel strategy that uses closed‐loop vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) paired with tactile rehabilitation to enhance synaptic plasticity and facilitate recovery of sensory function.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A clinical case report provides initial evidence that a similar implementation of closed‐loop VNS paired with a tactile rehabilitation regimen could improve recovery of somatosensory function. Here, we sought to build on these promising initial clinical data and rigorously evaluate the ability of VNS paired with tactile rehabilitation to improve recovery in an animal model of chronic sensory loss. The study design, including planned sample size, assessments, and statistical comparisons, was preregistered prior to beginning data collection (<a href="https://osf.io/xsnj5/" target="_blank" title="Link to external resource">https://osf.io/xsnj5/</a>).</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>VNS paired with tactile rehabilitation resulted in a significant and nearly complete recovery of mechanosensory withdrawal thresholds. Equivalent tactile rehabilitation without VNS failed to improve sensory function. This VNS‐dependent restoration of sensory thresholds was maintained for several months after the cessation of stimulation, illustrating long‐term benefits. Moreover, VNS paired with tactile rehabilitation resulted in significant generalized improvements in other measures of sensorimotor forepaw function.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Given the safety and tolerability of VNS therapy, these findings suggest that incorporating VNS paired with sensory retraining into rehabilitative regimens may represent a fundamentally new method to increase recovery of sensory function after neurological injury. ANN NEUROL 2020;87:194–205</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Weight loss has been identified as a negative prognostic factor in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, but there is no evidence regarding whether a high‐caloric diet increases survival. Therefore, we sought to evaluate the efficacy of a high‐caloric fatty diet (HCFD) for increasing survival.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A 1:1 randomized, placebo‐controlled, parallel‐group, double‐blinded trial (LIPCAL‐ALS study) was conducted between February 2015 and September 2018. Patients were followed up at 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18 months after randomization. The study was performed at 12 sites of the clinical and scientific network of German motor neuron disease centers (ALS/MND‐NET). Eligible patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either HCFD (405kcal/day, 100% fat) or placebo in addition to riluzole (100mg/day). The primary endpoint was survival time, defined as time to death or time to study cutoff date.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Two hundred one patients (80 female, 121 male, age = 62.4 ± 10.8 years) were included. The confirmatory analysis of the primary outcome survival showed a survival probability of 0.39 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.27–0.51) in the placebo group and 0.37 (95% CI = 0.25–0.49) in the HCFD group, both after 28 months (point in time of the last event). The hazard ratio was 0.97, 1‐sided 97.5% CI = −∞ to 1.44, <i>p</i> = 0.44.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The results provide no evidence for a life‐prolonging effect of HCFD for the whole amyotrophic lateral sclerosis population. However, post hoc analysis revealed a significant survival benefit for the subgroup of fast‐progressing patients. ANN NEUROL 2020;87:206–216</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Recently, the ASC‐1 complex has been identified as a mechanistic link between amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), and 3 mutations of the ASC‐1 gene <i>TRIP4</i> have been associated with SMA or congenital myopathy. Our goal was to define ASC‐1 neuromuscular function and the phenotypical spectrum associated with <i>TRIP4</i> mutations.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Clinical, molecular, histological, and magnetic resonance imaging studies were made in 5 families with 7 novel <i>TRIP4</i> mutations. Fluorescence activated cell sorting and Western blot were performed in patient‐derived fibroblasts and muscles and in <i>Trip4</i> knocked‐down C2C12 cells.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>All mutations caused ASC‐1 protein depletion. The clinical phenotype was purely myopathic, ranging from lethal neonatal to mild ambulatory adult patients. It included early onset axial and proximal weakness, scoliosis, rigid spine, dysmorphic facies, cutaneous involvement, respiratory failure, and in the older cases, dilated cardiomyopathy. Muscle biopsies showed multiminicores, nemaline rods, cytoplasmic bodies, caps, central nuclei, rimmed fibers, and/or mild endomysial fibrosis. ASC‐1 depletion in C2C12 and in patient‐derived fibroblasts and muscles caused accelerated proliferation, altered expression of cell cycle proteins, and/or shortening of the G0/G1 cell cycle phase leading to cell size reduction.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our results expand the phenotypical and molecular spectrum of <i>TRIP4</i>‐associated disease to include mild adult forms with or without cardiomyopathy, associate ASC‐1 depletion with isolated primary muscle involvement, and establish <i>TRIP4</i> as a causative gene for several congenital muscle diseases, including nemaline, core, centronuclear, and cytoplasmic‐body myopathies. They also identify ASC‐1 as a novel cell cycle regulator with a key role in cell proliferation, and underline transcriptional coregulation defects as a novel pathophysiological mechanism.

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Restless legs syndrome is a frequent neurological disorder with substantial burden on individual well‐being and public health. Genetic risk loci have been identified, but the causatives genes at these loci are largely unknown, so that functional investigation and clinical translation of molecular research data are still inhibited. To identify putatively causative genes, we searched for highly significant mutational burden in candidate genes.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We analyzed 84 candidate genes in 4,649 patients and 4,982 controls by next generation sequencing using molecular inversion probes that targeted mainly coding regions. The burden of low‐frequency and rare variants was assessed, and in addition, an algorithm (binomial performance deviation analysis) was established to estimate independently the sequence variation in the probe binding regions from the variation in sequencing depth.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Highly significant results (considering the number of genes in the genome) of the conventional burden test and the binomial performance deviation analysis overlapped significantly. Fourteen genes were highly significant by one method and confirmed with Bonferroni‐corrected significance by the other to show a differential burden of low‐frequency and rare variants in restless legs syndrome. Nine of them (<i>AAGAB</i>, <i>ATP2C1</i>, <i>CNTN4</i>, <i>COL6A6</i>, <i>CRBN</i>, <i>GLO1</i>, <i>NTNG1</i>, <i>STEAP4</i>, <i>VAV3</i>) resided in the vicinity of known restless legs syndrome loci, whereas 5 (<i>BBS7</i>, <i>CADM1</i>, <i>CREB5</i>, <i>NRG3</i>, <i>SUN1</i>) have not previously been associated with restless legs syndrome. Burden test and binomial performance deviation analysis also converged significantly in fine‐mapping potentially causative domains within these genes.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Differential burden with intragenic low‐frequency variants reveals putatively causative genes in restless legs syndrome. ANN NEUROL 2020;87:184–193</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Drug‐resistant seizures are common in patients with leucine‐rich, glioma‐inactivated 1 (LGI1)‐IgG associated and contactin‐associated protein‐like 2 (CASPR2)‐IgG associated encephalitis. We performed the first randomized double‐blind placebo‐controlled trial to evaluate efficacy of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) in reducing seizure frequency.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Our enrollment goal was 30 LGI1/CASPR2‐IgG–seropositive adult patients with ≥2 seizures per week. Patients were randomized to receive IVIG (0.5g/kg day 1, 1g/kg day 2, 0.6g/kg weeks 3 and 5) or volume‐matched intravenous normal saline. Following the blinded phase, the nonresponders in the placebo group received IVIG. The primary clinical outcome was 50% reduction in seizure frequency from baseline to 5 weeks.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>After enrollment of 17 patients (LGI1‐IgG, 14; CASPR2‐IgG, 3) over 34 months, the study was terminated due to slow enrollment. Six of 8 patients in the IVIG group were responders, compared to 2 of 9 in the placebo group (<i>p</i> = 0.044, odds ratio = 10.5, 95% confidence interval = 1.1–98.9). For the LGI1‐IgG seropositive subgroup, 6 of 8 patients in the IVIG group were responders, compared to zero of 6 in the placebo group. Two LGI1‐IgG–seropositive patients receiving IVIG, but none receiving placebo, were seizure‐free at the end of the blinded phase. Four of the 6 patients entering the open‐label IVIG arm reported ≥50% reduction in seizure frequency. There were no correlations with LGI1/CASPR2‐IgG1–4 subclasses.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Superiority of IVIG to placebo reached statistical significance for the primary endpoint for all patients and the subset with LGI1‐IgG. These results have to be interpreted with the caveat that the study did not reach its originally selected sample size. ANN NEUROL 2020;87:313–323</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The pallidonigroluysian (PNL) system, the primary component of corticosubcortical circuits, is generally spared in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We evaluated the clinicopathological features of an unusual form of ALS with PNL degeneration (PNLD) and assessed whether ALS with PNLD represents a distinct ALS subtype.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>From a cohort of 97 autopsied cases of sporadic ALS with phosphorylated 43kDa TAR DNA‐binding protein (TDP‐43) inclusions, we selected those with PNLD and analyzed their clinicopathological features.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Eleven cases (11%) that showed PNLD were divided into 2 subtypes depending on the lesion distribution: (1) extensive type (n = 6), showing widespread TDP‐43 pathology and multisystem degeneration, both involving the PNL system; and (2) limited type (n = 5), showing selective PNL and motor system involvement, thus being unclassifiable in terms of Brettschneiderʼs staging or Nishihiraʼs typing of ALS. The limited type showed a younger age at onset and predominant PNLD that accounted for the early development of extrapyramidal signs. The limited type exhibited the heaviest pathology in the subthalamus and external globus pallidus, suggesting that TDP‐43 inclusions propagated via indirect or hyperdirect pathways, unlike ALS without PNLD, where the direct pathway is considered to convey TDP‐43 aggregates from the cerebral cortex to the substantia nigra.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The PNL system can be involved in the disease process of ALS, either nonselectively as part of multisystem degeneration, or selectively. ALS with selective involvement of the PNL and motor systems exhibits unique clinicopathological features and TDP‐43 propagation routes, thus representing a distinct subtype of ALS.

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Regional variations in oscillatory activity during human sleep remain unknown. Using the unique ability of intracranial electroencephalography to study in situ brain physiology, this study assesses regional variations of electroencephalographic sleep activity and creates the first atlas of human sleep using recordings from the first sleep cycle.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Intracerebral electroencephalographic recordings with channels displaying physiological activity from nonlesional tissue were selected from 91 patients of 3 tertiary epilepsy centers. Sections during non–rapid eye movement sleep (stages N2 and N3) and rapid eye movement sleep (stage R) were selected from the first sleep cycle for oscillatory and nonoscillatory signal analysis. Results of 1,468 channels were grouped into 38 regions covering all cortical areas.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We found regional differences in the distribution of sleep transients and spectral content during all sleep stages. There was a caudorostral gradient, with more slow frequencies and fewer spindles in temporoparieto‐occipital than in frontal cortex. Moreover, deep‐seated structures showed spectral peaks differing from the baseline electroencephalogram. The regions with &gt;60% of channels presenting significant rhythmic activity were either mesial or temporal basal structures that contribute minimally to the scalp electroencephalogram. Finally, during deeper sleep stages, electroencephalographic analysis revealed a more homogeneous spatial distribution, with increased coupling between high and low frequencies.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This study provides a better understanding of the regional variability of sleep, and establishes a baseline for human sleep in all cortical regions during the first sleep cycle. Furthermore, the open‐access atlas will be a unique resource for research (<a href="https://mni-open-ieegatlas.research.mcgill.ca" target="_blank" title="Link to external resource">https://mni-open-ieegatlas.research.mcgill.ca</a>).

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Febrile seizures may follow vaccination. Common variants in the sodium channel gene, <i>SCN1A</i>, are associated with febrile seizures, and rare pathogenic variants in <i>SCN1A</i> cause the severe developmental and epileptic encephalopathy Dravet syndrome. Following vaccination, febrile seizures may raise the specter of poor outcome and inappropriately implicate vaccination as the cause. We aimed to determine the prevalence of <i>SCN1A</i> variants in children having their first febrile seizure either proximal to vaccination or unrelated to vaccination compared to controls.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed <i>SCN1A</i> sequencing, blind to clinical category, in a prospective cohort of children presenting with their first febrile seizure as vaccine proximate (n = 69) or as non–vaccine proximate (n = 75), and children with no history of seizures (n = 90) recruited in Australian pediatric hospitals.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We detected 2 pathogenic variants in vaccine‐proximate cases (p.R568X and p.W932R), both of whom developed Dravet syndrome, and 1 in a non–vaccine‐proximate case (p.V947L) who had febrile seizures plus from 9 months. All had generalized tonic–clonic seizures lasting &gt;15 minutes. We also found enrichment of a reported risk allele, rs6432860‐T, in children with febrile seizures compared to controls (odds ratio = 1.91, 95% confidence interval = 1.31–2.81).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Pathogenic <i>SCN1A</i> variants may be identified in infants with vaccine‐proximate febrile seizures. As early diagnosis of Dravet syndrome is essential for optimal management and outcome, <i>SCN1A</i> sequencing in infants with prolonged febrile seizures, proximate to vaccination, should become routine.

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Unawareness, or <i>anosognosia</i>, of memory deficits is a challenging manifestation of Alzheimer's disease (AD) that adversely affects a patient's safety and decision‐making. However, there is a lack of consensus regarding the presence, as well as the evolution, of altered awareness of memory function across the preclinical and prodromal stages of AD. Here, we aimed to characterize change in awareness of memory abilities and its relationship to beta‐amyloid (Aβ) burden in a large cohort (N = 1,070) of individuals across the disease spectrum.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Memory awareness was longitudinally assessed (average number of visits = 4.3) and operationalized using the discrepancy between mean participant and partner report on the Everyday Cognition scale (memory domain). Aβ deposition was measured at baseline using [18F]florbetapir positron emission tomographic imaging.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Aβ predicted longitudinal changes in memory awareness, such that awareness decreased faster in participants with increased Aβ burden. Aβ and clinical group interacted to predict change in memory awareness, demonstrating the strongest effect in dementia participants, but could also be found in the cognitively normal (CN) participants. In a subset of CN participants who progressed to mild cognitive impairment (MCI), heightened memory awareness was observed up to 1.6 years before MCI diagnosis, with memory awareness declining until the time of progression to MCI (−0.08 discrepant‐points/yr<i>)</i>. In a subset of MCI participants who progressed to dementia, awareness was low initially and continued to decline (−0.23 discrepant‐points/yr<i>)</i>, reaching anosognosia 3.2 years before dementia onset.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Aβ burden is associated with a progressive decrease in self‐awareness of memory deficits, reaching anosognosia approximately 3 years before dementia diagnosis. ANN NEUROL 2020;87:267–280</p>

<p>We present a pixel-based deep Active Inference algorithm (PixelAI) inspired
in human body perception and successfully validated in robot body perception
and action as a use case. Our algorithm combines the free energy principle from
neuroscience, rooted in variational inference, with deep convolutional decoders
to scale the algorithm to directly deal with images input and provide online
adaptive inference. The approach enables the robot to perform 1) dynamical body
estimation of arm using only raw monocular camera images and 2) autonomous
reaching to "imagined" arm poses in the visual space. We statistically analyzed
the algorithm performance in a simulated and a real Nao robot. Results show how
the same algorithm deals with both perception an action, modelled as an
inference optimization problem.

<p>Cortical neural circuits display highly irregular spiking in individual
neurons but variably sized collective firing, oscillations and critical
avalanches at the population level, all of which have functional importance for
information processing. Theoretically, the balance of excitation and inhibition
inputs is thought to account for spiking irregularity and critical avalanches
may originate from an underlying phase transition. However, the theoretical
reconciliation of these multilevel dynamic aspects remains an open question.
Herein, we show that excitation-inhibition (E-I) balanced network with synaptic
kinetics can maintain irregular spiking dynamics with different levels of
synchrony and critical avalanches emerge near the synchronous transition point.
The mechanism is unveiled by a novel mean-field theory that derives the field
equations governing the network macroscopic dynamics. It reveals that the E-I
balanced state of the network manifesting irregular individual spiking is
characterized by a macroscopic stable state, which can be either a fixed point
or a periodic motion and the transition is predicted by a Hopf bifurcation in
the macroscopic field. Furthermore, these multiscale variable behaviours can be
jointly observed in the spontaneous activities of mouse cortical slice in
vitro, indicating universality of the theoretical prediction. Our theory
unveils the mechanism that permits complex neural activities in different
spatiotemporal scales to coexist and elucidates a possible origin of the
criticality of neural systems. It also provides a theoretical framework for
analyzing the macroscopic dynamics of E-I balanced networks and its
relationship to the microscopic counterparts, which can be useful for
large-scale modeling and computation of cortical dynamics.

<p>Respiratory motor failure is the leading cause of death in spinal cord injury (SCI). Cervical injuries disrupt connections between brainstem neurons that are the primary source of excitatory drive to respiratory motor neurons in the spinal cord and their targets. In addition to direct connections from bulbospinal neurons, respiratory motor neurons also receive excitatory and inhibitory inputs from propriospinal neurons, yet their role in the control of breathing is often overlooked. In this review, we will present evidence that propriospinal neurons play important roles in patterning muscle activity for breathing. These roles likely include shaping the pattern of respiratory motor output, processing and transmitting sensory afferent information, coordinating ventilation with motor activity, and regulating accessory and respiratory muscle activity. In addition, we discuss recent studies that have highlighted the importance of propriospinal neurons for recovery of respiratory muscle function following SCI. We propose that molecular genetic approaches to target specific developmental neuron classes in the spinal cord would help investigators resolve the many roles of propriospinal neurons in the control of breathing. A better understanding of how spinal circuits pattern breathing could lead to new treatments to improve breathing following injury or disease.</p>

<p>In an ever-changing environment, crossmodal recalibration is crucial to maintain precise and coherent spatial estimates across different sensory modalities. Accordingly, it has been found that perceived auditory space is recalibrated toward vision after consistent exposure to spatially misaligned audio-visual stimuli (VS). While this so-called ventriloquism aftereffect (VAE) yields internal consistency between vision and audition, it does not necessarily lead to consistency between the perceptual representation of space and the actual environment. For this purpose, feedback about the true state of the external world might be necessary. Here, we tested whether the size of the VAE is modulated by external feedback and reward. During adaptation audio-VS with a fixed spatial discrepancy were presented. Participants had to localize the sound and received feedback about the magnitude of their localization error. In half of the sessions the feedback was based on the position of the VS and in the other half it was based on the position of the auditory stimulus. An additional monetary reward was given if the localization error fell below a certain threshold that was based on participants’ performance in the pretest. As expected, when error feedback was based on the position of the VS, auditory localization during adaptation trials shifted toward the position of the VS. Conversely, feedback based on the position of the auditory stimuli reduced the visual influence on auditory localization (i.e., the ventriloquism effect) and improved sound localization accuracy. After adaptation with error feedback based on the VS position, a typical auditory VAE (but no visual aftereffect) was observed in subsequent unimodal localization tests. By contrast, when feedback was based on the position of the auditory stimuli during adaptation, no auditory VAE was observed in subsequent unimodal auditory trials. Importantly, in this situation no visual aftereffect was found either. As feedback did not change the physical attributes of the audio-visual stimulation during adaptation, the present findings suggest that crossmodal recalibration is subject to top–down influences. Such top–down influences might help prevent miscalibration of audition toward conflicting visual stimulation in situations in which external feedback indicates that visual information is inaccurate.</p>

<p>Transcranial direct and alternating current stimulation (tDCS and tACS, respectively) entail capability to modulate human brain dynamics and cognition. However, the comparability of these approaches at the level of large-scale functional networks has not been thoroughly investigated. In this study, 44 subjects were randomly assigned to receive sham (N = 15), tDCS (N = 15), or tACS (N = 14). The first electrode (anode in tDCS) was positioned over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, the target area, and the second electrode (cathode in tDCS) was placed over the right supraorbital region. tDCS was delivered with a constant current of 2 mA. tACS was fixed to 2 mA peak-to-peak with 6 Hz frequency. Stimulation was applied concurrently with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) acquisitions, both at rest and during the performance of a verbal working memory (WM) task. After stimulation, subjects repeated the fMRI WM task. Our results indicated that at rest, tDCS increased functional connectivity particularly within the default-mode network (DMN), while tACS decreased it. When comparing both fMRI WM tasks, it was observed that tDCS displayed decreased brain activity post-stimulation as compared to online. Conversely, tACS effects were driven by neural increases online as compared to post-stimulation. Interestingly, both effects primarily occurred within DMN-related areas. Regarding the differences in each fMRI WM task, during the online fMRI WM task, tACS engaged distributed neural resources which did not overlap with the WM-dependent activity pattern, but with some posterior DMN regions. In contrast, during the post-stimulation fMRI WM task, tDCS strengthened prefrontal DMN deactivations, being these activity reductions associated with faster responses. Furthermore, it was observed that tDCS neural responses presented certain consistency across distinct fMRI modalities, while tACS did not. In sum, tDCS and tACS modulate fMRI-derived network dynamics differently. However, both effects seem to focus on DMN regions and the WM network-DMN shift, which are highly affected in aging and disease. Thus, albeit exploratory and needing further replication with larger samples, our results might provide a refined understanding of how the DMN functioning can be externally modulated through commonly used non-invasive brain stimulation techniques, which may be of eventual clinical relevance.</p>

<p>A resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC)-constructed functional network (FN) derived from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data can effectively mine alterations in brain function during aging due to the non-invasive and effective advantages of fMRI. With global health research focusing on aging, several open fMRI datasets have been made available that combine deep learning with big data and are a new, promising trend and open issue for brain information detection in fMRI studies of brain aging. In this study, we proposed a new method based on deep learning from the perspective of big data, named Deep neural network (DNN) with Autoencoder (AE) pretrained Functional connectivity Analysis (DAFA), to deeply mine the important functional connectivity changes in fMRI during brain aging. First, using resting-state fMRI data from 421 subjects from the CamCAN dataset, functional connectivities were calculated using sliding window method, and the complex functional patterns were mined by an AE. Then, to increase the statistical power and reliability of the results, we used an AE-pretrained DNN to relabel the functional connectivities of each subject to classify them as belonging to the attributes of young or old individuals. A method called search-back analysis was performed to find alterations in brain function during aging according to the relabeled functional connectivities. Finally, behavioral data regarding fluid intelligence and response time were used to verify the revealed functional changes. Compared to traditional methods, DAFA revealed additional, important aged-related changes in FC patterns [e.g., FC connections within the default mode (DMN) and the sensorimotor and cingulo-opercular networks, as well as connections between the frontoparietal and cingulo-opercular networks, between the DMN and the frontoparietal/cingulo-opercular/sensorimotor/occipital/cerebellum networks, and between the sensorimotor and frontoparietal/cingulo-opercular networks], which were correlated to behavioral data. These findings demonstrated that the proposed DAFA method was superior to traditional FC-determining methods in discovering changes in brain functional connectivity during aging. In addition, it may be a promising method for exploring important information in other fMRI studies.</p>

<p>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the leading type of dementia worldwide. Despite an increasing burden of disease due to a rapidly aging population, there is still a lack of complete understanding of the precise pathological mechanisms which drive its progression. Glutamate is the main excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain and plays an essential role in the normal function and excitability of neuronal networks. While previous studies have shown alterations in the function of the glutamatergic system in AD, the underlying etiology of beta amyloid (Aβ<sub>1–42</sub>) induced changes has not been explored. Here we have investigated the acute effects of stereotaxic hippocampal Aβ<sub>1–42</sub> injection on specific glutamatergic receptors and transporters in the mouse hippocampus, using immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy 3 days after Aβ<sub>1–42</sub> injection in aged male C57BL/6 mice, before the onset of neuronal cell death. We show that acute injection of Aβ<sub>1–42</sub> is sufficient to induce cognitive deficits 3 days post-injection. We also report no significant changes in glutamate receptor subunits GluA1, GluA2, VGluT1, and VGluT2 in response to acute injection of Aβ<sub>1–42</sub> when compared with the ACSF-vehicle injected mice. However, we observed increased expression in the DG hilus and ventral stratum (str.) granulosum, CA3 str. radiatum and str. oriens, and CA1 str. radiatum of the GluN1 subunit, and increased expression within the CA3 str. radiatum and decreased expression within the DG str. granulosum of the GluN2A subunit in Aβ<sub>1–42</sub> injected mice compared to NC, and a similar trend observed when compared to ACSF-injected mice. We also observed alterations in expression patterns of glutamatergic receptor subunits and transporters within specific layers of hippocampal subregions in response to a microinjection stimulus. These findings indicate that the pathological alterations in the glutamatergic system observed in AD are likely to be partially a result of both acute and chronic exposure to Aβ<sub>1–42</sub> and implies a much more complex circuit mechanism associated with glutamatergic dysfunction than simply glutamate-mediated excitotoxic neuronal death.</p>

<p>The emotion generated by the touch of materials is studied via a protocol based on blind assessment of various stimuli. The human emotional reaction felt toward a material is estimated through (i) explicit measurements, using a questionnaire collecting valence and intensity, and (ii) implicit measurements of the activity of the autonomic nervous system, via a pupillometry equipment. A panel of 25 university students (13 women, 12 men), aged from 18 to 27, tested blind twelve materials such as polymers, sandpapers, wood, velvet and fur, randomly ordered. After measuring the initial pupil diameter, taken as a reference, its variation during the tactile exploration was recorded. After each touch, the participants were asked to quantify the emotional value of the material. The results show that the pupil size variation follows the emotional intensity. It is significantly larger during the touch of materials considered as pleasant or unpleasant, than with the touch of neutral materials. Moreover, after a time period of about 0.5 s following the stimulus, the results reveal significant differences between pleasant and unpleasant stimuli, as well as differences according to gender, i.e., higher pupil dilatation of women than men. These results suggest (i) that the autonomic nervous system is initially sensitive to high arousing stimulation, and (ii) that, after a certain period, the pupil size changes according to the cognitive interest induced and the emotional regulation adopted. This research shows the interest of the emotional characterization of materials for product design.</p>

<p>Two strikingly distinct types of activity have been observed in various brain structures during delay periods of delayed response tasks: Persistent activity (PA), in which a sub-population of neurons maintains an elevated firing rate throughout an entire delay period; and Sequential activity (SA), in which sub-populations of neurons are activated sequentially in time. It has been hypothesized that both types of dynamics can be “learned” by the relevant networks from the statistics of their inputs, thanks to mechanisms of synaptic plasticity. However, the necessary conditions for a synaptic plasticity rule and input statistics to learn these two types of dynamics in a stable fashion are still unclear. In particular, it is unclear whether a single learning rule is able to learn both types of activity patterns, depending on the statistics of the inputs driving the network. Here, we first characterize the complete bifurcation diagram of a firing rate model of multiple excitatory populations with an inhibitory mechanism, as a function of the parameters characterizing its connectivity. We then investigate how an unsupervised temporally asymmetric Hebbian plasticity rule shapes the dynamics of the network. Consistent with previous studies, we find that for stable learning of PA and SA, an additional stabilization mechanism is necessary. We show that a generalized version of the standard multiplicative homeostatic plasticity (Renart et al., 2003; Toyoizumi et al., 2014) stabilizes learning by effectively masking excitatory connections during stimulation and unmasking those connections during retrieval. Using the bifurcation diagram derived for fixed connectivity, we study analytically the temporal evolution and the steady state of the learned recurrent architecture as a function of parameters characterizing the external inputs. Slow changing stimuli lead to PA, while fast changing stimuli lead to SA. Our network model shows how a network with plastic synapses can stably and flexibly learn PA and SA in an unsupervised manner.</p>

<p>Resting-state brain activities have been extensively investigated to understand the macro-scale network architecture of the human brain using non-invasive imaging methods such as fMRI, EEG, and MEG. Previous studies revealed a mechanistic origin of resting-state networks (RSNs) using the connectome dynamics modeling approach, where the neural mass dynamics model constrained by the structural connectivity is simulated to replicate the resting-state networks measured with fMRI and/or fast synchronization transitions with EEG/MEG. However, there is still little understanding of the relationship between the slow fluctuations measured with fMRI and the fast synchronization transitions with EEG/MEG. In this study, as a first step toward evaluating experimental evidence of resting state activity at two different time scales but in a unified way, we investigate connectome dynamics models that simultaneously explain resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) and EEG microstates. Here, we introduce empirical rsFC and microstates as evaluation criteria of simulated neuronal dynamics obtained by the Larter-Breakspear model in one cortical region connected with those in other cortical regions based on structural connectivity. We optimized the global coupling strength and the local gain parameter (variance of the excitatory and inhibitory threshold) of the simulated neuronal dynamics by fitting both rsFC and microstate spatial patterns to those of experimental ones. As a result, we found that simulated neuronal dynamics in a narrow optimal parameter range simultaneously reproduced empirical rsFC and microstates. Two parameter groups had different inter-regional interdependence. One type of dynamics was synchronized across the whole brain region, and the other type was synchronized between brain regions with strong structural connectivity. In other words, both fast synchronization transitions and slow BOLD fluctuation changed based on structural connectivity in the two parameter groups. Empirical microstates were similar to simulated microstates in the two parameter groups. Thus, fast synchronization transitions correlated with slow BOLD fluctuation based on structural connectivity yielded characteristics of microstates. Our results demonstrate that a bottom-up approach, which extends the single neuronal dynamics model based on empirical observations into a neural mass dynamics model and integrates structural connectivity, effectively reveals both macroscopic fast, and slow resting-state network dynamics.</p>

<p>Behavioral studies have shown spatial working memory impairment with aging in several animal species, including humans. Persistent activity of layer 3 pyramidal dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) neurons during delay periods of working memory tasks is important for encoding memory of the stimulus. In vitro studies have shown that these neurons undergo significant age-related structural and functional changes, but the extent to which these changes affect neural mechanisms underlying spatial working memory is not understood fully. Here, we confirm previous studies showing impairment on the Delayed Recognition Span Task in the spatial condition (DRSTsp), and increased in vitro action potential firing rates (hyperexcitability), across the adult life span of the rhesus monkey. We use a bump attractor model to predict how empirically observed changes in the aging dlPFC affect performance on the Delayed Response Task (DRT), and introduce a model of memory retention in the DRSTsp. Persistent activity—and, in turn, cognitive performance—in both models was affected much more by hyperexcitability of pyramidal neurons than by a loss of synapses. Our DRT simulations predict that additional changes to the network, such as increased firing of inhibitory interneurons, are needed to account for lower firing rates during the DRT with aging reported in vivo. Synaptic facilitation was an essential feature of the DRSTsp model, but it did not compensate fully for the effects of the other age-related changes on DRT performance. Modeling pyramidal neuron hyperexcitability and synapse loss simultaneously led to a partial recovery of function in both tasks, with the simulated level of DRSTsp impairment similar to that observed in aging monkeys. This modeling work integrates empirical data across multiple scales, from synapse counts to cognitive testing, to further our understanding of aging in non-human primates.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00574">Altered Levels and Isoforms of Tau and Nuclear Membrane Invaginations in Huntington’s Disease</a></h4>

<p>Since the early reports of neurofibrillary Tau pathology in brains of some Huntington’s disease (HD) patients, mounting evidence of multiple alterations of Tau in HD brain tissue has emerged in recent years. Such Tau alterations range from increased total levels, imbalance of isoforms generated by alternative splicing (increased 4R-/3R-Tau ratio) or by post-translational modifications such as hyperphosphorylation or truncation. Besides, the detection in HD brains of a new Tau histopathological hallmark known as Tau nuclear rods (TNRs) or Tau-positive nuclear indentations (TNIs) led to propose HD as a secondary Tauopathy. After their discovery in HD brains, TNIs have also been reported in hippocampal neurons of early Braak stage AD cases and in frontal and temporal cortical neurons of FTD-MAPT cases due to the intronic IVS10+16 mutation in the Tau gene (MAPT) which results in an increased 4R-/3R-Tau ratio similar to that observed in HD. TNIs are likely pathogenic for contributing to the disturbed nucleocytoplasmic transport observed in HD. A key question is whether correction of any of the mentioned Tau alterations might have positive therapeutic implications for HD. The beneficial effect of decreasing Tau expression in HD mouse models clearly implicates Tau in HD pathogenesis. Such beneficial effect might be exerted by diminishing the excess total levels of Tau or specifically by diminishing the excess 4R-Tau, as well as any of their downstream effects. In any case, since gene silencing drugs are under development to attenuate both Huntingtin (HTT) expression for HD and MAPT expression for FTD-MAPT, it is conceivable that the combined therapy in HD patients might be more effective than HTT silencing alone.</p>

<p>Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the most frequently occurring movement disorder, with an increasing incidence due to an aging population. For many years, the post-mortem brain was regarded as the gold standard for the analysis of the human pathology of this disease. However, modern stem cell technologies, including the analysis of patient-specific neurons and glial cells, have opened up new avenues for dissecting the pathologic mechanisms of PD. Most data on morphological changes, such as cell death or changes in neurite complexity, or functional deficits were acquired in 2D and few in 3D models. This review will examine the prerequisites for human disease modeling in PD, covering the generation of midbrain neurons, 3D organoid midbrain models, the selection of controls including genetically engineered lines, and the study of cell-cell interactions. We will present major disease phenotypes in human in vitro models of PD, focusing on those phenotypes that have been detected in genetic and sporadic PD models. An additional point covered in this review will be the use of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived technologies to model cell-cell interactions in PD.</p>

<p>Mechanisms underlying the selective vulnerability of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) over those in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) to degeneration in Parkinson’s disease (PD) remain poorly understood. DA neurons of SNpc and VTA are autonomous pacemakers but pacemaking in SNpc but not in VTA is accompanied by calcium influx through L-type calcium channel, Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 contributing to increased intracellular calcium and hence to cell death. Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>42A</sub>, an alternatively spliced short variant of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 has increased calcium influx. We, therefore studied the role of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>42</sub> (full-length channel) and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>42A</sub> in mouse SNpc in PD pathogenesis by quantifying mRNA levels of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>42</sub> and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>42A</sub> in SNpc and followed the change in their levels in MPTP induced parkinsonism mouse model. Using in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry we observed the localization of mRNA of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>42</sub> and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>42A</sub> in tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) positive DA neurons. Further, mRNA levels of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>42A</sub> were higher in SNpc as compared to the cortex. Upon MPTP treatment, mRNA levels of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>42</sub> and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>42A</sub> maintained their levels in SNpc in spite of the loss of ~50% of the DA neurons. This indicates that the expression of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>42</sub> and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>42A</sub> is maintained at a robust level during the degenerative process in the parkinsonism model.</p>

<p>miR-146a is a microRNA (miRNA) involved in neuroinflammation and aging; alterations in its expression were described in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, most of the studies conducted so far on this miRNA included a limited number of participants and produced contradictory results. We compared miR-146a levels in plasma from 33 AD patients vs. 28 age-matched non-affected controls (CTRL) through quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). No difference between the case and the control group was evidenced, but a correlation was detected between miR-146a levels and subjects’ age (p &lt; 0.001) as well as between miR-146a levels and patients’ Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores (p = 0.011), in an enlarged group of 51 AD patients and 45 CTRL supporting a role for this miRNA in aging processes and disease progression.</p>

The BBSome is a heterooctameric protein complex that plays a central role in primary cilia homeostasis. Its malfunction causes the severe ciliopathy Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS). The complex acts as a cargo adapter that recognizes signaling proteins such as GPCRs and links them to the intraflagellar transport machinery. The underlying mechanism is poorly understood. Here we present a high-resolution cryo-EM structure of a human heterohexameric core subcomplex of the BBSome. The structure reveals the architecture of the complex in atomic detail. It explains how the subunits interact with each other and how disease-causing mutations hamper this interaction. The complex adopts a conformation that is open for binding to membrane-associated GTPase Arl6 and a large positively charged patch likely strengthens the interaction with the membrane. A prominent negatively charged cleft at the center of the complex is likely involved in binding of positively charged signaling sequences of cargo proteins.

DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) have detrimental effects on cell survival and genomic stability, and are related to cancer and other human diseases. In this study, we identified microtubule-depolymerizing kinesin Kif2C as a protein associated with DSB-mimicking DNA templates and known DSB repair proteins in <i>Xenopus</i> egg extracts and mammalian cells. The recruitment of Kif2C to DNA damage sites was dependent on both PARP and ATM activities. Kif2C knockdown or knockout led to accumulation of endogenous DNA damage, DNA damage hypersensitivity, and reduced DSB repair via both NHEJ and HR. Interestingly, Kif2C depletion, or inhibition of its microtubule depolymerase activity, reduced the mobility of DSBs, impaired the formation of DNA damage foci, and decreased the occurrence of foci fusion and resolution. Taken together, our study established Kif2C as a new player of the DNA damage response, and presented a new mechanism that governs DSB dynamics and repair.

<p>by Maria Bargués-Ribera, Chaitanya S. Gokhale</p>

Since its origins, thousands of years ago, agriculture has been challenged by the presence of evolving plant pathogens. Temporal rotations of host and non-host crops have helped farmers to control epidemics among other utilities, but further efforts for strategy assessment are needed. Here, we present a methodology for developing crop rotation strategies optimal for control of pathogens informed by numerical simulations of eco-evolutionary dynamics in one field. This approach can integrate agronomic criteria used in crop rotations—soil quality and cash yield—and the analysis of pathogen evolution in systems where hosts are artificially selected. Our analysis shows which rotation patterns perform better in maximising crop yield when an unspecified infection occurs, with yield being dependent on both soil quality and the strength of the epidemic. Importantly, the use of non-host crops, which both improve soil quality and control the epidemic results in similar rational rotation strategies for diverse agronomic and infection conditions. We test the repeatability of the best rotation patterns over multiple decades, an essential end-user goal. Our results provide sustainable strategies for optimal resource investment for increased food production and lead to further insights into the minimisation of pesticide use in a society demanding ever more efficient agriculture.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/6Rt757zAX7c" width="1" />

Abstract<p>Humans and other animals adapt motor commands to predictable disturbances within tens of trials in laboratory conditions. A central question is how does the nervous system adapt to disturbances in natural conditions when exactly the same movements cannot be practiced several times. Because motor commands and sensory feedback together carry continuous information about limb dynamics, we hypothesized that the nervous system could adapt to unexpected disturbances online. We tested this hypothesis in two reaching experiments during which velocity-dependent force fields were randomly applied. We found that within-movement feedback corrections gradually improved, despite the fact that the perturbations were unexpected. Moreover, when participants were instructed to stop at a via-point, the application of a force field prior to the via-point induced mirror-image after-effects after the via-point, consistent with within-trial adaptation to the unexpected dynamics. These findings suggest a fast time-scale of motor learning, which complements feedback control and supports adaptation of an ongoing movement.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> An important function of the nervous system is to adapt motor commands in anticipation of predictable disturbances, which supports motor learning when we move in novel environments such as force fields. Here we show that movement control when exposed to unpredictable disturbances exhibit similar traits: motor corrections become tuned to the force field, and they evoke after effects within an ongoing sequence of movements. We propose and discuss the framework of adaptive control to explain these results: a real-time learning algorithm, which complements feedback control in the presence of model errors. This candidate model potentially links movement control and trial-by-trial adaptation of motor commands.</p>

<p>We present an optimized conductance-based retina microcircuit simulator which
transforms light stimuli into a series of graded and spiking action potentials
through photo transduction. We use discrete retinal neuron blocks based on a
collation of single-compartment models and morphologically realistic
formulations, and successfully achieve a biologically real-time simulator. This
is done by optimizing the numerical methods employed to solve the system of
over 270 nonlinear ordinary differential equations and parameters. Our
simulator includes some of the most recent advances in compartmental modeling
to include five intrinsic ion currents of each cell whilst ensuring real-time
performance, in attaining the ion-current and membrane responses of the
photoreceptor rod and cone cells, the bipolar and amacrine cells, their
laterally connected electrical and chemical synapses, and the output ganglion
cell. It exhibits dynamical retinal behavior such as spike-frequency
adaptation, rebound activation, fast-spiking, and subthreshold responsivity.
Light stimuli incident at the photoreceptor rod and cone cells is modulated
through the system of differential equations, enabling the user to probe the
neuronal response at any point in the network. This is in contrast to many
other retina encoding schemes which prefer to `black-box' the preceding stages
to the spike train output. Our simulator is made available open source, with
the hope that it will benefit neuroscientists and machine learning
practitioners in better understanding the retina sub-circuitries, how retina
cells optimize the representation of visual information, and in generating
large datasets of biologically accurate graded and spiking responses.

<p>In systems neuroscience, most models posit that brain regions communicate
information under constraints of efficiency. Yet, metabolic and information
transfer efficiency across structural networks are not understood. In a large
cohort of youth, we find metabolic costs associated with structural path
strengths supporting information diffusion. Metabolism is balanced with the
coupling of structures supporting diffusion and network modularity. To
understand efficient network communication, we develop a theory specifying
minimum rates of message diffusion that brain regions should transmit for an
expected fidelity, and we test five predictions from the theory. We introduce
compression efficiency, which quantifies differing trade-offs between lossy
compression and communication fidelity in structural networks. Compression
efficiency evolves with development, heightens when metabolic gradients guide
diffusion, constrains network complexity, explains how rich-club hubs integrate
information, and correlates with cortical areal scaling, myelination, and
speed-accuracy trade-offs. Our findings elucidate how network structures and
metabolic resources support efficient neural communication.

<p>Spiking activity in cortical networks is nonlinear in nature. The
linear-nonlinear cascade model, some versions of which are also known as
point-process generalized linear model, can efficiently capture the nonlinear
dynamics exhibited by such networks. Of particular interest in such models are
theoretical predictions of spike train statistics. However, due to the
moment-closure problem, approximations are inevitable. We suggest here a series
expansion that explains how higher-order moments couple to lower-order ones.
Our approach makes predictions in terms of certain integrals, the so-called
loop integrals. In previous studies these integrals have been evaluated
numerically, but numerical instabilities are sometimes encountered rendering
the results unreliable. Analytic solutions are presented here to overcome this
problem, and to arrive at more robust evaluations. We were able to deduce these
analytic solutions by switching to Fourier space and making use of complex
analysis, specifically Cauchy's residue theorem. We formalized the loop
integrals and explicitly solved them for specific response functions. To
quantify the importance of these corrections for spike train cumulants, we
numerically simulated spiking networks and compared their sample statistics to
our theoretical predictions. Our results demonstrate that the magnitude of the
nonlinear corrections depends on the working point of the nonlinear network
dynamics, and that it is related to the eigenvalues of the mean-field stability
matrix. For our example, the corrections for the firing rates are in the range
between 4 % and 21 % on average. Precise and robust predictions of spike train
statistics accounting for nonlinear effects are, for example, highly relevant
for theories involving spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP).

<p>Fitts' law is a linear equation relating movement time to an index of
movement difficulty. The recent finding that Fitts' law applies to voluntary
movement of the vocal tract raises the question of whether the theory of speech
production implies Fitts' law. The present letter establishes a theoretical

We derive a variant of Fitts' law where the intercept and slope are functions
of the parameters of the Task Dynamics model and the index of difficulty is a
product logarithm, or Lambert W function, rather than a logarithm.

<p>by Sungrim Seirin-Lee, Yuhki Yanase, Shunsuke Takahagi, Michihiro Hide</p>

Urticaria is a common skin disorder characterized by the rapid appearance and disappearance of local skin edema and flares with itching. It is characterized by various macroscopic skin eruptions unique to patients and/or subtypes of urticaria with respect to shape, size, color, and/or duration of eruptions. Nevertheless, the mechanism underlying multifarious eruptions in urticaria is largely unknown. The eruptions are believed to be evoked by histamine release from mast cells in the skin. However, the majority of visible characteristics of urticaria cannot be explained by a simple injection of histamine to the skin. To explain the multifarious eruptions of urticaria, we developed a single reaction-diffusion model suggesting the self-activation and self-inhibition regulation of histamine release from mast cells. Using the model, we found that various geometrical shapes of eruptions typically observed in patients can be explained by the model parameters and randomness or strength of the initial stimuli to mast cells. Furthermore, we verified that the wheal-expanding speed of urticaria, which is shown to be much smaller than that of the intradermal injection experimental system may be explained by our model and a simple diffusion equation. Our study suggests that the simple reaction-diffusion dynamics, including the independent self-activating and -inhibitory regulation of histamine release, may account for the essential mechanism underlying the formation of multifarious eruptions in urticaria.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/agkwHgohOw4" width="1" />

Advanced brain imaging analysis methods, including multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA), functional connectivity, and functional alignment, have become powerful tools in cognitive neuroscience over the past decade. These tools are implemented in custom code and separate packages, often requiring different software and language proficiencies. Although usable by expert researchers, novice users face a steep learning curve. These difficulties stem from the use of new programming languages (e.g., Python), learning how to apply machine-learning methods to high-dimensional fMRI data, and minimal documentation and training materials. Furthermore, most standard fMRI analysis packages (e.g., AFNI, FSL, SPM) focus on preprocessing and univariate analyses, leaving a gap in how to integrate with advanced tools. To address these needs, we developed BrainIAK (brainiak.org), an open-source Python software package that seamlessly integrates several cutting-edge, computationally efficient techniques with other Python packages (e.g., Nilearn, Scikit-learn) for file handling, visualization, and machine learning. To disseminate these powerful tools, we developed user-friendly tutorials (in Jupyter format; https://brainiak.org/tutorials/) for learning BrainIAK and advanced fMRI analysis in Python more generally. These materials cover techniques including: MVPA (pattern classification and representational similarity analysis); parallelized searchlight analysis; background connectivity; full correlation matrix analysis; inter-subject correlation; inter-subject functional connectivity; shared response modeling; event segmentation using hidden Markov models; and real-time fMRI. For long-running jobs or large memory needs we provide detailed guidance on high-performance computing clusters. These notebooks were successfully tested at multiple sites, including as problem sets for courses at Yale and Princeton universities and at various workshops and hackathons. These materials are freely shared, with the hope that they become part of a pool of open-source software and educational materials for large-scale, reproducible fMRI analysis and accelerated discovery.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/oLWKbgzX3Gk" width="1" />

<p>by Christie A. Bahlai, Elise F. Zipkin</p>

Environmental factors interact with internal rules of population regulation, sometimes perturbing systems to alternate dynamics though changes in parameter values. Yet, pinpointing when such changes occur in naturally fluctuating populations is difficult. An algorithmic approach that can identify the timing and magnitude of parameter shifts would facilitate understanding of abrupt ecological transitions with potential to inform conservation and management of species. The “Dynamic Shift Detector” is an algorithm to identify changes in parameter values governing temporal fluctuations in populations with nonlinear dynamics. The algorithm examines population time series data for the presence, location, and magnitude of parameter shifts. It uses an iterative approach to fitting subsets of time series data, then ranks the fit of break point combinations using model selection, assigning a relative weight to each break. We examined the performance of the Dynamic Shift Detector with simulations and two case studies. Under low environmental/sampling noise, the break point sets selected by the Dynamic Shift Detector contained the true simulated breaks with 70–100% accuracy. The weighting tool generally assigned breaks intentionally placed in simulated data (i.e., true breaks) with weights averaging &gt;0.8 and those due to sampling error (i.e., erroneous breaks) with weights averaging &lt;0.2. In our case study examining an invasion process, the algorithm identified shifts in population cycling associated with variations in resource availability. The shifts identified for the conservation case study highlight a decline process that generally coincided with changing management practices affecting the availability of hostplant resources. When interpreted in the context of species biology, the Dynamic Shift Detector algorithm can aid management decisions and identify critical time periods related to species’ dynamics. In an era of rapid global change, such tools can provide key insights into the conditions under which population parameters, and their corresponding dynamics, can shift.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/pv4TenRPku0" width="1" />

Abstract
<p>The preBötzinger complex (preBötC) generates the rhythm and rudimentary motor pattern for inspiratory breathing movements. Here, we test "burstlet" theory (Kam et al., 2013a), which posits that low amplitude burstlets, subthreshold from the standpoint of inspiratory bursts, reflect the fundamental oscillator of the preBötC. In turn, a discrete suprathreshold process transforms burstlets into full amplitude inspiratory bursts that drive motor output, measurable via hypoglossal nerve (XII) discharge <i>in vitro</i>. We recap observations by Kam and Feldman in neonatal mouse slice preparations: field recordings from preBötC demonstrate bursts and concurrent XII motor output intermingled with lower amplitude burstlets that do not produce XII motor output. Manipulations of excitability affect the relative prevalence of bursts and burstlets and modulate their frequency. Whole-cell and photonic recordings of preBötC neurons suggest that burstlets involve inconstant subsets of rhythmogenic interneurons. We conclude that discrete rhythm- and pattern-generating mechanisms coexist in the preBötC and that burstlets reflect its fundamental rhythmogenic nature.</p>

Abstract
<p>For humans, visual tracking of moving stimuli often triggers catch-up saccades during smooth pursuit. The switch between these continuous and discrete eye movements is a trade-off between tolerating sustained position error (PE) when no saccade is triggered or a transient loss of vision during the saccade due to saccadic suppression. de Brouwer et al. (2002b) demonstrated that catch-up saccades were less likely to occur when the target re-crosses the fovea within 40–180 ms. To date, there is no mechanistic explanation for how the trigger decision is made by the brain. Recently, we proposed a stochastic decision model for saccade triggering during visual tracking (Coutinho et al., 2018) that relies on a probabilistic estimate of predicted PE (PE<sub>pred</sub>). Informed by model predictions, we hypothesized that saccade trigger time length and variability will increase when pre-saccadic predicted errors are small or visual uncertainty is high (e.g., for blurred targets). Data collected from human participants performing a double step-ramp task showed that large pre-saccadic PE<sub>pred</sub> (&gt;10°) produced short saccade trigger times regardless of the level of uncertainty while saccade trigger times preceded by small PE<sub>pred</sub> (&lt;10°) significantly increased in length and variability, and more so for blurred targets. Our model also predicted increased signal-dependent noise (SDN) as retinal slip (RS) increases; in our data, this resulted in longer saccade trigger times and more smooth trials without saccades. In summary, our data supports our hypothesized predicted error-based decision process for coordinating saccades during smooth pursuit.</p>

<p>Impaired mitochondrial function and aberrant neuronal network activity are believed to be early events in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), but how mitochondrial alterations contribute to aberrant activity in neuronal circuits is unknown. In this study, we examined the function of mitochondrial protein deacetylase sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) in the pathogenesis of AD. Compared with AppPs1 mice, Sirt3-haploinsufficient AppPs1 mice (Sirt3<sup>+/–</sup>AppPs1) exhibit early epileptiform EEG activity and seizure. Both male and female Sirt3<sup>+/–</sup>AppPs1 mice were observed to die prematurely before 5 months of age. When comparing male mice among different genotypes, Sirt3 haploinsufficiency renders GABAergic interneurons in the cerebral cortex vulnerable to degeneration and associated neuronal network hyperexcitability. Feeding Sirt3<sup>+/–</sup>AppPs1 AD mice with a ketone ester-rich diet increases SIRT3 expression and prevents seizure-related death and the degeneration of GABAergic neurons, indicating that the aggravated GABAergic neuron loss and neuronal network hyperexcitability in Sirt3<sup>+/–</sup>AppPs1 mice are caused by SIRT3 reduction and can be rescued by increase of SIRT3 expression. Consistent with a protective role in AD, SIRT3 levels are reduced in association with cerebral cortical Aβ pathology in AD patients. In summary, SIRT3 preserves GABAergic interneurons and protects cerebral circuits against hyperexcitability, and this neuroprotective mechanism can be bolstered by dietary ketone esters.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> GABAergic neurons provide the main inhibitory control of neuronal activity in the brain. By preserving mitochondrial function, SIRT3 protects parvalbumin and calretinin interneurons against Aβ-associated dysfunction and degeneration in AppPs1 Alzheimer's disease mice, thus restraining neuronal network hyperactivity. The neuronal network dysfunction that occurs in Alzheimer's disease can be partially reversed by physiological, dietary, and pharmacological interventions to increase SIRT3 expression and enhance the functionality of GABAergic interneurons.</p>

<p>Memory deficits are common in epilepsy patients. In these patients, the interictal EEG commonly shows interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs). While IEDs are associated with transient cognitive impairments, it remains poorly understood why this is. We investigated the effects of human (male and female) hippocampal IEDs on single-neuron activity during a memory task in patients with medically refractory epilepsy undergoing depth electrode monitoring. We quantified the effects of hippocampal IEDs on single-neuron activity and the impact of this modulation on subjectively declared memory strength. Across all recorded neurons, the activity of 50 of 728 neurons were significantly modulated by IEDs, with the strongest modulation in the medial temporal lobe (33 of 416) and in particular the right hippocampus (12 of 58). Putative inhibitory neurons, as identified by their extracellular signature, were more likely to be modulated by IEDs than putative excitatory neurons (19 of 157 vs 31 of 571). Behaviorally, the occurrence of hippocampal IEDs was accompanied by a disruption of recognition of familiar images only if they occurred up to 2 s before stimulus onset. In contrast, IEDs did not impair encoding or recognition of novel images, indicating high temporal and task specificity of the effects of IEDs. The degree of modulation of individual neurons by an IED correlated with the declared confidence of a retrieval trial, with higher firing rates indicative of reduced confidence. Together, these data link the transient modulation of individual neurons by IEDs to specific declarative memory deficits in specific cell types, thereby revealing a mechanism by which IEDs disrupt medial temporal lobe-dependent declarative memory retrieval processes.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) are thought to be a cause of memory deficits in chronic epilepsy patients, but the underlying mechanisms are not understood. Utilizing single-neuron recordings in epilepsy patients, we found that hippocampal IEDs transiently change firing of hippocampal neurons and disrupted selectively the retrieval, but not encoding, of declarative memories. The extent of the modulation of the individual firing of hippocampal neurons by an IED predicted the extent of reduction of subjective retrieval confidence. Together, these data reveal a specific kind of transient cognitive impairment caused by IEDs and link this impairment to the modulation of the activity of individual neurons. Understanding the mechanisms by which IEDs impact memory is critical for understanding memory impairments in epilepsy patients.</p>

<p>It is unclear to what extent sensory processing areas are involved in the maintenance of sensory information in working memory (WM). Previous studies have thus far relied on finding neural activity in the corresponding sensory cortices, neglecting potential activity-silent mechanisms, such as connectivity-dependent encoding. It has recently been found that visual stimulation during visual WM maintenance reveals WM-dependent changes through a bottom-up neural response. Here, we test whether this impulse response is uniquely visual and sensory-specific. Human participants (both sexes) completed visual and auditory WM tasks while electroencephalography was recorded. During the maintenance period, the WM network was perturbed serially with fixed and task-neutral auditory and visual stimuli. We show that a neutral auditory impulse-stimulus presented during the maintenance of a pure tone resulted in a WM-dependent neural response, providing evidence for the auditory counterpart to the visual WM findings reported previously. Interestingly, visual stimulation also resulted in an auditory WM-dependent impulse response, implicating the visual cortex in the maintenance of auditory information, either directly or indirectly, as a pathway to the neural auditory WM representations elsewhere. In contrast, during visual WM maintenance, only the impulse response to visual stimulation was content-specific, suggesting that visual information is maintained in a sensory-specific neural network, separated from auditory processing areas.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Working memory is a crucial component of intelligent, adaptive behavior. Our understanding of the neural mechanisms that support it has recently shifted: rather than being dependent on an unbroken chain of neural activity, working memory may rely on transient changes in neuronal connectivity, which can be maintained efficiently in activity-silent brain states. Previous work using a visual impulse stimulus to perturb the memory network has implicated such silent states in the retention of line orientations in visual working memory. Here, we show that auditory working memory similarly retains auditory information. We also observed a sensory-specific impulse response in visual working memory, while auditory memory responded bimodally to both visual and auditory impulses, possibly reflecting visual dominance of working memory.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/40/3/661?rss=1">Dopamine-Dependent Loss Aversion during Effort-Based Decision-Making</a></h4>

<p>From psychology to economics, there has been substantial interest in how costs (e.g., delay, risk) are represented asymmetrically during decision-making when attempting to gain reward or avoid punishment. For example, in decision-making under risk, individuals show a tendency to prefer to avoid punishment rather than to acquire the equivalent reward (loss aversion). Although the cost of physical effort has recently received significant attention, it remains unclear whether loss aversion exists during effort-based decision-making. On the one hand, loss aversion may be hardwired due to asymmetric evolutionary pressure on losses and gains and therefore exists across decision-making contexts. On the other hand, distinct brain regions are involved with different decision costs, making it questionable whether similar asymmetries exist. Here, we demonstrate that young healthy human participants (females, 16; males, 6) exhibit loss aversion during effort-based decision-making by exerting more physical effort to avoid punishment than to gain a same-size reward. Next, we show that medicated Parkinson's disease (PD) patients (females, 9; males, 9) show a reduction in loss aversion compared with age-matched control subjects (females, 11; males, 9). Behavioral and computational analysis revealed that people with PD exerted similar physical effort in return for a reward but were less willing to produce effort to avoid punishment. Therefore, loss aversion is present during effort-based decision-making and can be modulated by altered dopaminergic state. This finding could have important implications for our understanding of clinical disorders that show a reduced willingness to exert effort in the pursuit of reward.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Loss aversion—preferring to avoid punishment rather than to acquire equivalent reward—is an important concept in decision-making under risk. However, little is known about whether loss aversion also exists during decisions where the cost is physical effort. This is surprising given that motor cost shapes human behavior, and a reduced willingness to exert effort is a characteristic of many clinical disorders. Here, we show that healthy human individuals exert more effort to minimize punishment than to maximize reward (loss aversion). We also demonstrate that medicated Parkinson's disease patients exert similar effort to gain reward but less effort to avoid punishment when compared with healthy age-matched control subjects. This indicates that dopamine-dependent loss aversion is crucial for explaining effort-based decision-making.</p>

<p>Visual systems have evolved to recognize and extract features from complex scenes using limited sensory information. Contour perception is essential to this process and can occur despite breaks in the continuity of neighboring features. Such robustness of the animal visual system to degraded or occluded shapes may also give rise to an interesting phenomenon of optical illusions. These illusions provide a great opportunity to decipher neural computations underlying contour integration and object detection. Kanizsa illusory contours have been shown to evoke responses in the early visual cortex despite the lack of direct receptive field activation. Recurrent processing between visual areas has been proposed to be involved in this process. However, it is unclear whether higher visual areas directly contribute to the generation of illusory responses in the early visual cortex. Using behavior, <i>in vivo</i> electrophysiology, and optogenetics, we first show that the primary visual cortex (V1) of male mice responds to Kanizsa illusory contours. Responses to Kanizsa illusions emerge later than the responses to the contrast-defined real contours in V1. Second, we demonstrate that illusory responses are orientation-selective. Finally, we show that top-down feedback controls the neural correlates of illusory contour perception in V1. Our results suggest that higher-order visual areas may fill in the missing information in the early visual cortex necessary for illusory contour perception.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Perception of the Kanizsa illusory contours is impaired in neurodevelopmental disorders such as schizophrenia, autism, and Williams syndrome. However, the mechanism of the illusory contour perception is poorly understood. Here we describe the behavioral and neural correlates of Kanizsa illusory contours perception in mice, a genetically tractable model system. We show that top-down feedback controls the neural responses to Kanizsa illusion in V1. To our knowledge, this is the first description of the neural correlates of the Kanizsa illusion in mice and the first causal demonstration of their regulation by top-down feedback.</p>

<p>The central nucleus of the amygdala plays a significant role in alcohol use and other affective disorders; however, the genetically-defined neuronal subtypes and projections that govern these behaviors are not well known. Here we show that neurotensin neurons in the central nucleus of the amygdala of male mice are activated by <i>in vivo</i> ethanol consumption and that genetic ablation of these neurons decreases ethanol consumption and preference in non-ethanol-dependent animals. This ablation did not impact preference for sucrose, saccharin, or quinine. We found that the most robust projection of the central amygdala neurotensin neurons was to the parabrachial nucleus, a brain region known to be important in feeding behaviors, conditioned taste aversion, and alarm. Optogenetic stimulation of projections from these neurons to the parabrachial nucleus is reinforcing, and increases ethanol drinking as well as consumption of sucrose and saccharin solutions. These data suggest that this central amygdala to parabrachial nucleus projection influences the expression of reward-related phenotypes and is a novel circuit promoting consumption of ethanol and palatable fluids.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a major health burden worldwide. Although ethanol consumption is required for the development of AUD, much remains unknown regarding the underlying neural circuits that govern initial ethanol intake. Here we show that ablation of a population of neurotensin-expressing neurons in the central amygdala decreases intake of and preference for ethanol in non-dependent animals, whereas the projection of these neurons to the parabrachial nucleus promotes consumption of ethanol as well as other palatable fluids.</p>

<p>The activity of neurons is determined by the balance between their excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs. Neurons in the avian nucleus magnocellularis (NM) integrate monosynaptic excitatory and polysynaptic inhibitory inputs from the auditory nerve, and transmit phase-locked output to higher auditory centers. The excitatory input is graded tonotopically, such that neurons tuned to higher frequency receive fewer, but larger, axon terminals. However, it remains unknown how the balance between excitatory and inhibitory inputs is determined in NM. We here examined synaptic and spike responses of NM neurons during stimulation of the auditory nerve in thick brain slices of chicken of both sexes, and found that the excitatory–inhibitory balance varied according to tonotopic region, ensuring reliable spike output across frequencies. Auditory nerve stimulation elicited IPSCs in NM neurons regardless of tonotopic region, but the dependence of IPSCs on intensity varied in a systematic way. In neurons tuned to low frequency, IPSCs appeared and increased in parallel with EPSCs with elevation of intensity, which expanded dynamic range by preventing saturation of spike generation. On the other hand, in neurons tuned to higher frequency, IPSCs were smaller than EPSCs and had higher thresholds for activation, thus facilitating high-fidelity transmission. Computer simulation confirmed that these differences in inhibitory input were optimally matched to the patterns of excitatory input, and enabled appropriate level of neuronal output for wide intensity and frequency ranges of sound in the auditory system.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Neurons in nucleus magnocellularis encode timing information of sound across wide intensity ranges by integrating excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs from the auditory nerve, but underlying synaptic mechanisms of this integration are not fully understood. We here show that the excitatory–inhibitory relationship was expressed differentially at each tonotopic region; the relationship was linear in neurons tuned to low-frequency, expanding dynamic range by preventing saturation of spike generation; by contrast inhibitory input remained much smaller than excitatory input in neurons tuned to higher frequency, thus ensuring high-fidelity transmission. The tonotopic regulation of excitatory and inhibitory input optimized the output across frequencies and intensities, playing a fundamental role in the timing coding pathway in the auditory system.</p>

<p>Leading neuroscientific theories posit a central role for the functional integration of cortical areas in conscious states. Considerable evidence supporting this hypothesis is based on network changes during anesthesia, but it is unclear whether these changes represent state-related (conscious vs unconscious) or drug-related (anesthetic vs no anesthetic) effects. We recently demonstrated that carbachol delivery to prefrontal cortex (PFC) restored wakefulness despite continuous administration of the general anesthetic sevoflurane. By contrast, carbachol delivery to parietal cortex, or noradrenaline delivery to either prefrontal or parietal cortices, failed to restore wakefulness. Thus, carbachol-induced reversal of sevoflurane anesthesia represents a unique state that combines wakefulness with clinically relevant anesthetic concentrations in the brain. To differentiate the state-related and drug-related associations of cortical connectivity and dynamics, we analyzed the electroencephalographic data gathered from adult male Sprague Dawley rats during the aforementioned experiments for changes in functional cortical gamma connectivity (25–155 Hz), slow oscillations (0.5–1 Hz), and complexity (&lt;175 Hz). We show that higher gamma (85–155 Hz) connectivity is decreased (<i>p</i> ≤ 0.02) during sevoflurane anesthesia, an expected finding, but was not restored during wakefulness induced by carbachol delivery to PFC. Conversely, for rats in which wakefulness was not restored, the functional gamma connectivity remained reduced, but there was a significant decrease (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) in the power of slow oscillations and increase (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) in cortical complexity, which was similar to that observed during wakefulness induced after carbachol delivery to PFC. We conclude that the level of consciousness can be dissociated from cortical connectivity, oscillations, and dynamics.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Numerous theories of consciousness suggest that functional connectivity across the cortex is characteristic of the conscious state and is reduced during anesthesia. However, it is unknown whether the observed changes are state-related (conscious vs unconscious) or drug-related (drug vs no drug). We used a novel rat model in which cholinergic stimulation of PFC produced wakefulness despite continuous exposure to a general anesthetic. We demonstrate that, as expected, general anesthesia reduces connectivity. Surprisingly, the connectivity remains suppressed despite pharmacologically induced wakefulness in the presence of anesthetic, with restoration occurring only after the anesthetic is discontinued. Thus, whether an animal exhibits wakefulness or not can be dissociated from cortical connectivity, prompting a reevaluation of the role of connectivity in level of consciousness.</p>

<p>Study of the neural deficits caused by mismatched binocular vision in early childhood has predominantly focused on circuits in the primary visual cortex (V1). Recent evidence has revealed that neurons in mouse dorsolateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) can undergo rapid ocular dominance plasticity following monocular deprivation (MD). It remains unclear, however, whether the long-lasting deficits attributed to MD during the critical period originate in the thalamus. Using <i>in vivo</i> two-photon Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging of dLGN afferents in superficial layers of V1 in female and male mice, we demonstrate that 14 d MD during the critical period leads to a chronic loss of binocular dLGN inputs while sparing response strength and spatial acuity. Importantly, MD leads to profoundly mismatched visual tuning properties in remaining binocular dLGN afferents. Furthermore, MD impairs binocular modulation, reducing facilitation of responses of both binocular and monocular dLGN inputs during binocular viewing. As predicted by our findings in thalamic inputs, Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging from V1 neurons revealed spared spatial acuity but impaired binocularity in L4 neurons. V1 L2/3 neurons in contrast displayed deficits in both binocularity and spatial acuity. Our data demonstrate that critical-period MD produces long-lasting disruptions in binocular integration beginning in early binocular circuits in dLGN, whereas spatial acuity deficits first arise from circuits further downstream in V1. Our findings indicate that the development of normal binocular vision and spatial acuity depend upon experience-dependent refinement of distinct stages in the mammalian visual system.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Abnormal binocular vision and reduced acuity are hallmarks of amblyopia, a disorder that affects 2%–5% of the population. It is widely thought that the neural deficits underlying amblyopia begin in the circuits of primary visual cortex. Using <i>in vivo</i> two-photon calcium imaging of thalamocortical axons in mice, we show that depriving one eye of input during a critical period in development chronically impairs binocular integration in thalamic inputs to primary visual cortex. In contrast, visual acuity is spared in thalamic inputs. These findings shed new light on the role for developmental mechanisms in the thalamus in establishing binocular vision and may have critical implications for amblyopia.</p>

<p>Chronic stress induces anhedonia in susceptible but not resilient individuals, a phenomenon observed in humans as well as animal models, but the molecular mechanisms underlying susceptibility and resilience are not well understood. We hypothesized that the serotonergic system, which is implicated in stress, reward, and antidepressant therapy, may play a role. We found that plasticity of the serotonergic system contributes to the differential vulnerability to stress displayed by susceptible and resilient animals. Stress-induced anhedonia was assessed in adult male rats using social defeat and intracranial self-stimulation, while changes in serotonergic phenotype were investigated using immunohistochemistry and <i>in situ</i> hybridization. Susceptible, but not resilient, rats displayed an increased number of neurons expressing the biosynthetic enzyme for serotonin, tryptophan-hydroxylase-2 (TPH2), in the ventral subnucleus of the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRv). Further, a decrease in the number of DRv glutamatergic (VGLUT3+) neurons was observed in all stressed rats. This neurotransmitter plasticity is activity-dependent, as was revealed by chemogenetic manipulation of the central amygdala, a stress-sensitive nucleus that forms a major input to the DR. Activation of amygdalar corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH)+ neurons abolished the increase in DRv TPH2+ neurons and ameliorated stress-induced anhedonia in susceptible rats. These findings show that activation of amygdalar CRH+ neurons induces resilience, and suppresses the gain of serotonergic phenotype in the DRv that is characteristic of susceptible rats. This molecular signature of vulnerability to stress-induced anhedonia and the active nature of resilience could be targeted to develop new treatments for stress-related disorders like depression.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Depression and other mental disorders can be induced by chronic or traumatic stressors. However, some individuals are resilient and do not develop depression in response to chronic stress. A complete picture of the molecular differences between susceptible and resilient individuals is necessary to understand how plasticity of limbic circuits is associated with the pathophysiology of stress-related disorders. Using a rodent model, our study identifies a novel molecular marker of susceptibility to stress-induced anhedonia, a core symptom of depression, and a means to modulate it. These findings will guide further investigation into cellular and circuit mechanisms of resilience, and the development of new treatments for depression.</p>

<p>Mitochondria are important sources of energy, but they are also the target of cellular stress, toxin exposure, and aging-related injury. Persistent accumulation of damaged mitochondria has been implicated in many neurodegenerative diseases. One highly conserved mechanism to clear damaged mitochondria involves the E3 ubiquitin ligase Parkin and PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1), which cooperatively initiate the process called mitophagy that identifies and eliminates damaged mitochondria through the autophagosome and lysosome pathways. Parkin is a mostly cytosolic protein, but is rapidly recruited to damaged mitochondria and target them for mitophagy. Moreover, Parkin interactomes also involve signaling pathways and transcriptional machinery critical for survival and cell death. However, the mechanism that regulates Parkin protein level remains poorly understood. Here, we show that the loss of homeodomain interacting protein kinase 2 (HIPK2) in neurons and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) has a broad protective effect from cell death induced by mitochondrial toxins. The mechanism by which <i>Hipk2</i><sup>–/–</sup> neurons and MEFs are more resistant to mitochondrial toxins is in part due to the role of HIPK2 and its kinase activity in promoting Parkin degradation via the proteasome-mediated mechanism. The loss of HIPK2 leads to higher cytosolic Parkin protein levels at basal conditions and upon exposure to mitochondrial toxins, which protects mitochondria from toxin-induced damage. In addition, <i>Hipk2</i><sup>–/–</sup> neurons and MEFs show increased expression of PGC-1α (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor- coactivator 1), a Parkin downstream target that can provide additional benefits via transcriptional activation of mitochondrial genes. Together, these results reveal a previously unrecognized avenue to target HIPK2 in neuroprotection via the Parkin-mediated pathway.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> In this study, we provide evidence that homeodomain interacting protein kinase 2 (HIPK2) and its kinase activity promote Parkin degradation via the proteasome-mediated pathway. The loss of HIPK2 increases cytosolic and mitochondrial Parkin protein levels under basal conditions and upon exposure to mitochondrial toxins, which protect mitochondria from toxin-induced damage. In addition, <i>Hipk2</i><sup>–/–</sup> neurons and mouse embryonic fibroblasts also show increased expression of PGC-1α (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor- coactivator 1), a Parkin downstream target that can provide additional benefits via transcriptional activation of mitochondrial genes. These results indicate that targeting HIPK2 and its kinase activity can have neuroprotective effects by elevating Parkin protein levels.</p>

<p>Synapse formation, maturation, and turnover require a finely regulated transport system that delivers selected cargos to specific synapses. However, the supporting mechanisms of this process are not fully understood. The present study unravels a new molecular system for vesicle-based axonal transport of proteins in male and female flies (<i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>). Here, we identify the gene <i>CG14579</i> as the transcription unit corresponding to the regulatory mutations known as <i>central complex broad</i> (<i>ccb</i>). These mutations were previously isolated for their morphological phenotype in R-neurons of the ellipsoid body, a component of the central complex. Mutant axons from R-neurons fail to cross the midline, which is indicative of an aberrant composition of the growth cone. However, the molecular mechanism remained to be deciphered. In this manuscript, we show that CCB is involved in axonal trafficking of FasII and synaptobrevin, but not syntaxin. These results suggest that axonal transport of certain proteins is required for the correct pathfinding of R-neurons. We further investigated the molecular network supporting the CCB system and found that CCB colocalizes and coimmunoprecipitates with Rab11. Epistasis studies indicated that Rab11 is positioned downstream of CCB within this axonal transport system. Interestingly, <i>ccb</i> also interacts with actin and the actin nucleator <i>spire</i>. The data revealed that this interaction plays a key role in the development of axonal connections within the ellipsoid body. We propose that the CCB/Rab11/SPIRE system regulates axonal trafficking of synaptic proteins required for proper connectivity and synaptic function.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Proper function of the nervous system requires the establishment of mature, functional synapses. Differential protein composition in the synapse enables optimal performance of cognitive tasks. Therefore, it is critical to have a finely regulated transport system to deliver selected synaptic proteins to synapses. Remarkably, impairments in cytoskeleton-based protein-transport systems often underlie cognitive deficits, such as those associated with aging and neurodegenerative diseases. This study reveals that CCB is part of a novel transport system that delivers certain synaptic proteins via the actin cytoskeleton within the Rab11-related domain of slow recycling endosomes.</p>

<p>Neuronal dendrites have specialized actin-rich structures called dendritic spines that receive and integrate most excitatory synaptic inputs. The stabilization of dendrites and spines during neuronal maturation is essential for proper neural circuit formation. Changes in dendritic morphology and stability are largely mediated by regulation of the actin cytoskeleton; however, the underlying mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated. Here, we present evidence that the nebulin family members LASP1 and LASP2 play an important role in the postsynaptic development of rat hippocampal neurons from both sexes. We find that both LASP1 and LASP2 are enriched in dendritic spines, and their knockdown impairs spine development and synapse formation. Furthermore, LASP2 exerts a distinct role in dendritic arbor and dendritic spine stabilization. Importantly, the actin-binding N-terminal LIM domain and nebulin repeats of LASP2 are required for spine stability and dendritic arbor complexity. These findings identify LASP1 and LASP2 as novel regulators of neuronal circuitry.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Proper regulation of the actin cytoskeleton is essential for the structural stability of dendrites and dendritic spines. Consequently, the malformation of dendritic structures accompanies numerous neurologic disorders, such as schizophrenia and autism. Nebulin family members are best known for their role in regulating the stabilization and function of actin thin filaments in muscle. The two smallest family members, LASP1 and LASP2, are more structurally diverse and are expressed in a broader array of tissues. While both LASP1 and LASP2 are highly expressed in the brain, little is currently known about their function in the nervous system. In this study, we demonstrate the first evidence that LASP1 and LASP2 are involved in the formation and long-term maintenance of dendrites and dendritic spines.</p>

<p>Medial olivocochlear (MOC) efferent neurons in the brainstem comprise the final stage of descending control of the mammalian peripheral auditory system through axon projections to the cochlea. MOC activity adjusts cochlear gain and frequency tuning, and protects the ear from acoustic trauma. The neuronal pathways that activate and modulate the MOC somata in the brainstem to drive these cochlear effects are poorly understood. Evidence suggests that MOC neurons are primarily excited by sound stimuli in a three-neuron activation loop from the auditory nerve via an intermediate neuron in the cochlear nucleus. Anatomical studies suggest that MOC neurons receive diverse synaptic inputs, but the functional effect of additional synaptic influences on MOC neuron responses is unknown. Here we use patch-clamp electrophysiological recordings from identified MOC neurons in brainstem slices from mice of either sex to demonstrate that in addition to excitatory glutamatergic synapses, MOC neurons receive inhibitory GABAergic and glycinergic synaptic inputs. These synapses are activated by electrical stimulation of axons near the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB). Focal glutamate uncaging confirms MNTB neurons as a source of inhibitory synapses onto MOC neurons. MNTB neurons inhibit MOC action potentials, but this effect depresses with repeat activation. This work identifies a new pathway of connectivity between brainstem auditory neurons and indicates that MOC neurons are both excited and inhibited by sound stimuli received at the same ear. The pathway depression suggests that the effect of MNTB inhibition of MOC neurons diminishes over the course of a sustained sound.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Medial olivocochlear (MOC) neurons are the final stage of descending control of the mammalian auditory system and exert influence on cochlear mechanics to modulate perception of acoustic stimuli. The brainstem pathways that drive MOC function are poorly understood. Here we show for the first time that MOC neurons are inhibited by neurons of the MNTB, which may suppress the effects of MOC activity on the cochlea.</p>

<p>Computations that require speed and temporal precision are implemented throughout the nervous system by neurons capable of firing at very high rates, rapidly encoding and transmitting a rich amount of information, but with substantial metabolic and physical costs. For economical fast spiking and high throughput information processing, neurons need to optimize multiple biophysical properties in parallel, but the mechanisms of this coordination remain unknown. We hypothesized that coordinated gene expression may underlie the coordinated tuning of the biophysical properties required for rapid firing and signal transmission. Taking advantage of the diversity of fast-spiking cell types in the medial vestibular nucleus of mice of both sexes, we examined the relationship between gene expression, ionic currents, and neuronal firing capacity. Across excitatory and inhibitory cell types, genes encoding voltage-gated ion channels responsible for depolarizing and repolarizing the action potential were tightly coexpressed, and their absolute expression levels increased with maximal firing rate. Remarkably, this coordinated gene expression extended to neurofilaments and specific presynaptic molecules, providing a mechanism for coregulating axon caliber and transmitter release to match firing capacity. These findings suggest the presence of a module of genes, which is coexpressed in a graded manner and jointly tunes multiple biophysical properties for economical differentiation of firing capacity. The graded tuning of fast-spiking capacity by the absolute expression levels of specific ion channels provides a counterexample to the widely held assumption that cell-type-specific firing patterns can be achieved via a vast combination of different ion channels.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Although essential roles of fast-spiking neurons in various neural circuits have been widely recognized, it remains unclear how neurons efficiently coordinate the multiple biophysical properties required to maintain high rates of action potential firing and transmitter release. Taking advantage of diverse fast-firing capacities among medial vestibular nucleus neurons of mice, we identify a group of ion channel, synaptic, and structural genes that exhibit mutually correlated expression levels, which covary with firing capacity. Coexpression of this fast-spiking gene module may be a basic strategy for neurons to efficiently and coordinately tune the speed of action potential generation and propagation and transmitter release at presynaptic terminals.</p>

ABSTRACT<p>α-Synuclein overexpression and aggregation are linked to Parkinson’s disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and several other neurodegenerative disorders. In addition to effects in the cell body, α-synuclein accumulation occurs at presynapses where the protein is normally localized. While it is generally agreed that excess α-synuclein impairs synaptic vesicle trafficking, the underlying mechanisms are unknown. We show here that acute introduction of excess human α-synuclein at a classic vertebrate synapse, the lamprey reticulospinal synapse, selectively impaired the uncoating of clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs) during synaptic vesicle recycling, leading to an increase in endocytic intermediates and a severe depletion of synaptic vesicles. Furthermore, human α-synuclein and lamprey -synuclein both interact <i>in vitro</i> with Hsc70, the chaperone protein that uncoats CCVs at synapses. After introducing excess α-synuclein to the giant axons of lampreys (males and females), Hsc70 availability was reduced at stimulated synapses, suggesting Hsc70 sequestration as a possible mechanism underlying the synaptic vesicle trafficking defects. In support of this hypothesis, increasing the levels of exogenous Hsc70 along with α-synuclein ameliorated the CCV uncoating and vesicle recycling defects. These experiments identify a reduction in Hsc70 availability at synapses, and consequently its function, as the mechanism by which α-synuclein induces synaptic vesicle recycling defects. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a viable chaperone-based strategy for reversing the synaptic vesicle trafficking defects associated with excess α-synuclein, which may be of value for improving synaptic function in PD and other synuclein-linked diseases.</p><p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Synaptic defects caused by α-synuclein overexpression are linked to cognitive deficits in PD and other diseases.

Abstract<p>Estrogen and progesterone act in neural circuits to elicit lordosis, the stereotypical female sexual receptivity behavior. Estradiol acts through membrane receptors to rapidly activate a limbic-hypothalamic circuit consisting of the arcuate (ARH), medial preoptic (MPN), and ventromedial nuclei of the hypothalamus. This initial activation results in a transient but necessary inhibition of lordosis, which appears to be a result of the release of beta-endorphin (β-End) from proopiomelanocortin (POMC) terminals onto cells containing the µ-opioid receptor (MOR) in the MPN. To functionally examine the role of the MOR in the hypothalamic lordosis circuit, we transfected a channelrhodopsin (ChR2) adeno-associated virus into POMC cell bodies in the ARH and photostimulated POMC/β-End axon terminals in the MPN in sexually receptive female Pomc-cre mice. Following estrogen and progesterone priming, sexual receptivity was assessed by measuring the lordosis quotient. Following an initial trial for sexual receptivity, mice were photostimulated during behavioral testing, and brains were processed for MOR immunohistochemistry. Photostimulation decreased the lordosis quotient only in ChR2-expressing Pomc-cre mice. Furthermore, photostimulation of ChR2 in POMC/β-End axon terminals in the MPN resulted in the internalization of MOR, indicating activation of the receptor. Our results suggest that the activation of the MOR in the MPN is sufficient to attenuate lordosis behavior in a hormone-primed, sexually receptive female mouse. These data support a central role of MOR in female sexual behavior, and provide further insight into the hypothalamus control of sexual receptivity.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> The µ-opioid receptor (MOR) has been shown to modify lordosis, the female sexual receptivity behavior. Estrogen and progesterone facilitate lordosis, though the initial effects of estradiol in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (ARH) inhibit the behavior through MOR activity in the medial preoptic nucleus (MPN). The present study uses optogenetics to directly stimulate proopiomelanocortin/beta-endorphin axonal terminals in the MPN in sexually receptive female mice to examine the effects of MOR activity on lordosis. Photostimulation of these terminals is sufficient to activate and internalize the MOR, and to attenuate lordosis behavior in otherwise sexually receptive mice. Our results provide further evidence of an ARH to MPN projection that, by activating MOR, is inhibitory to lordosis behavior.</p>

ABSTRACT<p>Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signals through its cognate receptor tropomyosin kinase B (TrkB) to promote the function of several classes of inhibitory interneurons. We previously reported that loss of BDNF-TrkB signaling in cortistatin-expressing (Cort) interneurons leads to behavioral hyperactivity and spontaneous seizures in mice. We performed bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) from the cortex of mice with disruption of BDNF-TrkB signaling in cortistatin interneurons, and identified differential expression of genes important for excitatory neuron function. Using translating ribosome affinity purification (TRAP) and RNA-seq, we define a molecular profile for Cort-expressing inhibitory neurons and subsequently compared the translatome of normal and TrkB-depleted Cort neurons, revealing alterations in calcium signaling and axon development. Several of the genes enriched in Cort neurons and differentially expressed in TrkB depleted neurons are also implicated in autism and epilepsy. Our findings highlight TrkB-dependent molecular pathways as critical for the maturation of inhibitory interneurons and support the hypothesis that loss of BDNF signaling in Cort interneurons leads to altered excitatory/inhibitory balance.</p><p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Mounting evidence suggests that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signals through its receptor TrkB to promote inhibitory interneuron function, including a sub-population of cortistatin-expressing (Cort) neurons. This study identifies how TrkB depletion in Cort neurons impacts the Cort interneuron transcriptome as well as gene expression in the surrounding cellular milieu of mouse cortex. Our findings highlight TrkB-dependent molecular pathways in the maturation of inhibitory interneurons and further implicate BDNF signaling as critical for regulating excitatory/inhibitory balance. We identified BDNF-regulation of a number of genes expressed in Cort neurons that are implicated in both autism and epilepsy, which is of note because these conditions are highly comorbid, and are hypothesized to share underlying molecular mechanisms.</p>

<p>Small dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons are primary nociceptors which are
responsible for sensing pain. Elucidation of their dynamics is essential for
understanding and controlling pain. To this end, we present a numerical
bifurcation analysis of a small DRG neuron model in this paper. The model is of
Hodgkin-Huxley type and has 9 state variables. It consists of a
Na$\mathrm{_v}$1.7 and a Na$\mathrm{_v}$1.8 sodium channel, a leak channel, a
delayed rectifier potassium and an A-type transient potassium channel. The
dynamics of this model strongly depends on the maximal conductances of the
voltage-gated ion channels and the external current, which can be adjusted
experimentally. We show that the neuron dynamics are most sensitive to the
Na$\mathrm{_v}$1.8 channel maximal conductance ($\bar{g}_{1.8}$). Numerical
bifurcation analysis shows that depending on $\bar{g}_{1.8}$ and the external
current, different parameter regions can be identified with stable steady
states, periodic firing of action potentials, mixed-mode oscillations (MMOs),
and bistability between stable steady states and stable periodic firing of
action potentials. We illustrate and discuss the transitions between these
different regimes. We further analyze the behavior of MMOs. Within this region,
bifurcation analysis shows a sequence of isolated periodic solution branches
with one large action potential and a number of small amplitude peaks per
period. A closer inspection reveals more complex concatenated MMOs in between
these periodic MMOs branches, forming Farey sequences. Lastly, we also find
small solution windows with aperiodic oscillations, which seem to be chaotic.
The dynamical patterns found here as a function of different parameters contain
information of translational importance as their relation to pain sensation and
its intensity is a potential source of insight into controlling pain.

<p>The fruit fly Drosophila's olfactory circuit has inspired a new locality
sensitive hashing (LSH) algorithm, FlyHash. In contrast with classical LSH
algorithms that produce low dimensional hash codes, FlyHash produces sparse
high-dimensional hash codes and has also been shown to have superior empirical
performance compared to classical LSH algorithms in similarity search. However,
FlyHash uses random projections and cannot learn from data. Building on
inspiration from FlyHash and the ubiquity of sparse expansive representations
in neurobiology, our work proposes a novel hashing algorithm BioHash that
produces sparse high dimensional hash codes in a data-driven manner. We show
that BioHash outperforms previously published benchmarks for various hashing
methods. Since our learning algorithm is based on a local and biologically
plausible synaptic plasticity rule, our work provides evidence for the proposal
that LSH might be a computational reason for the abundance of sparse expansive
motifs in a variety of biological systems. We also propose a convolutional
variant BioConvHash that further improves performance. From the perspective of
computer science, BioHash and BioConvHash are fast, scalable and yield
compressed binary representations that are useful for similarity search.

<p>An open question in systems and computational neuroscience is how neural
circuits accumulate evidence towards a decision. Fitting models of
decision-making theory to neural activity helps answer this question, but
current approaches limit the number of these models that we can fit to neural
data. Here we propose a unifying framework for modeling neural activity during
decision-making tasks. The framework includes the canonical drift-diffusion
model and enables extensions such as multi-dimensional accumulators, variable
and collapsing boundaries, and discrete jumps. Our framework is based on
constraining the parameters of recurrent state-space models, for which we
introduce a scalable variational Laplace-EM inference algorithm. We applied the
modeling approach to spiking responses recorded from monkey parietal cortex
during two decision-making tasks. We found that a two-dimensional accumulator
better captured the trial-averaged responses of a set of parietal neurons than
a single accumulator model. Next, we identified a variable lower boundary in
the responses of an LIP neuron during a random dot motion task.

<p>A mid-thoracic spinal cord injury (SCI) severely impairs activation of the lower limb sensorimotor spinal networks, leading to paralysis. Various neuromodulatory techniques including electrical and pharmacological activation of the spinal networks have been successful in restoring locomotor function after SCI. We hypothesized that the combination of self-training in a natural environment with epidural stimulation (ES), quipazine (Quip), and strychnine (Strych) would result in greater activity in a cage environment after paralysis compared to either intervention alone. To assess this, we developed a method measuring and characterizing the chronic EMG recordings from tibialis anterior (TA) and soleus (Sol) muscles while rats were freely moving in their home cages. We then assessed the relationship between the change in recorded activity over time and motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) in animals receiving treatments. We found that the combination of ES, Quip, and Strych (sqES) generated the greatest level of recovery followed by ES + Quip (qES) while ES + Strych (sES) and ES alone showed least improvement in recorded activity. Further, we observed an exponential relationship between late response (LR) component of the MEPs and spontaneously generated step-like activity. Our data demonstrate the feasibility and potential importance of quantitatively monitoring mechanistic factors linked to activity-dependence in response to combinatorial interventions compared to individual therapies after SCI.</p>

<p>The efficacy of neocortical synapses to transmit during bursts of action potentials (APs) increases during development but the underlying mechanisms are largely unclear. We investigated synaptic efficacy at synapses between layer 5 pyramidal neurons (L5PNs) during development, using paired recordings, presynaptic two-photon Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging, and numerical simulations. Our data confirm a developmental increase in paired-pulse ratios (PPRs). Independent of age, Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging revealed no AP invasion failures and linear summation of presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients, making differences in Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling an unlikely reason for developmental changes in PPR. Cumulative excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) amplitudes indicate that neither the size of the readily-releasable pool (RRP) nor replenishment rates were different between age groups, while the time-courses of depression differed significantly. At young synapses, EPSCs depressed rapidly to near steady-state during the first four APs, and synaptic failures (F<sub>syn</sub>) increased from 0 to 30%. At mature synapses this drop was significantly slower and strongly biphasic, such that near steady-state depression was reached not before 18 APs with F<sub>syn</sub> remaining between 0 and 5%. While young synapses reliably transmitted during pairs of APs, albeit with strong depression, mature synapses maintained near 100% transfer efficacy with significantly less depression during high-frequency bursts of APs. Our analysis indicates that at mature synapses a replenishment pool (RepP) is responsible for their high efficacy during bursting activity, while this RepP is functionally immature at young synapses. Hence, our data provide evidence that the functional maturation of a RepP underlies increasing synaptic efficacy during the development of an excitatory cortical synapse.</p>

<p>To clarify the different regional brain electroencephalogram (EEG) activities and biochemical responses in seizure and epilepsy models, we assessed the EEG and c-Fos immunolabeling characteristics in a lithium-pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (SE) model and pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced seizure model. The regional brain activities were evaluated by EEG and c-Fos immunolabeling. ZnT3 immunostaining was performed to observe hippocampal mossy fiber sprouting (MFS) within 7 days after the induction of SE in the lithium-pilocarpine model. The EEG recordings showed distinctive features of activation in different brain areas. With the aggravation of the behavioral manifestations of the seizures, the frequency and amplitude of the discharges on EEG gradually increased. SE was eventually induced and sustained. The labeling of c-Fos was enhanced in the cortex and hippocampal CA1, CA3, and dentate gyrus (DG); however, compared to the PTZ-induced seizure model, c-Fos staining could only be observed in the striatum and thalamus in the lithium-pilocarpine-induced epilepsy model. In each brain region, prominent c-Fos labeling was observed 2 h and 4 h after the induction of SE or seizures and diminished at 24 h. During the lithium-pilocarpine-induced chronic epilepsy phase after SE induction, MFS was observed 7 days after SE and was accompanied by the dynamic evolution of epileptic EEG activities. These findings validated the lithium-pilocarpine-induced SE model as an epilepsy model with a specific spatial-temporal profile of neural activation. The EEG characteristics and c-Fos expression patterns differ from those presented in a previous study using a PTZ-induced seizure model. Hippocampal mossy fiber spouting might be associated with spontaneous seizures during the chronic phase and can be detected at least within 1 week by ZnT3 staining after stimulation.</p>

<p>Hair cells sense and transmit auditory, vestibular, and hydrodynamic information by converting mechanical stimuli into electrical signals. This process of mechano-electrical transduction (MET) requires a mechanically gated channel localized in the apical stereocilia of hair cells. In mice, lipoma HMGIC fusion partner-like 5 (LHFPL5) acts as an auxiliary subunit of the MET channel whose primary role is to correctly localize PCDH15 and TMC1 to the mechanotransduction complex. Zebrafish have two lhfpl5 genes (lhfpl5a and lhfpl5b), but their individual contributions to MET channel assembly and function have not been analyzed. Here we show that the zebrafish lhfpl5 genes are expressed in discrete populations of hair cells: lhfpl5a expression is restricted to auditory and vestibular hair cells in the inner ear, while lhfpl5b expression is specific to hair cells of the lateral line organ. Consequently, lhfpl5a mutants exhibit defects in auditory and vestibular function, while disruption of lhfpl5b affects hair cells only in the lateral line neuromasts. In contrast to previous reports in mice, localization of Tmc1 does not depend upon Lhfpl5 function in either the inner ear or lateral line organ. In both lhfpl5a and lhfpl5b mutants, GFP-tagged Tmc1 and Tmc2b proteins still localize to the stereocilia of hair cells. Using a stably integrated GFP-Lhfpl5a transgene, we show that the tip link cadherins Pcdh15a and Cdh23, along with the Myo7aa motor protein, are required for correct Lhfpl5a localization at the tips of stereocilia. Our work corroborates the evolutionarily conserved co-dependence between Lhfpl5 and Pcdh15, but also reveals novel requirements for Cdh23 and Myo7aa to correctly localize Lhfpl5a. In addition, our data suggest that targeting of Tmc1 and Tmc2b proteins to stereocilia in zebrafish hair cells occurs independently of Lhfpl5 proteins.</p>

<p>This study investigates the assessment of motor imagery (MI) ability in humans. Commonly, MI ability is measured through two methodologies: a self-administered questionnaire (MIQ-3) and the mental chronometry (MC), which measures the temporal discrepancy between the actual and the imagined motor tasks. However, both measures rely on subjects' self-assessment and do not use physiological measures. In this study, we propose a novel set of features extracted from the nonlinear dynamics of the eye gaze signal to discriminate between good and bad imagers. To this aim, we designed an experiment where twenty volunteers, categorized as good or bad imagers according to MC, performed three tasks: a motor task (MT), a visual Imagery task (VI), and a kinaesthetic Imagery task (KI). Throughout the experiment, the subjects' eye gaze was continuously monitored using an eye-tracking system. Eye gaze time series were analyzed through recurrence quantification analysis of the reconstructed phase space and compared between the two groups. Statistical results have shown how nonlinear eye behavior can express an inner dynamics of imagery mental process and may be used as a more objective and physiological-based measure of MI ability.</p>

<p>Untreated human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) depletes its host CD4 cells, ultimately leading to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). In brain, the HIV confines itself to astrocytes and microglia, the resident brain macrophages, but does not infect oligodendrocytes and neurons. Nonetheless, cognitive symptoms associated with HIV and AIDS are attributed to loss of axons and white matter damage. We used design-based stereology to estimate the numbers of neocortical neurons and glial cells (astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and microglia), in a series of 12 patients dying with AIDS before the era of retroviral treatments, and in 13 age-matched control brains. Relative to the control material, there was a 19% loss of neocortical neuron (p = 0.04) and a 29% reduction of oligodendrocytes (p = 0.003) in the patients with AIDS, whereas astrocyte and microglia numbers did not differ between patients and controls. Furthermore, we saw a 17% reduction in mean hemispheric volume in the AIDS group (p = 0.0015), which was driven by neocortical and white matter loss (p &lt; 0.05), while the archicortex, subcortical gray matter, and ventricular volumes were within normal limits. Our results confirm previous reports of neuronal loss in AIDS. The new finding of oligodendrocyte loss supports the proposal that HIV in the brain provokes demyelination and axonal dysfunction and suggests that remyelination treatment strategies may be beneficial to patients suffering from HIV-associated neurocognitive deficits.</p>

<p>Objective: Previous studies have shown that the performance of the famous face P300-speller was better than that of the classical row/column flashing P300-speller. Furthermore, in some studies, the brain was more active when responding to one's own face than to a famous face, and a self-face stimulus elicited larger amplitude event-related potentials (ERPs) than did a famous face. Thus, we aimed to study the role of the self-face paradigm on further improving the performance of the P300-speller system with the famous face P300-speller paradigm as the control paradigm.</p><p>Methods: We designed two facial P300-speller paradigms based on the self-face and a famous face (Ming Yao, a sports star; the famous face spelling paradigm) with a neutral expression.</p><p>Results: ERP amplitudes were significantly greater in the self-face than in the famous face spelling paradigm at the parietal area from 340 to 480 ms (P300), from 480 to 600 ms (P600f), and at the fronto-central area from 700 to 800 ms. Offline and online classification results showed that the self-face spelling paradigm accuracies were significantly higher than those of the famous face spelling paradigm at superposing first two times (P &lt; 0.05). Similar results were found for information transfer rates (P &lt; 0.05).</p><p>Conclusions: The self-face spelling paradigm significantly improved the performance of the P300-speller system. This has significant practical applications for brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) and could avoid infringement issues caused by using images of other people's faces.</p>

<p>Dynamic Functional Connectivity (DFC) analysis is a promising approach for the characterization of brain electrophysiological activity. In this study, we investigated abnormal alterations due to mild Traumatic Brain Injury (mTBI) using DFC of the source reconstructed magnetoencephalographic (MEG) resting-state recordings. Brain activity in several well-known frequency bands was first reconstructed using beamforming of the MEG data to determine ninety anatomical brain regions of interest. A DFC graph was formulated using the imaginary part of phase-locking values, which were obtained from 30 mTBI patients and 50 healthy controls (HC). Subsequently, we estimated normalized Laplacian transformations of individual, statistically and topologically filtered quasi-static graphs. The corresponding eigenvalues of each node synchronization were then computed and through the neural-gas algorithm, we quantized the evolution of the eigenvalues resulting in distinct network microstates (NMstates). The discrimination level between the two groups was assessed using an iterative cross-validation classification scheme with features either the NMstates in each frequency band, or the combination of the so-called chronnectomics (flexibility index, occupancy time of NMstate, and Dwell time) with the complexity index over the evolution of the NMstates across all frequency bands. Classification performance based on chronnectomics showed 80% accuracy, 99% sensitivity, and 49% specificity. However, performance was much higher (accuracy: 91–97%, sensitivity: 100%, and specificity: 77–93%) when focusing on the microstates. Exploring the mean node degree within and between brain anatomical networks (default mode network, frontoparietal, occipital, cingulo-opercular, and sensorimotor), a reduced pattern occurred from lower to higher frequency bands, with statistically significant stronger degrees for the HC than the mTBI group. A higher entropic profile on the temporal evolution of the modularity index was observed for both NMstates for the mTBI group across frequencies. A significant difference in the flexibility index was observed between the two groups for the β frequency band. The latter finding may support a central role of the thalamus impairment in mTBI. The current study considers a complete set of frequency-dependent connectomic markers of mTBI-caused alterations in brain connectivity that potentially could serve as markers to assess the return of an injured subject back to normality.</p>

<p>The function of triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-2 (TREM2) has been described within microglia with a beneficial activated phenotype. However, the role of TREM2 underlying microglial phenotypic alterations in the cross-tolerance protection of heat acclimation (HA) against the inflammatory stimuli electromagnetic field (EMF) exposure is less well known. Here, we investigated the TREM2-related signaling mechanism induced by HA in EMF-stimulated N9 microglial cells (N9 cells). We found that EMF exposure significantly increased the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6), and the expression of M1 markers (CD11b and CD86); meanwhile, decreased the levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4 and IL-10) and the expression of M2 markers (CD206 and Arg1) in N9 cells. Clearly, HA treatment decreased the secretion of TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 and the expression of CD11b and CD86, and enhanced the production of IL-4 and IL-10 and the expression of CD206 and Arg1. Moreover, TREM2 esiRNA and selective inhibitor of PI3K clearly decreased anti-inflammatory cytokines production, M2 markers expression, and phosphorylation of PI3K and Akt following HA plus EMF stimulation. These results indicate that TREM2 and PI3K-Akt pathway are involved in the cross-tolerance protective effect of HA in microglial polarization towards the EMF exposure. This finding inspires future studies that aim to explore the non-drug approaches underlying EMF stimulation and other central nervous system (CNS) inflammatory diseases.</p>

<p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and dyslexia are both neurodevelopmental disorders with high prevalence in children. Both disorders have strong genetic basis, and share similar social communication deficits co-occurring with impairments of reading or language. However, whether these two disorders share common genetic risks remain elusive. DOCK4 (dedicator for cytokinesis 4), a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for the small GTPase Rac1, is one of few genes that are associated with both ASD and dyslexia. Dock4 is important for neuronal development and social behaviors. Two DOCK4 variations, Exon27-52 deletion (protein product: Dock4-945VS) and a missense mutation at rs2074130 (protein product: Dock4-R853H), are associated with dyslexia and/or ASD with reading difficulties. The present study explores the molecular and cellular functions of these two DOCK4 variants on neuronal development, by comparing them with the wild-type Dock4 protein. Notably, it is revealed that both mutants of Dock4 showed decreased ability to activate not only Rac1, but also another small GTPase Rap1. Consistently, both mutants were dysfunctional for regulation of cell morphology and cytoskeleton. Using Neuro-2a cells and hippocampus neurons as models, we found that both mutants had compromised function in promoting neurite outgrowth and dendritic spine formation. Electrophysiological recordings further showed that R853H partially lost the ability to promote excitatory synaptic transmission, whereas 945VS totally lost the ability. Together, we identified R853 as a previously uncharacterized site for the regulation of the integrity of Dock4 function, and provides insights in understanding the common molecular pathophysiology of ASD and dyslexia.</p>

<p>Pharmacological treatment facilitating locomotor expression will also have some effects on reflex expression through the modulation of spinal circuitry. Buspirone, a partial serotonin receptor agonist (5-HT<sub>1</sub><sub>A</sub>), was recently shown to facilitate and even trigger locomotor movements in mice after complete spinal lesion (Tx). Here, we studied its effect on the H-reflex after acute Tx in adult mice. To avoid possible impacts of anesthetics on H-reflex depression, experiments were performed after decerebration in un-anesthetized mice (N = 20). The H-reflex in plantar muscles of the hind paw was recorded after tibial nerve stimulation 2 h after Tx at the 8th thoracic vertebrae and was compared before and every 10 min after buspirone (8 mg/kg, i.p.) for 60 min (N = 8). Frequency-dependent depression (FDD) of the H-reflex was assessed before and 60 min after buspirone. Before buspirone, a stable H-reflex could be elicited in acute spinal mice and FDD of the H-reflex was observed at 5 and 10 Hz relative to 0.2 Hz, FDD was still present 60 min after buspirone. Early after buspirone, the H-reflex was significantly decreased to 69% of pre-treatment, it then increased significantly 30–60 min after treatment, reaching 170% 60 min after injection. This effect was not observed in a control group (saline, N = 5) and was blocked when a 5-HT<sub>1</sub><sub>A</sub> antagonist (NAD-299) was administered with buspirone (N = 7). Altogether results suggest that the reported pro-locomotor effect of buspirone occurs at a time where there is a 5-HT<sub>1</sub><sub>A</sub> receptors mediated reflex depression followed by a second phase marked by enhancement of reflex excitability.</p>

<p>Podoplanin (Pdpn), a brain-tumor-related glycoprotein identified in humans and animals, is endogenously expressed in several organs critical for life support such as kidney, lung, heart and brain. In the brain, Pdpn has been identified in proliferative nestin-positive adult neural progenitor cells and in neurons of the neurogenic hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG), a structure associated to anxiety, critical for learning and memory functions and severely damaged in people with Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). The in vivo role of Pdpn in adult neurogenesis and anxiety-like behavior remained however unexplored. Using mice with disrupted Pdpn gene as a model organism and applying combined behavioral, molecular biological and electrophysiological assays, we here show that the absence of Pdpn selectively impairs long-term synaptic depression in the neurogenic DG without affecting the CA3-Schaffer’s collateral-CA1 synapses. Pdpn deletion also enhanced the proliferative capacity of DG neural progenitor cells and diminished survival of differentiated neuronal cells in vitro. In addition, mice with podoplanin gene disruption showed increased anxiety-like behaviors in experimentally validated behavioral tests as compared to wild type littermate controls. Together, these findings broaden our knowledge on the molecular mechanisms influencing hippocampal synaptic plasticity and neurogenesis in vivo and reveal Pdpn as a novel molecular target for future studies addressing general anxiety disorder and synaptic depression-related memory dysfunctions.</p>

<p>Aging is associated with cognitive decline and dysregulation of the circadian system, which modulates hippocampal-dependent memory as well as biological processes underlying hippocampal function. While circadian dysfunction and memory impairment are common features of aging and several neurodegenerative brain disorders, how aging impacts the circadian expression patterns of proteins involved in processes that underlie hippocampal-dependent memory is not well understood. In this study, we profiled the hippocampal proteomes of young and middle-aged mice across two circadian cycles using quantitative mass spectrometry in order to explore aging-associated changes in the temporal orchestration of biological pathways. Of the ∼1,420 proteins that were accurately quantified, 15% (214 proteins) displayed circadian rhythms in abundance in the hippocampus of young mice, while only 1.6% (23 proteins) were rhythmic in middle-aged mice. Remarkably, aging disrupted the circadian regulation of proteins involved in cellular functions critical for hippocampal function and memory, including dozens of proteins participating in pathways of energy metabolism, neurotransmission, and synaptic plasticity. These included processes such as glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, synaptic vesicle cycling, long-term potentiation, and cytoskeletal organization. Moreover, aging altered the daily expression rhythms of proteins implicated in hallmarks of aging and the pathogenesis of several age-related neurodegenerative brain disorders affecting the hippocampus. Notably, we identified age-related alterations in the rhythmicity of proteins involved in mitochondrial dysfunction and loss of proteostasis, as well as proteins involved in the pathogenesis of disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease. These insights into aging-induced changes in the hippocampal proteome provide a framework for understanding how the age-dependent circadian decline may contribute to cognitive impairment and the development of neurodegenerative diseases during aging.</p>

<p>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a growing global threat to healthcare in the aging population. In the USA alone, it is estimated that one in nine persons over the age of 65 years is living with AD. The pathology is marked by the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) deposition in the brain, which is further enhanced by the neuroinflammatory process. Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain, leucine rich repeat and pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) are the major neuroinflammatory pathways that intensify AD pathogenesis. Histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2)-mediated epigenetic mechanisms play a major role in the genesis and neuropathology of AD. Therefore, therapeutic drugs, which can target Aβ production, NLRP3 activation, and HDAC2 levels, may play a major role in reducing Aβ levels and the prevention of associated neuropathology of AD. In this study, we demonstrate that withaferin A (WA), an extract from Withania somnifera plant, significantly inhibits the Aβ production and NF-κB associated neuroinflammatory molecules’ gene expression. Furthermore, we demonstrate that cytokine release inhibitory drug 3 (CRID3), an inhibitor of NLRP3, significantly prevents inflammasome-mediated gene expression in our in vitro AD model system. We have also observed that mithramycin A (MTM), an HDAC2 inhibitor, significantly upregulated the synaptic plasticity gene expression and downregulated HDAC2 in SH-SY5Y cells overexpressing amyloid precursor protein (SH-APP cells). Therefore, the introduction of these agents targeting Aβ production, NLRP3-mediated neuroinflammation, and HDAC2 levels will have a translational significance in the prevention of neuroinflammation and associated neurodegeneration in AD patients.</p>

Abstract<p>Despite the still prevailing notion of a shared substrate of action for all addictive drugs, there is evidence suggesting that opioid and psychostimulant drugs differ substantially in terms of their neurobiological and behavioural effects. These differences may reflect separate neural circuits engaged by the two drugs. Here we used the catFISH technique to investigate the degree of overlap between neurons engaged by heroin versus cocaine in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats. The catFISH technique is a within-subject procedure that takes advantage of the different transcriptional time-course of the immediate-early genes <i>homer 1a</i> and <i>arc</i> to determine to what extent two stimuli separated by an interval of 25 min engage the same neuronal population. We found that throughout the striatal complex the neuronal populations activated by non-contingent intravenous injections of cocaine (800 µg/kg) and heroin (100 and 200 µg/kg), administered at an interval of 25 min from each other, overlapped to a much lesser extent than in the case of two injections of cocaine (800 µg/kg), also 25 min apart. The greatest reduction in overlap between populations activated by cocaine and heroin was in the dorsomedial and dorsolateral striatum (~30% and ~22%, respectively, of the overlap observed for the sequence cocaine-cocaine). Our results point toward a significant separation between neuronal populations activated by heroin and cocaine in the striatal complex. We propose that our findings are a proof of concept that these two drugs are encoded differently in a brain area believed to be a common neurobiological substrate to drug abuse.</p><p><b>Significance statement</b> Despite significant advances in the substance use disorders field, effective prevention and treatment strategies are scarce and still under active development. Here we add to growing evidence indicating major differences in the neurobiological effects of opioid versus psychostimulant drugs, which is at odds with the still prevailing notion of a shared substrate of action for all addictive drugs. This suggests that, to be effective, development of prevention and treatment strategies should not look for a "silver bullet" solution to all drug addictions. Instead, they should be tailored to the specific drug preference of pathological users.</p>

ABSTRACT<p>In this study, we use an optogenetic inhibitor of JNK in dendritic spine sub-compartments of rat hippocampal neurons. JNK inhibition exerts rapid (within seconds) reorganisation of actin in the spine-head. Using real-time FRET to measure JNK activity, we find that either excitotoxic insult (NMDA) or endocrine stress (corticosterone), activate spine-head JNK causing internalization of AMPARs and spine retraction. Both events are prevented upon optogenetic inhibition of JNK, and rescued by JNK inhibition even 2 h after insult. Moreover, we identify that the fast-acting anti-depressant ketamine reduces JNK activity in hippocampal neurons suggesting that JNK inhibition may be a downstream mediator of its anti-depressant effect. In conclusion, we show that JNK activation plays a role in triggering spine elimination by NMDA or corticosterone stress, whereas inhibition of JNK facilitates regrowth of spines even in the continued presence of glucocorticoid. This identifies that JNK acts locally in the spine-head to promote AMPAR internalization and spine shrinkage following stress, and reveals a protective function for JNK inhibition in preventing spine regression.</p><p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Identifying mechanisms that underlie dendritic spine elimination is important if we are to understand maladaptive changes that contribute to psychiatric disease. Compartment-specific, fast-acting tools can expedite this endeavor. Here we use a light-activated inhibitor of JNK to control kinase activity specifically in dendritic spines. Light-activation of the JNK inhibitor reduces AMPA receptor removal and spine regression in response to corticosterone and NMDA stress. Furthermore, we find that the anti-depressant drug ketamine lowers JNK activity in hippocampal neurons and prevents spine regression, though direct JNK inhibition is more effective. This study identifies a role for JNK in spine regression and may be relevant for endocrine control of synaptic strength and for conditions where chronic glucocorticoid stress leads to spine elimination.</p>

<p>Two elements of neural information processing have primarily been proposed:
firing rate and spike timing of neurons. In the case of synaptic plasticity,
although spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) depending on presynaptic and
postsynaptic spike times had been considered the most common rule, recent
studies have shown the inhibitory nature of the brain in vivo for precise spike
timing, which is key to the STDP. Thus, the importance of the firing frequency
in synaptic plasticity in vivo has been recognized again. However, little is
understood about how the frequency-dependent synaptic plasticity (FDP) is
regulated in vivo. Here, we focused on the presynaptic input pattern, the
intracellular calcium decay time constants, and the background synaptic
activity, which vary depending on neuron types and the anatomical and
physiological environment in the brain. By analyzing a calcium-based model, we
found that the synaptic weight differs depending on these factors
characteristic in vivo, even if neurons receive the same input rate. This
finding suggests the involvement of multifaceted factors other than input
frequency in FDP and even neural coding in vivo.

<p>Neuroprosthesis, as one type of precision medicine device, is aiming for
manipulating neuronal signals of the brain in a closed-loop fashion, together
with receiving stimulus from the environment and controlling some part of our
brain/body. In terms of vision, incoming information can be processed by the
brain in millisecond interval. The retina computes visual scenes and then sends
its output as neuronal spikes to the cortex for further computation. Therefore,
the neuronal signal of interest for retinal neuroprosthesis is spike.
Closed-loop computation in neuroprosthesis includes two stages: encoding
stimulus to neuronal signal, and decoding it into stimulus. Here we review some
of the recent progress about visual computation models that use spikes for
analyzing natural scenes, including static images and dynamic movies. We
hypothesize that for a better understanding of computational principles in the
retina, one needs a hypercircuit view of the retina, in which different
functional network motifs revealed in the cortex neuronal network should be
taken into consideration for the retina. Different building blocks of the
retina, including a diversity of cell types and synaptic connections, either
chemical synapses or electrical synapses (gap junctions), make the retina an
ideal neuronal network to adapt the computational techniques developed in
artificial intelligence for modeling of encoding/decoding visual scenes.
Altogether, one needs a systems approach of visual computation with spikes to
advance the next generation of retinal neuroprosthesis as an artificial visual
system.

<p>The fate of scientific hypotheses often relies on the ability of a
computational model to explain the data, quantified in modern statistical
approaches by the likelihood function. The log-likelihood is the key element
for parameter estimation and model evaluation. However, the log-likelihood of
complex models in fields such as computational biology and neuroscience is
often intractable to compute analytically or numerically. In those cases,
researchers can often only estimate the log-likelihood by comparing observed
data with synthetic observations generated by model simulations. Standard
techniques to approximate the likelihood via simulation either use summary
statistics of the data or are at risk of producing severe biases in the
estimate. Here, we explore another method, inverse binomial sampling (IBS),
which can estimate the log-likelihood of an entire data set efficiently and
without bias. For each observation, IBS draws samples from the simulator model
until one matches the observation. The log-likelihood estimate is then a
function of the number of samples drawn. The variance of this estimator is
uniformly bounded, achieves the minimum variance for an unbiased estimator, and
we can compute calibrated estimates of the variance. We provide theoretical
arguments in favor of IBS and an empirical assessment of the method for
maximum-likelihood estimation with simulation-based models. As case studies, we
take three model-fitting problems of increasing complexity from computational
and cognitive neuroscience. In all problems, IBS generally produces lower error
in the estimated parameters and maximum log-likelihood values than alternative
sampling methods with the same average number of samples. Our results
demonstrate the potential of IBS as a practical, robust, and easy to implement

<p>Evidence suggests that brain network dynamics is a key determinant of brain
function and dysfunction. Here we propose a new framework to assess the
dynamics of brain networks based on recurrence analysis. Our framework uses
recurrence plots and recurrence quantification analysis to characterize dynamic
networks. For resting-state magnetoencephalographic dynamic functional networks
(dFNs), we have found that functional networks recur more quickly in people
with epilepsy than healthy controls. This suggests that recurrence of dFNs may
be used as a biomarker of epilepsy. For stereo electroencephalography data, we
have found that dFNs involved in epileptic seizures emerge before seizure
onset, and recurrence analysis allows us to detect seizures. We further observe
distinct dFNs before and after seizures, which may inform neurostimulation
strategies to prevent seizures. Our framework can also be used for
understanding dFNs in brain function in health and other neurological
disorders.

<p>The Hodgkin-Huxley model describes the conduction of the nervous impulse
through the axon, whose membrane's electric response can be described employing
multiple connected electric circuits containing capacitors, voltage sources,
and conductances. These conductances depend on previous depolarizing membrane
voltages, which can be identified with a memory resistive element called
memristor. Inspired by the recent quantization of the memristor, a simplified
Hodgkin-Huxley model including a single ion channel has been studied in the
quantum regime. Here, we study the quantization of the complete Hodgkin-Huxley
model, accounting for all three ion channels, and introduce a quantum source,
together with an output waveguide as the connection to a subsequent neuron. Our
system consists of two memristors and one resistor, describing potassium,
sodium, and chloride ion channel conductances, respectively, and a capacitor to
account for the axon's membrane capacitance. We study the behavior of both ion
channel conductivities and the circuit voltage, and we compare the results with
those of the single channel, for a given quantum state of the source. It is
remarkable that, in opposition to the single-channel model, we are able to
reproduce the voltage spike in an adiabatic regime. Arguing that the circuit
voltage is a quantum variable, we find a purely quantum-mechanical contribution
in the system voltage's second moment. This work represents a complete study of
the Hodgkin-Huxley model in the quantum regime, establishing a recipe for
constructing quantum neuron networks with quantum state inputs. This paves the
way for advances in hardware-based neuromorphic quantum computing, as well as
quantum machine learning, which might be more efficient resource-wise.

<p>The flow of information through the brain is reflected by the activity
patterns of neural cells. Indeed, these firing patterns are widely used as
input data to predictive models that relate stimuli and animal behavior to the
activity of a population of neurons. However, relatively little attention was
paid to single neuron spike trains as predictors of cell or network properties
in the brain. In this work, we introduce an approach to neuronal spike train
data mining which enables effective classification and clustering of neuron
types and network activity states based on single-cell spiking patterns. This
approach is centered around applying state-of-the-art time series
classification/clustering methods to sequences of interspike intervals recorded
from single neurons. We demonstrate good performance of these methods in tasks
involving classification of neuron type (e.g. excitatory vs. inhibitory cells)
and/or neural circuit activity state (e.g. awake vs. REM sleep vs. nonREM sleep
states) on an open-access cortical spiking activity dataset.

<p>White matter pathways that surround the hippocampus comprise its afferent and efferent connections, and are therefore crucial in mediating the function of the hippocampus. We recently demonstrated a role for the hippocampus in both spatial memory and olfactory identification in humans. In the current study, we focused our attention on the fimbria-fornix white matter bundle and investigated its relationship with spatial memory and olfactory identification. We administered a virtual navigation task and an olfactory identification task to 55 young healthy adults and measured the volume of the fimbria-fornix. We found that the volume of the right fimbria-fornix and its subdivisions is correlated with both navigational learning and olfactory identification in those who use hippocampus-based spatial memory strategies, and not in those who use caudate nucleus-based navigation strategies. These results are consistent with our recent finding that spatial memory and olfaction rely on similar neural networks and structures.</p>

<p>Coupling of neural oscillations is essential for the transmission of cortical motor commands to motoneuron pools through direct and indirect descending motor pathways. Most studies focus on iso-frequency coupling between brain and muscle activities, i.e., cortico-muscular coherence, which is thought to reflect motor command transmission in the mono-synaptic corticospinal pathway. Compared to this direct pathway, indirect corticobulbospinal motor pathways involve multiple intermediate synaptic connections via spinal interneurons. Neuronal processing of synaptic inputs can lead to modulation of inter-spike intervals which produces cross-frequency coupling. This theoretical study aims to evaluate the effect of the number of synaptic layers in descending pathways on the expression of cross-frequency coupling between supraspinal input and the cumulative output of the motoneuron pool using a computer simulation. We simulated descending pathways as various layers of interneurons with a terminal motoneuron pool using Hogdkin–Huxley styled neuron models. Both cross- and iso-frequency coupling between the supraspinal input and the motorneuron pool output were computed using a novel generalized coherence measure, i.e., n:m coherence. We found that the iso-frequency coupling is only dominant in the mono-synaptic corticospinal tract, while the cross-frequency coupling is dominant in multi-synaptic indirect motor pathways. Furthermore, simulations incorporating both mono-synaptic direct and multi-synaptic indirect descending pathways showed that increased reliance on a multi-synaptic indirect pathway over a mono-synaptic direct pathway enhances the dominance of cross-frequency coupling between the supraspinal input and the motorneuron pool output. These results provide the theoretical basis for future human subject study quantitatively assessing motor command transmission in indirect vs. direct pathways and its changes after neurological disorders such as unilateral brain injury.</p>

<p>Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a complex condition that develops after experiencing a severe emotional trauma, with or without physical trauma. There is no known cure and evidence-based treatments, which are effective in reducing symptoms, have low retention rates. It is therefore important, in addition to seeking new therapeutics, to identify ways to reduce the likelihood of developing PTSD. The fact that some, but not all, individuals exposed to the same traumatic event develop PTSD suggests that there is individual susceptibility. Investigating susceptibility and underlying factors will be better guided if there is a coherent framework for such investigations. In this review, we propose that susceptibility is a dynamic state that is comprised of susceptibility factors (before trauma) and sequalae factors (during or after trauma, but before PTSD diagnosis). We define key features of susceptibility and sequalae factors as: (1) they are detectable before trauma (susceptibility factors) or during/shortly after trauma (sequalae factors), (2) they can be manipulated, and (3) manipulation of these factors alters the likelihood of developing PTSD, thus affecting resilience. In this review we stress the importance of investigating susceptibility to PTSD with appropriate animal models, because prospective human studies are expensive and manipulation of susceptibility and sequalae factors for study purposes may not always be feasible. This review also provides a brief overview of a subset of animal models that study PTSD-related behaviors and related alterations in endocrine and brain systems that focus on individual differences, peri- and post-trauma. Attention is drawn to the RISP model (Revealing Individual Susceptibility to a PTSD-like Phenotype) which assesses susceptibility before trauma. Using the RISP model and expression of plasticity-associated immediate early genes, Arc and Homer1a, we have identified impaired hippocampal function as a potential susceptibility factor. We further discuss other putative susceptibility factors and approaches to mitigate them. We assert that this knowledge will guide successful strategies for interventions before, during or shortly after trauma that can decrease the probability of developing PTSD.</p>

<p>ADP-ribosylation of the P2X7k splice variant on mouse T cells by Ecto-ADP-ribosyltransferase ARTC2.2 in response to its substrate extracellular nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD<sup>+</sup>) triggers cell death. Since NAD<sup>+</sup> is released as a danger signal during tissue damage, this NAD<sup>+</sup>-induced cell death (NICD) may impact the survival of other cell populations co-expressing P2X7 and of one of the ARTC2 isoforms (ARTC2.1, ARTC2.2). NICD of brain-resident, non-T cell populations has only been rudimentarily investigated. In this study, we evaluated the susceptibility of two glia cell populations, astrocytes and microglia, towards NICD. We found that astrocytes and microglia strongly upregulate cell surface levels of ARTC2.1 and ADP-ribosylation of cell surface proteins in response to treatment with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) 1 and 2 inhibitor U0126, but do not respond to extracellular NAD<sup>+</sup> with P2X7 activation and induction of cell death. Furthermore, we found that astrocytes and microglia preferentially express the ADP-ribosylation-insensitive P2X7a splice variant, likely accounting for the resistance of these cells to NICD.</p>

<p>The aim of this article is to introduce the concept of Cognitive Fitness (CF), identify its key ingredients underpinning both real-time task performance and career longevity in high-risk occupations, and to canvas a holistic framework for their assessment, training, and augmentation. CF as a capacity to deploy neurocognitive resources, knowledge and skills to meet the demands of operational task performance, is likely to be multi-faceted and differentially malleable. A taxonomy of CF constructs derived from Cognitive Readiness (CR) and Mental fitness (MF) literature maps into phases of operational cycle from foundational to advanced, mission-ready and recovery. Foundational cognitive attributes, such as attention, executive control and co-action, were hypothesized to be trainable at the initial Cognitive Gym phase. More advanced training targets at the CR phase included stress and arousal regulation, adaptability, teamwork, situation awareness (including detection, sense-making and prediction) and decision making (de-biasing and confidence calibration). The mission-ready training phase is focused on tolerances (to sleep loss, monotony, pain, frustration, uncertainty) and resistance (to distraction, deception or manipulation). Operational Augmentation phase relies on support tools such as decision aids and fatigue countermeasures, while the Recovery phase employs reflexive (e.g., mindfulness), and restorative practices (e.g., nutrition and sleep hygiene). The periodization of cognitive training in this cycle is hypothesized to optimize both real-time cognitive performance and the resilience that enables life-long thriving. One of the most promising avenues of validating this hypothesis is by developing an expert consensus on the key CF ingredients and their relative importance in high-performance settings.</p>

Rodent models of obesity show that high-calorie diets cause brain inflammation (neuroinflammation) in multiple regions, including the hippocampus, and impairments in hippocampal-dependent memory tasks. To determine if similar effects exist in humans with obesity, we applied Diffusion Basis Spectrum Imaging (DBSI) to evaluate neuroinflammation and axonal integrity. We examined diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data in two independent cohorts of obese and non-obese individuals (Cohort 1: 25 obese/21 non-obese; Cohort 2: 18 obese/41 non-obese). We applied Tract-based Spatial Statistics (TBSS) to allow whole-brain white matter (WM) analyses and compare DBSI-derived isotropic and anisotropic diffusion measures between the obese and non-obese groups. In both cohorts, the obese group had significantly greater DBSI-derived restricted fraction (DBSI-RF; an indicator of neuroinflammation-related cellularity), and significantly lower DBSI-derived fiber fraction (DBSI-FF; an indicator of apparent axonal density) in several WM tracts (all corrected p &lt; 0.05). Moreover, using region of interest analyses, average DBSI-RF and DBSI-FF values in the hippocampus were significantly greater and lower, respectively, in obese relative to non-obese individuals (Cohort 1: p = 0.045; Cohort 2: p = 0.008). Hippocampal DBSI-FF and DBSI-RF and amygdalar DBSI-FF metrics related to cognitive performance in Cohort 2. In conclusion, these findings suggest that greater neuroinflammation-related cellularity and lower apparent axonal density are associated with human obesity and cognitive performance. Future studies are warranted to determine a potential role for neuroinflammation in obesity-related cognitive impairment.</p>

<p>Classification learning is a preeminent human ability within the animal kingdom but the key mechanisms of brain networks regulating learning remain mostly elusive. Recent neuroimaging advancements have depicted human brain as a complex graph machinery where brain regions are nodes and coherent activities among them represent the functional connections. While long-term motor memories have been found to alter functional connectivity in the resting human brain, a graph topological investigation of the short-time effects of learning are still not widely investigated. For instance, classification learning is known to orchestrate rapid modulation of diverse memory systems like short-term and visual working memories but how the brain functional connectome accommodates such modulations is unclear. We used publicly available repositories (openfmri.org) selecting three experiments, two focused on short-term classification learning along two consecutive runs where learning was promoted by trial-by-trial feedback errors, while a further experiment was used as supplementary control. We analyzed the functional connectivity extracted from BOLD fMRI signals, and estimated the graph information processing in the cerebral networks. The information processing capability, characterized by complex network statistics, significantly improved over runs, together with the subject classification accuracy. Instead, null-learning experiments, where feedbacks came with poor consistency, did not provoke any significant change in the functional connectivity over runs. We propose that learning induces fast modifications in the overall brain network dynamics, definitely ameliorating the short-term potential of the brain to process and integrate information, a dynamic consistently orchestrated by modulations of the functional connections among specific brain regions.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00448">Cross-Situational Statistical Learning of New Words Despite Bilateral Hippocampal Damage and Severe Amnesia</a></h4>

<p>Word learning requires learners to bind together arbitrarily-related phonological, visual, and conceptual information. Prior work suggests that this binding can be robustly achieved via incidental cross-situational statistical exposure to words and referents. When cross-situational statistical learning (CSSL) is tested in the laboratory, there is no information on any given trial to identify the referent of a novel word. However, by tracking which objects co-occur with each word across trials, learners may acquire mappings through statistical association. While CSSL behavior is well-characterized, its brain correlates are not. The arbitrary nature of CSSL mappings suggests hippocampal involvement, but the incremental, statistical nature of the learning raises the possibility of neocortical or procedural learning systems. Prior studies have shown that neurological patients with hippocampal pathology have word-learning impairments, but this has not been tested in a statistical learning paradigm. Here, we used a neuropsychological approach to test whether patients with bilateral hippocampal pathology (N = 3) could learn new words in a CSSL paradigm. In the task, patients and healthy comparison participants completed a CSSL word-learning task in which they acquired eight word/object mappings. During each trial of the CSSL task, participants saw two objects on a computer display, heard one novel word, and selected the most likely referent. Across trials, words were 100% likely to co-occur with their referent, but only 14.3% likely with non-referents. Two of three amnesic patients learned the associations between objects and word forms, although performance was impaired relative to healthy comparison participants. Our findings show that the hippocampus is not strictly necessary for CSSL for words, although it may facilitate such learning. This is consistent with a hybrid account of CSSL supported by implicit and explicit memory systems, and may have translational applications for remediation of (word-) learning deficits in neurological populations with hippocampal pathology.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2019.00081">Inhibitory Network Bistability Explains Increased Interneuronal Activity Prior to Seizure Onset</a></h4>

<p>Recent experimental literature has revealed that GABAergic interneurons exhibit increased activity prior to seizure onset, alongside additional evidence that such activity is synchronous and may arise abruptly. These findings have led some to hypothesize that this interneuronal activity may serve a causal role in driving the sudden change in brain activity that heralds seizure onset. However, the mechanisms predisposing an inhibitory network toward increased activity, specifically prior to ictogenesis, without a permanent change to inputs to the system remain unknown. We address this question by comparing simulated inhibitory networks containing control interneurons and networks containing hyperexcitable interneurons modeled to mimic treatment with 4-Aminopyridine (4-AP), an agent commonly used to model seizures in vivo and in vitro. Our in silico study demonstrates that model inhibitory networks with 4-AP interneurons are more prone than their control counterparts to exist in a bistable state in which asynchronously firing networks can abruptly transition into synchrony driven by a brief perturbation. This transition into synchrony brings about a corresponding increase in overall firing rate. We further show that perturbations driving this transition could arise in vivo from background excitatory synaptic activity in the cortex. Thus, we propose that bistability explains the increase in interneuron activity observed experimentally prior to seizure via a transition from incoherent to coherent dynamics. Moreover, bistability explains why inhibitory networks containing hyperexcitable interneurons are more vulnerable to this change in dynamics, and how such networks can undergo a transition without a permanent change in the drive. We note that while our comparisons are between networks of control and ictogenic neurons, the conclusions drawn specifically relate to the unusual dynamics that arise prior to seizure, and not seizure onset itself. However, providing a mechanistic explanation for this phenomenon specifically in a pro-ictogenic setting generates experimentally testable hypotheses regarding the role of inhibitory neurons in pre-ictal neural dynamics, and motivates further computational research into mechanisms underlying a newly hypothesized multi-step pathway to seizure initiated by inhibition.</p>

<p>Activity-dependent neuroprotective protein (ADNP) was discovered and first characterized in the laboratory of Prof. Illana Gozes to be regulated by vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), and pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide (PACAP) toward neuroprotection. Importantly, ADNP is a master regulator of &gt;400 genes, essential for brain formation, while its haploinsufficiency causes cognitive impairments. Recently, de novo mutations in ADNP were identified as leading to the autism-like ADNP syndrome, mimicked by the Adnp-deficient mouse model. Furthermore, novel peptide derivatives of the neuroprotective ADNP-snippet NAP (NAPVSIPQ), developed in our laboratory, include SKIP and the mirroring all D-amino acid SKIP (D-SKIP). We now extended previous evidence suggesting potential antagonistic features for D-SKIP, compared with the neuroprotective peptide SKIP, as was observed by NMR analysis and social/olfactory functional testing. Here, an impact of the Adnp genotype was observed in the Morris Water Maze (MWM) test measuring cognition, coupled with improvement by SKIP, opposing the inert/exacerbating effect of D-SKIP. In the elevated plus-maze and open field tests measuring anxiety-related behaviors, contrasting effects of SKIP and D-SKIP were found, with SKIP improving/preserving the normal phenotype of the mouse, and D-SKIP causing alterations. Lastly, an in silico analysis suggested that SKIP and D-SKIP bind the microtubule end binding (EB) proteins EB1 and EB3 in different conformations, thereby indicating distinctive natures for the two peptides, potentially mediating differential in vivo effects. Altogether, our findings corroborate the notion of D-SKIP acting as an antagonist, thus distinguishing it from the neuroprotective SKIP.</p>

<p>Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder characterized by recurrent uncontrolled seizures and has an idiopathic “genetic” etiology or a symptomatic “acquired” component. Genetic studies have revealed that many epilepsy susceptibility genes encode ion channels, including voltage-gated sodium, potassium and calcium channels. The high prevalence of ion channels in epilepsy pathogenesis led to the causative concept of “ion channelopathies,” which can be elicited by specific mutations in the coding or promoter regions of genes in genetic epilepsies. Intriguingly, expression changes of the same ion channel genes by augmentation of specific transcription factors (TFs) early after an insult can underlie acquired epilepsies. In this study, we review how the transcriptional regulation of ion channels in both genetic and acquired epilepsies can be controlled, and compare these epilepsy “ion channelopathies” with other neurodevelopmental disorders.</p>

<p>Daily exposure of awake mice to a phase-reversing visual grating stimulus leads to enhancement of the visual-evoked potential (VEP) in layer 4 of the primary visual cortex (V1). This stimulus-selective response potentiation (SRP) resembles and shares mechanistic requirements with canonical long-term synaptic potentiation (LTP). However, it remains to be determined how this augmentation of a population response translates into altered neuronal activity of individual V1 neurons. To address this question, we performed longitudinal calcium imaging of layer 4 excitatory neurons in V1 and tracked changes associated with the induction and expression of SRP. We found no evidence for a net change in the fraction of visually responsive neurons as the stimulus became familiar. However, endoscopic calcium imaging of layer 4 principal neurons revealed that somatic calcium transients in response to phase-reversals of the familiar visual stimulus are reduced and undergo strong within-session adaptation. Conversely, neuropil calcium responses and VEPs are enhanced during familiar stimulus viewing, and the VEPs show reduced within-session adaptation. Consistent with the exquisite selectivity of SRP, the plasticity of cellular responses to phase-reversing gratings did not translate into altered orientation selectivity to drifting gratings. Our findings suggest a model in which augmentation of fast, short-latency synaptic (dendritic) responses, manifested as enhanced layer 4 VEPs, recruits inhibition to suppress cellular activity. Reduced cellular activity to the familiar stimulus may account for the behavioral correlate of SRP, orientation-selective long-term habituation.</p>

<p>Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) checkpoint blockade with an antibody has been shown to reduce amyloid-β plaques, associated pathologies and cognitive impairment in mouse models. More recently, this approach has shown effectiveness in a tauopathy mouse model to improve cognition and reduce tau lesions. Follow-up studies by other laboratories did not see similar benefits of this type of therapy in other amyloid-β plaque models. Here, we report a modest increase in locomotor activity but no effect on cognition or tau pathology, in a different more commonly used tauopathy model following a weekly treatment for 12 weeks with the same PD-1 antibody and isotype control as in the original Aβ- and tau-targeting studies. These findings indicate that further research is needed before clinical trials based on PD-1 checkpoint immune blockage are devised for tauopathies.</p>

<p>Through a number of an extensive autopsy, biomarker, and genomics studies, researchers have recently defined a novel type of dementia known as limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy (LATE). LATE is perhaps best characterized by the presence of hyperphosphorylated TDP-43, which plays multi-functional roles through interactions with DNA and RNA, leading to significant alterations in the transcription and translation of particular genes. As individuals of advanced age represent a rapidly growing demographic group globally, there is a steadily increasing rate of LATE incidence that has to date received insufficient recognition despite its serious implications for public health. TDP-43 is the common pathology of various age-related dementia, therefore, it may be a potential and promising therapeutic target for such diseases. In the present review, we discuss the pathways regulating TDP-43 expression, metabolism, and disease activity in order to better understand the link between TDP-43 proteinopathy and LATE at the genetic, pathological, and clinical levels.</p>

<p>by Alba Solsona-Berga, Kaitlin E. Frasier, Simone Baumann-Pickering, Sean M. Wiggins, John A. Hildebrand</p>

Passive acoustic monitoring has become an important data collection method, yielding massive datasets replete with biological, environmental and anthropogenic information. Automated signal detectors and classifiers are needed to identify events within these datasets, such as the presence of species-specific sounds or anthropogenic noise. These automated methods, however, are rarely a complete substitute for expert analyst review. The ability to visualize and annotate acoustic events efficiently can enhance scientific insights from large, previously intractable datasets. A MATLAB-based graphical user interface, called <i>DetEdit</i>, was developed to accelerate the editing and annotating of automated detections from extensive acoustic datasets. This tool is highly-configurable and multipurpose, with uses ranging from annotation and classification of individual signals or signal-clusters and evaluation of signal properties, to identification of false detections and false positive rate estimation. <i>DetEdit</i> allows users to step through acoustic events, displaying a range of signal features, including time series of received levels, long-term spectral averages, time intervals between detections, and scatter plots of peak frequency, RMS, and peak-to-peak received levels. Additionally, it displays either individual, or averaged sound pressure waveforms, and power spectra within each acoustic event. These views simultaneously provide analysts with signal-level detail and encounter-level context. <i>DetEdit</i> creates datasets of signal labels for further analyses, such as training classifiers and quantifying occurrence, abundances, or trends. Although designed for evaluating underwater-recorded odontocete echolocation click detections, <i>DetEdit</i> can be adapted to almost any stereotyped impulsive signal.

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is an increasing threat to public health. Current methods of determining AMR rely on inefficient phenotypic approaches, and there remains incomplete understanding of AMR mechanisms for many pathogen-antimicrobial combinations. Given the rapid, ongoing increase in availability of high-density genomic data for a diverse array of bacteria, development of algorithms that could utilize genomic information to predict phenotype could both be useful clinically and assist with discovery of heretofore unrecognized AMR pathways. To facilitate understanding of the connections between DNA variation and phenotypic AMR, we developed a new bioinformatics tool, variant mapping and prediction of antibiotic resistance (VAMPr), to (1) derive gene ortholog-based sequence features for protein variants; (2) interrogate these explainable gene-level variants for their known or novel associations with AMR; and (3) build accurate models to predict AMR based on whole genome sequencing data. We curated the publicly available sequencing data for 3,393 bacterial isolates from 9 species that contained AMR phenotypes for 29 antibiotics. We detected 14,615 variant genotypes and built 93 association and prediction models. The association models confirmed known genetic antibiotic resistance mechanisms, such as <i>blaKPC</i> and carbapenem resistance consistent with the accurate nature of our approach. The prediction models achieved high accuracies (mean accuracy of 91.1% for all antibiotic-pathogen combinations) internally through nested cross validation and were also validated using external clinical datasets. The VAMPr variant detection method, association and prediction models will be valuable tools for AMR research for basic scientists with potential for clinical applicability.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Gf9k_mpe_uQ" width="1" />

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/QBjgc7MAzWg/article">The role of actin protrusion dynamics in cell migration through a degradable viscoelastic extracellular matrix: Insights from a computational model</a></h4>

<p>by Tommy Heck, Diego A. Vargas, Bart Smeets, Herman Ramon, Paul Van Liedekerke, Hans Van Oosterwyck</p>

Actin protrusion dynamics plays an important role in the regulation of three-dimensional (3D) cell migration. Cells form protrusions that adhere to the surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM), mechanically probe the ECM and contract in order to displace the cell body. This results in cell migration that can be directed by the mechanical anisotropy of the ECM. However, the subcellular processes that regulate protrusion dynamics in 3D cell migration are difficult to investigate experimentally and therefore not well understood. Here, we present a computational model of cell migration through a degradable viscoelastic ECM. This model is a 2D representation of 3D cell migration. The cell is modeled as an active deformable object that captures the viscoelastic behavior of the actin cortex and the subcellular processes underlying 3D cell migration. The ECM is regarded as a viscoelastic material, with or without anisotropy due to fibrillar strain stiffening, and modeled by means of the meshless Lagrangian smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method. ECM degradation is captured by local fluidization of the material and permits cell migration through the ECM. We demonstrate that changes in ECM stiffness and cell strength affect cell migration and are accompanied by changes in number, lifetime and length of protrusions. Interestingly, directly changing the total protrusion number or the average lifetime or length of protrusions does not affect cell migration. A stochastic variability in protrusion lifetime proves to be enough to explain differences in cell migration velocity. Force-dependent adhesion disassembly does not result in faster migration, but can make migration more efficient. We also demonstrate that when a number of simultaneous protrusions is enforced, the optimal number of simultaneous protrusions is one or two, depending on ECM anisotropy. Together, the model provides non-trivial new insights in the role of protrusions in 3D cell migration and can be a valuable contribution to increase the understanding of 3D cell migration mechanics.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/QBjgc7MAzWg" width="1" />

<p>Allopregnanolone (APα), as a functional neurosteroid, exhibits the neuroprotective effect on neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s disease (PD) through γ-aminobutyric acid A receptor (GABAAR), but it has not been completely understood about its molecular mechanisms. In order to investigate the neuroprotective effect of APα, as well as to clarify its possible molecular mechanisms, SH-SY5Y neuronal cell lines were incubated with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA), which has been widely used as an in vitro model for PD, along with APα alone or in combination with GABAAR antagonist (bicuculline, Bic), intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> chelator (EGTA) and voltage-gated L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel blocker (Nifedipine). The viability, proliferation, and differentiation of SH-SY5Y cells, the expression levels of calmodulin (CaM), Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II δ3 (CaMKIIδ3), cyclin-dependent kinase-1 (CDK1) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), as well as the interaction between CaMKIIδ3 and CDK1 or BDNF, were detected by morphological and molecular biological methodology. Our results found that the cell viability and the number of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) and TH/BrdU-positive cells in 6-OHDA-treated SH-SY5Y cells were significantly decreased with the concomitant reduction in the expression levels of aforementioned proteins, which were ameliorated following APα administration. In addition, Bic could further increase the number of TH or BrdU-positive cells as well as the expression levels of aforementioned proteins except for TH/BrdU-double positive cells, while EGTA and Nifedipine could attenuate the expression levels of CaM, CaMKIIδ3 and BDNF. Moreover, there existed a direct interaction between CaMKIIδ3 and CDK1 or BDNF. As a result, APα-induced an increase in the number of TH-positive SH-SY5Y cells might be mediated through GABAAR via Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM/CaMKIIδ3/BDNF (CDK1) signaling pathway, which would ultimately facilitate to elucidate PD pathogenesis and hold a promise as an alternative therapeutic target for PD.</p>

Recent high-dimensional single-cell technologies such as mass cytometry are enabling time series experiments to monitor the temporal evolution of cell state distributions and to identify dynamically important cell states, such as fate decision states in differentiation. However, these technologies are destructive, and require analysis approaches that temporally map between cell state distributions across time points. Current approaches to approximate the single-cell time series as a dynamical system suffer from too restrictive assumptions about the type of kinetics, or link together pairs of sequential measurements in a discontinuous fashion. We propose Dynamic Distribution Decomposition (DDD), an operator approximation approach to infer a continuous distribution map between time points. On the basis of single-cell snapshot time series data, DDD approximates the continuous time Perron-Frobenius operator by means of a finite set of basis functions. This procedure can be interpreted as a continuous time Markov chain over a continuum of states. By only assuming a memoryless Markov (autonomous) process, the types of dynamics represented are more general than those represented by other common models, e.g., chemical reaction networks, stochastic differential equations. Furthermore, we can <i>a posteriori</i> check whether the autonomy assumptions are valid by calculation of prediction error—which we show gives a measure of autonomy within the studied system. The continuity and autonomy assumptions ensure that the same dynamical system maps between all time points, not arbitrarily changing at each time point. We demonstrate the ability of DDD to reconstruct dynamically important cell states and their transitions both on synthetic data, as well as on mass cytometry time series of iPSC reprogramming of a fibroblast system. We use DDD to find previously identified subpopulations of cells and to visualise differentiation trajectories. Dynamic Distribution Decomposition allows interpretation of high-dimensional snapshot time series data as a low-dimensional Markov process, thereby enabling an interpretable dynamics analysis for a variety of biological processes by means of identifying their dynamically important cell states.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0-mUa0zfZ6o" width="1" />

Abstract<p>Localization of odors is essential to animal survival, and thus animals are adept at odor-navigation. In natural conditions animals encounter odor sources in which odor is carried by air flow varying in complexity. We sought to identify potential minimalist strategies that can effectively be used for odor-based navigation and asses their performance in an increasingly chaotic environment. To do so, we compared mouse, <i>in silico</i> model, and Arduino-based robot odor-localization behavior in a standardized odor landscape. Mouse performance remains robust in the presence of increased complexity, showing a shift in strategy towards faster movement with increased environmental complexity. Implementing simple binaral and temporal models of tropotaxis and klinotaxis, an <i>in silico</i> model and Arduino robot, in the same environment as the mice, are equally successful in locating the odor source within a plume of low complexity. However, performance of these algorithms significantly drops when the chaotic nature of the plume is increased. Additionally, both algorithm-driven systems show more successful performance when using a strictly binaral model at a larger sensor separation distance and more successful performance when using a temporal and binaral model when using a smaller sensor separation distance. This suggests that with an increasingly chaotic odor environment, mice rely on complex strategies that allow for robust odor localization that cannot be resolved by minimal algorithms that display robust performance at low levels of complexity. Thus, highlighting that an animal’s ability to modulate behavior with environmental complexity is beneficial for odor localization.</p><p><b>Significance statement</b> A promising body of work has been devoted to designing robots and algorithms that address the strategies used by animals during odor-based navigation. One method to do so is by designing models that account for complex navigational tactics implemented by a particular species. How do these models directly compare to animal behavior in the same environment? We addressed this question by comparing odor-localization performance of minimal spatial and temporal algorithms <i>in silico</i> and in a robot to the strategies and performance of mice in the same odor environment. Through implementing this unique comparison, we revealed that mouse behavior remains robust with an increase in odor plume complexity, whereas simple algorithm behavior (although high-performing at low plume complexity) does not.</p>

Abstract<p>Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is often used to understand the function of individual brain regions, but this ignores the fact that TMS may affect network-level rather than nodal-level processes. We examine the effects of a double perturbation to two frontoparietal network nodes, as compared to the effects of single lesions to either node. We hypothesized that Bayesian evidence for the absence of effects that build upon one another indicates that a single perturbation is consequential to network-level processes. Twenty-three humans performed pro- (look towards) and anti- (look away) saccades after receiving continuous theta-burst stimulation (cTBS) to right frontal eye fields (FEF), dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) or somatosensory cortex (S1) (the control region). On a subset of trials, a TMS pulse was applied to right posterior parietal cortex (PPC). FEF, DLPFC and PPC are important frontoparietal network nodes for generating anti-saccades. Bayesian T-tests were used to test hypotheses for enhanced double perturbation effects (cTBS plus TMS pulse) on saccade behaviors, against the alternative hypothesis that double perturbation effects to a network are not greater than single perturbation effects. In one case, we observed strong evidence (BF<sub>10</sub> = 325) that PPC TMS following DLPFC cTBS enhanced impairments in ipsilateral anti-saccade amplitudes over DLPFC cTBS alone, and not over the effect of the PPC pulse alone (BF<sub>10</sub> = 0.75), suggesting double perturbation effects do not augment one another. Rather, this suggests that computations are distributed across the network, and in some cases there can be compensation for cTBS perturbations.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> We explore whether a frontoparietal network important to executive control, attentional processing, and saccadic gaze behaviors operates in a distributed fashion, as compared to what would be predicted from combining contributions from individual brain regions. This is important as lesions or perturbations to these regions individually can produce behavioral deficits. We apply inhibitory Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) to a frontal cortical region, followed by a second TMS perturbation to a parietal region. The point is that this second perturbation could, in principle, build upon the effects of the first perturbation. We tested different hypotheses regarding the effects of such double perturbations, and conclude that the effects do not build upon one another, suggesting a single perturbation affects a network-level process.</p>

Abstract
<p>Optical imaging of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx as a correlate of neuronal excitation represents a standard technique for visualizing spatiotemporal activity of neuronal networks. However, the information-processing properties of single neurons and neuronal circuits likewise involve inhibition of neuronal membrane potential. Here, we report spatially resolved optical imaging of odor-evoked inhibitory patterns in the olfactory circuitry of <i>Drosophila</i> using a genetically encoded fluorescent Cl<sup>-</sup> sensor. In combination with the excitatory component reflected by intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics, we present a comprehensive functional map of both odor-evoked neuronal activation and inhibition at different levels of olfactory processing. We demonstrate that odor-evoked inhibition carried by Cl<sup>-</sup> influx is present both in sensory neurons and second-order projection neurons (PNs), and is characterized by stereotypic, odor-specific patterns. Cl<sup>-</sup>-mediated inhibition features distinct dynamics in different neuronal populations. Our data support a dual role of inhibitory neurons in the olfactory system: global gain control across the neuronal circuitry and glomerulus-specific inhibition to enhance neuronal information processing.</p>

<p>Do subjects with atypical patterns in attentional and executive behaviour show different brain network topology and react differently towards nicotine administration? The efficacy of pro-cognitive drugs like nicotine considerably varies between subjects and previous theoretical and empirical evidence suggest stronger behavioural nicotine effects in subjects with low performance. One problem is, however, how to best define low performance, especially if several cognitive functions are assessed for subject characterisation. We here present a method that used a multivariate, robust outlier detection algorithm to identify subjects with suspicious patterns of performance in attentional and executive functioning. In contrast to univariate approaches, this method is sensitive towards extreme positions within the multidimensional space that do not have to be extreme values in the individual behavioural distributions. The method was applied to a dataset of healthy, non-smoking subjects (n = 34) who were behaviorally characterised by an attention and executive function test on which N = 12 volunteers were classified as outliers. All subjects then underwent a resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scan to characterise brain network topology and an experimental behavioural paradigm under placebo and nicotine (7 mg patch) that gauged aspects of attention and executive function. Our results indicate that subjects with an atypical multivariate pattern in attention and executive functioning showed significant differences in nodal brain network integration in visual association and pre-motor brain regions during resting state. These differences in brain network topology significantly predicted larger individual nicotine effects on attentional processing. In summary, the current approach successfully identified a subgroup of healthy volunteers with low behavioural performance who differ in brain network topology and attentional benefit from nicotine.</p>

<p>Astronauts return to Earth from spaceflight missions with impaired mobility and balance; recovery can last weeks postflight. This is due in large part to the altered vestibular signaling and sensory reweighting that occurs in microgravity. The neural mechanisms of spaceflight-induced vestibular changes are not well understood. Head-down-tilt bed rest (HDBR) is a common spaceflight analog environment that allows for study of body unloading, fluid shifts, and other consequences of spaceflight. Subjects in this context still show vestibular changes despite being in Earth’s gravitational environment, potentially due to sensory reweighting. Previously, we found evidence of sensory reweighting and reduced neural efficiency for vestibular processing in subjects who underwent a 70-day HDBR intervention. Here we extend this work by evaluating the impact of HDBR paired with elevated carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) to mimic International Space Station conditions on vestibular neural processing. Eleven participants (6 males, 34 ± 8 years) completed 30 days of HDBR combined with 0.5% atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> (HDBR + CO<sub>2</sub>). Participants underwent six functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) sessions pre-, during, and post- HDBR + CO<sub>2</sub> while we measured brain activity in response to pneumatic skull taps (a validated method of vestibular stimulation). We also measured mobility and balance performance several times before and after the intervention. We found support for adaptive neural changes within the vestibular system during bed rest that subsequently recovered in several cortical and cerebellar regions. Further, there were multiple brain regions where greater pre- to post- deactivation was associated with reduced pre- to post- balance declines. That is, increased deactivation of certain brain regions associated with better balance post-HDBR + CO<sub>2</sub>. We also found that, compared to HDBR alone (n = 13 males; 29 ± 3 years) HDBR + CO<sub>2</sub> is associated with greater increases in activation of multiple frontal, parietal, and temporal regions during vestibular stimulation. This suggests interactive or additive effects of bed rest and elevated CO<sub>2</sub>. Finally, we found stronger correlations between pre- to post- HDBR + CO<sub>2</sub> brain changes and dependence on the visual system during balance for subjects who developed signs of Spaceflight-Associated Neuro-ocular Syndrome (SANS). Together, these findings have clear implications for understanding the neural mechanisms of bed rest and spaceflight-related changes in vestibular processing, as well as adaptation to altered sensory inputs.</p>

<p>The addition and removal of presynaptic terminals reconfigures neuronal circuits of the mammalian neocortex, but little is known about how this presynaptic structural plasticity is controlled. Since mitochondria can regulate presynaptic function, we investigated whether the presence of axonal mitochondria relates to the structural plasticity of presynaptic boutons in mouse neocortex. We found that the overall density of axonal mitochondria did not appear to influence the loss and gain of boutons. However, positioning of mitochondria at individual presynaptic sites did relate to increased stability of those boutons. In line with this, synaptic localization of mitochondria increased as boutons aged and showed differing patterns of localization at en passant and terminaux boutons. These results suggest that mitochondria accumulate locally at boutons over time to increase bouton stability.</p>

<p>Acute liver failure (ALF) implies a severe and rapid liver dysfunction that leads to impaired liver metabolism and hepatic encephalopathy (HE). Recent studies have suggested that several brain alterations such as astrocytic dysfunction and energy metabolism impairment may synergistically interact, playing a role in the development of HE. The purpose of the present study is to investigate early alterations in redox status, energy metabolism and astrocytic reactivity of rats submitted to ALF. Adult male Wistar rats were submitted either to subtotal hepatectomy (92% of liver mass) or sham operation to induce ALF. Twenty-four hours after the surgery, animals with ALF presented higher plasmatic levels of ammonia, lactate, ALT and AST and lower levels of glucose than the animals in the sham group. Animals with ALF presented several astrocytic morphological alterations indicating astrocytic reactivity. The ALF group also presented higher mitochondrial oxygen consumption, higher enzymatic activity and higher ATP levels in the brain (frontoparietal cortex). Moreover, ALF induced an increase in glutamate oxidation concomitant with a decrease in glucose and lactate oxidation. The increase in brain energy metabolism caused by astrocytic reactivity resulted in augmented levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and Poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase 1 (PARP1) and a decreased activity of the enzymes superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px). These findings suggest that in the early stages of ALF the brain presents a hypermetabolic state, oxidative stress and astrocytic reactivity, which could be in part sustained by an increase in mitochondrial oxidation of glutamate.</p>

<p>Spinal cord injury (SCI) is mostly caused by trauma. As the primary mechanical injury is unavoidable, a focus on the underlying molecular mechanisms of the SCI-induced secondary injury is necessary to develop promising treatments for patients with SCI. Transfer RNA-derived small RNA (tsRNA) is a novel class of short, non-coding RNA, possessing potential regulatory functions in various diseases. However, the functional roles of tsRNAs in traumatic SCI have not been determined yet. We used a combination of sequencing, quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), bioinformatics, and luciferase reporter assay to screen the expression profiles and identify the functional roles of tsRNAs after SCI. As a result, 297 differentially expressed tsRNAs were identified in rats’ spinal cord 1 day after contusion. Of those, 155 tsRNAs were significantly differentially expressed: 91 were significantly up-regulated, whereas 64 were significantly down-regulated after SCI (fold change &gt; 1.5; P &lt; 0.05). Bioinformatics analyses revealed candidate tsRNAs (tiRNA-Gly-GCC-001, tRF-Gly-GCC-012, tRF-Gly-GCC-013, and tRF-Gly-GCC-016) that might play regulatory roles through the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and neurotrophin signaling pathways by targeting brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). We validated the candidate tsRNAs and found opposite trends in the expression levels of the tsRNAs and BDNF after SCI. Finally, tiRNA-Gly-GCC-001 was identified to target BDNF using the luciferase reporter assay. In summary, we found an altered tsRNA expression pattern and predicted tiRNA-Gly-GCC-001 might be involved in the MAPK and neurotrophin pathways by targeting the BDNF, thus regulating the post-SCI pathophysiologic processes. This study provides novel insights for future investigations to explore the mechanisms and therapeutic targets for SCI.</p>

<p>The majority of studies in the field of timing and time perception have generally focused on sub- and supra-second time scales, specific behavioral processes, and/or discrete neuronal circuits. In an attempt to find common elements of interval timing from a broader perspective, we review the literature and highlight the need for cell and molecular studies that can delineate the neural mechanisms underlying temporal processing. Moreover, given the recent attention to the function of microtubule proteins and their potential contributions to learning and memory consolidation/re-consolidation, we propose that these proteins play key roles in coding temporal information in cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs) and striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs). The presence of microtubules at relevant neuronal sites, as well as their adaptability, dynamic structure, and longevity, makes them a suitable candidate for neural plasticity at both intra- and inter-cellular levels. As a consequence, microtubules appear capable of maintaining a temporal code or engram and thereby regulate the firing patterns of PCs and MSNs known to be involved in interval timing. This proposed mechanism would control the storage of temporal information triggered by postsynaptic activation of mGluR7. This, in turn, leads to alterations in microtubule dynamics through a “read-write” memory process involving alterations in microtubule dynamics and their hexagonal lattice structures involved in the molecular basis of temporal memory.</p>

<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neuro-autoimmune and neurodegenerative disorder leading to chronic inflammation, demyelination, axonal, and neuronal loss in the central nervous system (CNS). Despite intense research efforts, the pathogenesis of MS still remains unclear. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are a family of type I transmembrane receptors that play a crucial role in the innate immune response. Myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) is the adaptor of major TLRs. It has been widely considered that the TLR-MyD88 signaling pathway plays an important role in the occurrence and development of autoimmune disease. Data have revealed that the TLR-MyD88 signaling may be involved in the pathogenesis of MS and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model for MS, by regulating the antigen presentation of dendritic cells, the integrity of blood-brain barrier (BBB), and the activation of T cells and B cells. Here, we summarize the role of TLRs and MyD88 in MS and discuss the possible therapies that are based on these molecules.</p>

<p>A large fraction of the human genome encodes intrinsically disordered proteins/regions (IDPs/IDRs) that are involved in diverse cellular functions/regulation and dysfunctions. Moreover, several neurodegenerative disorders are associated with the pathological self-assembly of neuronal IDPs, including tau [Alzheimer’s disease (AD)], α-synuclein [Parkinson’s disease (PD)], and huntingtin exon 1 [Huntington’s disease (HD)]. Therefore, there is an urgent and emerging clinical interest in understanding the physical and structural features of their functional and disease states. However, their biophysical characterization is inherently challenging by traditional ensemble techniques. First, unlike globular proteins, IDPs lack stable secondary/tertiary structures under physiological conditions and may interact with multiple and distinct biological partners, subsequently folding differentially, thus contributing to the conformational polymorphism. Second, amyloidogenic IDPs display a high aggregation propensity, undergoing complex heterogeneous self-assembly mechanisms. In this review article, we discuss the advantages of employing cutting-edge single-molecule fluorescence (SMF) techniques to characterize the conformational ensemble of three selected neuronal IDPs (huntingtin exon 1, tau, and α-synuclein). Specifically, we survey the versatility of these powerful approaches to describe their monomeric conformational ensemble under functional and aggregation-prone conditions, and binding to biological partners. Together, the information gained from these studies provides unique insights into the role of gain or loss of function of these disordered proteins in neurodegeneration, which may assist the development of new therapeutic molecules to prevent and treat these devastating human disorders.</p>

<p>Background: A continuous effort has been devoted to identifying factors that contribute to individual differences in pain perception. Amongst the personality traits, Neuroticism is assumed to be the most significant moderator of experimental and clinical pain. Multi-sensory responsiveness to daily sensations has been shown to be associated with pain perception. Yet, neither the relationship between personality traits and multi-sensory responsiveness nor the impact of both these factors to pain perception have been examined. Thus, this study aims to explore the contribution of both multi-sensory responsiveness and personality traits to pain perception in a daily context.</p><p>Methods: A community-based sample of 204 adults completed the Sensory Responsiveness Questionnaire-Intensity Scale (SRQ-IS); the Big Five Inventory (BFI); and the Pain Sensitivity Questionnaire (PSQ).</p><p>Results: The partial eta-square demonstrated that the SRQ-IS Aversive sub-scale score had the strongest relationship with the PSQ-Total score, accounting for 9% of the variation. The regression coefficient relating PSQ-Total score with SRQ-IS Aversive, and BFI sub-scales of Extraversion, Neuroticism and Openness-to-Experience scores was found to be r = 0.39 (p &lt; 0.0001), accounting for 16% of the variance, and yielding a large effect size.</p><p>Discussion: To the best of our knowledge this is the first study to report on the interplay between aversive responsiveness to daily sensations and personality traits of Neuroticism, Openness-to-Experience, and Extraversion as contributing factors to daily pain sensitivity, amongst which aversive responsiveness was found as the major contributing factor. This study may broaden the understanding of the pain experience variability, both in practice and in experimental research.</p>

<p>Targeted memory reactivation (TMR) during slow-wave oscillations (SWOs) in sleep has been demonstrated with sensory cues to achieve about 5–12% improvement in post-nap memory performance on simple laboratory tasks. But prior work has not yet addressed the one-shot aspect of episodic memory acquisition, or dealt with the presence of interference from ambient environmental cues in real-world settings. Further, TMR with sensory cues may not be scalable to the multitude of experiences over one’s lifetime. We designed a novel non-invasive non-sensory paradigm that tags one-shot experiences of minute-long naturalistic episodes in immersive virtual reality (VR) with unique spatiotemporal amplitude-modulated patterns (STAMPs) of transcranial electrical stimulation (tES). In particular, we demonstrated that these STAMPs can be re-applied as brief pulses during SWOs in sleep to achieve about 10–20% improvement in the metamemory of targeted episodes compared to the control episodes at 48 hours after initial viewing. We found that STAMPs can not only facilitate but also impair metamemory for the targeted episodes based on an interaction between pre-sleep metamemory and the number of STAMP applications during sleep. Overnight metamemory improvements were mediated by spectral power increases following the offset of STAMPs in the slow-spindle band (8–12 Hz) for left temporal areas in the scalp electroencephalography (EEG) during sleep. These results prescribe an optimal strategy to leverage STAMPs for boosting metamemory and suggest that real-world episodic memories can be modulated in a targeted manner even with coarser, non-invasive spatiotemporal stimulation.</p>

<p>When designing electrodes and probes for brain–machine interfaces, one of the challenges faced involves minimizing the brain-tissue response, which would otherwise create an environment that is detrimental for the accurate functioning of such probes. Following the implantation process, the brain reacts with a sterile inflammation response and resulting astrocytic glial scar formation, potentially resulting in neuronal cell loss around the implantation site. Such alterations in the naïve brain tissue can hinder both the quality of neuronal recordings, and the efficacy of deep-brain stimulation. In this study, we chronically implanted a glass-supported polyimide microelectrode in the dorsolateral striatum of Sprague–Dawley rats. The effect of high-frequency stimulation (HFS) was investigated using c-fos immunoreactivity techniques. GFAP and ED1 immunohistochemistry were used to analyze the brain-tissue response. No changes in c-fos expression were found for either the acute or chronic stimulus groups; although a c-fos expression was found along the length of the implantation trajectory, following chronic implantation of our stiffened polyimide microelectrode. Furthermore, we also observed the formation of a glial scar around the microelectrode, with an accompanying low number of inflammation cells. Histological and statistical analysis of NeuN-positive cells did not demonstrate a pronounced “kill zone” with accompanying neuronal cell death around the implantation site, neither on the polymer side, nor on the glass side of the PI-glass probe.</p>

<p>Automated cerebrovascular segmentation of time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography (TOF-MRA) images is an important technique, which can be used to diagnose abnormalities in the cerebrovascular system, such as vascular stenosis and malformation. Automated cerebrovascular segmentation can direct show the shape, direction and distribution of blood vessels. Although deep neural network (DNN)-based cerebrovascular segmentation methods have shown to yield outstanding performance, they are limited by their dependence on huge training dataset. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised cerebrovascular segmentation method of TOF-MRA images based on DNN and hidden Markov random field (HMRF) model. Our DNN-based cerebrovascular segmentation model is trained by the labeling of HMRF rather than manual annotations. The proposed method was trained and tested using 100 TOF-MRA images. The results were evaluated using the dice similarity coefficient (DSC), which reached a value of 0.79. The trained model achieved better performance than that of the traditional HMRF-based cerebrovascular segmentation method in binary pixel-classification. This paper combines the advantages of both DNN and HMRF to train the model with a not so large amount of the annotations in deep learning, which leads to a more effective cerebrovascular segmentation method.</p>

<p>The sensitizing effect of capsaicin has been previously characterized using laser and contact heat evoked potentials (LEPs and CHEPs) by stimulating in the primary area of hyperalgesia. Interestingly, only CHEPs reveal changes consistent with notion of peripheral sensitization (i.e., reduced latencies). The aim of this study was to investigate contact heat stimulation parameters necessary to detect peripheral sensitization related to the topical application of capsaicin, and therefore significantly improve the current method of measuring peripheral sensitization via CHEPs. Rapid contact heat stimulation (70°C/s) was applied from three different baseline temperatures (35, 38.5, and 42°C) to a 52°C peak temperature, before and after the topical application of capsaicin on the hand dorsum. Increased pain ratings in the primary area of hyperalgesia were accompanied by reduced N2 latency. Changes in N2 latency were, however, only significant following stimulation from 35 and 38.5°C baseline temperatures. These findings suggest that earlier recruitment of capsaicin-sensitized afferents occurs between 35 and 42°C, as stimulations from 42°C baseline were unchanged by capsaicin. This is in line with reduced thresholds of type II A-delta mechanoheat (AMH) nociceptors following sensitization. Conventional CHEP stimulation, with a baseline temperature below 42°C, is well suited to objectively detect evidence of peripheral sensitization.</p>

<p>Deficits in basal ganglia-based inhibitory and timing circuits along with sensorimotor internal modeling mechanisms are thought to underlie stuttering. However, much remains to be learned regarding the precise manner how these deficits contribute to disrupting both speech and cognitive functions in those who stutter. Herein, we examine the suitability of electroencephalographic (EEG) mu rhythms for addressing these deficits. We review some previous findings of mu rhythm activity differentiating stuttering from non-stuttering individuals and present some new preliminary findings capturing stuttering-related deficits in working memory. Mu rhythms are characterized by spectral peaks in alpha (8–13 Hz) and beta (14–25 Hz) frequency bands (mu-alpha and mu-beta). They emanate from premotor/motor regions and are influenced by basal ganglia and sensorimotor function. More specifically, alpha peaks (mu-alpha) are sensitive to basal ganglia-based inhibitory signals and sensory-to-motor feedback. Beta peaks (mu-beta) are sensitive to changes in timing and capture motor-to-sensory (i.e., forward model) projections. Observing simultaneous changes in mu-alpha and mu-beta across the time-course of specific events provides a rich window for observing neurophysiological deficits associated with stuttering in both speech and cognitive tasks and can provide a better understanding of the functional relationship between these stuttering symptoms. We review how independent component analysis (ICA) can extract mu rhythms from raw EEG signals in speech production tasks, such that changes in alpha and beta power are mapped to myogenic activity from articulators. We review findings from speech production and auditory discrimination tasks demonstrating that mu-alpha and mu-beta are highly sensitive to capturing sensorimotor and basal ganglia deficits associated with stuttering with high temporal precision. Novel findings from a non-word repetition (working memory) task are also included. They show reduced mu-alpha suppression in a stuttering group compared to a typically fluent group. Finally, we review current limitations and directions for future research.</p>

<p>To characterize each cognitive function per se and to understand the brain as an aggregate of those functions, it is vital to relate dozens of these functions to each other. Knowledge about the relationships among cognitive functions is informative not only for basic neuroscientific research but also for clinical applications and developments of brain-inspired artificial intelligence. In the present study, we propose an exhaustive data mining approach to reveal relationships among cognitive functions based on functional brain mapping and network analysis. We began our analysis with 109 pseudo-activation maps (cognitive function maps; CFM) that were reconstructed from a functional magnetic resonance imaging meta-analysis database, each of which corresponds to one of 109 cognitive functions such as ‘emotion,’ ‘attention,’ ‘episodic memory,’ etc. Based on the resting-state functional connectivity between the CFMs, we mapped the cognitive functions onto a two-dimensional space where the relevant functions were located close to each other, which provided a rough picture of the brain as an aggregate of cognitive functions. Then, we conducted so-called conceptual analysis of cognitive functions using clustering of voxels in each CFM connected to the other 108 CFMs with various strengths. As a result, a CFM for each cognitive function was subdivided into several parts, each of which is strongly associated with some CFMs for a subset of the other cognitive functions, which brought in sub-concepts (i.e., sub-functions) of the cognitive function. Moreover, we conducted network analysis for the network whose nodes were parcels derived from whole-brain parcellation based on the whole-brain voxel-to-CFM resting-state functional connectivities. Since each parcel is characterized by associations with the 109 cognitive functions, network analyses using them are expected to inform about relationships between cognitive and network characteristics. Indeed, we found that informational diversities of interaction between parcels and densities of local connectivity were dependent on the kinds of associated functions. In addition, we identified the homogeneous and inhomogeneous network communities about the associated functions. Altogether, we suggested the effectiveness of our approach in which we fused the large-scale meta-analysis of functional brain mapping with the methods of network neuroscience to investigate the relationships among cognitive functions.</p>

<p>People living with schizophrenia (SCZ) experience severe brain network deterioration. The brain is constantly fizzling with non-linear causal activities measured by electroencephalogram (EEG) and despite the variety of effective connectivity methods, only few approaches can quantify the direct non-linear causal interactions. To circumvent this problem, we are motivated to quantitatively measure the effective connectivity by multivariate transfer entropy (MTE) which has been demonstrated to be able to capture both linear and non-linear causal relationships effectively. In this work, we propose to construct the EEG effective network by MTE and further compare its performance with the Granger causal analysis (GCA) and Bivariate transfer entropy (BVTE). The simulation results quantitatively show that MTE outperformed GCA and BVTE under varied signal-to-noise conditions, edges recovered, sensitivity, and specificity. Moreover, its applications to the P300 task EEG of healthy controls (HC) and SCZ patients further clearly show the deteriorated network interactions of SCZ, compared to that of the HC. The MTE provides a novel tool to potentially deepen our knowledge of the brain network deterioration of the SCZ.</p>

<p>Neural circuits interconnect to organize large-scale networks that generate perception, cognition, memory, and behavior. Information in the nervous system is processed both through parallel, independent circuits and through intermixing circuits. Analyzing the interaction between circuits is particularly indispensable for elucidating how the brain functions. Monosynaptic circuit tracing with glycoprotein (G) gene-deleted rabies viral vectors (RVΔG) comprises a powerful approach for studying the structure and function of neural circuits. Pseudotyping of RVΔG with the foreign envelope EnvA permits expression of transgenes such as fluorescent proteins, genetically-encoded sensors, or optogenetic tools in cells expressing TVA, a cognate receptor for EnvA. Trans-complementation with rabies virus glycoproteins (RV-G) enables trans-synaptic labeling of input neurons directly connected to the starter neurons expressing both TVA and RV-G. However, it remains challenging to simultaneously map neuronal connections from multiple cell populations and their interactions between intermixing circuits solely with the EnvA/TVA-mediated RV tracing system in a single animal. To overcome this limitation, here, we multiplexed RVΔG circuit tracing by optimizing distinct viral envelopes (oEnvX) and their corresponding receptors (oTVX). Based on the EnvB/TVB and EnvE/DR46-TVB systems derived from the avian sarcoma leukosis virus (ASLV), we developed optimized TVB receptors with lower or higher affinity (oTVB-L or oTVB-H) and the chimeric envelope oEnvB, as well as an optimized TVE receptor with higher affinity (oTVE-H) and its chimeric envelope oEnvE. We demonstrated independence of RVΔG infection between the oEnvA/oTVA, oEnvB/oTVB, and oEnvE/oTVE systems and in vivo proof-of-concept for multiplex circuit tracing from two distinct classes of layer 5 neurons targeting either other cortical or subcortical areas. We also successfully labeled common input of the lateral geniculate nucleus to both cortico-cortical layer 5 neurons and inhibitory neurons of the mouse V1 with multiplex RVΔG tracing. These oEnvA/oTVA, oEnvB/oTVB, and oEnvE/oTVE systems allow for differential labeling of distinct circuits to uncover the mechanisms underlying parallel processing through independent circuits and integrated processing through interaction between circuits in the brain.</p>

<p>Alteration of glutamatergic synaptic plasticity in the Nucleus Accumbens (NAc) has been implicated in cocaine-seeking behaviors. Astroglial mechanisms for maintaining extracellular glutamate homeostasis through cysteine/glutamate exchanger (xCT) and glutamate transporter GLT1 are dysregulated following cocaine exposure and contribute to altered glutamatergic synaptic plasticity. However, how these astroglial proteins become dysregulated in cocaine addiction remains unknown. We recently showed that neuron to astroglial exosome signaling is essential to maintain GLT1 protein expression by transferring neuronal miR-124-3p into astrocytes to suppress GLT1-inhibiting microRNAs (miRs) in astrocytes. In the current study, by selectively labeling neuronal exosomes using CD63-GFP<sup>f/+</sup> exosome reporter mice, we examined how the self-administration and extinction stages of the mouse cocaine self-administration model alter neuronal exosome signaling to astrocytes and microglia in the NAc. We found that cocaine (but not food) self-administration strongly reduces the internalization of neuronal exosomes, particularly in astrocytes in the NAc (but not in motor cortex), which can be effectively reversed by extinction training. In parallel, cocaine self-administration alone specifically and differentially affects activation of glial cells by decreasing GFAP expression in astrocytes but increasing Iba1 expression in microglia. However, extinction training fully reverses the increased Iba1 expression in microglia but only partially reverses the reduction of GFAP in astrocytes. Taken together, our study reveals altered in vivo dynamics of NAc neuronal exosomes in the cocaine addiction model, providing new insights about how altered neuron to glial exosome signaling may contribute to astroglial dysfunction in cocaine addiction.</p>

<p>RE-1 Silencing Transcription factor (REST) controls several steps in neural development by modulating the expression of a wide range of neural genes. Alterations in REST expression have been associated with the onset of epilepsy; however, whether such alterations are deleterious or represent a protective homeostatic response remains elusive. To study the impact of REST modulation on seizure propensity, we developed a tool for its negative modulation in vivo. The tool is composed of the paired-amphipathic helix 1 (PAH1) domain, a competitive inhibitor of REST activation by mSin3, fused to the light-oxygen-voltage sensing 2 (LOV2) domain of Avena sativa phototropin 1, a molecular switch to alternatively hide or expose the PAH1 inhibitor. We employed the C450A and I539E light-independent AsLOV2 variants to mimic the closed (inactive) and open (active) states of LOV2-PAH1, respectively. Recombinant AAV1/2 viral particles (rAAVs) allowed LOV2-PAH1 expression in HEK293T cells and primary neurons, and efficiently transduced hippocampal neurons in vivo. mRNA expression analysis revealed an increased expression of several neuronal genes in the hippocampi of mice expressing the open probe. AAV-transduced mice received a single dose of kainic acid (KA), a treatment known to induce a transient increase of REST levels in the hippocampus. Remarkably, mice expressing the active variant displayed a reduced number of KA-induced seizures, which were less severe compared to mice carrying the inactive probe. These data support the validity of our tool to modulate REST activity in vivo and the potential impact of REST modulation on epileptogenesis.</p>

<p>Proper transport of the Parkinson’s disease (PD) protein, α-synuclein (α-syn), is thought to be crucial for its localization and function at the synapse. Previous work has shown that defects in long distance transport within narrow caliber axons occur early in PD, but how such defects contribute to PD is unknown. Here we test the hypothesis that the NAC region is involved in facilitating proper transport of α-syn within axons via its association with membranes. Excess α-syn or fPD mutant α-syn<sup>A53T</sup> accumulates within larval axons perturbing the transport of synaptic proteins. These α-syn expressing larvae also show synaptic morphological and larval locomotion defects, which correlate with the extent of α-syn-mediated axonal accumulations. Strikingly, deletion of the NAC region (α-syn<sup>Δ71–82</sup>) prevented α-syn accumulations and axonal blockages, and reduced its synaptic localization due to decreased axonal entry and axonal transport of α-syn, due to less α-syn bound to membranes. Intriguingly, co-expression α-syn<sup>Δ71–82</sup> with full-length α-syn rescued α-syn accumulations and synaptic morphological defects, and decreased the ratio of the insoluble higher molecular weight (HMW)/soluble low molecular weight (LMW) α-syn, indicating that this region is perhaps important for the dimerization of α-syn on membranes. Together, our observations suggest that under physiological conditions, α-syn associates with membranes via the NAC region, and that too much α-syn perturbs axonal transport via aggregate formation, instigating synaptic and behavioral defects seen in PD.</p>

<p>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and treatment of the brain in aging require the development of new biologic drugs, such as recombinant proteins or gene therapies. Biologics are large molecule therapeutics that do not cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). BBB drug delivery is the limiting factor in the future development of new therapeutics for the brain. The delivery of recombinant protein or gene medicines to the brain is a binary process: either the brain drug developer re-engineers the biologic with BBB drug delivery technology, or goes forward with brain drug development in the absence of a BBB delivery platform. The presence of BBB delivery technology allows for engineering the therapeutic to enable entry into the brain across the BBB from blood. Brain drug development may still take place in the absence of BBB delivery technology, but with a reliance on approaches that have rarely led to FDA approval, e.g., CSF injection, stem cells, small molecules, and others. CSF injection of drug is the most widely practiced approach to brain delivery that bypasses the BBB. However, drug injection into the CSF results in limited drug penetration to the brain parenchyma, owing to the rapid export of CSF from the brain to blood. A CSF injection of a drug is equivalent to a slow intravenous (IV) infusion of the pharmaceutical. Given the profound effect the existence of the BBB has on brain drug development, future drug or gene development for the brain will be accelerated by future advances in BBB delivery technology in parallel with new drug discovery.</p>

<p>Parkinson’s disease (PD), the main risk factor of which is age, is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases, thus presenting a substantial burden on the health of affected individuals as well as an economic burden. Sirtuin 2 (SIRT2), a subtype in the family of sirtuins, belongs to class III histone deacetylases (HDACs). It is known that SIRT2 levels increase with aging, and a growing body of evidence has been accumulating, showing that the activity of SIRT2 mediates various processes involved in PD pathogenesis, including aggregation of α-synuclein (α-syn), microtubule function, oxidative stress, inflammation, and autophagy. There have been conflicting reports about the role of SIRT2 in PD, in that some studies indicate its potential to induce the death of dopaminergic (DA) neurons, and that inhibition of SIRT2 may, therefore, have protective effects in PD. Other studies suggest a protective role of SIRT2 in the context of neuronal damage. As current treatments for PD are directed at alleviating symptoms and are very limited, a comprehensive understanding of the enzymology of SIRT2 in PD may be essential for developing novel therapeutic agents for the treatment of this disease. This review article will provide an update on our knowledge of the structure, distribution, and biological characteristics of SIRT2, and highlight its role in the pathogenesis of PD.</p>

<p>An advanced understanding of the neurophysiologic changes that occur with aging may help improve care for older, vulnerable surgical patients. The objective of this study was to determine age-related changes in cortical connectivity patterns during surgical anesthesia. This was a substudy analysis of a prospective, observational study characterizing cortical connectivity during surgical anesthesia in adult patients (n = 45) via whole-scalp (16-channel) electroencephalography. Functional connectivity was estimated using a weighted phase lag index (wPLI), which was classified into a discrete set of states through k-means analysis. Temporal dynamics were quantified by occurrence rate and state transition probabilities. The mean global connectivity state transition probability [13.4% (±8.1)] was not correlated with age (ρ = 0.100, p = 0.513). Increasing age was inversely correlated with prefrontal-frontal alpha-beta connectivity (ρ = −0.446, p = 0.002) and positively correlated with frontal-parietal theta connectivity (ρ = 0.414, p = 0.005). After adjusting for anesthetic-related confounders, prefrontal-frontal alpha-beta connectivity remained significantly associated with age (β = −0.625, 95% CI −0.99 to −0.26; p = 0.001), while frontal-parietal theta connectivity was no longer significant (β = 0.436, 95% CI −0.03 to 0.90; p = 0.066). Specific transition states were also examined. Between frontal-parietal connectivity states, transitioning from theta-alpha to theta-dominated connectivity positively correlated with age (ρ = 0.545, p = 0.001). Dynamic connectivity states during surgical anesthesia, particularly involving alpha and theta bandwidths, maybe an informative measure to assess neurophysiologic changes that occur with aging.</p>

<p>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a type of incurable neurodegenerative disease that is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ; plaques) and tau hyperphosphorylation as neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in the brain followed by neuronal death, cognitive decline, and memory loss. The high prevalence of AD in the developed world has become a major public health challenge associated with social and economic burdens on individuals and society. Due to there being limited options for early diagnosis and determining the exact pathophysiology of AD, finding effective therapeutic strategies has become a great challenge. Several possible risk factors associated with AD pathology have been identified; however, their roles are still inconclusive. Recent clinical trials of the drugs targeting Aβ and tau have failed to find a cure for the AD pathology. Therefore, effective preventive strategies should be followed to reduce the exponential increase in the prevalence of cognitive decline and dementia, especially AD. Although the search for new therapeutic targets is a great challenge for the scientific community, the roles of lifestyle interventions and nutraceuticals in the prevention of many metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases are highly appreciated in the literature. In this article, we summarize the molecular mechanisms involved in AD pathology and the possible ameliorative action of lifestyle and nutritional interventions including diet, exercise, Calorie restriction (CR), and various bioactive compounds on cognitive decline and dementia. This article will provide insights into the role of non-pharmacologic interventions in the modulation of AD pathology, which may offer the benefit of improving quality of life by reducing cognitive decline and incident AD.</p>

Background<p>Sleep apnea leads to cognitive impairment in older patients, but its association with neurodegeneration remains controversial, and most studies do not distinguish between the more common obstructive form (OSAS) and the rarer central form (CSAS).</p>Objective<p>The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence of the different forms of sleep apnea in a cohort of cognitively impaired elderly patients (&gt;70 years) and to investigate their associations with cognitive deficit, weighted against known risk factors for neurodegeneration.</p>Methods<p>Overnight polygraphy was performed for 76 consecutive patients admitted to our geriatric unit. Their cognitive function was assessed using the Mini Mental-State Exam (MMSE), Mattis Dementia Rating Scale (MDRS) and Stroop test. Multivariable analyses were performed to determine associations between cognitive function and independent variables describing demographics, sleep apnea measures, and cardiovascular risk factors.</p>Results<p>The cohort comprised 58 women and 18 men aged a mean of 84 years (range, 73–96). Sleep apnea syndrome (SAS) was diagnosed in 48 patients (63%), of which 31 (41%) with OSAS and 17 (22%) with CSAS. Multivariable regression analysis revealed that MDRS was lower in patients with OSAS (β = −10.03, p = 0.018), that Stroop Colors and Words delays increased with AHI (β = 0.17, p = 0.030 and β = 0.31, p = 0.047) and that that Stroop Interference delay was higher in patients with CSAS (β = 24.45, p = 0.002).</p>Conclusion<p>Sleep apnea is thus highly prevalent in elderly patients with cognitive impairment. OSAS was associated with lower general cognitive function, while CSAS was only associated with increased Stroop Interference delays. Elderly patients with cognitive deficit could benefit from sleep apnea screening and treatment.</p>

<p>Neuroinflammation accompanies or even precedes the development of cognitive changes in many brain pathologies, including Alzheimer’s disease. Therefore, dampening inflammatory reactions within the brain is a promising strategy for supporting cognitive functions in elderly people and for preventing the development of neurodegenerative disorders. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors containing α7 subunits (α7 nAChRs) are involved in regulating cell survival, inflammation, and memory. The aim of our study was to evaluate the efficiency of α7-specific therapy at different stages of inflammation and to compare the effects of orthosteric agonist PNU282987 and type 2 positive allosteric modulator (PAM) PNU120596 in mice after a single injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The data presented demonstrate that PNU282987 protected mice from LPS-induced impairment of episodic memory by decreasing IL-6 levels in the blood, stabilizing the brain mitochondria and up-regulating the brain α7-, α3-, and α4-containing nAChRs. Such treatment was efficient when given simultaneously with LPS or a week after LPS injection and was not efficient if LPS had been injected 2 months before. PNU120596 also decreased IL-6, stabilized mitochondria and up-regulated the brain nAChRs. However, its memory-improving effect was transient and disappeared after the end of the injection cycle. Moreover, cessation of PNU120596 treatment resulted in a sharp increase in IL-1β and IL-6 levels in the blood. It is concluded that activating α7 nAChRs protects the mouse brain from the pathogenic effect of LPS in the early stages of inflammation but is not efficient when irreversible changes have already occurred. The use of a PAM does not improve the effect of the agonist, possibly potentiates the effect of endogenous agonists, and results in undesirable effects after treatment cessation.</p>

<p>by Vaitea Opuu, Giuliano Nigro, Thomas Gaillard, Emmanuelle Schmitt, Yves Mechulam, Thomas Simonson</p>

Designed enzymes are of fundamental and technological interest. Experimental directed evolution still has significant limitations, and computational approaches are a complementary route. A designed enzyme should satisfy multiple criteria: stability, substrate binding, transition state binding. Such multi-objective design is computationally challenging. Two recent studies used adaptive importance sampling Monte Carlo to redesign proteins for ligand binding. By first flattening the energy landscape of the apo protein, they obtained positive design for the bound state and negative design for the unbound. We have now extended the method to design an enzyme for specific transition state binding, <i>i.e</i>., for its catalytic power. We considered methionyl-tRNA synthetase (MetRS), which attaches methionine (Met) to its cognate tRNA, establishing codon identity. Previously, MetRS and other synthetases have been redesigned by experimental directed evolution to accept noncanonical amino acids as substrates, leading to genetic code expansion. Here, we have redesigned MetRS computationally to bind several ligands: the Met analog azidonorleucine, methionyl-adenylate (MetAMP), and the activated ligands that form the transition state for MetAMP production. Enzyme mutants known to have azidonorleucine activity were recovered by the design calculations, and 17 mutants predicted to bind MetAMP were characterized experimentally and all found to be active. Mutants predicted to have low activation free energies for MetAMP production were found to be active and the predicted reaction rates agreed well with the experimental values. We suggest the present method should become the paradigm for computational enzyme design.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/9IRQvjcfygY" width="1" />

<p>by Anton M. Unakafov, Thomas Schultze, Alexander Gail, Sebastian Moeller, Igor Kagan, Stephan Eule, Fred Wolf</p>

Real-world agents, humans as well as animals, observe each other during interactions and choose their own actions taking the partners’ ongoing behaviour into account. Yet, classical game theory assumes that players act either strictly sequentially or strictly simultaneously without knowing each other’s current choices. To account for action visibility and provide a more realistic model of interactions under time constraints, we introduce a new game-theoretic setting called transparent games, where each player has a certain probability of observing the partner’s choice before deciding on its own action. By means of evolutionary simulations, we demonstrate that even a small probability of seeing the partner’s choice before one’s own decision substantially changes the evolutionary successful strategies. Action visibility enhances cooperation in an iterated coordination game, but reduces cooperation in a more competitive iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma. In both games, “Win–stay, lose–shift” and “Tit-for-tat” strategies are predominant for moderate transparency, while a “Leader-Follower” strategy emerges for high transparency. Our results have implications for studies of human and animal social behaviour, especially for the analysis of dyadic and group interactions.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/HW4BIZgKGSQ" width="1" />

<p>by Henghui Zhu, Hao Liu, Armin Ataei, Yonatan Munk, Thomas Daniel, Ioannis Ch. Paschalidis</p>

We develop a method to learn a bio-inspired motion control policy using data collected from hawkmoths navigating in a virtual forest. A Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework is introduced to model the dynamics of moths and sparse logistic regression is used to learn control policy parameters from the data. The results show that moths do not favor detailed obstacle location information in navigation, but rely heavily on optical flow. Using the policy learned from the moth data as a starting point, we propose an actor-critic learning algorithm to refine policy parameters and obtain a policy that can be used by an autonomous aerial vehicle operating in a cluttered environment. Compared with the moths’ policy, the policy we obtain integrates both obstacle location and optical flow. We compare the performance of these two policies in terms of their ability to navigate in artificial forest areas. While the optimized policy can adjust its parameters to outperform the moth’s policy in each different terrain, the moth’s policy exhibits a high level of robustness across terrains.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/2Zf0ld4qcNU" width="1" />

<p>While BDNF is receiving considerable attention for its role in synaptic plasticity and in nervous system dysfunction, identifying brain circuits involving BDNF-expressing neurons has been challenging. BDNF levels are very low in most brain areas, except for the large mossy fiber terminals in the hippocampus where BDNF accumulates at readily detectable levels. This report describes the generation of a mouse line allowing the detection of single brain cells synthesizing BDNF. A bicistronic construct encoding BDNF tagged with a P2A sequence preceding GFP allows the translation of BDNF and GFP as separate proteins. Following its validation with transfected cells, this construct was used to replace the endogenous <i>Bdnf</i> gene. Viable and fertile homozygote animals were generated, with the GFP signal marking neuronal cell bodies translating the <i>Bdnf</i> mRNA. Importantly, the distribution of immunoreactive BDNF remained unchanged, as exemplified by its accumulation in mossy fiber terminals in the transgenic animals. GFP-labeled neurons could be readily visualized in distinct layers in the cerebral cortex where BDNF has been difficult to detect with currently available reagents. In the hippocampal formation, quantification of the GFP signal revealed that &lt;10% of the neurons do not translate the <i>Bdnf</i> mRNA at detectable levels, with the highest proportion of strongly labeled neurons found in CA3.</p>

Abstract
<p>Cholinergic transmission is essential for adaptive behavior and has been suggested to play a central role in the modulation of brain states by means of the modulation of thalamic neurons. Midbrain cholinergic neurons from the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) and the laterodorsal tegmental nucleus (LDT) provide dense innervation of the thalamus, but a detailed connectivity mapping is missing. Using conditional tracing of midbrain cholinergic axons in the rat, together with a detailed segmentation of thalamic structures, we show that projections arising in PPN and LDT are topographically organized along the entire extent of the thalamus. PPN cholinergic neurons preferentially innervate thalamic relay structures, whereas LDT cholinergic neurons preferentially target thalamic limbic nuclei. Moreover, both PPN and LDT provide a dense innervation of the intralaminar thalamic nuclei. Notably, we observe a differential synaptic density that functionally dissociates between PPN and LDT innervation. Our results show that midbrain cholinergic neurons innervate virtually all thalamic structures and this innervation is functionally segregated.</p>

<p>The pineal gland maintains the circadian rhythm in the body by secreting the hormone melatonin. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease. Pineal gland impairment in AD is widely observed, but no study to date has analyzed the transcriptome in the pineal glands of AD. To establish resources for the study on pineal gland dysfunction in AD, we performed a transcriptome analysis of the pineal glands of AD model mice and compared them to those of wild type mice. We identified the global change of diverse protein-coding RNAs, which are implicated in the alteration in cellular transport, protein transport, protein folding, collagen expression, histone dosage, and the electron transfer system. We also discovered various dysregulated long noncoding RNAs and circular RNAs in the pineal glands of mice with AD. This study showed that the expression of diverse RNAs with important functional implications in AD was changed in the pineal gland of the AD mouse model. The analyzed data reported in this study will be an important resource for future studies to elucidate the altered physiology of the pineal gland in AD.</p>

<p>The tetrameric capsaicin receptor transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) in mammals has evolved the capability to integrate pain signal arising from harmful temperature and chemical irritants. The four repetitions of TRPV1 subunits result in an ion channel with excellent pain sensitivity, allowing this ionotropic receptor to differentiate graded injuries. We manipulated the stoichiometry and relative steric coordination of capsaicin-bound structures at the molecular level to determine the rules by which the receptor codes pain across a broad range of intensities. By introducing capsaicin-insensitive S512F mutant subunits into the TRPV1 channel, we found that binding of the first ligand results in low but clear channel activation. Maximal agonist-induced activation is already apparent in tetramers harboring two or three wild-type TRPV1 subunits, which display comparable activity to wild-type tetramer. The non-vanilloid agonist 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB) differs from that of capsaicin in the TRPV1 channel opening mechanism activating all S512F-mutated TRPV1 channels. Two or more wild-type TRPV1 subunits are also required for full anandamide-induced channel activation, a cannabinoid that shares overlapping binding-pocket to capsaicin. Our results demonstrate that the stoichiometry of TRPV1 activation is conserved for two types of agonists.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01384">Functional Ultrasound (fUS) During Awake Brain Surgery: The Clinical Potential of Intra-Operative Functional and Vascular Brain Mapping</a></h4>

Background and Purpose<p>Oncological neurosurgery relies heavily on making continuous, intra-operative tumor-brain delineations based on image-guidance. Limitations of currently available imaging techniques call for the development of real-time image-guided resection tools, which allow for reliable functional and anatomical information in an intra-operative setting. Functional ultrasound (fUS), is a new mobile neuro-imaging tool with unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution, which allows for the detection of small changes in blood dynamics that reflect changes in metabolic activity of activated neurons through neurovascular coupling. We have applied fUS during conventional awake brain surgery to determine its clinical potential for both intra-operative functional and vascular brain mapping, with the ultimate aim of achieving maximum safe tumor resection.</p>Methods<p>During awake brain surgery, fUS was used to image tumor vasculature and task-evoked brain activation with electrocortical stimulation mapping (ESM) as a gold standard. For functional imaging, patients were presented with motor, language or visual tasks, while the probe was placed over (ESM-defined) functional brain areas. For tumor vascular imaging, tumor tissue (pre-resection) and tumor resection cavity (post-resection) were imaged by moving the hand-held probe along a continuous trajectory over the regions of interest.</p>Results<p>A total of 10 patients were included, with predominantly intra-parenchymal frontal and temporal lobe tumors of both low and higher histopathological grades. fUS was able to detect (ESM-defined) functional areas deep inside the brain for a range of functional tasks including language processing. Brain tissue could be imaged at a spatial and temporal resolution of 300 μm and 1.5–2.0 ms respectively, revealing real-time tumor-specific, and healthy vascular characteristics.</p>Conclusion<p>The current study presents the potential of applying fUS during awake brain surgery. We illustrate the relevance of fUS for awake brain surgery based on its ability to capture both task-evoked functional cortical responses as well as differences in vascular characteristics between tumor and healthy tissue. As current neurosurgical practice is still pre-dominantly leaning on inherently limited pre-operative imaging techniques for tumor resection-guidance, fUS enters the scene as a promising alternative that is both anatomically and physiologically informative.</p>

Introduction<p>Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) is one of the common and burdensome non-motor symptoms of Parkinson’s disease (PD). However, the underlying neuropathology mechanism in PD patients with EDS (PD-EDS) remains unclear. The present study aims to delineate potential locations of structural alteration of subcortical regions in early stage and drug-naïve PD-EDS.</p>Methods<p>The study had 252 patients with PD and 92 matched healthy controls (HC). EDS was estimated with the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, with a cutoff of 10. Ultimately, 59 patients were considered as PD-EDS. The remaining 193 were PD patients without EDS (PD-nEDS). FMRIB’s Integrated Registration and Segmentation Tool (FIRST) was employed to assess the volumetric and surface alterations of subcortical nuclei in PD and PD-EDS.</p>Results<p>Volumetric analyses found no difference in the subcortical nucleus volume between PD and HC, or PD-EDS and PD-nEDS groups. The shape analyses revealed the local atrophic changes in bilateral caudate and right putamen in patients with PD. In addition, the hypertrophic changes were located in the right putamen and left pallidum in PD-EDS than in PD-nEDS.</p>Conclusion<p>Our findings revealed the regional hypertrophy of the striatum in PD-EDS. Our results indicate that local hypertrophic striatum would be a valuable early biomarker for detecting the alteration in PD-EDS. The shape analysis contributes valuable information when investigating PD-EDS.</p>

<p>It was recognized long ago by Seneca through his famous “errare humanum est.” that the human information processing system is intrinsically fallible. What is newer is the fact that, at least in sensorimotor information processing realized under time pressure, errors are largely dealt with by several (psycho)physiological-specific mechanisms: prevention, detection, inhibition, correction, and, if these mechanisms finally fail, strategic behavioral adjustments following errors. In this article, we review several datasets from laboratory experiments, showing that the human information processing system is well equipped not only to detect and correct errors when they occur but also to detect, inhibit, and correct them even before they fully develop. We argue that these (psycho)physiological mechanisms are important to consider when the brain works in everyday settings in order to render work systems more resilient to human errors and, thus, safer.</p>

<p>Prediction errors (PEs) encode representations of rewarding and aversive experiences and are critical to reinforcement processing. The feedback-related negativity (FRN), a component of the event-related potential (ERP) that is sensitive to valenced feedback, is believed to reflect PE signals. Reinforcement is also studied using frontal midline theta (FMΘ) activity, which peaks around the same time as the FRN and increases in response to unexpected events compared to expected events. We recorded EEG while participants completed a monetary incentive delay (MID) task that included positive reinforcement and negative reinforcement conditions with multiple levels of the outcome, as well as control conditions that had no reinforcement value. Despite the overlap of FRN and FMΘ, these measures indexed dissociable cognitive processing. The FRN was sensitive to errors in both positive and negative reinforcement but not in control conditions, while frontal theta instead was sensitive to outcomes in positive reinforcement and control conditions, but not in negative reinforcement conditions. The FRN was sensitive to the point level of feedback in both positive and negative reinforcement, while FMΘ was not influenced by the feedback point level. Results are consistent with recent results indicating that the FRN is influenced by unsigned PEs (i.e., a salience signal). In contrast, we suggest that our findings for frontal theta are consistent with hypotheses suggesting that the neural generators of FMΘ are sensitive to both negative cues and the need for control.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00447">Imaging the Centromedian Thalamic Nucleus Using Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping</a></h4>

<p>The centromedian (CM) nucleus is an intralaminar thalamic nucleus that is considered as a potentially effective target of deep brain stimulation (DBS) and ablative surgeries for the treatment of multiple neurological and psychiatric disorders. However, the structure of CM is invisible on the standard T1- and T2-weighted (T1w and T2w) magnetic resonance images, which hamper it as a direct DBS target for clinical applications. The purpose of the current study is to demonstrate the use of quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) technique to image the CM within the thalamic region. Twelve patients with Parkinson’s disease, dystonia, or schizophrenia were included in this study. A 3D multi-echo gradient recalled echo (GRE) sequence was acquired together with T1w and T2w images on a 3-T MR scanner. The QSM image was reconstructed from the GRE phase data. Direct visual inspection of the CM was made on T1w, T2w, and QSM images. Furthermore, the contrast-to-noise ratios (CNRs) of the CM to the adjacent posterior part of thalamus on T1w, T2w, and QSM images were compared using the one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test. QSM dramatically improved the visualization of the CM nucleus. Clear delineation of CM compared to the surroundings was observed on QSM but not on T1w and T2w images. Statistical analysis showed that the CNR on QSM was significantly higher than those on T1w and T2w images. Taken together, our results indicate that QSM is a promising technique for improving the visualization of CM as a direct targeting for DBS surgery.</p>

<p>The main goal of this study was to examine the effect of long-term meditation practice on behavioral indicators and ERP peak characteristics during an error-recognition task, where participants were presented with emotionally negative (evoking anxiety or aggression) written sentences describing self-related or non-self-related emotional state and personality traits. In total, 200 sentences written in Russian with varying emotional coloring were presented during the task, with half of the sentences containing a grammatical error that the participants were asked to identify. The EEG was recorded in age-matched control individuals (n = 17) and two groups of Samatha meditators with relatively short- (3–5 years’ experience, n = 18) and long-term (10–30 years’ experience, n = 18) practice experience. Task performance time (TPT) and accuracy of error detection (AED) were chosen as behavioral values. Amplitude, time latency and cortical distribution of P300 and P600 peaks of ERP were used as a value of speech-related brain activity. All statistical effects of meditation were estimated, controlling for age and sex. No behavioral differences between two groups of meditators were found. General TPT was shorter for both groups of meditators compared to the control group. Non-meditators reacted significantly slower to sentences about aggression than to sentences about anxiety or non-emotional sentences, whereas no significance was found between meditator groups. Non-meditators had better AED for the sentences about one-self than for the sentences about other people, whereas the meditators did not show any significant difference. The amplitude of P300 peak in frontal and left temporal scalp regions was higher for long-term meditators in comparison with both intermediate and control groups. The latency of P300 and P600 in left frontal and temporal regions positively correlated with TPT, whereas the amplitude of P300 in these regions had a negative correlation with TPT. We demonstrate that long-term meditation practice increases the ability of an individual to process negative emotional stimuli. The differences in behavioral reactions after onset of negative information that was self-related and non-self-related, which is typical for non-meditators, disappeared due to the influence of meditation. ERP results could be interpreted as a value of increase in voluntary control over emotional state during meditational practice.</p>

<p>Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a deeply enigmatic psychiatric condition associated with immense suffering worldwide. Efficacious therapies for OCD, like exposure and response prevention (ERP), are sometimes poorly tolerated by patients. As many as 25% of patients refuse to initiate ERP mainly because they are too anxious to follow exposure procedures. Accordingly, we proposed a simple and tolerable (immersive yet indirect) low-cost technique for treating OCD that we call “multisensory stimulation therapy.” This method involves contaminating a rubber hand during the so-called “rubber hand illusion” (RHI) in which tactile sensations may be perceived as arising from a fake hand. Notably, Jalal et al. (2015) showed that such fake hand contamination during the RHI provokes powerful disgust reactions in healthy volunteers. In the current study, we explored the therapeutic potential of this novel approach. OCD patients (n = 29) watched as their hidden real hand was being stroked together with a visible fake hand; either synchronously (inducing the RHI; i.e., the experimental condition; n = 16) or asynchronously (i.e., the control condition; n = 13). After 5 min of tactile stimulation, the rubber hand was contaminated with fake feces, simulating conventional exposure therapy. Intriguingly, results suggested sensory assimilation of contamination sensations into the body image via the RHI: patients undergoing synchronous stimulation did not report greater contamination sensations when the fake hand was initially contaminated relative to asynchronous stroking. But contrary to expectations, they did so after the rubber hand had been contaminated for 5 min, as assessed via disgust facial expressions (a secondary outcome) and in vivo exposure (upon discontinuing the illusion). Further, to our surprise, synchronous and asynchronous stroking induced an equally vivid and fast-emerging illusion, which helps explain why both conditions initially (5 min after initiating tactile stimulation) provoked contamination reactions of equal magnitude. This study is the first to suggest heightened malleability of body image in OCD. Importantly, it may pave the way for a tolerable technique for the treatment of OCD—highly suitable for poorly resourced and emergency settings, including low-income and developing countries with minimal access to high-tech solutions like virtual reality.</p>

<p>Successive patterns of activation and deactivation in local areas of the brain indicate the mechanisms of information processing in the brain. It is possible that this process can be optimized by principles, such as the maximization of mutual information and the minimization of energy consumption. In the present paper, I showed evidence for this argument by demonstrating the correlation among mutual information, the energy of the activation, and the activation patterns. Modeling the information processing based on the functional connectome datasets of the human brain, I simulated information transfer in this network structure. Evaluating the statistical quantities of the different network states, I clarified the correlation between them. First, I showed that mutual information and network energy have a close relationship, and that the values are maximized and minimized around a same network state. This implies that there is an optimal network state in the brain that is organized according to the principles regarding mutual information and energy. On the other hand, the evaluation of the network structure revealed that the characteristic network structure known as the criticality also emerges around this state. These results imply that the characteristic features of the functional network are also affected strongly by these principles. To assess the functional aspects of this state, I investigated the output activation patterns in response to random input stimuli. Measuring the redundancy of the responses in terms of the number of overlapping activation patterns, the results indicate that there is a negative correlation between mutual information and the redundancy in the patterns, suggesting that there is a trade-off between communication efficiency and robustness due to redundancy, and the principles of mutual information and network energy are important to network formation and its function in the human brain.</p>

<p>The cholinergic system plays an essential role in central respiratory control, but the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. We used whole-cell recordings in brainstem slices from juvenile mice expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) under the control of the glycine transporter type 2 (GlyT<sub>2</sub>) promoter, to examine muscarinic modulation of morphologically identified glycinergic neurons in the preBötzinger complex (preBötC), an area critical for central inspiratory rhythm generation. Biocytin-filled reconstruction of glycinergic neurons revealed that the majority of them had few primary dendrites and had axons arborized within their own dendritic field. Few glycinergic neurons had axon collaterals extended towards the premotor/motor areas or ran towards the contralateral preBötC, and had more primary dendrites and more compact dendritic trees. Spontaneously active glycinergic neurons fired regular spikes, or less frequently in a “burst-like” pattern at physiological potassium concentration. Muscarine suppressed firing in the majority of regular spiking neurons via M<sub>2</sub> receptor activation while enhancing the remaining neurons through M<sub>1</sub> receptors. Interestingly, rhythmic bursting was augmented by muscarine in a small group of glycinergic neurons. In contrast to its heterogeneous modulation of glycinergic neuronal excitability, muscarine generally depressed inhibitory and excitatory synaptic inputs onto both glycinergic and non-glycinergic preBötC neurons, with a stronger effect on inhibitory input. Notably, presynaptic muscarinic attenuation of excitatory synaptic input was dependent on M<sub>1</sub> receptors in glycinergic neurons and on M<sub>2</sub> receptors in non-glycinergic neurons. Additional field potential recordings of excitatory synaptic potentials in the M<sub>2</sub> receptor knockout mice indicate that glycinergic and non-glycinergic neurons contribute equally to the general suppression by muscarine of excitatory activity in preBötC circuits. In conclusion, our data show that preBötC glycinergic neurons are morphologically heterogeneous, and differ in the properties of synaptic transmission and muscarinic modulation in comparison to non-glycinergic neurons. The dominant and cell-type-specific muscarinic inhibition of synaptic neurotransmission and spiking may contribute to central respiratory disturbances in high cholinergic states.</p>

<p>Human intelligence has been theorized since the ancient Greeks. Plato and Aristotle incorporated theories of human intelligence into their metaphysical and cosmological theories which informed the social and medical sciences for centuries. With the advent of the 20th century, human intelligence became increasingly standardized based on Intelligence Quotients (IQ). Moreover, multiple theories of human intelligence were posited on morphological features of the human brain, focusing on cranial volume and size of the pre-frontal cortex which was suggestive of superior human cognitive abilities. This article argues that fixation with anatomical features of the brain was tended to ignore the importance of neuro-hormonal regulation which is a more appropriate indicator of human cognitive abilities. The article challenges the correlation between brain size and human cognitive abilities while offering an alternate theory of human cognitive abilities which emphasizes the roles of neurotransmitters, neurotrophins, and enteric gut microbiome (EGM) regulation.</p>

Background<p>Brain reserve can be defined as the individual variation in the brain structural characteristics that later in life are likely to modulate cognitive performance. Late midlife represents a point in aging where some structural brain imaging changes have become manifest but the effects of cognitive aging are minimal, and thus may represent an ideal opportunity to determine the relationship between risk factors and brain imaging biomarkers of reserve.</p>Objective<p>We aimed to assess neuroimaging measures from multiple modalities to broaden our understanding of brain reserve, and the late midlife risk factors that may make the brain vulnerable to age related cognitive disorders.</p>Methods<p>We examined multimodal [structural and diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), FDG PET] neuroimaging measures in 50–65 year olds to examine the associations between risk factors (Intellectual/Physical Activity: education-occupation composite, physical, and cognitive-based activity engagement; General Health Factors: presence of cardiovascular and metabolic conditions (CMC), body mass index, hemoglobin A1c, smoking status (ever/never), CAGE Alcohol Questionnaire (&gt;2, yes/no), Beck Depression Inventory score), brain reserve measures [Dynamic: genu corpus callosum fractional anisotropy (FA), posterior cingulate cortex FDG uptake, superior parietal cortex thickness, AD signature cortical thickness; Static: intracranial volume], and cognition (global, memory, attention, language, visuospatial) from a population-based sample. We quantified dynamic proxies of brain reserve (cortical thickness, glucose metabolism, microstructural integrity) and investigated various protective/risk factors.</p>Results<p>Education-occupation was associated with cognition and total intracranial volume (static measure of brain reserve), but was not associated with any of the dynamic neuroimaging biomarkers. In contrast, many general health factors were associated with the dynamic neuroimaging proxies of brain reserve, while most were not associated with cognition in this late middle aged group.</p>Conclusion<p>Brain reserve, as exemplified by the four dynamic neuroimaging features studied here, is itself at least partly influenced by general health status in midlife, but may be largely independent of education and occupation.</p>

<p>“Practice makes perfect” is a principle widely applied when one is acquiring a new sensorimotor skill to cope with challenges from a new environment. In terms of oral healthcare, the traditional view holds that restoring decayed structures is one of the primary aims of treatment. This assumes that the patient’s oromotor functions would be recovered back to normal levels after the restoration. However, in older patients, such a structural–functional coupling after dental treatment shows a great degree of individual variations. For example, after prosthodontic treatment, some patients would adapt themselves quickly to the new dentures, while others would not. In this Focused Review, I argue that the functional aspects of adaptation—which would be predominantly associated with the brain mechanisms of cognitive processing and motor learning—play a critical role in the individual differences in the adaptive behaviors of oromotor functions. This thesis is critical to geriatric oral healthcare since the variation in the capacity of cognitive processing and motor learning is critically associated with aging. In this review, (a) the association between aging and the brain-stomatognathic axis will be introduced; (b) the brain mechanisms underlying the association between aging, compensatory behavior, and motor learning will be briefly summarized; (c) the neuroimaging evidence that suggests the role of cognitive processing and motor learning in oromotor functions will be summarized, and critically, the brain mechanisms underlying mastication and swallowing in older people will be discussed; and (d) based on the current knowledge, an experimental framework for investigating the association between aging and the functional adaptation of oromotor functions will be proposed. Finally, I will comment on the practical implications of this framework and postulate questions open for future research.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/IJDwP90wTvI/article">The origin of biological homochirality along with the origin of life</a></h4>

<p>by Yong Chen, Wentao Ma</p>

How homochirality concerning biopolymers (DNA/RNA/proteins) could have originally occurred (i.e., arisen from a non-life chemical world, which tended to be chirality-symmetric) is a long-standing scientific puzzle. For many years, people have focused on exploring plausible physic-chemical mechanisms that may have led to prebiotic environments biased to one chiral type of monomers (e.g., D-nucleotides against L-nucleotides; L-amino-acids against D-amino-acids)–which should have then assembled into corresponding polymers with homochirality, but as yet have achieved no convincing advance. Here we show, by computer simulation–with a model based on the RNA world scenario, that the biased-chirality may have been established at polymer level instead, just deriving from a racemic mixture of monomers (i.e., equally with the two chiral types). In other words, the results suggest that the homochirality may have originated along with the advent of biopolymers during the origin of life, rather than somehow at the level of monomers before the origin of life.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/IJDwP90wTvI" width="1" />

<p>Spinal cord injury (SCI) disrupts critical physiological systems, including the cardiovascular and immune system. Plasticity of spinal circuits below the injury results in abnormal, heightened sympathetic responses, such as extreme, sudden hypertension that hallmarks life-threatening autonomic dysreflexia. Moreover, such sympathetic hyperreflexia detrimentally impacts other effector organs, including the spleen, resulting in spinal cord injury-induced immunodeficiency. Consequently, infection is a leading cause of mortality after SCI. Unfortunately, there are no current treatments that prophylactically limit sympathetic hyperreflexia to prevent subsequent effector organ dysfunction. The cytokine soluble tumor necrosis factor α (sTNFα) is upregulated in the CNS within minutes after SCI and remains elevated. Here, we report that commencing intrathecal administration of XPro1595, an inhibitor of sTNFα, at a clinically feasible, postinjury time point (i.e., 3 d after complete SCI) sufficiently diminishes maladaptive plasticity within the spinal sympathetic reflex circuit. This results in less severe autonomic dysreflexia, a real-time gauge of sympathetic hyperreflexia, for months postinjury. Remarkably, delayed delivery of the sTNFα inhibitor prevents sympathetic hyperreflexia-associated splenic atrophy and loss of leukocytes to dramatically improve the endogenous ability of chronic SCI rats to fight off pneumonia, a common cause of hospitalization after injury. The improved immune function with XPro1595 correlates with less noradrenergic fiber sprouting and normalized norepinephrine levels in the spleen, indicating that heightened, central sTNFα signaling drives peripheral, norepinephrine-mediated organ dysfunction, a novel mechanism of action. Thus, our preclinical study supports intrathecally targeting sTNFα as a viable strategy to broadly attenuate sympathetic dysregulation, thereby improving cardiovascular regulation and immunity long after SCI.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Spinal cord injury (SCI) significantly disrupts immunity, thus increasing susceptibility to infection, a leading cause of morbidity in those living with SCI. Here, we report that commencing intrathecal administration of an inhibitor of the proinflammatory cytokine soluble tumor necrosis factor α days after an injury sufficiently diminishes autonomic dysreflexia, a real time gauge of sympathetic hyperreflexia, to prevent associated splenic atrophy. This dramatically improves the endogenous ability of chronically injured rats to fight off pneumonia, a common cause of hospitalization. This preclinical study could have a significant impact for broadly improving quality of life of SCI individuals.</p>

<p>α-Synuclein (α-Syn) accumulation is a pathological hallmark of Parkinson's disease. Duplications and triplications of <i>SNCA</i>, the gene coding for α-Syn, cause genetic forms of the disease, which suggests that increased α-Syn dosage can drive PD. To identify the proteins that regulate α-Syn, we previously performed a screen of potentially druggable genes that led to the identification of 60 modifiers. Among them, Doublecortin-like kinase 1 (DCLK1), a microtubule binding serine threonine kinase, emerged as a promising target due to its potent effect on α-Syn and potential druggability as a neuron-expressed kinase. In this study, we explore the relationship between DCLK1 and α-Syn in human cellular and mouse models of PD. First, we show that DCLK1 regulates α-Syn levels post-transcriptionally. Second, we demonstrate that knockdown of <i>Dclk1</i> reduces phosphorylated species of α-Syn and α-Syn-induced neurotoxicity in the SNc in two distinct mouse models of synucleinopathy. Last, silencing <i>DCLK1</i> in human neurons derived from individuals with <i>SNCA</i> triplications reduces phosphorylated and total α-Syn, thereby highlighting DCLK1 as a potential therapeutic target to reduce pathological α-Syn in disease.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> DCLK1 regulates α-Syn protein levels, and <i>Dclk1</i> knockdown rescues α-Syn toxicity in mice. This study provides evidence for a novel function for DCLK1 in the mature brain, and for its potential as a new therapeutic target for synucleinopathies.</p>

<p>Field potentials (FPs) are easily reached signals that provide information about the brain’s processing. However, FP should be interpreted cautiously since their biophysical bases are complex. The lateral habenula (LHb) is a brain structure involved in the encoding of aversive motivational values. Previous work indicates that the activity of the LHb is relevant for hippocampal-dependent learning. Moreover, it has been proposed that the interaction of the LHb with the hippocampal network is evidenced by the synchronization of LHb and hippocampal FPs during theta rhythm. However, the origin of the habenular FP has not been analyzed. Hence, its validity as a measurement of LHb activity has not been proven. In this work, we used electrophysiological recordings in anesthetized rats and feed-forward modeling to investigate biophysical basis of the FP recorded in the LHb. Our results indicate that the FP in the LHb during theta rhythm is a volume-conducted signal from the hippocampus. This result highlight that FPs must be thoroughly analyzed before its biological interpretation and argues against the use of the habenular FP signal as a readout of the activity of the LHb.</p>

<p>Dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons process pain signaling through specialized nociceptors located in their peripheral endings. It has long been established low voltage-activated (LVA) Ca<sub>V</sub>3.2 calcium channels control neuronal excitability during sensory perception in these neurons. Silencing Ca<sub>V</sub>3.2 activity with antisense RNA or genetic ablation results in anti-nociceptive, anti-hyperalgesic and anti-allodynic effects. Ca<sub>V</sub>3.2 channels are regulated by many proteins (Weiss and Zamponi, 2017), including KLHL1, a neuronal actin-binding protein that stabilizes channel activity by recycling it back to the plasma membrane through the recycling endosome. We explored whether manipulation of KLHL1 levels and thereby function as a Ca<sub>V</sub>3.2 modifier can modulate DRG excitability and mechanical pain transmission or sensitivity to pain. We first assessed the mechanical sensitivity threshold and DRG properties in the KLHL1 KO mouse model. KO DRG neurons exhibited smaller T-type current density compared to WT without significant changes in voltage dependence, as expected in the absence of its modulator. Western blot analysis confirmed Ca<sub>V</sub>3.2 but not Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1, Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3, Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1, or Ca<sub>V</sub>2.2 protein levels were significantly decreased; and reduced neuron excitability and decreased pain sensitivity were also found in the KLHL1 KO model. Analogously, transient down-regulation of KLHL1 levels in WT mice with viral delivery of anti-KLHL1 shRNA also resulted in decreased pain sensitivity. These two experimental approaches confirm KLHL1 as a physiological modulator of excitability and pain sensitivity, providing a novel target to control peripheral pain.</p>

<p>Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a common age-related neurodegenerative disorder with disabling motor symptoms and no available disease modifying treatment. The majority of the PD cases are of unknown etiology, with both genetics and environment playing important roles. Over the past 25 years, however, genetic analysis of patients with familial history of Parkinson’s and, latterly, genome wide association studies (GWAS) have provided significant advances in our understanding of the causes of the disease. These genetic insights have uncovered pathways that are affected in both genetic and sporadic forms of PD. These pathways involve oxidative stress, abnormal protein homeostasis, mitochondrial dysfunction, and lysosomal defects. In addition, newly identified PD genes and GWAS nominated genes point toward synaptic changes involving vesicles. This review will highlight the genes that contribute PD risk relating to intracellular vesicle trafficking and their functional consequences. There is still much to investigate on this newly identified and converging pathway of vesicular dynamics and PD, which will aid in better understanding and suggest novel therapeutic strategies for PD patients.</p>

<p>The invention of representational similarity analysis [RSA, following multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA)] has allowed cognitive neuroscientists to identify the representational structure of multiple brain regions, moving beyond functional localization. By comparing these structures, cognitive neuroscientists can characterize how brain areas form functional networks. Univariate analysis (UNIVAR) and functional connectivity analysis (FCA) are two other popular methods to identify functional networks. Despite their popularity, few studies have examined the relationship between networks from RSA with those from UNIVAR and FCA. Thus, the aim of the current study is to examine the similarities between neural networks derived from RSA with those from UNIVAR and FCA to explore how these methods relate to each other. We analyzed the data of a previously published study with the three methods and compared the results by performing (partial) correlation and multiple regression analysis. Our findings reveal that neural networks resulting from RSA, UNIVAR, and FCA methods are highly similar to each other even after ruling out the effect of anatomical proximity between the network nodes. Nevertheless, the neural network from each method shows unique organization that cannot be explained by any of the other methods. Thus, we conclude that the RSA, UNIVAR and FCA methods provide similar but not identical information on how brain regions are organized in functional networks.</p>

<p>Orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is implicated in multiple cognitive processes, including inhibitory control, context memory, recency judgment, and choice behavior. Despite an emerging understanding of the role of OFC in memory and executive control, its necessity for core working memory (WM) operations remains undefined. Here, we assessed the impact of OFC damage on interference effects in WM using a Recent Probes task based on the Sternberg item-recognition task (1966). Subjects were asked to memorize a set of letters and then indicate whether a probe letter was presented in a particular set. Four conditions were created according to the forthcoming response (“yes”/“no”) and the recency of the probe (presented in the previous trial set or not). We compared behavioral and electroencephalography (EEG) responses between healthy subjects (n = 14) and patients with bilateral OFC damage (n = 14). Both groups had the same recency pattern of slower reaction time (RT) when the probe was presented in the previous trial but not in the current one, reflecting the proactive interference (PI). The within-group electrophysiological results showed no condition difference during letter encoding and maintenance. In contrast, event-related potentials (ERPs) to probes showed distinct within-group condition effects, and condition by group effects. The response and recency effects for controls occurred within the same time window (300–500 ms after probe onset) and were observed in two distinct spatial groups including right centro-posterior and left frontal electrodes. Both clusters showed ERP differences elicited by the response effect, and one cluster was also sensitive to the recency manipulation. Condition differences for the OFC group involved two different clusters, encompassing only left hemisphere electrodes and occurring during two consecutive time windows (345–463 ms and 565–710 ms). Both clusters were sensitive to the response effect, but no recency effect was found despite the behavioral recency effect. Although the groups had different electrophysiological responses, the maintenance of letters in WM, the evaluation of the context of the probe, and the decision to accept or reject a probed letter were preserved in OFC patients. The results suggest that neural reorganization may contribute to intact recency judgment and response after OFC damage.</p>

<p>Pentraxins are a superfamily of evolutionarily conserved proteins that are characterized by their multimeric architecture and their calcium-dependent binding. They can be broadly grouped into two subfamilies: short pentraxins and long pentraxins. Pentraxins regulate many processes in the brain as well as the periphery. Neuronal pentraxin 2 (NP2/NPTX2), also known as neuronal activity-regulated pentraxin (Narp), is an immediate-early gene that has been shown to play a critical role in guiding synaptic plasticity. NP2 has been previously linked to excitatory neurotransmission, based on its ability to aggregate excitatory receptors in the central nervous system. The mechanisms mediating the effects of NP2 on excitatory neurotransmission remain unclear and warrants further investigation. This review article focuses on the biological features of NP2 and discusses the literature supporting a role for NP2 and other pentraxins in glutamatergic signaling. An analysis of evidence around the role of pentraxins in neuropathology is also reviewed.</p>

<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory demyelinating disorder in the central nervous system (CNS), in which remyelination failure results in persistent neurologic impairment. Ginkgolide B (GB), a major terpene lactone and active component of Ginkgo biloba, has neuroprotective effects in several models of neurological diseases. Here, our results show, by using an in vivo cuprizone (CPZ)-induced demyelinating model, administration of GB improved behavior abnormalities, promoted myelin generation, and significantly regulated the dynamic balance of microglia and astrocytes by inhibiting the expression of TLR4, NF-κB and iNOS as well as IL-1β and TNF-α, and up-regulating the expression of Arg-1 and neurotrophic factors. GB treatment also induced the generation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs). In vitro cell experiments yielded the results similar to those of the in vivo model. The dynamic balance by decreasing microglia-mediated neuroinflammation and promoting astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factors should contribute to endogenous remyelination. Despite GB treatment may represent a novel strategy for promoting myelin recovery, the precise mechanism of GB targeting microglia and astrocytes remains to be further explored.</p>

<p>Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia. Amyloid β-peptide (Aβ) deposition is a major neuropathologic feature of AD. When unfolded or misfolded proteins accumulate in mitochondria, the unfolded protein responses (UPRmt) is initiated. Numerous lines of evidence show that AD pathogenesis involves mitochondrial dysfunction. However little is known about whether the UPRmt is engaged in the process of AD development. In this study, we investigated the UPRmt in mouse and cell models of AD. We found that UPRmt was activated in the brain of 3 and 9 months old APP/PS1 mice, and in the SHSY5Y cells after exposure to Aβ<sub>25–35</sub>, Aβ<sub>25–35</sub> triggered UPRmt in SHSY5Y cells could be attenuated upon administration of simvastatin or siRNA for HMGCS-1 to inhibit the mevalonate pathway, and or upon knocking down Serine palmitoyltransferase long chain subunit 1 (SPTLC-1) to lower sphingolipid biosynthesis. We observed that inhibition of UPRmt aggravated cytotoxic effects of Aβ<sub>25–35</sub> in SHSY5Y cells. Our research suggests that the UPRmt activation and two pathways necessary for this response, and further provides evidence for the cytoprotective effect of UPRmt during the AD process.</p>

<p>PSD-Zip70 is a postsynaptic protein that regulates glutamatergic synapse formation and maturation by modulation of Rap2 activity. PSD-Zip70 knockout (PSD-Zip70KO) mice exhibit defective glutamatergic synaptic transmission in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) with aberrant Rap2 activation. As prefrontal dysfunction is implicated in the pathophysiology of stress-induced psychiatric diseases, we examined PSD-Zip70KO mice in a social defeat (SD) stress-induced mouse model of depression to investigate stress-induced alterations in synaptic function. Compared with wild-type (WT) mice, PSD-Zip70KO mice exhibited almost normal responses to SD stress in depression-related behaviors such as social activity, anhedonia, and depressive behavior. However, PSD-Zip70KO mice showed enhanced anxiety-like behavior irrespective of stress conditions. The density and size of dendritic spines of pyramidal neurons were reduced in the medial PFC (mPFC) in mice exposed to SD stress. Phosphorylation levels of the AMPA–type glutamate receptor (AMPA-R) GluA2 subunit at Ser880 were prominently elevated in mice exposed to SD stress, indicating internalization of surface-expressed AMPA-Rs and decreased postsynaptic responsiveness. Structural and functional impairments in postsynaptic responsiveness were associated with Rap2 GTPase activation in response to SD stress. Social stress-induced Rap2 activation was regulated by a PSD-Zip70-dependent pathway via interaction with SPAR/PDZ-GEF1. Notably, features such as Rap2 activation, dendritic spine shrinkage, and increased GluA2 phosphorylation were observed in the mPFC of PSD-Zip70KO mice even without SD stress. Together with our previous results, the present findings suggest that SD stress-induced postsynaptic hyporesponsiveness in glutamatergic synapses is mediated by PSD-Zip70-Rap2 signaling pathway and closely relates to anxiety-like behaviors.</p>

<p>Reelin is a large extracellular matrix (ECM) glycoprotein secreted by several neuronal populations in a specific manner in both the developing and the adult central nervous system. The extent of Reelin protein distribution and its functional role in the adult neocortex is well documented in different mammal models. However, its role in the adult spinal cord has not been well characterized and its distribution in the rodent spinal cord is fragmentary and has not been investigated in carnivores or primates as of yet. To gain insight into which neuronal populations and specific circuits may be influenced by Reelin in the adult spinal cord, we have conducted light and confocal microscopy study analysis of Reelin-immunoreactive cell types in the adult spinal cord. Here, we describe and compare Reelin immunoreactive cell type and distribution in the spinal cord of adult non-human primate (macaque monkeys, Macaca mulatta), carnivore (ferret, Mustela putorius) and rodent (rat, Rattus norvegicus). Our results show that in all three species studied, Reelin-immunoreactive neurons are present in the intermediate gray matter, ventricular zone and superficial dorsal horn and intermedio-lateral nucleus, while positive cells in the Clarke nucleus are only found in rats and primates. In addition, Reelin intermediolateral neurons colocalize with choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) only in macaque whilst motor neurons also colocalize Reelin and ChAT in macaque, ferret and rat spinal cord. The different expression patterns might reflect a differential role for Reelin in the pathways involved in the coordination of locomotor activity in the fore- and hind limbs.</p>

<p>How aging concomitantly modulates the structural integrity of the brain and retina in healthy individuals remains an outstanding question. Given the strong bottom-up retinocortical connectivity, it is important to study how these structures co-evolve during healthy aging in order to unravel mechanisms that may affect the physiological integrity of both structures. For the 56 participants in the study, primary visual cortex (BA17), as well as frontal, parietal and temporal regions thicknesses were measured in T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and retinal macular thickness (10 neuroretinal layers) was measured by optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging. We investigated the statistical association of these measures and their age dependence. We found an age-related decay of primary visual cortical thickness that was significantly correlated with a decrease in global and multiple layer retinal thicknesses. The atrophy of both structures might jointly account for the decline of various visual capacities that accompany the aging process. Furthermore, associations with other cortical regions suggest that retinal status may index cortical integrity in general.</p>

<p>Age-related brain changes likely contribute to mobility impairments, but the specific mechanisms are poorly understood. Current brain measurement approaches (e.g., functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), PET) are limited by inability to measure activity from the whole brain during walking. The Mind in Motion Study will use cutting edge, mobile, high-density electroencephalography (EEG). This approach relies upon innovative hardware and software to deliver three-dimensional localization of active cortical and subcortical regions with good spatial and temporal resolution during walking. Our overarching objective is to determine age-related changes in the central neural control of walking and correlate these findings with a comprehensive set of mobility outcomes (clinic-based, complex walking, and community mobility measures). Our hypothesis is that age-related walking deficits are explained in part by the Compensation Related Utilization of Neural Circuits Hypothesis (CRUNCH). CRUNCH is a well-supported model that describes the over-recruitment of brain regions exhibited by older adults in comparison to young adults, even at low levels of task complexity. CRUNCH also describes the limited brain reserve resources available with aging. These factors cause older adults to quickly reach a ceiling in brain resources when performing tasks of increasing complexity, leading to poor performance. Two hundred older adults and twenty young adults will undergo extensive baseline neuroimaging and walking assessments. Older adults will subsequently be followed for up to 3 years. Aim 1 will evaluate whether brain activity during actual walking explains mobility decline. Cross sectional and longitudinal designs will be used to study whether poorer walking performance and steeper trajectories of decline are associated with CRUNCH indices. Aim 2 is to harmonize high-density EEG during walking with fNIRS (during actual and imagined walking) and fMRI (during imagined walking). This will allow integration of CRUNCH-related hallmarks of brain activity across neuroimaging modalities, which is expected to lead to more widespread application of study findings. Aim 3 will study central and peripheral mechanisms (e.g., cerebral blood flow, brain regional volumes, and connectivity, sensory function) to explain differences in CRUNCH indices during walking. Research performed in the Mind in Motion Study will comprehensively characterize the aging brain during walking for developing new intervention targets.</p>

In this issue of Neuron, Joffe et al. (2020) assess the antidepressant-relevant effects and underlying neural mechanisms of negative allosteric modulators selective for either metabotropic glutamate receptors 2 (mGlu2) or 3 (mGlu3). Negative modulation of both receptors enhanced excitatory glutamatergic input to mouse prefrontal cortex pyramidal cells, leading to antidepressant-relevant actions.

<p>Publication date: October 2020</p><p><b>Source:</b> Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 64</p><p>Author(s): Matthieu Louis</p><div><p>The neural logic underlying the conversion of non-stationary (dynamic) olfactory inputs into odor-search behaviors has been difficult to crack due to the distributed nature of the olfactory code — food odors typically co-activate multiple olfactory sensory neurons. In the <em>Drosophila</em> larva, the activity of a single olfactory sensory neuron is sufficient to direct accurate reorientation maneuvers in odor gradients (chemotaxis). In this reduced sensory system, a descending pathway essential for larval chemotaxis has been delineated from the peripheral olfactory system down to the premotor system. Here, I review how anatomical and functional inspections of this pathway have advanced our understanding of the neural mechanisms that convert behaviorally relevant sensory signals into orientation responses.</p></div>

Nagel</p><div><p>Spatial navigation is influenced by cues from nearly every sensory modality and thus provides an excellent model for understanding how different sensory streams are integrated to drive behavior. Here we review recent work on multisensory control of navigation in the model organism <em>Drosophila melanogaster</em>, which allows for detailed circuit dissection. We identify four modes of integration that have been described in the literature—suppression, gating, summation, and association—and describe regions of the larval and adult brain that have been implicated in sensory integration. Finally we discuss what circuit architectures might support these different forms of integration. We argue that <em>Drosophila</em> is an excellent model to discover these circuit and biophysical motifs</p></div>

<p>This article presents an integrative model of effortful control, a resource-limited top-down control mechanism involved in mental tasks and physical exercises. Based on recent findings in the fields of neuroscience, social psychology and cognitive psychology, this model posits the intrinsic costs related to a weakening of the connectivity of neural networks underpinning effortful control as the main cause of mental fatigue in long and high-demanding tasks. In this framework, effort reflects three different inter-related aspects of the same construct. First, effort is a mechanism comprising a limited number of interconnected processing units that integrate information regarding the task constraints and subject’s state. Second, effort is the main output of this mechanism, namely, the effort signal that modulates neuronal activity in brain regions involved in the current task to select pertinent information. Third, effort is a feeling that emerges in awareness during effortful tasks and reflects the costs associated with goal-directed behavior. Finally, the model opens new avenues for research investigating effortful control at the behavioral and neurophysiological levels.</p>

<p>Neuronal firing rate variability prior to movement onset contributes to trial-to-trial variability in primate behavior. However, in humans, whether similar mechanisms contribute to trial-to-trial behavioral variability remains unknown. We investigated the time-course of trial-to-trial variability in corticospinal excitability (CSE) using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) during a self-paced reach-to-grasp task. We hypothesized that CSE variability will be modulated prior to the initiation of reach and that such a modulation would explain trial-to-trial behavioral variability. Able-bodied individuals were visually cued to plan their grip force before exertion of either 30% or 5% of their maximum pinch force capacity on an object. TMS was delivered at six time points (0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3 s) following a visual cue that instructed the force level. We first modeled the relation between CSE magnitude and its variability at rest (n = 12) to study the component of CSE variability pertaining to the task but not related to changes in CSE magnitude (n = 12). We found an increase in CSE variability from 1.2 to 1.3 s following the visual cue at 30% but not at 5% of force. This effect was temporally dissociated from the decrease in CSE magnitude that was observed from 0.5 to 0.75 s following the cue. Importantly, the increase in CSE variability explained at least ∼40% of inter-individual differences in trial-to-trial variability in time to peak force rate. These results were found to be repeatable across studies and robust to different analysis methods. Our findings suggest that the neural mechanisms underlying modulation in CSE variability and CSE magnitude are distinct. Notably, the extent of modulation in variability in corticospinal system prior to grasp within individuals may explain their trial-to-trial behavioral variability.</p>

<p>Exposure to opioids reshapes future reward and motivated behaviors partially by altering the functional output of medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the nucleus accumbens shell. Here, we investigated how morphine, a highly addictive opioid, alters synaptic transmission and intrinsic excitability on dopamine D1-receptor (D1R) expressing and dopamine D2-receptor (D2R) expressing MSNs, the two main output neurons in the nucleus accumbens shell. Using whole-cell electrophysiology recordings, we show, that 24 h abstinence following repeated non-contingent administration of morphine (10 mg/kg, i.p.) in mice reduces the miniature excitatory postsynaptic current (mEPSC) frequency and miniature inhibitory postsynaptic current (mIPSC) frequency on D2R-MSNs, with concomitant increases in D2R-MSN intrinsic membrane excitability. We did not observe any changes in synaptic or intrinsic changes on D1R-MSNs. Last, in an attempt to determine the integrated effect of the synaptic and intrinsic alterations on the overall functional output of D2R-MSNs, we measured the input-output efficacy by measuring synaptically-driven action potential firing. We found that both D1R-MSN and D2R-MSN output was unchanged following morphine treatment.</p>

<p>The stria vascularis (SV) generates the endocochlear potential (EP) in the inner ear and is necessary for proper hair cell mechanotransduction and hearing. While channels belonging to SV cell types are known to play crucial roles in EP generation, relatively little is known about gene regulatory networks that underlie the ability of the SV to generate and maintain the EP. Using single cell and single nucleus RNA-sequencing, we identify and validate known and rare cell populations in the SV. Furthermore, we establish a basis for understanding molecular mechanisms underlying SV function by identifying potential gene regulatory networks as well as druggable gene targets. Finally, we associate known deafness genes with adult SV cell types. This work establishes a basis for dissecting the genetic mechanisms underlying the role of the SV in hearing and will serve as a basis for designing therapeutic approaches to hearing loss related to SV dysfunction.</p>

<p>Sickness behavior is a set of behavioral changes induced by infections and mediated by pro-inflammatory cytokines. It is characterized by fatigue, decreased appetite and weight loss, changes in sleep patterns, cognitive functions, and lost interest in social activity. It can expedite recovery by conserving energy to mount an immune response involving innate immunity. To provide insights into microglial implication in sickness behavior with special focus on cognitive and social impairment, we investigated changes in their ultrastructure and interactions with synapses using a toxemia mouse model. Adult mice were injected with 1 mg/kg lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or saline, and assayed for signs of sickness behavior. LPS treated mice displayed reduced activity in open-field tests 24 h post-injection, while social avoidance and weight gain/loss were not significantly different between treatment groups. Microglia were investigated using electron microscopy to describe changes in their structure and function at nanoscale resolution. Microglial cell bodies and processes were investigated in the hippocampus CA1, a region responsible for learning and memory that is often impacted after peripheral LPS administration. Microglia in LPS treated animals displayed larger cell bodies as well as less complex processes at the time point examined. Strikingly, microglial processes in LPS injected animals were also more likely to contact excitatory synapses and contained more phagocytic material compared with saline injected controls. We have identified at the ultrastructural level significant changes in microglia-synapse interactions shortly after LPS administration, which draws attention to studying the roles of microglia in synaptic rewiring after inflammatory stimuli.</p>

<p>Previous studies have shown that tool use affects the plasticity of the body schema. In other words, people will perceive the tool as a part of their body, and thus feel like they have “longer limbs” after using tools. However, it is unclear whether tool embodiment could spread to a limb that is not using the tool, and whether other limbs could utilize the proprioception of a limb. In Experiment 1, blindfolded participants were asked to search with a cane (Condition 1) or to walk with a cane (Condition 2). The results in Condition 1 illustrated that the tactile distance perception on the forearm was lengthened after tool use, while other body parts did not significantly change. In Condition 2, the tactile distance perception on the hand and forearm extended significantly after using tools. Additionally, tool-use training even induced an increased perception of the calf that was not using the tool. Possible interference from the difference between walking and standing was excluded in Experiment 2. These results demonstrate that the proprioception information of one limb could be exploited by another limb to extend the body schema even though that limb was not using a tool. It was also observed that the effect of direction was task-dependent in the tactile perception task.</p>

<p>An important challenge in segmenting real-world biomedical imaging data is the presence of multiple disease processes within individual subjects. Most adults above age 60 exhibit a variable degree of small vessel ischemic disease, as well as chronic infarcts, which will manifest as white matter hyperintensities (WMH) on brain MRIs. Subjects diagnosed with gliomas will also typically exhibit some degree of abnormal T2 signal due to WMH, rather than just due to tumor. We sought to develop a fully automated algorithm to distinguish and quantify these distinct disease processes within individual subjects’ brain MRIs. To address this multi-disease problem, we trained a 3D U-Net to distinguish between abnormal signal arising from tumors vs. WMH in the 3D multi-parametric MRI (mpMRI, i.e., native T1-weighted, T1-post-contrast, T2, T2-FLAIR) scans of the International Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) 2018 dataset (n<sub>training</sub> = 285, n<sub>validation</sub> = 66). Our trained neuroradiologist manually annotated WMH on the BraTS training subjects, finding that 69% of subjects had WMH. Our 3D U-Net model had a 4-channel 3D input patch (80 × 80 × 80) from mpMRI, four encoding and decoding layers, and an output of either four [background, active tumor (AT), necrotic core (NCR), peritumoral edematous/infiltrated tissue (ED)] or five classes (adding WMH as the fifth class). For both the four- and five-class output models, the median Dice for whole tumor (WT) extent (i.e., union of AT, ED, NCR) was 0.92 in both training and validation sets. Notably, the five-class model achieved significantly (p = 0.002) lower/better Hausdorff distances for WT extent in the training subjects. There was strong positive correlation between manually segmented and predicted volumes for WT (r = 0.96) and WMH (r = 0.89). Larger lesion volumes were positively correlated with higher/better Dice scores for WT (r = 0.33), WMH (r = 0.34), and across all lesions (r = 0.89) on a log(10) transformed scale. While the median Dice for WMH was 0.42 across training subjects with WMH, the median Dice was 0.62 for those with at least 5 cm<sup>3</sup> of WMH. We anticipate the development of computational algorithms that are able to model multiple diseases within a single subject will be a critical step toward translating and integrating artificial intelligence systems into the heterogeneous real-world clinical workflow.</p>

<p>The processing of odor input in the brain begins in the olfactory bulb (OB), where odor information is represented by combinations of active glomeruli. Each glomerulus is associated with a specific odorant receptor type, of which there are ~1,000 in mice; thus different odors activate different subsets of glomeruli. Most receptor types have duplicate lateral and medial glomeruli in each of the left and right OBs. The two sets of glomeruli form separate but mirror-symmetric glomerular maps. It is not known whether the odor representations in these paired maps are exact copies of each other or potentially encode additional information. Previous studies of glomerular odor representations were mostly limited to the lateral map because the medial map is inaccessible with high-resolution activity mapping techniques, such as optical imaging. To address this, we developed a method for optical imaging of the medial bulb by replacing the contralateral bulb with a right-angle prism that has a mirror coating on the hypotenuse. With this method, we performed calcium imaging of corresponding subsets of glomeruli in the lateral map at the dorsal surface and the medial map at the medial wall. Thus, we demonstrate an experimental model system for comparing odor representations in these redundant sensory maps, enabling a better understanding of the role of paired maps and the neuronal coding of odor stimuli.</p>

<p>Neurotransmitters and their receptors are key molecules of signal transduction and subject to various changes during pre- and postnatal development. Previous studies addressed ontogeny at the level of neurotransmitters and expression of neurotransmitter receptor subunits. However, developmental changes in receptor densities to this day are not well understood. Here, we analyzed developmental changes in excitatory glutamate and inhibitory γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors in adjacent sections of the rat brain by means of quantitative in vitro receptor autoradiography. Receptor densities of the ionotropic glutamatergic receptors α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA), kainate and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) as well as of the ionotropic GABA<sub>A</sub> and metabotropic GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors were investigated using specific high-affinity ligands. For each receptor binding site, significant density differences were demonstrated in the investigated regions of interest [olfactory bulb, striatum, hippocampus, and cerebellum] and developmental stages [postnatal day (P) 0, 10, 20, 30 and 90]. In particular, we showed that the glutamatergic and GABAergic receptor densities were already present between P0 and P10 in all regions of interest, which may indicate the early relevance of these receptors for brain development. A transient increase of glutamatergic receptor densities in the hippocampus was found, indicating their possible involvement in synaptic plasticity. We demonstrated a decline of NMDA receptor densities in the striatum and hippocampus from P30 to P90, which could be due to synapse elimination, a process that redefines neuronal networks in postnatal brains. Furthermore, the highest increase in GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor densities from P10 to P20 coincides with the developmental shift from excitatory to inhibitory GABA transmission. Moreover, the increase from P10 to P20 in GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor densities in the cerebellum corresponds to a point in time when functional GABAergic synapses are formed. Taken together, the present data reveal differential changes in glutamate and GABA receptor densities during postnatal rat brain development, which may contribute to their specific functions during ontogenesis, thus providing a deeper understanding of brain ontogenesis and receptor function.</p>

<p>The application of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over the primary motor cortex (M1) could influence the intrinsic brain activity in the sensorimotor network (SMN). However, how rTMS modulates the topological organization of the SMN remains unclear. In this study, we employed resting-state fMRI to investigate the topological alterations in the functional SMN after application of different frequency rTMS over the left M1. To accomplish this, we collected MRI data from 45 healthy participants who were randomly divided into three groups based on rTMS frequency (HF, high-frequency 3 Hz; LF, low-frequency 1 Hz; and SHAM). Individual large-scale functional SMN was constructed by correlating the mean time series among 29 regions of interest (ROI) in the SMN and was fed into graph-based network analyses at multiple levels of global organization and nodal centrality. Our results showed that compared with the network metrics before rTMS stimulation, the left paracentral lobule (PCL) exhibited reduced nodal degree and betweenness centrality in the LF group after rTMS, while the right supplementary motor area (SMA) exhibited reduced nodal betweenness centrality in the HF group after rTMS. Moreover, rTMS-related alterations in nodal metrics might have been attributable to the changes in connectivity patterns and local activity of the affected nodes. These findings reflected the potential of using rTMS over M1 as an effective intervention to promote motor function rehabilitation.</p>

<p>Tongue exercise programs are used clinically for dysphagia in aged individuals and have been shown to improve lingual strength. However, the neural mechanisms of age-related decline in swallowing function and its association with lingual strength are not well understood. Using an established rat model of aging and tongue exercise, we hypothesized that the motor cortex of aged rats would have a smaller lingual motor map area than young adult rats and would increase in size as a function of tongue exercise. Over 8 weeks, rats either underwent a progressive resistance tongue exercise program (TE), learned the task but did not exercise (trained controls, TC), or were naïve untrained controls (UC). Cortical motor map areas for tongue and jaw were determined using intracortical microstimulation (ICMS). Rats in the TE and TC groups had a significantly larger motor cortex region for the tongue than the UC group. Lingual cortical motor area was not correlated with protrusive tongue force gains and did not differ significantly with age. These results suggest that learning a novel tongue force skill was sufficient to induce plasticity of the lingual motor cortex yet increasing tongue strength with progressive resistance exercise did not significantly expand the lingual motor area beyond the gains that occurred through the skilled learning component.</p>

<p>A variety of anatomical alterations have been reported in the hippocampal formation of patients with Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and these alterations have been correlated with cognitive symptoms in the early stages of the disease. Major hallmarks in AD are the presence of paired helical filaments of tau protein (PHF<sub>Tau</sub>) within neurons, also known as neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), and aggregates of amyloid-β protein (Aβ) which form plaques in the extracellular space. Nevertheless, how the density of plaques and NFTs relate to the severity of cell loss and cognitive decline is not yet clear. The aim of the present study was to further examine the possible relationship of both Aβ plaques and NFTs with neuronal loss in several hippocampal fields (DG, CA3, CA1, and subiculum) of 11 demented AD patients. For this purpose, using stereological techniques, we compared neuronal densities (Nissl-stained, and immunoreactive neurons for NeuN) with: (i) numbers of neurons immunostained for two isoforms of PHF<sub>Tau</sub> (PHF<sub>Tau-AT8</sub> and PHF<sub>Tau-pS396</sub>); and (ii) number of Aβ plaques. We found that CA1 showed the highest number of NFTs and Aβ plaques, whereas DG and CA3 displayed the lowest number of these markers. Furthermore, AD patients showed a variable neuronal loss in CA1 due to tangle-related cell death, which seems to correlate with the presence of extracellular tangles.</p>

<p>Object: There is an increasing interest in preoperative diffusion tensor imaging-based fiber tracking (DTI-FT) to preserve function during surgeries in motor eloquent brain regions. However, DTI tractography is challenged by inherent presumptions during particular tracking steps [e.g., deterministic vs. probabilistic DTI, fractional anisotropy (FA) and fiber length (FL) thresholding] and the missing “ground truth” information. In the present study, we intended to establish an objective, neurophysiology-driven approach for parameter selection during DTI-FT of the corticospinal tract integrating both imaging and neurophysiological information.</p><p>Methods: In ten patients with lesions in eloquent motor areas, preoperative navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS) was performed, followed by individual deterministic DTI-FT from a grid of cortical seed points. We investigated over 300 combinations of FA and FL thresholds and applied subsequently a multidimensional mathematical modeling of this empirical data. Optimal DTI parameters were determined by the relationship between DTI-FT (i.e., number of fibers, NoF) and nTMS (i.e., amplitudes of motor-evoked potentials) results. Finally, neurophysiological DTI parameters and the resulting tractography were compared to the current standard approaches of deterministic DTI fiber tracking with a 75% and 50% FA and a FL threshold of 110 mm as well as with intraoperative direct cortical and subcortical stimulation.</p><p>Results: There was a good goodness-of-fit for the mathematical model (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.68 ± 0 13; range: 0.59–0.97; n = 8) except of two cases. Neurophysiology-driven parameter selection showed a high correlation between DTI-FT and nTMS results (r = 0.73 ± 0.16; range: 0.38–0.93). In comparison to the standard approach, the mathematically calculated thresholds resulted in a higher NoF in 75% of patients. In 50% of patients this approach helped to clarify the exact tract location or to detect additional functional tracts, which were not identified by the standard approach. This was confirmed by direct cortical or subcortical stimulation.</p><p>Conclusion: The present study evaluates a novel user-independent method to extract objective DTI-FT parameters that were completely based on neurophysiological data. The findings suggest that this method may improve the specificity and sensitivity of DTI-FT and thereby overcome the disadvantages of current approaches.</p>

Many behaviors promote reproduction or food finding. These critical functions of behavior can conflict; successful reproductive strategies can grow populations to the point where food is depleted. In this issue of Neuron, Wu et al. (2019) show how the nematode C. elegans detects crowding to change feeding behavior by coupling pheromone sensing to signaling via insulin-like peptides.

In this issue of Neuron, O’Sullivan et al. (2019) measured electro-cortical responses to “cocktail party” speech mixtures in neurosurgical patients and demonstrated that the selective enhancement of attended speech is achieved through the adaptive weighting of primary auditory cortex output by non-primary auditory cortex.

Dysregulated mTOR contributes to neurodevelopmental dysfunction. A new study (Chen et al., 2019) demonstrates that suppression of mTORC2, not mTORC1, ameliorates survival, seizures, and abnormal behaviors in a Pten mutant model, highlighting mTORC2 as a potential therapeutic target in mTORopathies.

In this issue of Neuron, Fossati et al. (2019) report a new constellation of players regulating inhibitory synaptogenesis. They show that GluD1, through a non-canonical ionotropic-independent mechanism, controls GABAergic synapse formation via trans-synaptic interactions mediated by extracellular cerebellin-4. They identify ARHGEF12 and PPP1R12A as GluD1 intracellular interactors and downstream effectors.

Neuron recently published a study that studied human post-mortem brain samples to determine whether there is an association between herpes virus abundance and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) (Readhead et al., 2018). We assigned the paper to students in our computational biology course because it employed a variety of statistical analyses, which we thought would provide good practice. As we and the students looked more closely at the paper, however, we noticed that the most significant associations seemed to be between viral abundance and “AD possible” rather than “AD definite” samples (Readhead et al., 2018).

<p>Barring a few studies, there are not enough established treatments to improve upper limb motor function in patients with severe impairments due to chronic stroke. This study aimed to clarify the effect of the kinesthetic perceptional illusion induced by visual stimulation (KINVIS) on upper limb motor function and the relationship between motor function and resting-state brain networks. Eleven patients with severe paralysis of upper limb motor function in the chronic phase (seven men and four women; age: 54.7 ± 10.8 years; 44.0 ± 29.0 months post-stroke) participated in the study. Patients underwent an intervention consisting of therapy using KINVIS and conventional therapeutic exercise (TherEX) for 10 days. Our originally developed KiNvis™ system was applied to induce KINVIS while watching the movement of the artificial hand. Clinical outcomes were examined to evaluate motor functions and resting-state brain functional connectivity (rsFC) by analyzing blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The outcomes of motor function (Fugle-Meyer Assessment, FMA) and spasticity (Modified Ashworth Scale, MAS) significantly improved after the intervention. The improvement in MAS scores for the fingers and the wrist flexors reached a minimum of clinically important differences. Before the intervention, strong and significant negative correlations between the motor functions and rsFC of the inferior parietal lobule (IPL) and premotor cortex (PMd) in the unaffected hemisphere was demonstrated. These strong correlations were disappeared after the intervention. A negative and strong correlation between the motor function and rsFC of the bilateral inferior parietal sulcus (IPS) significantly changed to strong and positive correlation after the intervention. These results may suggest that the combination approach of KINVIS therapy and TherEX improved motor functions and decreased spasticity in the paralyzed upper extremity after stroke in the chronic phase, possibly indicating the contribution of embodied-visual stimulation. The rsFC for the interhemispheric IPS and intrahemispheric IPL and PMd may be a possible regulatory factor for improving motor function and spasticity.</p><p>Clinical Trial Registration: www.ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier NCT01274117.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2019.00074">Principles of Neurorehabilitation After Stroke Based on Motor Learning and Brain Plasticity Mechanisms</a></h4>

<p>What are the principles underlying effective neurorehabilitation? The aim of neurorehabilitation is to exploit interventions based on human and animal studies about learning and adaptation, as well as to show that the activation of experience-dependent neuronal plasticity augments functional recovery after stroke. Instead of teaching compensatory strategies that do not reduce impairment but allow the patient to return home as soon as possible, functional recovery might be more sustainable as it ensures a long-term reduction in impairment and an improvement in quality of life. At the same time, neurorehabilitation permits the scientific community to collect valuable data, which allows inferring about the principles of brain organization. Hence neuroscience sheds light on the mechanisms of learning new functions or relearning lost ones. However, current rehabilitation methods lack the exact operationalization of evidence gained from skill learning literature, leading to an urgent need to bridge motor learning theory and present clinical work in order to identify a set of ingredients and practical applications that could guide future interventions. This work aims to unify the neuroscientific literature relevant to the recovery process and rehabilitation practice in order to provide a synthesis of the principles that constitute an effective neurorehabilitation approach. Previous attempts to achieve this goal either focused on a subset of principles or did not link clinical application to the principles of motor learning and recovery. We identified 15 principles of motor learning based on existing literature: massed practice, spaced practice, dosage, task-specific practice, goal-oriented practice, variable practice, increasing difficulty, multisensory stimulation, rhythmic cueing, explicit feedback/knowledge of results, implicit feedback/knowledge of performance, modulate effector selection, action observation/embodied practice, motor imagery, and social interaction. We comment on trials that successfully implemented these principles and report evidence from experiments with healthy individuals as well as clinical work.</p>

<p>α-Synuclein (α-Syn) forms toxic intracellular protein inclusions and transmissible amyloid structures in Parkinson’s disease (PD). Preventing α-Syn self-assembly has become one of the most promising approaches in the search for disease-modifying treatments for this neurodegenerative disorder. Here, we describe the capacity of a small molecule (ZPD-2), identified after a high-throughput screening, to inhibit α-Syn aggregation. ZPD-2 inhibits the aggregation of wild-type α-Syn and the A30P and H50Q familial variants in vitro at substoichiometric compound:protein ratios. In addition, the molecule prevents the spreading of α-Syn seeds in protein misfolding cyclic amplification assays. ZPD-2 is active against different α-Syn strains and blocks their seeded polymerization. Treating with ZPD-2 two different PD Caenorhabditis elegans models that express α-Syn either in muscle or in dopaminergic (DA) neurons substantially reduces the number of α-Syn inclusions and decreases synuclein-induced DA neurons degeneration. Overall, ZPD-2 is a hit compound worth to be explored in order to develop lead molecules for therapeutic intervention in PD.</p>

<p>Transactive response DNA binding protein (TDP-43) is a key player in neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we have gathered and presented structural information on the different regions of TDP-43 with high resolution structures available. A thorough understanding of TDP-43 structure, effect of modifications, aggregation and sites of localization is necessary as we develop therapeutic strategies targeting TDP-43 for neurodegenerative diseases. We discuss how different domains as well as post-translational modification may influence TDP-43 overall structure, aggregation and droplet formation. The primary aim of the review is to utilize structural insights as we develop an understanding of the deleterious behavior of TDP-43 and highlight locations of established and proposed post-translation modifications. TDP-43 structure and effect on localization is paralleled by many RNA-binding proteins and this review serves as an example of how structure may be modulated by numerous compounding elements.</p>

<p>In the sensory cortex, cross-modal interaction occurs during the early cortical stages of processing; however, its effect on the speed of neuronal activity remains unclear. In this study, we used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to investigate whether tactile stimulation influences auditory steady-state responses (ASSRs). To this end, a 0.5-ms electrical pulse was randomly presented to the dorsum of the left or right hand of 12 healthy volunteers at 700 ms while a train of 25-ms pure tones were applied to the left or right side at 75 dB for 1,200 ms. Peak latencies of 40-Hz ASSR were measured. Our results indicated that tactile stimulation significantly shortened subsequent ASSR latency. This cross-modal effect was observed from approximately 50 ms to 125 ms after the onset of tactile stimulation. The somatosensory information that appeared to converge on the auditory system may have arisen during the early processing stages, with the reduced ASSR latency indicating that a new sensory event from the cross-modal inputs served to increase the speed of ongoing sensory processing. Collectively, our findings indicate that ASSR latency changes are a sensitive index of accelerated processing.</p>

<p>Hypothalamic dysfunction is a key pathological factor in inflammation-associated depression. In the present study, isobaric tags for relative-absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) combined with mass spectrometry and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) were employed to detect the proteomes and metabolomes in the hypothalamus of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced depression mouse, respectively. A total of 187 proteins and 27 metabolites were differentially expressed compared with the control group. Following the integration of bi-omics data, pertinent pathways and molecular interaction networks were further identified. The results indicated altered molecules were clustered into Ephrin receptor signaling, glutamatergic transmission, and inflammation-related signaling included the LXR/RXR activation, FXR/RXR activation, and acute phase response signaling. First discovered in the hypothalamus, Ephrin receptor signaling regulates N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-predominant glutamatergic transmission, and further acted on AKT signaling that contributed to changes in hypothalamic neuroplasticity. Ephrin type-B receptor 2 (EPHB2), a transmembrane receptor protein in Ephrin receptor signaling, was significantly elevated and interacted with the accumulated NMDAR subunit GluN2A in the hypothalamus. Additionally, molecules involved in synaptic plasticity regulation, such as hypothalamic postsynaptic density protein-95 (PSD-95), p-AKT and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), were significantly altered in the LPS-induced depressed group. It might be an underlying pathogenesis that the EPHB2-GluN2A-AKT cascade regulates synaptic plasticity in depression. EPHB2 can be a potential therapeutic target in the correction of glutamatergic transmission dysfunction. In summary, our findings point to the previously undiscovered molecular underpinnings of the pathophysiology in the hypothalamus of inflammation-associated depression and offer potential targets to develop antidepressants.</p>

<p>Neuropathic pain (NP) is an intractable disease accompanying with allodynia, hyperalgesia and spontaneous pain. Accumulating evidence suggested that large volume of neurotransmitters, genes, and signaling pathways were implicated with the initiation and development of NP, while the underlying mechanism still remained poorly understood. Therefore, it was extremely important to further elucidate the potential regulatory networks for developing appropriate treatment options. Here, the RNA-Seq high-throughput sequencing was employed to determine the genes expression change in mice undergoing spinal nerve ligation (SNL). Meanwhile, the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were analyzed by using integrated Differential Expression and Pathway analysis (iDEP) tools and String database. Then, quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was employed to detect the expression of hub gens. The results showed that the DEGs mainly comprised 1712 upregulated and 1515 downregulated genes at 7 days, and consisted of 243 upregulated and 357 downregulated genes at 28 days after surgery, respectively. Additionally, 133 genes and two pathways including retrograde endocannabinoid signaling and cardiac muscle contraction collectively participated in biological reactions of 7th and 28th day after operation. Moreover, the results showed that the mRNA and protein expression of Ccl5, Cacna2d1, Cacna2d2, Cacnb2, Gabrb3, GluA1, and GluA2 were significantly upregulated in SNL-7/28d group than that of in Sham-7/28d group (SNL-7d vs. Sham-7d; SNL-28d vs. Sham-28d; P &lt; 0.05). And the level of Glra2, Glra4, Glra3, Grik1, Grik2, NR1, NR2A, and NR2B was obviously increased in SNL-7d group compared to Sham-7d group (P &lt; 0.05), but which was no statistical difference between SNL-28d group and Sham-28d group. Therefore, these results provided new perspectives and strategies for deeply illuminating the underlying mechanism, and identifying the key elements for treating NP.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01352">Autophagy and LRRK2 in the Aging Brain</a></h4>

<p>Autophagy is a highly conserved process by which long-lived macromolecules, protein aggregates and dysfunctional/damaged organelles are delivered to lysosomes for degradation. Autophagy plays a crucial role in regulating protein quality control and cell homeostasis in response to energetic needs and environmental challenges. Indeed, activation of autophagy increases the life-span of living organisms, and impairment of autophagy is associated with several human disorders, among which neurodegenerative disorders of aging, such as Parkinson’s disease. These disorders are characterized by the accumulation of aggregates of aberrant or misfolded proteins that are toxic for neurons. Since aging is associated with impaired autophagy, autophagy inducers have been viewed as a strategy to counteract the age-related physiological decline in brain functions and emergence of neurodegenerative disorders. Parkinson’s disease is a hypokinetic, multisystemic disorder characterized by age-related, progressive degeneration of central and peripheral neuronal populations, associated with intraneuronal accumulation of proteinaceous aggregates mainly composed by the presynaptic protein α-synuclein. α-synuclein is a substrate of macroautophagy and chaperone-mediated autophagy (two major forms of autophagy), thus impairment of its clearance might favor the process of α-synuclein seeding and spreading that trigger and sustain the progression of this disorder. Genetic factors causing Parkinson’s disease have been identified, among which mutations in the LRRK2 gene, which encodes for a multidomain protein encompassing central GTPase and kinase domains, surrounded by protein-protein interaction domains. Six LRRK2 mutations have been pathogenically linked to Parkinson’s disease, the most frequent being the G2019S in the kinase domain. LRRK2-associated Parkinson’s disease is clinically and neuropathologically similar to idiopathic Parkinson’s disease, also showing age-dependency and incomplete penetrance. Several mechanisms have been proposed through which LRRK2 mutations can lead to Parkinson’s disease. The present article will focus on the evidence that LRRK2 and its mutants are associated with autophagy dysregulation. Studies in cell lines and neurons in vitro and in LRRK2 knock-out, knock-in, kinase-dead and transgenic animals in vivo will be reviewed. The role of aging in LRRK2-induced synucleinopathy will be discussed. Possible mechanisms underlying the LRRK2-mediated control over autophagy will be analyzed, and the contribution of autophagy dysregulation to the neurotoxic actions of LRRK2 will be examined.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01350">Diminished Expression of P-glycoprotein Using Focused Ultrasound Is Associated With JNK-Dependent Signaling Pathway in Cerebral Blood Vessels</a></h4>

<p>MRI-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) combined with microbubbles (MBs) is a promising technology that can facilitate drug delivery through a temporarily disrupted blood-brain barrier (BBB) and induce the down-regulation of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) expression on the blood vessels. Despite the increasing evidence regarding the down-regulation of P-gp expression after MRgFUS BBB disruption (BBBD), its underlying molecular events remain unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the underlying mechanism of FUS BBBD-mediated P-gp down-regulation. While our results showed down-regulation of P-gp at 24 h post-BBBD in transcriptional and translational levels, restoration to the normal expression appeared at different time points for transcriptional (72 h) and translational (120 h) levels. In addition, the signaling molecule, JNK, was significantly activated in the cerebral blood vessels at 24 h post-BBBD. Although P-gp levels were significantly decreased, the expression levels of proteins involved in the integrity of blood vessels, such as Glut1, ZO-1 and occludin, were not decreased at 24 h post-BBBD. Our study suggests that the JNK signaling pathway is involved in the regulation of FUS-induced P-gp expression, without affecting vessel integrity, and a detailed regulatory mechanism can provide the basis for clinical application of FUS to the treatment of neurological disease.</p>

<p>Intracortical electrodes for brain–machine interfaces rely on intimate contact with tissues for recording signals and stimulating neurons. However, the long-term viability of intracortical electrodes in vivo is poor, with a major contributing factor being the development of a glial scar. In vivo approaches for evaluating responses to intracortical devices are resource intensive and complex, making statistically significant, high throughput data difficult to obtain. In vitro models provide an alternative to in vivo studies; however, existing approaches have limitations which restrict the translation of the cellular reactions to the implant scenario. Notably, there is no current robust model that includes astrocytes, microglia, oligodendrocytes and neurons, the four principle cell types, critical to the health, function and wound responses of the central nervous system (CNS). In previous research a co-culture of primary mouse mature mixed glial cells and immature neural precursor cells were shown to mimic several key properties of the CNS response to implanted electrode materials. However, the method was not robust and took up to 63 days, significantly affecting reproducibility and widespread use for assessing brain-material interactions. In the current research a new co-culture approach has been developed and evaluated using immunocytochemistry and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). The resulting method reduced the time in culture significantly and the culture model was shown to have a genetic signature similar to that of healthy adult mouse brain. This new robust CNS culture model has the potential to significantly improve the capacity to translate in vitro data to the in vivo responses.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01333">Depression Affects Intrinsic Brain Activity in Patients With Mild Cognitive Impairment</a></h4>

<p>Numerous observational studies have shown that depressive symptoms are common in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) who have a higher rate of progress to dementia. However, it is still uncertain whether there are any differences between MCI patients with and without depression symptom in their brain function activities. Here we have identified the brain function activity differences in two groups of MCI patients (with depression or without depression) using the resting state MRI (rsfMRI) measurements. 76 right-handed MCI subjects have been recruited in this study, including 27 MCI patients with depression symptom (MCID), 49 MCI patients without depression symptom (MCIND). Analyses based on 7 rsfMRI measurements, including four static measurements (ALFF, fALFF, PerAF, and ReHo) and three dynamic measurements (dALFF, dfALFF, and dReHo) have been used to explore the temporal variability of intrinsic brain activity. No significant differences in ALFF and dALFF between the two group were found. In the MCID group, fALFF decreased in temporal gyrus, frontal gyrus, inferior occipital gyrus, middle frontal gyrus and cerebellum, but increased in cuneus, calcarine, lingual; while PerAF increased in left parahippocampus. The differences of ReHo in the two groups was only found in cerebellum. Compared to MCIND group, dfALFF in MCID decreased in cuneus, occipital gyrus and calcarine, while dReHo in MCID increased in bilateral temporal gyrus, frontal gyrus, superior parietal gyrus, inferior parietal gyrus and precuneus. Our results may provide a better understanding in the relationship between the depressive symptoms and memory deficits.</p>

<p>As part of a larger study examining relationships between taste properties and swallowing, we assessed the influence of genetic taster status (GTS) on measures of brain activity and swallowing physiology during taste stimulation in healthy men and women. Twenty-one participants underwent videofluoroscopic swallowing study (VFSS) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during trials of high-intensity taste stimuli. The precisely formulated mixtures included sour, sweet-sour, lemon, and orange taste profiles and unflavored controls. Swallowing physiology was characterized via computational analysis of swallowing mechanics plus other kinematic and temporal measures, all extracted from VFSS recordings. Whole-brain analysis of fMRI data assessed blood oxygen responses to neural activity associated with taste stimulation. Swallowing morphometry, kinematics, temporal measures, and neuroimaging analysis revealed differential responses by GTS. Supertasters exhibited increased amplitude of most pharyngeal movements, and decreased activity in the primary somatosensory cortex compared to nontasters and midtasters. These preliminary findings suggest baseline differences in swallowing physiology and the associated neural underpinnings associated with GTS. Given the potential implications for dysphagia risk and recovery patterns, GTS should be included as a relevant variable in future research regarding swallowing function and dysfunction.</p>

<p>Chronic pain is known as a complex disease due to its comorbidities with other symptoms and the lack of effective treatments. As a consequence, chronic pain seems to be under-diagnosed in more than 75% of patients. At the same time, the advance in brain imaging, the popularization of machine learning techniques and the development of new diagnostic tools based on these technologies have shown that these tools could be an option in supporting decision-making of healthcare professionals. In this study, we computed functional brain connectivity using resting-state fMRI data from one hundred and fifty participants to assess the performance of different machine learning models, including deep learning (DL) neural networks in classifying chronic pain patients and pain-free controls. The best result was obtained by training a convolutional neural network fed with data preprocessed using the MSDL probabilistic atlas and using the dynamic time warping (DTW) as connectivity measure. DL models had a better performance compared to other less costly models such as support vector machine (SVM) and RFC, with balanced accuracy ranged from 69 to 86%, while the area under the curve (ROC) ranged from 0.84 to 0.93. Also, DTW overperformed correlation as connectivity measure. These findings support the notion that resting-state fMRI data could be used as a potential biomarker of chronic pain conditions.</p>

<p>In biomedical research, cell analysis is important to assess physiological and pathophysiological information. Virtual microscopy offers the unique possibility to study the compositions of tissues at a cellular scale. However, images acquired at such high spatial resolution are massive, contain complex information, and are therefore difficult to analyze automatically. In this article, we address the problem of individualization of size-varying and touching neurons in optical microscopy two-dimensional (2-D) images. Our approach is based on a series of processing steps that incorporate increasingly more information. (1) After a step of segmentation of neuron class using a Random Forest classifier, a novel min-max filter is used to enhance neurons’ centroids and boundaries, enabling the use of region growing process based on a contour-based model to drive it to neuron boundary and achieve individualization of touching neurons. (2) Taking into account size-varying neurons, an adaptive multiscale procedure aiming at individualizing touching neurons is proposed. This protocol was evaluated in 17 major anatomical regions from three NeuN-stained macaque brain sections presenting diverse and comprehensive neuron densities. Qualitative and quantitative analyses demonstrate that the proposed method provides satisfactory results in most regions (e.g., caudate, cortex, subiculum, and putamen) and outperforms a baseline Watershed algorithm. Neuron counts obtained with our method show high correlation with an adapted stereology technique performed by two experts (respectively, 0.983 and 0.975 for the two experts). Neuron diameters obtained with our method ranged between 2 and 28.6 μm, matching values reported in the literature. Further works will aim to evaluate the impact of staining and interindividual variability on our protocol.</p>

Recently, there has been a renewed focus exploring the concept that the nervous system also communicates across biological systems. Specifically, several high profile studies have recently highlighted the importance of neuro-immune communication in the context of homeostasis, central nervous system disorders, host defense and injury. Here, we discuss the history of shared mechanisms and interconnectedness of the nervous, immune and epithelial compartments. In light of these overlapping mechanisms, it is perhaps unsurprising that neuro-immune-epithelial signaling plays a key role in regulating diverse biological phenomena.

The worldwide average human lifespan has increased over the past century. These changing demographics demand a reinvention of experimental approaches to study the brain and aging, with the aim of better matching cognitive healthspan with human lifespan. Past studies of cognitive aging included sample sizes that tended to be underpowered, were not sufficiently representative of national population characteristics, and often lacked longitudinal assessments. As a step to address these shortcomings, we propose a framework that encourages interaction between electronic-based and face-to-face study designs.

Additionally, CSF biomarkers now reflect synaptic pathology, axonal injury and neuroinflammation. Novel techniques are capable of measuring proteins of pathophysiological importance at femtomolar concentrations in blood (e.g. amyloid, tau species and neurofilaments), which enable screening of large populations in the near future. This will be essential for secondary prevention trials and clinical management. However, common diseases such as dementia with Lewy bodies, Parkinson’s disease and frontotemporal dementias, are still without reliable diagnostic biomarkers, although emerging techniques show promising pilot results for some of these diseases. This is likely to change in the next few years, which will be crucial to stratify populations enrolling in clinical trials, since pathologies often coexist.</p></div>

<p>The use of Artificial Intelligence and machine learning in basic research and clinical neuroscience is increasing. AI methods enable the interpretation of large multimodal datasets that can provide unbiased insights into the fundamental principles of brain function, potentially paving the way for earlier and more accurate detection of brain disorders and better informed intervention protocols. Despite AI’s ability to create accurate predictions and classifications, in most cases it lacks the ability to provide a mechanistic understanding of how inputs and outputs relate to each other. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is a new set of techniques that attempts to provide such an understanding, here we report on some of these practical approaches. We discuss the potential value of XAI to the field of neurostimulation for both basic scientific inquiry and therapeutic purposes, as well as, outstanding questions and obstacles to the success of the XAI approach.</p>

<p>Transcranial electrical stimulation is an important neuromodulation tool, which has been widely applied in the cognitive sciences and in the treatment of neurological and psychiatric diseases. In this work, a novel non-invasive method of transcranial electrical stimulation with high-resolution transcranial magneto-acoustic stimulation (TMAS) method has been tested experimentally in living mice for the first time. It can achieve spatial resolution of 2 mm in the cortex and even in the deep brain regions. The induced electrical field of TMAS was simulated and measured using a test sample. Then, an animal experimental system was built, and the healthy as well as Parkinson’s disease (PD) mice were simulated by TMAS in vivo. To investigate the effect of transcranial ultrasound stimulation (TUS) at the same time as TMAS, a TUS group was added in the experiments and its results compared with those of the TMAS group. The results not only demonstrate the high-resolution ability and safety of TMAS, but also show that both TMAS and TUS improved the synaptic plasticity of the PD mice and might improve the spatial learning and memory ability of the healthy mice and the PD mice, although the improvement performance of the TMAS group was superior to that of the TUS-group. Based on the in vivo TMAS studies, we propose that TMAS functions as a dual-mode stimulation combining the electric field of the magneto-acoustic effect and the mechanical force of TUS. Our results also provide an explanation of the mechanism of TMAS. This research suggests that future use of US stimulation in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided studies should involve careful consideration of the induced magneto-acoustic electrical field caused by the static magnetic field of MRI.</p>
