              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Effect of tuberculosis training on community health workers’ knowledge: a cluster randomized control trial in South Nigeria [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Intensified efforts to improve tuberculosis (TB) diagnosis, treatment, and prevention are needed to meet global EndTB targets. Community health workers’ (CHWs) knowledge with respect to case finding is vital in tuberculosis elimination. This study aimed to determine the effect of tuberculosis training on the knowledge of community health workers in Nigeria. Methods: As part of a larger multicomponent intervention study, a randomised control trial was conducted with CHWs in 18 primary health care (PHC) clusters in Nigeria. The clusters were allocated to three arms: training and cash incentive (A), training only (B), and control (C) arms. Arms (A) and (B) received training on tuberculosis symptoms, prevention, diagnosis and treatment while the control arm (C) did not receive training. Participants’ knowledge on tuberculosis was assessed using questionnaires administered pre- and post-intervention. Data was analyzed using GraphPad Prism. Descriptive data was presented in tables and bivariate data was analyzed using chi square. Statistical significance was set as P<0.05. Results: There was a significant increase in the total knowledge score (25.4%), knowledge of general symptoms (24.4%), prevention (22.6%) and diagnosis and treatment (30.0%) across all study arms post-intervention (p<0.0001). Compared with the control arm, the training arm (A) had a higher proportion of good total knowledge score (94.4%) and arm (B) had a lower proportion of good total knowledge score (83.1%) when compared to the control group (93.1%). These were, however, not statistically significant. Conclusions: An improvement in the CHWs’ knowledge of symptoms, prevention, diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis was observed after a training intervention was done. Integration of routine tuberculosis training is recommended to improve tuberculosis case finding in high burden communities.

	<p>Survivors of severe brain injury may require care in a neurointensive care unit (neuro-ICU), where the brain is vulnerable to secondary brain injury. Thus, there is a need for noninvasive, bedside, continuous cerebral blood flow monitoring approaches in the neuro-ICU. Our goal is to address this need through combined measurements of EEG and functional optical spectroscopy (EEG-Optical) instrumentation and analysis to provide a complementary fusion of data about brain activity and function. We utilized the diffuse correlation spectroscopy method for assessing cerebral blood flow at the neuro-ICU in a patient with traumatic brain injury. The present case demonstrates the feasibility of continuous recording of noninvasive cerebral blood flow transients that correlated well with the gold-standard invasive measurements and with the frequency content changes in the EEG data.</p>

	<p>Mirror visual feedback (MVF) has been shown to increase the excitability of the primary motor cortex (M1) during asynchronous bimanual movement. However, the functional networks underlying this process remain unclear. We recruited 16 healthy volunteers to perform asynchronous bimanual movement, that is, their left hand performed partial range of movement while their right hand performed normal full range of movement. Their ongoing brain activities were recorded by whole-head magnetoencephalography during the movement. Participants were required to keep both hands stationary in the control condition. In the other two conditions, participants were required to perform asynchronous bimanual movement with MVF (Asy_M) and without MVF (Asy_w/oM). Greater M1 excitability was found under Asy_M than under Asy_w/oM. More importantly, when receiving MVF, the visual cortex reduced its functional connection to brain regions associated with perceptuo-motor-attentional process (i.e., M1, superior temporal gyrus, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex). This is the first study to demonstrate a global functional network of MVF during asynchronous bimanual movement, providing a foundation for future research to examine the neural mechanisms of mirror illusion in motor control.</p>

	<p>Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) is the standard procedure for feeding severely dysphagic patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). It is associated with prolonged survival and improvement in quality of life. Nasal inspiratory pressure during a sniff (SNIP) is a respiratory test used extensively in ALS for the assessment of inspiratory muscle strength. In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of SNIP at baseline to predict PEG placement in ALS. Data from a clinical incident cohort of 179 ALS cases attending the multidisciplinary ALS unit of the University of Bari between April 2006 and December 2012 were retrospectively analysed. At baseline, patients underwent detailed neurological, nutritional and respiratory assessments, including measurements of SNIP and forced vital capacity (FVC). Patients were therefore followed up approximately every three to six months until they were able to attend the centre. The censoring date for the survival analysis was 15 April 2014, with PEG placement as the main outcome. Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to examine the association between SNIP and PEG placement, adjusted for possible confounders. During the follow-up period, 75 participants (42%) received PEG implant. PEG placement was more frequent (57% vs. 31%; p = 0.001) and earlier (after 11.6 ± 14.0 months from the first visit, vs. 23.3 ± 15.5 months; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001) in the group of patients with baseline SNIP ≤ 40 cm H2O. Baseline SNIP was a predictor of PEG placement even after correction for multiple potential confounders (HR 0.98; 95% CI: 0.96–0.99; p = 0.02). To conclude, the present study showed that SNIP at baseline is an early indicator of disease progression and therefore of the need for enteral nutrition in ALS.</p>

                <p>Stochastic fluctuations in gene expression ("noise") are often considered detrimental, but fluctuations can also be exploited for benefit (e.g., dither). We show here that DNA base excision repair amplifies transcriptional noise to facilitate cellular reprogramming. Specifically, the DNA repair protein Apex1, which recognizes both naturally occurring and unnatural base modifications, amplifies expression noise while homeostatically maintaining mean expression levels. This amplified expression noise originates from shorter-duration, higher-intensity transcriptional bursts generated by Apex1-mediated DNA supercoiling. The remodeling of DNA topology first impedes and then accelerates transcription to maintain mean levels. This mechanism, which we refer to as "discordant transcription through repair" ("DiThR," which is pronounced "dither"), potentiates cellular reprogramming and differentiation. Our study reveals a potential functional role for transcriptional fluctuations mediated by DNA base modifications in embryonic development and disease.</p>

                <p>DeepMind presented notably accurate predictions at the recent 14th Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction (CASP14) conference. We explored network architectures that incorporate related ideas and obtained the best performance with a three-track network in which information at the one-dimensional (1D) sequence level, the 2D distance map level, and the 3D coordinate level is successively transformed and integrated. The three-track network produces structure predictions with accuracies approaching those of DeepMind in CASP14, enables the rapid solution of challenging x-ray crystallography and cryo&ndash;electron microscopy structure modeling problems, and provides insights into the functions of proteins of currently unknown structure. The network also enables rapid generation of accurate protein-protein complex models from sequence information alone, short-circuiting traditional approaches that require modeling of individual subunits followed by docking. We make the method available to the scientific community to speed biological research.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Mechanisms that ensure speed and fidelity in eukaryotic translation termination</a></h4>

              
                <p>Translation termination, which liberates a nascent polypeptide from the ribosome specifically at stop codons, must occur accurately and rapidly. We established single-molecule fluorescence assays to track the dynamics of ribosomes and two requisite release factors (eRF1 and eRF3) throughout termination using an in vitro&ndash;reconstituted yeast translation system. We found that the two eukaryotic release factors bound together to recognize stop codons rapidly and elicit termination through a tightly regulated, multistep process that resembles transfer RNA selection during translation elongation. Because the release factors are conserved from yeast to humans, the molecular events that underlie yeast translation termination are likely broadly fundamental to eukaryotic protein synthesis.</p>

                <p>Eukaryotic genomes contain domesticated genes from integrating viruses and mobile genetic elements. Among these are homologs of the capsid protein (known as Gag) of long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons and retroviruses. We identified several mammalian Gag homologs that form virus-like particles and one LTR retrotransposon homolog, PEG10, that preferentially binds and facilitates vesicular secretion of its own messenger RNA (mRNA). We showed that the mRNA cargo of PEG10 can be reprogrammed by flanking genes of interest with <I>Peg10</I>&rsquo;s untranslated regions. Taking advantage of this reprogrammability, we developed selective endogenous encapsidation for cellular delivery (SEND) by engineering both mouse and human PEG10 to package, secrete, and deliver specific RNAs. Together, these results demonstrate that SEND is a modular platform suited for development as an efficient therapeutic delivery modality.</p>

                <p>Understanding the causes and consequences of the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants of concern is crucial to pandemic control yet difficult to achieve because they arise in the context of variable human behavior and immunity. We investigated the spatial invasion dynamics of lineage B.1.1.7 by jointly analyzing UK human mobility, virus genomes, and community-based polymerase chain reaction data. We identified a multistage spatial invasion process in which early B.1.1.7 growth rates were associated with mobility and asymmetric lineage export from a dominant source location, enhancing the effects of B.1.1.7&rsquo;s increased intrinsic transmissibility. We further explored how B.1.1.7 spread was shaped by nonpharmaceutical interventions and spatial variation in previous attack rates. Our findings show that careful accounting of the behavioral and epidemiological context within which variants of concern emerge is necessary to interpret correctly their observed relative growth rates.</p>

                <p>The impact of unconventional oil and gas development on water quality is a major environmental concern. We built a large geocoded database that combines surface water measurements with horizontally drilled wells stimulated by hydraulic fracturing (HF) for several shales to examine whether temporal and spatial well variation is associated with anomalous salt concentrations in United States watersheds. We analyzed four ions that could indicate water impact from unconventional development. We found very small concentration increases associated with new HF wells for barium, chloride, and strontium but not bromide. All ions showed larger, but still small-in-magnitude, increases 91 to 180 days after well spudding. Our estimates were most pronounced for wells with larger amounts of produced water, wells located over high-salinity formations, and wells closer and likely upstream from water monitors.</p>

                <p>The interfaces of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are important in determining their efficiency and stability, but the morphology and stability of imbedded perovskite-substrate interfaces have received less attention than have top interfaces. We found that dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), which is a liquid additive broadly applied to enhance perovskite film morphology, was trapped during film formation and led to voids at perovskite-substrate interfaces that accelerated the film degradation under illumination. Partial replacement of DMSO with solid-state carbohydrazide reduces interfacial voids. A maximum stabilized power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.6% was realized for blade-coated p-type/intrinsic/n-type (p-i-n) structure PSCs with no efficiency loss after 550-hour operational stability tests at 60&deg;C. The perovskite mini-modules showed certified PCEs of 19.3 and 19.2%, with aperture areas of 18.1 and 50.0 square centimeters, respectively.</p>

                <p>Many correlated systems feature an insulator-to-metal transition that can be triggered by an electric field. Although it is known that metallization takes place through filament formation, the details of how this process initiates and evolves remain elusive. We use in-operando optical reflectivity to capture the growth dynamics of the metallic phase with space and time resolution. We demonstrate that filament formation is triggered by nucleation at hotspots, with a subsequent expansion over several decades in time. By comparing three case studies (VO<SUB>2</SUB>, V<SUB>3</SUB>O<SUB>5</SUB>, and V<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>3</SUB>), we identify the resistivity change across the transition as the crucial parameter governing this process. Our results provide a spatiotemporal characterization of volatile resistive switching in Mott insulators, which is important for emerging technologies, such as optoelectronics and neuromorphic computing.</p>

                <p>In human-made malleable materials, microdamage such as cracking usually limits material lifetime. Some biological composites, such as bone, have hierarchical microstructures that tolerate cracks but cannot withstand high elongation. We demonstrate a directionally solidified eutectic high-entropy alloy (EHEA) that successfully reconciles crack tolerance and high elongation. The solidified alloy has a hierarchically organized herringbone structure that enables bionic-inspired hierarchical crack buffering. This effect guides stable, persistent crystallographic nucleation and growth of multiple microcracks in abundant poor-deformability microstructures. Hierarchical buffering by adjacent dynamic strain&ndash;hardened features helps the cracks to avoid catastrophic growth and percolation. Our self-buffering herringbone material yields an ultrahigh uniform tensile elongation (~50%), three times that of conventional nonbuffering EHEAs, without sacrificing strength.</p>

                <p>Zoonotic avian influenza A virus (IAV) infections are rare. Sustained transmission of these IAVs between humans has not been observed, suggesting a role for host genes. We used whole-genome sequencing to compare avian IAV H7N9 patients with healthy controls and observed a strong association between H7N9 infection and rare, heterozygous single-nucleotide variants in the <I>MX1</I> gene. <I>MX1</I> codes for myxovirus resistance protein A (MxA), an interferon-induced antiviral guanosine triphosphatase known to control IAV infections in transgenic mice. Most of the MxA variants identified lost the ability to inhibit avian IAVs, including H7N9, in transfected human cell lines. Nearly all of the inactive MxA variants exerted a dominant-negative effect on the antiviral function of wild-type MxA, suggesting an MxA null phenotype in heterozygous carriers. Our study provides genetic evidence for a crucial role of the <I>MX1</I>-based antiviral defense in controlling zoonotic IAV infections in humans.</p>

                <p>Babbling is a production milestone in infant speech development. Evidence for babbling in nonhuman mammals is scarce, which has prevented cross-species comparisons. In this study, we investigated the conspicuous babbling behavior of <I>Saccopteryx bilineata</I>, a bat capable of vocal production learning. We analyzed the babbling of 20 bat pups in the field during their 3-month ontogeny and compared its features to those that characterize babbling in human infants. Our findings demonstrate that babbling in bat pups is characterized by the same eight features as babbling in human infants, including the conspicuous features reduplication and rhythmicity. These parallels in vocal ontogeny between two mammalian species offer future possibilities for comparison of cognitive and neuromolecular mechanisms and adaptive functions of babbling in bats and humans.</p>

To examine the three most common severe malaria phenotypes from catchment populations across East Africa, we assembled a dataset of 6506 hospital admissions for malaria in children aged 3 months to 9 years from 2006 to 2020. Admissions were paired with data from community parasite infection surveys. A Bayesian procedure was used to calibrate uncertainties in exposure (parasite prevalence) and outcomes (severe malaria phenotypes). Each 25% increase in prevalence conferred a doubling of severe malaria admission rates. Severe malaria remains a burden predominantly among young children (3 to 59 months) across a wide range of community prevalence typical of East Africa. This study offers a quantitative framework for linking malaria parasite prevalence and severe disease outcomes in children.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Masitinib is a broad coronavirus 3CL inhibitor that blocks replication of SARS-CoV-2</a></h4>

              
                <p>There is an urgent need for antiviral agents that treat severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. We screened a library of 1900 clinically safe drugs against OC43, a human beta coronavirus that causes the common cold, and evaluated the top hits against SARS-CoV-2. Twenty drugs significantly inhibited replication of both viruses in cultured human cells. Eight of these drugs inhibited the activity of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease, 3CLpro, with the most potent being masitinib, an orally bioavailable tyrosine kinase inhibitor. X-ray crystallography and biochemistry show that masitinib acts as a competitive inhibitor of 3CLpro. Mice infected with SARS-CoV-2 and then treated with masitinib showed &gt;200-fold reduction in viral titers in the lungs and nose, as well as reduced lung inflammation. Masitinib was also effective in vitro against all tested variants of concern (B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1).</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Unbiased K-L estimator for the linear regression model [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: In the linear regression model, the ordinary least square (OLS) estimator performance drops when multicollinearity is present. According to the Gauss-Markov theorem, the estimator remains unbiased when there is multicollinearity, but the variance of its regression estimates become inflated. Estimators such as the ridge regression estimator and the K-L estimators were adopted as substitutes to the OLS estimator to overcome the problem of multicollinearity in the linear regression model. However, the estimators are biased, though they possess a smaller mean squared error when compared to the OLS estimator. Methods: In this study, we developed a new unbiased estimator using the K-L estimator and compared its performance with some existing estimators theoretically, simulation wise and by adopting real-life data. Results: Theoretically, the estimator even though unbiased also possesses a minimum variance when compared with other estimators.  Results from simulation and real-life study showed that the new estimator produced smaller mean square error (MSE) and had the smallest mean square prediction error (MSPE). This further strengthened the findings of the theoretical comparison using both the MSE and the MSPE as criterion. Conclusions: By simulation and using a real-life application that focuses on modelling, the high heating values of proximate analysis was conducted to support the theoretical findings. This new method of estimation is recommended for parameter estimation with and without multicollinearity in a linear regression model.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Enhancing oscillations in intracranial electrophysiological recordings with data-driven spatial filters</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Natalie Schaworonkow, Bradley Voytek</p>

In invasive electrophysiological recordings, a variety of neural oscillations can be detected across the cortex, with overlap in space and time. This overlap complicates measurement of neural oscillations using standard referencing schemes, like common average or bipolar referencing. Here, we illustrate the effects of spatial mixing on measuring neural oscillations in invasive electrophysiological recordings and demonstrate the benefits of using data-driven referencing schemes in order to improve measurement of neural oscillations. We discuss referencing as the application of a spatial filter. Spatio-spectral decomposition is used to estimate data-driven spatial filters, a computationally fast method which specifically enhances signal-to-noise ratio for oscillations in a frequency band of interest. We show that application of these data-driven spatial filters has benefits for data exploration, investigation of temporal dynamics and assessment of peak frequencies of neural oscillations. We demonstrate multiple use cases, exploring between-participant variability in presence of oscillations, spatial spread and waveform shape of different rhythms as well as narrowband noise removal with the aid of spatial filters. We find high between-participant variability in the presence of neural oscillations, a large variation in spatial spread of individual rhythms and many non-sinusoidal rhythms across the cortex. Improved measurement of cortical rhythms will yield better conditions for establishing links between cortical activity and behavior, as well as bridging scales between the invasive intracranial measurements and noninvasive macroscale scalp measurements.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Elucidating relationships between P.falciparum prevalence and measures of genetic diversity with a combined genetic-epidemiological model of malaria</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jason A. Hendry, Dominic Kwiatkowski, Gil McVean</p>

There is an abundance of malaria genetic data being collected from the field, yet using these data to understand the drivers of regional epidemiology remains a challenge. A key issue is the lack of models that relate parasite genetic diversity to epidemiological parameters. Classical models in population genetics characterize changes in genetic diversity in relation to demographic parameters, but fail to account for the unique features of the malaria life cycle. In contrast, epidemiological models, such as the Ross-Macdonald model, capture malaria transmission dynamics but do not consider genetics. Here, we have developed an integrated model encompassing both parasite evolution and regional epidemiology. We achieve this by combining the Ross-Macdonald model with an intra-host continuous-time Moran model, thus explicitly representing the evolution of individual parasite genomes in a traditional epidemiological framework. Implemented as a stochastic simulation, we use the model to explore relationships between measures of parasite genetic diversity and parasite prevalence, a widely-used metric of transmission intensity. First, we explore how varying parasite prevalence influences genetic diversity at equilibrium. We find that multiple genetic diversity statistics are correlated with prevalence, but the strength of the relationships depends on whether variation in prevalence is driven by host- or vector-related factors. Next, we assess the responsiveness of a variety of statistics to malaria control interventions, finding that those related to mixed infections respond quickly (∼months) whereas other statistics, such as nucleotide diversity, may take decades to respond. These findings provide insights into the opportunities and challenges associated with using genetic data to monitor malaria epidemiology.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Neutrophils promote T-cell activation through the regulated release of CD44-bound Galectin-9 from the cell surface during HIV infection</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Garett Dunsmore, Eliana Perez Rosero, Shima Shahbaz, Deanna M. Santer, Juan Jovel, Paige Lacy, Stan Houston, Shokrollah Elahi</p>

The interaction of neutrophils with T cells has been the subject of debate and controversies. Previous studies have suggested that neutrophils may suppress or activate T cells. Despite these studies, the interaction between neutrophils and T cells has remained a largely unexplored field. Here, based on our RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis, we found that neutrophils have differential transcriptional and functional profiling depending on the CD4 T-cell count of the HIV-infected individual. In particular, we identified that neutrophils in healthy individuals express surface Galectin-9 (Gal-9), which is down-regulated upon activation, and is consistently down-regulated in HIV-infected individuals. However, down-regulation of Gal-9 was associated with CD4 T-cell count of patients. Unstimulated neutrophils express high levels of surface Gal-9 that is bound to CD44, and, upon stimulation, neutrophils depalmitoylate CD44 and induce its movement out of the lipid raft. This process causes the release of Gal-9 from the surface of neutrophils. In addition, we found that neutrophil-derived exogenous Gal-9 binds to cell surface CD44 on T cells, which promotes LCK activation and subsequently enhances T-cell activation. Furthermore, this process was regulated by glycolysis and can be inhibited by interleukin (IL)-10. Together, our data reveal a novel mechanism of Gal-9 shedding from the surface of neutrophils. This could explain elevated plasma Gal-9 levels in HIV-infected individuals as an underlying mechanism of the well-characterized chronic immune activation in HIV infection. This study provides a novel role for the Gal-9 shedding from neutrophils. We anticipate that our results will spark renewed investigation into the role of neutrophils in T-cell activation in other acute and chronic conditions, as well as improved strategies for modulating Gal-9 shedding.

Marine multicellular organisms host a diverse collection of bacteria, archaea, microbial eukaryotes, and viruses that form their microbiome. Such host-associated microbes can significantly influence the host’s physiological capacities; however, the identity and functional role(s) of key members of the microbiome (“core microbiome”) in most marine hosts coexisting in natural settings remain obscure. Also unclear is how dynamic interactions between hosts and the immense standing pool of microbial genetic variation will affect marine ecosystems’ capacity to adjust to environmental changes. Here, we argue that significantly advancing our understanding of how host-associated microbes shape marine hosts’ plastic and adaptive responses to environmental change requires (i) recognizing that individual host–microbe systems do not exist in an ecological or evolutionary vacuum and (ii) expanding the field toward long-term, multidisciplinary research on entire communities of hosts and microbes. Natural experiments, such as time-calibrated geological events associated with well-characterized environmental gradients, provide unique ecological and evolutionary contexts to address this challenge. We focus here particularly on mutualistic interactions between hosts and microbes, but note that many of the same lessons and approaches would apply to other types of interactions.

                Introduction: The number of publications in Scopus on this topic increased from less than 50 in 1995 to more than 250 in 2015. In other hand, inconsistency in results about the correlation between yeast and lactic acid bacteria as probiotics has been evident since the early publications on use in broilers. Methods: A meta-analysis was conducted to determine relationship between lactic acid bacteria and yeast as probiotics to broiler diets on the growth performance, relative organ weight, blood parameters, and immune response of the broiler.  A database was designed based on published data that reported the use of probiotics on the broiler. The method used for selecting articles was based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) method. Articles selected were taken from PubMed, Web of science, Scopus, Google Scholar, and Science direct databases as well as individual. Results: The final database consists of 49 in vivo articles, 93 studies, and 225 treatments. The analysis statement in the system was a PROC MIXED procedure of SAS software. The level of probiotic increased (p <0.001) body weight, body weight gain, and feed intake of broiler. There was a reduction (p <0.01) on feed conversion ratio and mortality on the level probiotic given to broiler. Supplementation of probiotics in broiler diet increased (p <0.001) the weight of liver, spleen, gizzard, bursa of fabricius and carcass yield, while reduced (p<0.001) abdominal fat weight. The probiotic given increased the total of red and white blood cells (both at p < 0.001) but did not affect lymphocyte.  Discussion: It can be concluded the yeast act as supporting agent that serves lactic acid bacteria as probiotic increases the growth performance, relative organ weight, blood parameters, and immune response of the broiler.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">UKB.COVID19: an R package for UK Biobank COVID-19 data processing and analysis [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in a global pandemic with a rapidly developing global health and economic crisis. Variations in the disease have been observed and have been associated with the genomic sequence of either the human host or the pathogen. Worldwide scientists scrambled initially to recruit patient cohorts to try and identify risk factors. A resource that presented itself early on was the UK Biobank (UKBB), which is investigating the respective contributions of genetic predisposition and environmental exposure to the development of disease. To enable COVID-19 studies, UKBB is now receiving COVID-19 test data for their participants every two weeks. In addition, UKBB is delivering more frequent updates of death and hospital inpatient data (including critical care admissions) on the UKBB Data Portal. This frequently changing dataset requires a tool that can rapidly process and analyse up-to-date data. We developed an R package specifically for the UKBB COVID-19 data, which summarises COVID-19 test results, performs association tests between COVID-19 susceptibility/severity and potential risk factors such as age, sex, blood type, comorbidities and generates input files for genome-wide association studies (GWAS). By applying the R package to data released in April 2021, we found that age, body mass index, socioeconomic status and smoking are positively associated with COVID-19 susceptibility, severity, and mortality. Males are at a higher risk of COVID-19 infection than females. People staying in aged care homes have a higher chance of being exposed to SARS-CoV-2. By performing GWAS, we replicated the 3p21.31 genetic finding for COVID-19 susceptibility and severity. The ability to iteratively perform such analyses is highly relevant since the UKBB data is updated frequently. As a caveat, users must arrange their own access to the UKBB data to use the R package.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: Cyclophosphamide in COVID-19 – when an absolute contraindication is an absolute necessity [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Despite many studies on COVID-19, our knowledge of it remains incomplete. In some cases, treating SARS-CoV-2 infection concomitant with other diseases can be particularly challenging, as finding an appropriate treatment may involve some risks. Case presentation: A 34-year-old SARS-CoV-2 positive patient admitted due to fever, dyspnoea, haemoptysis and pneumonia, developed alveolar haemorrhage and acute kidney injury. Due to his severe state, abnormalities in laboratory tests and rapidly progressing loss of kidney function, kidney biopsy, as well as antibody panel were carried out, in which perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (p-ANCA) were found with a high titer (>200; N: <1:20). The results of kidney biopsy, combined with clinical manifestation and laboratory findings prompted the diagnosis of rapidly progressing glomerulonephritis (RPGN) in the course of p-ANCA vasculitis. Initial treatment consisted of heamodialyses, remdesivir, plasmaphereses, intravenous immunoglobulins, antibiotics, corticosteroids and fraxiparine. Once the haemorrhage had subsided, kidney function had been partially retrieved and heamodialyses had no longer been necessary, cyclophosphamide treatment was initiated, despite being contraindicated in COVID-19 according to its summary of product characteristics. Immunotherapy is still continued. The patient has already received a total of 2.4g of cyclophosphamide (4 cycles of 600mg each every three weeks). Pulmonary and radiological regression, as well as improvement of renal parameters have been achieved.        Conclusions: We suspect that cyclophosphamide, the drug of choice in p-ANCA vasculitis, could be a potential factor providing regression of the radiological changes in the lungs and it could have prevented the patient from developing acute respiratory distress syndrome. COVID-19 diagnosis should not exclude searching for other diseases which can have a similar course. When treating a patient in a life-threatening condition, a departure from trying to find the perfect timing of cyclophosphamide delivery should be considered, as delaying it could cause potentially greater harm.

     alt="Morphological and neurochemical characterization of glycinergic neurons in laminae I–IV of the mouse spinal dorsal horn"/>
<p>Glycinergic neurons are sparsely distributed in laminae I–II, but their densities are much higher in lamina III and especially in lamina IV. Based on dendritic morphology, we divided them into three and six groups in laminae I–II and III–IV, respectively. At least one type of neurons in laminae III–IV may project its axon into laminae I–II. We also provided experimental evidence indicating that there are glycine-only neurons and axon terminals in laminae I–II. The glycine-only neurons may express retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptor β and/or receptor tyrosine kinase Ret, but there might be other neurochemical markers that are still awaiting identification.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>A growing body of experimental evidence shows that glycinergic inhibition plays vital roles in spinal pain processing. In spite of this, however, our knowledge about the morphology, neurochemical characteristics, and synaptic relations of glycinergic neurons in the spinal dorsal horn is very limited. The lack of this knowledge makes our understanding about the specific contribution of glycinergic neurons to spinal pain processing quite vague. Here we investigated the morphology and neurochemical characteristics of glycinergic neurons in laminae I–IV of the spinal dorsal horn using a GlyT2::CreERT2-tdTomato transgenic mouse line. Confirming previous reports, we show that glycinergic neurons are sparsely distributed in laminae I–II, but their densities are much higher in lamina III and especially in lamina IV. First in the literature, we provide experimental evidence indicating that in addition to neurons in which glycine colocalizes with GABA, there are glycinergic neurons in laminae I–II that do not express GABA and can thus be referred to as glycine-only neurons. According to the shape and size of cell bodies and dendritic morphology, we divided the tdTomato-labeled glycinergic neurons into three and six morphological groups in laminae I–II and laminae III–IV, respectively. We also demonstrate that most of the glycinergic neurons co-express neuronal nitric oxide synthase, parvalbumin, the receptor tyrosine kinase RET, and the retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptor β (RORβ), but there might be others that need further neurochemical characterization. The present findings may foster our understanding about the contribution of glycinergic inhibition to spinal pain processing.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/neuron/inpress.rss">NPAS4 regulates the transcriptional response of the suprachiasmatic nucleus to light and circadian behavior</a></h4>

              
                In this study, Xu et al. investigate the transcriptional response of the suprachiasmatic nucleus to light. They show that the light-inducible gene Npas4 is involved in mediating the transcriptional response of SCN neurons. Furthermore, loss of Npas4 alters circadian rhythms in mice, suggesting a role of Npas4 in photic entrainment.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">TMEM120A contains a specific coenzyme A-binding site and might not mediate poking- or stretch-induced channel activities in cells</a></h4>

              
                TMEM120A, a member of the Transmembrane protein 120 (TMEM120) family, has pivotal function in adipocyte differentiation and metabolism, and may also contribute to sensing mechanical pain by functioning as an ion channel named TACAN. Here we report that expression of TMEM120A is not sufficient in mediating poking- or stretch-induced currents in cells, and have solved cryo-EM structures of human TMEM120A (<i>Hs</i>TMEM120A) in complex with an endogenous metabolic cofactor (coenzyme A, CoASH) and in the apo form. <i>Hs</i>TMEM120A forms a symmetrical homodimer with each monomer containing an amino-terminal coiled-coil motif followed by a transmembrane domain with six membrane-spanning helices. Within the transmembrane domain, a CoASH molecule is hosted in a deep cavity and forms specific interactions with nearby amino acid residues. Mutation of a central tryptophan residue involved in binding CoASH dramatically reduced the binding affinity of <i>Hs</i>TMEM120A with CoASH. <i>Hs</i>TMEM120A exhibits distinct conformations at the states with or without CoASH bound. Our results suggest that TMEM120A may have alternative functional roles potentially involved in CoASH transport, sensing or metabolism.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">TRPC3 and NALCN channels drive pacemaking in substantia nigra dopaminergic neurons</a></h4>

              
                Midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons are slow pacemakers that maintain extracellular DA levels. During the interspike intervals, subthreshold slow depolarization underlies autonomous pacemaking and determines its rate. However, the ion channels that determine slow depolarization are unknown. Here we show that TRPC3 and NALCN channels together form sustained inward currents responsible for the slow depolarization of nigral DA neurons. Specific TRPC3 channel blockade completely blocked DA neuron pacemaking, but the pacemaking activity in TRPC3 knock-out (KO) mice was perfectly normal, suggesting the presence of compensating ion channels. Blocking NALCN channels abolished pacemaking in both TRPC3 KO and wild-type mice. The NALCN current and mRNA and protein expression are increased in TRPC3 KO mice, indicating that NALCN compensates for TRPC3 currents. In normal conditions, TRPC3 and NALCN contribute equally to slow depolarization. Therefore, we conclude that TRPC3 and NALCN are two major leak channels that drive robust pacemaking in nigral DA neurons.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Quantifying the relationship between genetic diversity and population size suggests natural selection cannot explain Lewontin's paradox</a></h4>

              
                Neutral theory predicts that genetic diversity increases with population size, yet observed levels of diversity across metazoans vary only two orders of magnitude while population sizes vary over several. This unexpectedly narrow range of diversity is known as Lewontin’s Paradox of Variation (1974). While some have suggested selection constrains diversity, tests of this hypothesis seem to fall short. Here, I revisit Lewontin’s Paradox to assess whether current models of linked selection are capable of reducing diversity to this extent. To quantify the discrepancy between pairwise diversity and census population sizes across species, I combine previously-published estimates of pairwise diversity from 172 metazoan taxa with newly derived estimates of census sizes. Using phylogenetic comparative methods, I show this relationship is significant accounting for phylogeny, but with high phylogenetic signal and evidence that some lineages experience shifts in the evolutionary rate of diversity deep in the past. Additionally, I find a negative relationship between recombination map length and census size, suggesting abundant species have less recombination and experience greater reductions in diversity due to linked selection. However, I show that even assuming strong and abundant selection, models of linked selection are unlikely to explain the observed relationship between diversity and census sizes across species.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The whale shark genome reveals patterns of vertebrate gene family evolution</a></h4>

              
                Chondrichthyes (cartilaginous fishes) are fundamental for understanding vertebrate evolution, yet their genomes are understudied. We report long-read sequencing of the whale shark genome to generate the best gapless chondrichthyan genome assembly yet with higher contig contiguity than all other cartilaginous fish genomes, and studied vertebrate genomic evolution of ancestral gene families, immunity, and gigantism. We found a major increase in gene families at the origin of gnathostomes (jawed vertebrates) independent of their genome duplication. We studied vertebrate pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs), which are key in initiating innate immune defense, and found diverse patterns of gene family evolution, demonstrating that adaptive immunity in gnathostomes did not fully displace germline-encoded PRR innovation. We also discovered a new Toll-like receptor (TLR29) and three NOD1 copies in the whale shark. We found chondrichthyan and giant vertebrate genomes had decreased substitution rates compared to other vertebrates, but gene family expansion rates varied among vertebrate giants, suggesting substitution and expansion rates of gene families are decoupled in vertebrate genomes. Finally, we found gene families that shifted in expansion rate in vertebrate giants were enriched for human cancer-related genes, consistent with gigantism requiring adaptations to suppress cancer.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">GIV/Girdin, a non-receptor modulator for Gαi/s, regulates spatiotemporal signaling during sperm capacitation and is required for male fertility</a></h4>

              
                For a sperm to successfully fertilize an egg, it must first undergo capacitation in the female reproductive tract and later undergo acrosomal reaction (AR) upon encountering an egg surrounded by its vestment. How premature AR is avoided despite rapid surges in signaling cascades during capacitation remains unknown. Using a combination of conditional knockout (cKO) mice and cell-penetrating peptides, we show that GIV (<i>CCDC88A</i>), a guanine nucleotide-exchange modulator (GEM) for trimeric GTPases, is highly expressed in spermatocytes and is required for male fertility. GIV is rapidly phosphoregulated on key tyrosine and serine residues in human and murine spermatozoa. These phosphomodifications enable GIV-GEM to orchestrate two distinct compartmentalized signaling programs in the sperm tail and head; in the tail, GIV enhances PI3K→Akt signals, sperm motility and survival, whereas in the head it inhibits cAMP surge and premature AR. Furthermore, GIV transcripts are downregulated in the testis and semen of infertile men. These findings exemplify the spatiotemporally segregated signaling programs that support sperm capacitation and shed light on a hitherto unforeseen cause of infertility in men.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">An essential, kinetoplastid-specific GDP-Fuc: β-D-Gal α-1,2-fucosyltransferase is located in the mitochondrion of Trypanosoma brucei </a></h4>

              
                Fucose is a common component of eukaryotic cell-surface glycoconjugates, generally added by Golgi-resident fucosyltransferases. Whereas fucosylated glycoconjugates are rare in kinetoplastids, the biosynthesis of the nucleotide sugar GDP-Fuc has been shown to be essential in <i>Trypanosoma brucei.</i> Here we show that the single identifiable <i>T. brucei</i> fucosyltransferase (TbFUT1) is a GDP-Fuc: β-D-galactose α-1,2-fucosyltransferase with an apparent preference for a Galβ1,3GlcNAcβ1-O-R acceptor motif. Conditional null mutants of <i>TbFUT1</i> demonstrated that it is essential for both the mammalian-infective bloodstream form and the insect vector-dwelling procyclic form. Unexpectedly, TbFUT1 was localized in the mitochondrion of <i>T. brucei</i> and found to be required for mitochondrial function in bloodstream form trypanosomes. Finally, the <i>TbFUT1</i> gene was able to complement a <i>Leishmania major</i> mutant lacking the homologous fucosyltransferase gene (Guo et al., 2021). Together these results suggest that kinetoplastids possess an unusual, conserved and essential mitochondrial fucosyltransferase activity that may have therapeutic potential across trypanosomatids.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Characterization of the ABC methionine transporter from Neisseria meningitidis reveals that lipidated MetQ is required for interaction</a></h4>

              
                NmMetQ is a substrate-binding protein (SBP) from Neisseria meningitidis that has been identified as a surface-exposed candidate antigen for meningococcal vaccines. However, this location for NmMetQ challenges the prevailing view that SBPs in Gram-negative bacteria are localized to the periplasmic space to promote interaction with their cognate ABC transporter embedded in the bacterial inner membrane. To elucidate the roles of NmMetQ, we characterized NmMetQ with and without its cognate ABC transporter (NmMetNI). Here, we show that NmMetQ is a lipoprotein (lipo-NmMetQ) that binds multiple methionine analogs and stimulates the ATPase activity of NmMetNI. Using single-particle electron cryo-microscopy, we determined the structures of NmMetNI in the presence and absence of lipo-NmMetQ. Based on our data, we propose that NmMetQ tethers to membranes via a lipid anchor and has dual function and localization, playing a role in NmMetNI-mediated transport at the inner membrane and moonlighting on the bacterial surface.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Neural dynamics between anterior insular cortex and right supramarginal gyrus dissociate genuine affect sharing from perceptual saliency of pretended pain</a></h4>

              
                Empathy for pain engages both shared affective responses and self-other distinction. In this study, we addressed the highly debated question of whether neural responses previously linked to affect sharing could result from the perception of salient affective displays. Moreover, we investigated how the brain network involved in affect sharing and self-other distinction underpinned our response to a pain that is either perceived as genuine or pretended (while in fact both were acted for reasons of experimental control). We found stronger activations in regions associated with affect sharing (anterior insula, aIns, and anterior mid-cingulate cortex, aMCC) as well as with affective self-other distinction (right supramarginal gyrus, rSMG), in participants watching video clips of genuine vs. pretended facial expressions of pain. Using dynamic causal modeling (DCM), we then assessed the neural dynamics between the right aIns and rSMG in these two conditions. This revealed a reduced inhibitory effect on the aIns to rSMG connection for genuine compared to pretended pain. For genuine pain only, brain-to-behavior regression analyses highlighted a linkage between this inhibitory effect on the one hand, and pain ratings as well as empathic traits on the other. These findings imply that if the pain of others is genuine and thus calls for an appropriate empathic response, neural responses in the aIns indeed seem related to affect sharing and self-other distinction is engaged to avoid empathic over-arousal. In contrast, if others merely pretend to be in pain, the perceptual salience of their painful expression results in neural responses that are down-regulated to avoid inappropriate affect sharing and social support.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Learning new concepts rapidly from a few examples is an open issue in spike-based machine learning. This few-shot learning imposes substantial challenges to the current learning methodologies of spiking neuron networks (SNNs) due to the lack of task-related priori knowledge. The recent learning-to-learn (L2L) approach allows SNNs to acquire priori knowledge through example-level learning and task-level optimization. However, existing L2L-based frameworks do not target the neural dynamics (i.e., neuronal and synaptic parameter changes) on different timescales. This diversity of temporal dynamics is an important attribute in spike-based learning, which facilitates the networks to rapidly acquire knowledge from very few examples and gradually integrate this knowledge. In this work, we consider the neural dynamics on various timescales and provide a multi-timescale optimization (MTSO) framework for SNNs. This framework introduces an adaptive-gated LSTM to accommodate two different timescales of neural dynamics: short-term learning and long-term evolution. Short-term learning is a fast knowledge acquisition process achieved by a novel surrogate gradient online learning (SGOL) algorithm, where the LSTM guides gradient updating of SNN on a short timescale through an adaptive learning rate and weight decay gating. The long-term evolution aims to slowly integrate acquired knowledge and form a priori, which can be achieved by optimizing the LSTM guidance process to tune SNN parameters on a long timescale. Experimental results demonstrate that the collaborative optimization of multi-timescale neural dynamics can make SNNs achieve promising performance for the few-shot learning tasks.</span>

This drastic reduction in dimensionality gives rise to metamerism, that is, the perceptual chromatic equivalence between two different light spectra. The classes of equivalence of metamerism are revealed by color-matching experiments in which observers adjust the intensity of three monochromatic light beams of three preset wavelengths (the <span style="font-style:italic;">primaries</span>) to produce a mixture that is perceptually equal to a given monochromatic target stimulus. Here we use the linear relation between the color matching functions and the absorption probabilities of each type of cone to find particularly useful triplets of primaries. As a second goal, we also derive an analytical description of the trial-to-trial variability and the correlations of color matching functions stemming from Poissonian noise in photon capture. We analyze how the statistical properties of the responses to color-matching experiments vary with the retinal composition and the wavelengths of peak absorption probability, and compare them with experimental data on subject-to-subject variability obtained previously.</span>

For example, we can manipulate even unfamiliar objects and can generate mental images before enacting a preplan. How is this possible? Our study investigated this problem by revisiting our previous study (Jung, Matsumoto, &amp; Tani, <a href="#B48" class="reflinks">2019</a>), which examined the problem of vision-based, goal-directed planning by robots performing a task of block stacking. By extending the previous study, our work introduces a large network comprising dynamically interacting submodules, including visual working memory (VWMs), a visual attention module, and an executive network. The executive network predicts motor signals, visual images, and various controls for attention, as well as masking of visual information. The most significant difference from the previous study is that our current model contains an additional VWM. The entire network is trained by using predictive coding and an optimal visuomotor plan to achieve a given goal state is inferred using active inference. Results indicate that our current model performs significantly better than that used in Jung et al. (<a href="#B48" class="reflinks">2019</a>), especially when manipulating blocks with unlearned colors and textures. Simulation results revealed that the observed generalization was achieved because content-agnostic information processing developed through synergistic interaction between the second VWM and other modules during the course of learning, in which memorizing image contents and transforming them are dissociated. This letter verifies this claim by conducting both qualitative and quantitative analysis of simulation results.</span>

This letter shows that the two frameworks can be linked by choosing biologically inspired source sparsity priors.

In addition, we extend the standard SBL approach to source imaging in two important directions. First, we augment the generative model of M/EEG to include artifactual sources. Second, we modify SBL to allow for efficient model inversion with sequential data. We refer to this new algorithm as recursive SBL (RSBL), a source estimation filter with potential for online and offline imaging applications. We use simulated data to verify that RSBL can accurately estimate and demix cortical and artifactual sources under different noise conditions. Finally, we show that on real error-related EEG data, RSBL can yield single-trial source estimates in agreement with the experimental literature. Overall, by demonstrating that ESI can produce maximally independent sources while simultaneously localizing them in cortical space, we bridge the gap between the ESI and ICA frameworks for M/EEG analysis.</span>

To this end, we seek a multichannel CCA algorithm that can be implemented in a biologically plausible neural network. For biological plausibility, we require that the network operates in the online setting and its synaptic update rules are local. Starting from a novel CCA objective function, we derive an online optimization algorithm whose optimization steps can be implemented in a single-layer neural network with multicompartmental neurons and local non-Hebbian learning rules. We also derive an extension of our online CCA algorithm with adaptive output rank and output whitening. Interestingly, the extension maps onto a neural network whose neural architecture and synaptic updates resemble neural circuitry and non-Hebbian plasticity observed in the cortex.</span>

In this letter, we analyze the insideness problem in isolation, without texture or semantic cues, such that other aspects of segmentation do not interfere in the analysis. We demonstrate that DNNs for segmentation with few units have sufficient complexity to solve the insideness for any curve. Yet such DNNs have severe problems with learning general solutions. Only recurrent networks trained with small images learn solutions that generalize well to almost any curve. Recurrent networks can decompose the evaluation of long-range dependencies into a sequence of local operations, and learning with small images alleviates the common difficulties of training recurrent networks with a large number of unrolling steps.</span>

It is shown that minimizing this generalized loss function under an (unconstrained) optimal discriminator is equivalent to minimizing the kth-order Pearson-Vajda divergence. Another novel GAN generator loss function is next proposed in terms of Rényi cross-entropy functionals with order α&gt;0, α≠1. It is demonstrated that this Rényi-centric generalized loss function, which provably reduces to the original GAN loss function as α→1, preserves the equilibrium point satisfied by the original GAN based on the Jensen-Rényi divergence, a natural extension of the Jensen-Shannon divergence.Experimental results indicate that the proposed loss functions, applied to the MNIST and CelebA data sets, under both DCGAN and StyleGAN architectures, confer performance benefits by virtue of the extra degrees of freedom provided by the parameters k and α, respectively. More specifically, experiments show improvements with regard to the quality of the generated images as measured by the Fréchet inception distance score and training stability. While it was applied to GANs in this study, the proposed approach is generic and can be used in other applications of information theory to deep learning, for example, the issues of fairness or privacy in artificial intelligence.</span>

                Activity-dependent myelination is the mechanism by which myelin changes as a function of neural activity, and plays a fundamental role in brain plasticity. Mediated by structural changes in glia, activity-dependent myelination regulates axonal conduction velocity. It remains unclear how neural activity impacts myelination to orchestrate the timing of neural signaling. We developed a model of spiking neurons enhanced with neuron-glia feedback. Inspired by experimental data and use-dependent synaptic plasticity, we introduced a learning rule, called the Activity-Dependent Myelination (ADM) rule, by which conduction velocity scales with firing rates. We found that the ADM rule implements a homeostatic control mechanism that promotes and preserves synchronization. ADM-mediated plasticity was found to optimize synchrony by compensating for variability in axonal lengths by scaling conduction velocity in an axon-specific way. This property was maintained even when the network structure is altered. We further explored how external stimuli interact with the ADM rule to trigger bidirectional and reversible changes in conduction delays. These results highlight the role played by activity-dependent myelination in synchronous neural communication and brain plasticity.

                Glia serve as double-edged swords to modulate neuropathology in Parkinson's disease (PD), but how they react opposingly to be beneficial or detrimental under pathological conditions, like promote or eliminate -Synuclein inclusions, remain elusive. Here we present evidence that the PD risk factor Cyclin G-associated kinase (GAK)/dAuxilin (Aux) is a new component in glial autophagy. Lack of GAK/Aux promotes autophagic induction, disrupts lysosome acidification, and blocks glial clearance of substrates. Aux regulates Atg9 trafficking to autophagosomes and lysosomes for autophagosome biogenesis and autolysosome maturation, respectively, via Atg9 phosphorylation at newly identified residues T62 and T69. GAK/Aux-mediated glial autophagy is required for -Syn degradation and contributes to a broad spectrum of parkinsonian symptoms in Drosophila and mice. Our findings indicate that glial autophagy is a critical component in PD progression and identify a new autophagy factor functioning in a tissue-specific manner; targeting glial autophagy is potentially a therapeutic solution for PD.

                Complex cognition relies on flexible working memory, which is severely limited in its capacity. The neuronal computations underlying these capacity limits have been extensively studied in humans and in monkeys, resulting in competing theoretical models. We probed the working memory capacity of crows (Corvus corone) in a change detection task, developed for monkeys (Macaca mulatta), while we performed extracellular recordings of the prefrontal-like area nidopallium caudolaterale. We found that neuronal encoding and maintenance of information were affected by item load, in a way that is virtually identical to results obtained from monkey prefrontal cortex. Contemporary neurophysiological models of working memory employ divisive normalization as an important mechanism that may result in the capacity limitation. As these models are usually conceptualized and tested in an exclusively mammalian context, it remains unclear if they fully capture a general concept of working memory or if they are restricted to the mammalian neocortex. Here we report that carrion crows and macaque monkeys share divisive normalization as a neuronal computation that is in line with mammalian models. This indicates that computational models of working memory developed in the mammalian cortex can also apply to non-cortical associative brain regions of birds.

                Olfactory information is encoded in lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) by two classes of layer 2 (L2) principal neurons: fan and pyramidal cells. However, the functional properties of L2 neurons are unclear. Here, we show in awake mice that L2 cells respond rapidly to odors during single sniffs and that LEC is essential for discrimination of odor identity and intensity. Population analyses of L2 ensembles reveals that while rate coding distinguishes odor identity, firing rates are weakly concentration-dependent and changes in spike timing represent odor intensity. L2 principal cells differ in afferent olfactory input and connectivity with local inhibitory circuits and the relative timing of pyramidal and fan cell spikes underlies odor intensity coding. Downstream, intensity is encoded purely by spike timing in hippocampal CA1. Together, these results reveal the unique processing of odor information by parallel LEC subcircuits and highlight the importance of temporal coding in higher olfactory areas.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Improving robustness of 3D multi-shot EPI by structured low-rank reconstruction of segmented CAIPI sampling for fMRI at 7T</a></h4>

              
                Three-dimensional (3D) encoding methods are increasingly being explored as alternatives to multi-slice two-dimensional (2D) acquisitions in fMRI, particularly in cases where high isotropic resolution is needed. 3D multi-shot EPI is the most popular 3D fMRI acquisition method, but is susceptible to physiological fluctuations which can induce inter-shot phase variations, and thus reducing the achievable tSNR, negating some of the benefit of 3D encoding. This issue can be particularly problematic at ultra-high fields like 7T, which have more severe off-resonance effects. In this work, we aim to improve the temporal stability of 3D multi-shot EPI at 7T by improving its robustness to inter-shot phase variations. We presented a 3D segmented CAIPI sampling trajectory ("seg-CAIPI") and an improved reconstruction method based on Hankel structured low-rank matrix recovery. Simulation and in-vivo results demonstrate that the combination of the seg-CAIPI sampling scheme and the proposed structured low-rank reconstruction is a promising way to effectively reduce the unwanted temporal variance induced by inter-shot physiological fluctuations, and thus improve the robustness of 3D multi-shot EPI for fMRI.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Lacking social support is associated with structural divergences in hippocampus-default network co-variation patterns</a></h4>

              
                Elaborate social interaction is a pivotal asset of the human species. The complexity of peoples social lives may constitute the dominating factor in the vibrancy of many individuals environment. The neural substrates linked to social cognition thus appear especially susceptible when people endure periods of social isolation: here, we zoom in on the systematic inter-relationships between two such neural substrates, the allocortical hippocampus (HC) and the neocortical default network (DN). Previous human social neuroscience studies have focused on the DN, while HC subfields have been studied in most detail in rodents and monkeys. To bring into contact these two separate research streams, we directly quantified how DN subregions are coherently co-expressed with specific HC subfields in the context of social isolation. A two-pronged decomposition of structural brain scans from 37,000 UK Biobank participants linked lack of social support to mostly lateral subregions in the DN patterns. This lateral DN association co-occurred with HC patterns that implicated especially subiculum, presubiculum, CA2, CA3, and dentate gyrus. Overall, the subregion divergences within spatially overlapping signatures of HC-DN co-variation followed a clear segregation divide into the left and right brain hemispheres. Separable regimes of structural HC-DN co-variation also showed distinct associations with the genetic predisposition for lacking social support at the population level.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Corticostriatal suppression of appetitive Pavlovian conditioned responding</a></h4>

              
                The capacity to suppress learned responses is essential for animals to adapt in dynamic environments. Extinction is a process by which animals learn to suppress conditioned responding when an expected outcome is omitted. The infralimbic cortex (IL) to nucleus accumbens shell (NAcS) neural circuit is implicated in suppressing conditioned responding after extinction, especially in the context of operant cocaine-seeking behaviour. However, the role of the IL-to-NAcS neural circuit in the extinction of responding to appetitive Pavlovian cues is unknown and the psychological mechanisms involved in response suppression following extinction are unclear. We trained rats to associate a 10 s auditory conditioned stimulus (CS; 14 trials per session) with a sucrose unconditioned stimulus (US; 0.2 mL per CS) in a specific context and then, following extinction in a different context, precipitated a renewal of CS responding by presenting the CS alone in the original Pavlovian conditioning context. Unilateral, optogenetic stimulation of the IL-to-NAcS circuit selectively during CS trials suppressed renewal. In a separate experiment, IL-to-NAcS stimulation suppressed CS responding regardless of prior extinction and impaired extinction retrieval. Finally, IL-to-NAcS stimulation during the CS did not suppress the acquisition of Pavlovian conditioning but was required for the subsequent expression of CS responding. These results are consistent with multiple studies showing that the IL-to-NAcS neural circuit is involved in the suppression of operant cocaine-seeking, extending these findings to appetitive Pavlovian cues. The suppression of appetitive Pavlovian responding following IL-to-NAcS circuit stimulation does not, however, appear to require an extinction-dependent process.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Modeling Neural Variability in Deep Networks with Dropout</a></h4>

              
                Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been used to model the biological visual system. Compared to other models, CNNs can better capture neural responses to natural stimuli. However, previous successes are limited to modeling mean responses; while another fundamental aspect of cortical activity, namely response variability, is ignored. How the CNN models capture neural variability properties remains unknown. Previous computational neuroscience studies showed that the response variability can have a functional role, and found that the correlation structure (especially noise correlation) influences the amount of information in the population code. However, CNN models are typically deterministic, so noise (and correlations) in CNN models have not been studied. In this study, we developed a CNN model of visual cortex that includes neural variability. The model includes Monte Carlo dropout, namely a random subset of units is silenced at each presentation of the input image, inducing variability in the model. We found that our model captured a wide-range of neural variability findings in electrophysiology experiments, including that response mean and variance scale together, noise correlations are small but positive on average, both evoked and spontaneous noise correlation are larger for neurons with similar tuning, and the noise covariance is low-dimensional. Further, we found that removing the correlation can boost trial-by-trial decoding performance in the CNN model.

                Scenes contain many statistical regularities that, if accounted for by the visual system, could greatly benefit visual processing. One such statistic to consider is the orientation-averaged slope () of the amplitude spectrum of natural scenes. Human observers are differently sensitive to s, and they may utilize this statistic when processing natural scenes. Here, we explore whether discrimination sensitivity to  is associated with the recently viewed environment. Observers were immersed, using a Head-Mounted Display, in an environment that was either unaltered or had its average  steepened or shallowed. Discrimination thresholds were affected by the average shift in : a steeper environment decreased thresholds for very steep reference s while a shallower environment decreased thresholds for shallow values. We modelled these data with a Bayesian observer model and explored how different prior shapes may influence the ability of the model to fit observer thresholds. We explore three potential prior shapes: unimodal, bimodal and trimodal modified-PERT distributions and found the bimodal prior to best-capture observer thresholds for all experimental conditions. Notably, the prior modes' position was shifted following adaptation, which suggests that a priori expectations for  are sufficiently malleable to account for changes in the average  of the recently viewed scenes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The active zone protein Clarinet regulates ATG-9 trafficking at synapses and presynaptic autophagy</a></h4>

              
                In neurons, autophagy is temporally and spatially regulated to occur near presynaptic sites. How trafficking of autophagy proteins is regulated to support synaptic autophagy is not well understood. From forward genetic screens, we identify a role for the long isoform of the active zone protein Clarinet (CLA-1L) in regulating trafficking of autophagy protein ATG-9 at synapses, and presynaptic autophagy. ATG-9 is a transmembrane protein that undergoes activity-dependent exo-endocytosis at synapses, and mutations in CLA-1L result in abnormal accumulation of ATG-9 into clathrin-rich endocytic intermediates. CLA-1L extends from the active zone to the periactive zone, and genetically interacts with periactive zone proteins required for clathrin-dependent endocytosis. We find that CLA-1L is specifically required for sorting of ATG-9 at synapses, likely via endosome-mediated endocytosis, and for activity-dependent presynaptic autophagy. Our findings provide mechanistic insights into how active zone proteins regulate key steps of ATG-9 exo-endocytosis, a process that could couple the activity state of the neuron and autophagy.

                Modelling and predicting individual differences in task-evoked FMRI activity can have a wide range of applications from basic to clinical neuroscience. It has been shown that models based on resting-state activity can have high predictive accuracy. Here we propose several improvements to such models. Using a sparse ensemble leaner, we show that (i) features extracted using Stochastic Probabilistic Functional Modes (sPROFUMO) outperform the previously proposed dual-regression approach, (ii) that the shape and overall intensity of individualised task activations can be modelled separately and explicitly, (iii) training the model on predicting residual differences in brain activity further boosts individualised predictions. These results hold for both surface-based analyses of the Human Connectome Project data as well as volumetric analyses of UK-biobank data. Overall, our model achieves state of the art prediction accuracy on par with the test-retest reliability of tfMRI scans, suggesting that it has potential to supplement traditional task localisers.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Oculomotor freezing tracks perception and is immune to decision bias</a></h4>

              
                The appearance of a salient stimulus rapidly inhibits saccadic eye movements. Curiously, this "oculomotor freezing" reflex is triggered only by stimuli that the participant reports seeing (White & Rolfs, 2016). But is oculomotor freezing linked to the participant's sensory experience, or their decision that a stimulus was present? If it were decision-related, oculomotor freezing should become less prevalent when the participant is induced to have a conservative decision criterion and reports seeing a stimulus less often. Here we manipulated decision criterion in two ways: by adjusting monetary payoffs and stimulus probability in a detection task. These bias manipulations greatly affected participants' explicit reports but did not affect the degree to which microsaccades were inhibited by stimulus presence. In addition, the link between oculomotor freezing and explicit reports was stronger when the decision criterion was conservative rather than liberal. The simplest explanation is that conservative reports of stimulus presence are more often based on a strong sensory signal that also inhibits microsaccades. We conclude that the sensory threshold for oculomotor freezing is independent of decision bias. To the extent that conscious experience is also unaffected by such bias, oculomotor freezing provides an involuntary, implicit indication that a stimulus has entered awareness.

                Traumatic brain injury is a major public health concern. A significant proportion of individuals experience post-traumatic brain injury behavioral impairments, especially in attention and inhibitory control domains. Traditional diffusion-weighted MRI techniques, such as diffusion tensor imaging, have provided tools to assess white matter structural disruptions reflecting the long-term brain tissue alterations associated with traumatic brain injury. The recently developed neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging is a more advanced diffusion-weighted MRI modality, which provides more refined characterization of brain tissue microstructures by assessing the neurite orientation dispersion and neurite density properties. In this study, we investigated the morphometrical and microstructural alterations at chronic brain injury stage and their relationships with the functional outcomes. Neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging data from 44 young adults with chronic traumatic brain injury (ranging from 18 - 27 years of age; 23 males/21 females) who had no prior-traumatic brain injury history of attention deficits and/or hyperactivity and 45 group-matched normal controls (23 males /22 females) were collected. Maps of fractional anisotropy, neurite orientation dispersion index, and neurite density index were calculated. Vertex-wise and voxel-wise analyses were conducted for gray matter and white matter, respectively. Post-hoc region of interest-based analyses were also performed. Compared to the controls, the group of traumatic brain injury showed significantly increased orientation dispersion index in various gray matter regions and significantly decreased orientation dispersion index in several white matter regions. Brain-behavioral association analyses indicated that the reduced neurite density index of left precentral gyrus and the reduced orientation dispersion index of left superior longitudinal fasciculus were significantly associated with elevated hyperactive/impulsive symptoms in the patients with traumatic brain injury. These findings suggest that traumatic brain injury-induced chronic neurite orientation dispersion alterations of left superior longitudinal fasciculus and left precentral may significantly contribute to post-traumatic brain injury hyperactive/impulsive behaviors in young adults with traumatic brain injury.

                Connectomes generated from electron microscopy images of neural tissue unveil the complex morphology of every neuron and the locations of every synapse interconnecting them. These wiring diagrams may also enable inference of synaptic and neuronal biophysics, such as the functional weights of synaptic connections, but this requires integration with physiological data to properly parameterize. Working with a stereotyped olfactory network in the Drosophila brain, we make direct comparisons of the anatomy and physiology of diverse neurons and synapses with subcellular and subthreshold resolution. We find that synapse density and location jointly predict the amplitude of the somatic postsynaptic potential evoked by a single presynaptic spike. Biophysical models fit to data predict that electrical compartmentalization allows axon and dendrite arbors to balance independent and interacting computations. These findings begin to fill the gap between connectivity maps and activity maps, which should enable new hypotheses about how network structure constrains network function.

                Spreading depolarization (SD) is a sudden and synchronized depolarization of principal cells followed by depression of activity, which slowly propagates across brain regions like cortex or hippocampus. SD is considered to be mechanistically relevant to migraine, epilepsy, and traumatic brain injury. Interestingly, research into SD typically uses SD triggered immediately after a focal stimulus. Here we optimize an in vitro experimental model allowing us to record SD without focal stimulation. This method uses electrophysiological recordings and intrinsic optical imaging in slices. The method is also relatively easy and inexpensive. Acute hippocampal slices from mice or rats were prepared and used for extracellular and whole-cell recordings. Recordings were made in a submerged-style chamber with flow of artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) above and below the slices. Flow was fast (> 5ml/min), and temperature was 32{degrees}C. As soon as slices were placed in the chamber, aCSF containing 0 mM Mg2+ and 5 mM K+ (0 Mg2+/5 K+ aCSF) was used. Two major types of activity were observed: SD and seizure-like events (SLEs). Both occurred after many minutes of recording. Although both mouse and rat slices showed SLEs, only mouse slices developed SD and did so in the first hour of 0 Mg2+/5 K+ aCSF exposure. Intrinsic optical imaging showed that most SDs initiated in CA3 and could propagate into CA1 and dentate gyrus. In dentate gyrus, SD propagated in two separate waves: (1) into the hilus and (2) into granule cell and molecular layers simultaneously. This in vitro model can be used to better understand the mechanisms and relationship between SD and SLEs. It could also be useful in preclinical drug screening.

                In the past decade it has become evident that neuroblasts continue to supply the human cortex with interneurons via unique migratory streams shortly following birth. Due to the size of the human brain, these newborn neurons must migrate long distances through complex cellular landscapes to reach their final locations. This process is poorly understood, largely due to technical difficulties in acquiring and studying neurotypical postmortem human samples along with diverging developmental features of well-studied mouse models. We reasoned that migratory streams of neuroblasts utilize cellular substrates, such as blood vessels, to guide their trek from the subventricular zone to distant cortical targets. Here we evaluate the association between young interneuronal migratory streams and their preferred cellular substrates in gyrencephalic piglets during the developmental equivalent of human birth, infancy, and toddlerhood.

                Hippocampal place cells are the functional units of spatial navigation and are present in all subregions- CA1, CA2, CA3 and CA4. Recent studies on CA2 have indicated its role in social and contextual memory, but its contribution towards spatial novelty detection and consolidation remains largely unknown. The current study aims to uncover how CA1 and CA2 detect, process, assimilate and consolidate spatial novelty. Accordingly, a novel 3-day paradigm was designed where the animal was introduced to a completely new environment on the first day and to varying degrees of familiarity and novelty on subsequent days, as the track was extended in length and modified in shape, keeping other environmental constraints fixed. Detection of spatial novelty was found to be a dynamic and complex phenomenon, characterized by different responses from hippocampal place cells, depending on when novelty was introduced. Therefore, the study concludes that early novelty detection (the first time a novel space is introduced in a relatively familiar environment) and subsequent novelty detection are not processed in the same way. Additionally, while neuronal responses to spatial novelty detection (early and subsequent) were found to be the same in CA1 and CA2 ensembles, their responses differed in spatial consolidation mechanisms during subsequent sleep replays. For CA1, spatial coverage of prior behaviour was found to be closely reflected in subsequent sleep for that particular day, but CA2 showed no such coherent response, highlighting mnemonic processing differences between CA2 and CA1 with respect to spatial novelty.

                Fast and accurate threat detection is critically important for animal survival. Reducing perceptual ambiguity by integrating multiple sources of sensory information can enhance threat detection and reduce response latency. However, studies showing a direct link between behavioral correlates of multisensory integration and its underlying neural basis are rare. In fish, an explosive escape behavior known as C-start is driven by an identified neural circuit centered on the Mauthner cell. The Mauthner cell can trigger C-starts in response to visual and auditory stimuli allowing to investigate how multisensory integration in a single neuron affects behavioral outcome after threat detection. Here we demonstrate that in goldfish visual looms and brief auditory stimuli can be integrated to increase C-start probability and that this enhancement is inversely correlated to the saliency of the cues with weaker auditory cues producing a proportionally stronger multisensory effect. We also show that multisensory stimuli reduce response latency locked to the presentation of the auditory cue. Finally, we make a direct link between behavioral data and its underlying neural mechanism by reproducing empirical data with an integrate-and-fire computational model of the Mauthner cell.

                Sex differences in white matter microstructure have been robustly demonstrated in the adult brain using both conventional and advanced diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) approaches. However, the effect of sex on white matter microstructure prior to adulthood remains poorly understood, with previous developmental work focusing on conventional microstructure metrics and yielding mixed results. Here we thoroughly and rigorously characterized sex differences in white matter microstructure among over 6,000 children from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study who were between 9 and 10 years old. Microstructure was quantified using both the conventional model - diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) - and an advanced model, restriction spectrum imaging (RSI). DTI metrics included fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean, axial, and radial diffusivity (MD, AD, RD). RSI metrics included normalized isotropic, directional, and total intracellular diffusion (N0, ND, NT). We found significant and replicable sex differences in DTI or RSI microstructure metrics in every white matter region examined across the brain. The impact of sex on FA was regionally specific. Across white matter regions, boys exhibited greater MD, AD, and RD than girls, on average. Girls displayed increased N0, ND, and NT compared to boys, on average, suggesting greater cell and neurite density in girls. Together, these robust and replicable findings provide an important foundation for understanding sex differences in health and disease.

                Social interaction complexity makes humans unique. But in times of social deprivation this strength risks to expose important vulnerabilities. Human social neuroscience studies have placed a premium on the default network (DN). In contrast, hippocampus (HC) subfields have been intensely studied in rodents and monkeys. To bridge these two literatures, we here quantified how DN subregions systematically co-vary with specific HC subfields in the context of subjective social isolation (i.e., loneliness). By co-decomposition using structural brain scans of ~40,000 UK Biobank participants, loneliness was specially linked to midline subregions in the uncovered DN patterns. These association cortex signatures coincided with concomitant HC patterns implicating especially CA1 and molecular layer. These patterns also showed a strong affiliation with the fornix white-matter tract and the nucleus accumbens. In addition, separable signatures of structural HC-DN co-variation had distinct associations with the genetic predisposition for loneliness at the population level.

                Photoplethysmography (PPG) offers a widely-used, convenient and non-invasive approach to monitoring basic indices of cardiovascular function such as heart rate and blood oxygenation. However, while the pulse waveform, generated by PPG comprises features that are shaped by physiological and psychological factors, it is frequently overlooked in analyses of such data. We suggest that studies could be enriched by exploiting the possibilities afforded by a systematic analysis of PPG waveforms. To do this we initially require a robust and automated means of characterising it, thereby allowing us to examine variations across individuals and between different physiological and psychological contexts. We present a psychophysiologically-relevant model, the Hybrid Excess and Decay (HED) Model, which characterises pulse wave morphology in terms of three underlying pressure waves and a decay function. We show that these parameters capture PPG data with a high degree of precision and, moreover, are sensitive to specific, physiologically-relevant changes within individuals. We present the theoretical and practical basis for the model and demonstrate its performance when applied to a pharmacological dataset of 105 participants receiving intravenous administrations of the sympathomimetic drug isoproterenol (Isoprenaline). We conclude by discussing the possible value in using the HED model to complement standard measures of PPG outputs.

                Vision loss causes dramatic changes in brain function which are thought to facilitate behavioral adaptation. One interesting prospect is that the cholinergic signals are involved in this blindness-induced plasticity. Critically, the nucleus basalis of Meynert is the principal source of the cholinergic signals, however, no studies have yet investigated whether the nucleus basalis of Meynert is altered in blindness. Therefore, here we examined its structure, cerebrovascular response, and the resting-state functional connectivity in blind individuals. We found that the global signal of the nucleus basalis of Meynert as well as its network connectivity with the visual, language, and default mode network is significantly enhanced in early blind individuals. On the other hand, its structure and cerebrovascular response remain unchanged in early blind individuals. Further, we observed that less visual experience predicts stronger global and network connectivity of the nucleus basalis of Meynert. These results suggest that the nucleus basalis of Meynert develops a stronger neuromodulatory influence on the cortex of blind individuals at both global and network levels.

                Understanding the topographic heterogeneity of cortical or- ganisation is an essential step towards precision modelling of neuropsychiatric disorders. While many cortical parcellation schemes have been proposed, few attempt to model inter-subject variability. For those that do, most have been proposed for high-resolution research quality data, without exploration of how well they generalise to clinical quality scans. In this paper, we benchmark and ensemble four different geometric deep learning models on the task of learning the Human Connectome Project (HCP) multimodal cortical parcellation. We employ Monte Carlo dropout to investigate model uncertainty with a view to propagate these labels to new datasets. Models achieved an overall Dice overlap ratio of >0.85 {+/-} 0.02. Regions with the highest mean and lowest variance included V1 and areas within the parietal lobe, and regions with the lowest mean and highest variance included areas within the medial frontal lobe, lateral occipital pole and insula. Qualitatively, our results suggest that more work is needed before geometric deep learning methods are capable of fully capturing atypical cortical topographies such as those seen in area 55b. However, information about topographic variability between participants was encoded in vertex-wise uncertainty maps, suggesting a potential avenue for projection of this multimodal parcellation to new datasets with limited functional MRI, such as the UK Biobank.

                Measuring the corticokinematic coherence (CKC) between magnetoencephalographic and movement signals using an accelerometer can evaluate the functional localization of the primary sensorimotor cortex (SM1) of the upper limbs. However, it is difficult to determine the tongue CKC because an accelerometer yields excessive magnetic artifacts. We introduce and validate a novel approach for measuring the tongue CKC using a deep learning-assisted motion capture system with videography, and compare it with an accelerometer in a control task measuring finger movement. Twelve healthy volunteers performed rhythmical side-to-side tongue movements in the whole-head magnetoencephalographic system, which were simultaneously recorded using a video camera and examined offline using a deep learning-assisted motion capture system. In the control task, right finger CKC measurements were simultaneously evaluated via motion capture and an accelerometer. The right finger CKC with motion capture was significant at the movement frequency peaks or its harmonics over the contralateral hemisphere; the motion-captured CKC was 84.9% similar to that with the accelerometer. The tongue CKC was significant at the movement frequency peaks or its harmonics over both hemispheres, with no difference between the left and right hemispheres. The CKC sources of the tongue were considerably lateral and inferior to those of the finger. Thus, the CKC based on deep learning-assisted motion capture can evaluate the functional localization of the tongue SM1. In this approach, because no devices are placed on the tongue, magnetic noise, disturbances due to tongue movements, risk of aspiration of the device, and risk of infection to the experimenter are eliminated.

                Deficits in goal-directed action are reported in multiple neuropsychiatric conditions, including schizophrenia. However, dysfunction is not always apparent in early stages of schizophrenia, possibly due to neural compensation. We designed a novel devaluation task in which goal-directed action could be guided by stimulus-outcome (S-O) [presumably orbitofrontal cortex (OFC)-mediated] or response-outcome (R-O) associations [presumably prelimbic cortex (PL)-mediated]. We previously found suggestive evidence that OFC and PL could compensate for each other in this task, and we more directly assessed this potential compensation here. In Experiment 1, rats received OFC, PL, combined OFC+PL, or sham lesions and then completed our devaluation task. The OFC+PL lesion group exhibited impaired devaluation. In Experiment 2, rats received cholera-toxin-b (CTb) into OFC and either neurotoxic or sham PL lesions. Rats were then sacrificed on the last training day to double-label for Arc and CTb. We found increased Arc+CTb in mediodorsal thalamus (MD) and increased Arc+ neurons in OFC when PL was lesioned, suggesting that PL lesions lead to a compensatory increased activation of the MD->OFC circuit. Our results suggest that our devaluation task can model neural compensation between OFC and PL and this compensation may be regulated by MD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Aβ toxicity rescued by protein retention in the ER</a></h4>

              
                Accumulation of A{beta} in the brain is one of the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In the adult Drosophila brain, human A{beta} over-expression is toxic and leads to deterioration of climbing ability and shortened lifespan. However, it remains unknown if A{beta} is inherently toxic or if it triggers toxic downstream pathways that lead to neurodegeneration. Here, we describe a novel, and previously unidentified, protective role of intracellular laminin chain accumulation. Despite high A{beta} levels, over-expression of the extracellular matrix protein subunit Laminin B1 (LanB1) resulted in a robust rescue of toxicity, highlighting a potential protective mechanism of resistance to A{beta}. Over-expression of other Laminin subunits and a Collagen IV subunit also significantly rescued A{beta} toxicity, while combining LanB1 with these subunits led to an even larger rescue. Imaging revealed that LanB1 was retained in the ER but had no effect on the secretion of A{beta} into the extracellular milieu. LanB1 rescued toxicity independently of the IRE1/XBP1-mediated branch of the ER stress response. Interestingly, over-expression of ER-targeted GFP also rescued A{beta} toxicity, indicating a potentially broader benefit of ER protein retention. Finally, in proof-of-principle lentiviral transduction experiments using murine organotypic hippocampal slice cultures, over-expression of mouse Lamb1 resulted in ER-retention in transduced cells, highlighting a conserved mechanism. Typically, retention of proteins in the ER is detrimental to cellular health, but in the context of neuronal A{beta} toxicity it may prove to be beneficial and a new therapeutic avenue for AD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Distinct fastigial output channels and their impact on temporal lobe seizures</a></h4>

              
                Despite being canonically considered a motor control structure, the cerebellum is increasingly recognized for important roles in processes beyond this traditional framework, including seizure suppression. Excitatory fastigial neurons project to a large number of downstream targets, and it is unclear if this broad targeting underlies seizure suppression, or if a specific output may be sufficient. To address this question, we used the intrahippocampal kainic acid mouse model of temporal lobe epilepsy, male and female animals, and a dual-virus approach to selectively label and manipulate fastigial outputs. We examined fastigial neurons projecting to the superior colliculus, medullary reticular formation, and central lateral nucleus of the thalamus, and found that these comprise largely non-overlapping populations of neurons which send collaterals to unique sets of additional thalamic and brainstem regions, creating distinct, somewhat overlapping, output channels. We found that neither optogenetic stimulation of superior colliculus nor reticular formation output channels attenuated hippocampal seizures. In contrast, on-demand stimulation of fastigial neurons targeting the central lateral nucleus robustly inhibited seizures. Our results indicate that fastigial control of hippocampal seizures does not require simultaneous modulation of many fastigial output channels. Rather, selective modulation of the fastigial output channel to the central lateral thalamus, specifically, is sufficient for seizure control. This may provide a means for more selective therapeutic interventions, which provide seizure control while minimizing unwanted side effects. More broadly, our data highlight the concept of specific cerebellar output channels, whereby discrete cerebellar nucleus neurons project to specific aggregates of downstream targets, with distinct functional outcomes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Myostatin is a negative regulator of adult neurogenesis in zebrafish</a></h4>

              
                Intrinsic and extrinsic inhibition of axonal and neuronal regeneration obstruct spinal cord (SC) repair in mammals. In contrast, adult zebrafish achieve functional recovery after SC damage. While studies of innate SC regeneration have focused on axon regrowth as a primary repair mechanism, how local neurogenesis impacts functional recovery is unknown. We uncovered dynamic expression of myostatin b (mstnb) in a niche of dorsal ependymal progenitors after complete SC transection in zebrafish. Genetic loss-of-function in mstnb impaired functional recovery, although glial and axonal bridging across the lesion were unaffected. Using a series of transgenic reporter lines, we quantified the numbers of stem, progenitor, and neuronal cells in the absence of mstnb. We found neural stem cell proliferation was reduced, while newborn neurons were increased in mstnb null tissues, suggesting mstnb is a negative regulator of neurogenesis. Molecularly, neuron differentiation genes were upregulated, while the neural stem cell maintenance gene fgf1b was downregulated in mstnb mutants. Finally, we show that human FGF1 treatment rescued neuronal gene expression in mstnb mutants. These studies uncover unanticipated neurogenic functions for mstnb in adult zebrafish, and establish the importance of local neurogenesis for functional SC repair.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Flexible control of behavioral variability mediated by an internal representation of head direction</a></h4>

              
                Internal representations are thought to support the generation of flexible, long-timescale behavioral patterns in both animals and artificial agents. Here, we present a novel conceptual framework for how Drosophila use their internal representation of head direction to maintain preferred headings in their surroundings, and how they learn to modify these preferences in the presence of selective thermal reinforcement. To develop the framework, we analyzed flies' behavior in a classical operant visual learning paradigm and found that they use stochastically generated fixations and directed turns to express their heading preferences. Symmetries in the visual scene used in the paradigm allowed us to expose how flies' probabilistic behavior in this setting is tethered to their head direction representation. We describe how flies' ability to quickly adapt their behavior to the rules of their environment may rest on a behavioral policy whose parameters are flexible but whose form is genetically encoded in the structure of their circuits. Many of the mechanisms we outline may also be relevant for rapidly adaptive behavior driven by internal representations in other animals, including mammals.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">L-DOPA enhances hippocampal directionsignals in younger and older adults</a></h4>

              
                Previous studies indicate a role of dopamine in hippocampus-dependent spatial navigation. Although neural representations of direction are an important aspect of spatial cognition, it is not well understood whether dopamine directly affects these representations, or only impacts other aspects of spatial brain function. Moreover, both dopamine and spatial cognition decline sharply during age, raising the question which effect dopamine has on directional signals in the brain of older adults. To investigate these questions, we used a double-blind cross-over L-DOPA/Placebo intervention design in which 43 younger and 37 older adults navigated in a virtual spatial environment while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We studied the effect of L-DOPA, a DA precursor, on fMRI activation patterns that encode spatial walking directions that have previously been shown to lose specificity with age. This was done in predefined regions of interest, including the early visual cortex, retrosplenial cortex, and hippocampus. Classification of brain activation patterns associated with different walking directions was improved in the hippocampus and the retrosplenial cortex following L-DOPA administration. This suggests that DA enhances the specificity of neural representations of walking direction in these areas. In the hippocampus these results were found in both age groups, while in the RSC they were only observed in younger adults. Taken together, our study provides evidence for a mechanistic link between DA and the specificity of neural responses during spatial navigation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Metabolic control of adult neural stem cell self-renewal by the mitochondrial protease YME1L</a></h4>

              
                The transition between quiescence and activation in neural stem and progenitor cells (NSPCs) is coupled to reversible changes in energy metabolism with key implications for life-long NSPC self-renewal and neurogenesis. How this metabolic plasticity is ensured between NSPC activity states is unclear. We found that a state-dependent rewiring of the mitochondrial proteome by the peptidase YME1L is required to preserve NSPC self-renewal in the adult brain. YME1L-mediated proteome rewiring regulates the rate of fatty acid oxidation (FAO) for replenishing Krebs cycle intermediates and dNTP precursors, which are required to sustain NSPC amplification. Yme1l deletion irreversibly shifts the metabolic profile of NSPCs away from a FAO-dependent state resulting in defective self-renewal, premature differentiation and NSPC pool depletion. Our results disclose an important role for YME1L in coordinating the switch between metabolic states of NSPCs and suggest that NSPC fate is regulated by compartmentalized changes in protein network dynamics.

                Epidemiologic studies have demonstrated that infections during pregnancy increase the risk of offspring developing Schizophrenia, Autism, Depression and Bipolar Disorder and have implicated interleukin-6 (IL-6) as a causal agent. However, other cytokines have been associated with psychiatric disorders; therefore, it remains to be established whether elevating IL-6 is sufficient to alter the trajectory of neural development. Furthermore, most rodent studies have manipulated the maternal immune system at mid-gestation, which affects the stem cells and progenitors in both the primary and secondary germinal matrices. Therefore, a question that remains to be addressed is whether elevating IL-6 when the secondary germinal matrices are most active will affect brain development. Here, we have increased IL-6 from postnatal days 3-6, when the secondary germinal matrices are rapidly expanding. Using Nestin-CreERT2 fate mapping we show that this transient increase in IL-6 decreased neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus of the dorsal hippocampus, reduced astrogliogenesis in the prefrontal cortex and amygdala and decreased oligodendrogenesis in the body and splenium of the corpus callosum all by ~50%. Moreover, the IL-6 treatment elicited behavioral changes classically associated with neurodevelopmental disorders. As adults, IL-6 injected male mice lost social preference in the social approach test, spent ~30% less time socially engaging with sexually receptive females and produced ~50% fewer ultrasonic vocalizations during mating. They also engaged ~50% more time in self-grooming behavior and had an increase in inhibitory avoidance. Altogether, these data provide new insights into the biological mechanisms linking perinatal immune activation to complex neurodevelopmental brain disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The Rules of Pulsatile Neurostimulation</a></h4>

              
                Electrical stimulation of neural responses is used both scientifically in brain mapping studies and in many clinical applications such as cochlear, vestibular, and retinal implants. Due to safety considerations, stimulation of the nervous system is restricted to short biphasic pulses. Despite decades of research and development, neural implants are far from optimal in their ability to restore function and lead to varying improvements in patients. In this study, we provide an explanation for how pulsatile stimulation affects individual neurons and therefore leads to variability in restoration of neural responses. The explanation is grounded in the physiological response of channels in the axon and represented with mathematical rules that predict firing rate as a function of pulse rate, pulse amplitude, and spontaneous activity. We validate these rules by showing that they predict recorded vestibular afferent responses in macaques and discuss their implications for designing clinical stimulation paradigms and electrical stimulation-based experiments.

	<p>(1) Background: Persons with multiple sclerosis (pwMS) are often characterized as ideal adopters of new digital healthcare trends, but it is worth thinking about whether and which pwMS will be targeted and served by a particular eHealth service like a patient portal. With our study, we wanted to explore needs and barriers for subgroups of pwMS and their caregivers when interacting with eHealth services in care and daily living. (2) Methods: This study comprises results from two surveys: one collecting data from pwMS and their relatives (as informal caregivers) and another one providing information on the opinions and attitudes of healthcare professionals (HCPs). Data were analyzed descriptively and via generalized linear models. (3) Results: 185 pwMS, 25 informal caregivers, and 24 HCPs in the field of MS participated. Nine out of ten pwMS used information technology on a daily base. Individual impairments like in vision and cognition resulted in individual needs like the desire to actively monitor their disease course or communicate with their physician in person. HCPs reported that a complete medication overview, additional medication information, overview of future visits and a reminder of medication intake would be very helpful eHealth features for pwMS, while they themselves preferred features organizing and enriching future visits. (4) Conclusions: A closer look at the various profiles of eHealth adoption in pwMS and their caregivers indicated that there is a broad and robust enthusiasm across several subgroups that does not exclude anyone in general, but constitutes specific areas of interest. For pwMS, the focus was on eHealth services that connect previously collected information and make them easily accessible and understandable.</p>

	<p>Individuals with different hypnotizability display different interoceptive sensitivity/awareness (IS) and accuracy (IA), likely sustained by morphofunctional differences in interoception-related brain regions and, thus, possibly also observable during sleep. We investigated the heartbeat-evoked cortical potential amplitude (HEP) during sleep, its association with IS, and the role of hypnotizability in such association. We performed a retrospective analysis of polysomnographic recordings of 39 healthy volunteers. Participants completed the Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness (MAIA), measuring IS and IA, and underwent hypnotic assessment via the Stanford Hypnotic Susceptibility Scale, form A. The amplitude of the early and late HEP components was computed at EEG frontal and central sites. In both regions, the early HEP component was larger in N3 than in N2 and REM, with no difference between N2 and REM. Greater HEP amplitude at frontal than at central sites was found for the late HEP component. HEP amplitudes were not influenced by the autonomic state assessed by heart rate variability in the frequency and time domains. We report for the first time a positive correlation between the central late HEP component and MAIA dimensions, which became non-significant after removing the effects of hypnotizability. Our findings indicate that hypnotizability sustains the correlation between IS and HEP amplitude during sleep.</p>

	<p>Aggression is a multidimensional behavior that could be caused by different biopsychosocial variables. The aim of this study was to explore whether temperament, cortisol and sex moderate the relation between fathers’ parenting style and aggressive behavior in school-aged children, and whether this corresponds to differential susceptibility or diathesis-stress. Participants were 158 children (88 boys and 70 girls) aged 8 years. Aggressive behavior was measured using the Direct and Indirect Aggression Scale and fathers informed about their child’s temperament and their own parenting style through the Children’s Behavior Questionnaire and the Parenting Styles and Dimensions Questionnaire (respectively). Children’s’ baseline saliva cortisol levels were analyzed through an enzyme immunoassay technique. The results revealed that high cortisol levels moderated the relation between fathers’ low levels of authoritative parenting and boys’ aggression. Moreover, high negative emotionality moderated the relation between permissive paternal parenting and girls’ aggressive behavior, with both these relations being consistent with the diathesis-stress theory.</p>

	<p>Background: Several studies highlighted that sleepiness affects driving abilities. In particular, road traffic injuries due to excessive daytime sleepiness are about 10%–20%. Considering that aging is related to substantial sleep changes and the number of older adults with driving license is increasing, the current review aims to summarize recent studies on this issue. Further, we intend to provide insights for future research. Methods: From the 717 records screened, ten articles were selected and systematically reviewed. Results: Among the selected articles, (a) five studies investigated sleepiness only by self-reported standardized measures; (b) two studies assessed sleepiness also using a behavioral task; (c) three studies obtained objective measures by electroencephalographic recordings. Conclusions: The available literature on the topic reports several limitations. Overall, many findings converge in evidencing that older drivers are less vulnerable to sleep loss and sleepiness-related driving impairments than young adults. These discrepancies in sleepiness vulnerability between age groups may be ascribed to differences in subjects’ lifestyles. Moreover, it has been hypothesized that older adults self-regulate their driving and avoid specific dangerous situations. We believe that an easy protocol to objectively evaluate the vigilance level in elderly and young adults is required, and further studies are needed.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The ventral pallidum (VP) is the major downstream nucleus of the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Both VP and NAc neurons are responsive to reward-predictive stimuli and are critical drivers of reward-seeking behavior. The cue-evoked excitations and inhibitions of NAc neurons predict the vigor (latency and speed) of the cue-elicited locomotor approach response and encode the animal&rsquo;s proximity to the movement target, but do not encode more specific movement features such as turn direction. VP neurons also encode certain vigor parameters, but it remains unknown whether they also encode more specific movement features, and whether such encoding could account for vigor encoding. To address these questions, we recorded the firing of neurons in the VP of freely moving male rats performing a discriminative stimulus (DS) task. Similar to NAc neurons, VP neurons&rsquo; cue-evoked excitations were correlated with the speed of the upcoming approach movement and the animal&rsquo;s proximity to the movement target at cue onset. Unlike NAc neurons, VP neurons&rsquo; firing reflected the efficiency of the approach movement path but not the latency to initiate locomotion. VP cue-evoked excitations are unlikely to be directly influenced by NAc cue-evoked excitations because unilateral treatment of the NAc with a dopamine D1 receptor antagonist, a manipulation that reduces NAc neurons&rsquo; cue-evoked excitations, did not alter ipsilateral VP cue-evoked excitations. These observations suggest that the two structures receive simultaneous activation by inputs conveying similar but not identical information, and work in parallel to set the vigor of the behavioral response.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Neurocognitive impairment is present in cirrhosis and may be more severe in cirrhosis with overt hepatic encephalopathy (OHE). Liver transplantation (LT) can restore liver function, but how it reverses the impaired brain function is still unclear. MRI of resting-state functional connectivity can help reveal the underlying mechanisms that lead to these cognitive deficits and cognitive recovery. In this study, 64 patients with cirrhosis (28 with OHE; 36 without OHE) and 32 healthy control subjects were recruited for resting-state fMRI. The patients were scanned before and after LT. We evaluated presurgical and postsurgical neurocognitive performance in cirrhosis patients using psychomotor tests. Network-based statistics found significant disrupted connectivity in both groups of cirrhotic patients, with OHE and without OHE, compared with control subjects. However, the presurgical connectivity disruption in patients with OHE affected a greater number of connections than those without OHE. The decrease in functional connectivity for both OHE and non-OHE patient groups was reversed after LT to the level of control subjects. An additional hyperconnected network (i.e., higher connected than control subjects) was observed in OHE patients after LT. Regarding the neural&ndash;behavior relationship, the functional network that predicted cognitive performance in healthy individuals showed no correlation in presurgical cirrhotic patients. The impaired neural&ndash;behavior relationship was re-established after LT for non-OHE patients, but not for OHE patients. OHE patients displayed abnormal hyperconnectivity and a persistently impaired neural&ndash;behavior relationship after LT. Our results suggest that patients with OHE may undergo a different trajectory of postsurgical neurofunctional recovery compared with those without, which needs further clarification in future studies.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">A Cre-Dependent CRISPR/dCas9 System for Gene Expression Regulation in Neurons</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Site-specific genetic and epigenetic targeting of distinct cell populations is a central goal in molecular neuroscience and is crucial to understand the gene regulatory mechanisms that underlie complex phenotypes and behaviors. While recent technological advances have enabled unprecedented control over gene expression, many of these approaches are focused on selected model organisms and/or require labor-intensive customization for different applications. The simplicity and modularity of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-based systems have transformed genome editing and expanded the gene regulatory toolbox. However, there are few available tools for cell-selective CRISPR regulation in neurons. We designed, validated, and optimized CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) and CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) systems for Cre recombinase-dependent gene regulation. Unexpectedly, CRISPRa systems based on a traditional double-floxed inverted open reading frame (DIO) strategy exhibited leaky target gene induction even without Cre. Therefore, we developed an intron-containing Cre-dependent CRISPRa system (SVI-DIO-dCas9-VPR) that alleviated leaky gene induction and outperformed the traditional DIO system at endogenous genes in HEK293T cells and rat primary neuron cultures. Using gene-specific CRISPR sgRNAs, we demonstrate that SVI-DIO-dCas9-VPR can activate numerous rat or human genes (<I>GRM2</I>, <I>Tent5b</I>, <I>Fos</I>, <I>Sstr2</I>, and <I>Gadd45b</I>) in a Cre-specific manner. To illustrate the versatility of this tool, we created a parallel CRISPRi construct that successfully inhibited expression from a luciferase reporter in HEK293T cells only in the presence of Cre. These results provide a robust framework for Cre-dependent CRISPR-dCas9 approaches across different model systems, and enable cell-specific targeting when combined with common Cre driver lines or Cre delivery via viral vectors.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Differential Expression Levels of Sox9 in Early Neocortical Radial Glial Cells Regulate the Decision between Stem Cell Maintenance and Differentiation</a></h4>

              
                <p>Radial glial progenitor cells (RGCs) in the dorsal telencephalon directly or indirectly produce excitatory projection neurons and macroglia of the neocortex. Recent evidence shows that the pool of RGCs is more heterogeneous than originally thought and that progenitor subpopulations can generate particular neuronal cell types. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we have studied gene expression patterns of RGCs with different neurogenic behavior at early stages of cortical development. At this early age, some RGCs rapidly produce postmitotic neurons, whereas others self-renew and undergo neurogenic divisions at a later age. We have identified candidate genes that are differentially expressed among these early RGC subpopulations, including the transcription factor Sox9. Using <I>in utero</I> electroporation in embryonic mice of either sex, we demonstrate that elevated Sox9 expression in progenitors affects RGC cell cycle duration and leads to the generation of upper layer cortical neurons. Our data thus reveal molecular differences between progenitor cells with different neurogenic behavior at early stages of corticogenesis and indicates that Sox9 is critical for the maintenance of RGCs to regulate the generation of upper layer neurons.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The existence of heterogeneity in the pool of RGCs and its relationship with the generation of cellular diversity in the cerebral cortex has been an interesting topic of debate for many years. Here we describe the existence of RGCs with reduced neurogenic behavior at early embryonic ages presenting a particular molecular signature. This molecular signature consists of differential expression of some genes including the transcription factor Sox9, which has been found to be a specific regulator of this subpopulation of progenitor cells. Functional experiments perturbing expression levels of Sox9 reveal its instructive role in the regulation of the neurogenic behavior of RGCs and its relationship with the generation of upper layer projection neurons at later ages.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Carboxypeptidase E Regulates Activity-Dependent TrkB Neuronal Surface Insertion and Hippocampal Memory</a></h4>

              
                <p>Activity-dependent insertion of the tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB) receptor into the plasma membrane can explain, in part, the preferential effect of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) on active neurons and synapses; however, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain obscure. Here, we report a novel function for carboxypeptidase E (CPE) in controlling chemical long-term potentiation stimuli-induced TrkB surface delivery in hippocampal neurons. Total internal reflection fluorescence assays and line plot assays showed that CPE facilitates TrkB transport from dendritic shafts to the plasma membrane. The Box2 domain in the juxtamembrane region of TrkB and the C terminus of CPE are critical for the activity-dependent plasma membrane insertion of TrkB. Moreover, the transactivator of transcription TAT-CPE<sup>452-466</sup>, which could block the association between CPE and TrkB, significantly inhibited neuronal activity-enhanced BDNF signaling and dendritic spine morphologic plasticity in cultured hippocampal neurons. Microinfusion of TAT-CPE<sup>452-466</sup> into the dorsal hippocampus of male C57BL/6 mice inhibited the endogenous interaction between TrkB and CPE and diminished fear-conditioning-induced TrkB phosphorylation, which might lead to an impairment in hippocampal memory acquisition and consolidation but not retrieval. These results suggest that CPE modulates activity-induced TrkB surface insertion and hippocampal-dependent memory and sheds light on our understanding of the role of CPE in TrkB-dependent synaptic plasticity and memory modulation.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> It is well known that BDNF acts preferentially on active neurons; however, the underlying molecular mechanism is not fully understood. In this study, we found that the cytoplasmic tail of CPE could interact with TrkB and facilitate the neuronal activity-dependent movement of TrkB vesicles to the plasma membrane. Blocking the association between CPE and TrkB decreased fear-conditioning-induced TrkB phosphorylation and led to hippocampal memory deficits. These findings provide novel insights into the role of CPE in TrkB intracellular trafficking as well as in mediating BDNF/TrkB function in synaptic plasticity and hippocampal memory.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Rapid Ultrastructural Changes in the PSD and Surrounding Membrane after Induction of Structural LTP in Single Dendritic Spines</a></h4>

              
                <p>The structural plasticity of dendritic spines is considered to be an important basis of synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory. Here, we induced input-specific structural LTP (sLTP) in single dendritic spines in organotypic hippocampal slices from mice of either sex and performed ultrastructural analyses of the spines using efficient correlative light and electron microscopy. We observed reorganization of the PSD nanostructure, such as perforation and segmentation, at 2&ndash;3, 20, and 120 min after sLTP induction. In addition, PSD and nonsynaptic axon&ndash;spine interface (nsASI) membrane expanded unevenly during sLTP. Specifically, the PSD area showed a transient increase at 2&ndash;3 min after sLTP induction. The PSD growth was to a degree less than spine volume growth at 2&ndash;3 min and 20 min after sLTP induction but became similar at 120 min. On the other hand, the nsASI area showed a profound and lasting expansion, to a degree similar to spine volume growth throughout the process. These rapid ultrastructural changes in PSD and surrounding membrane may contribute to rapid electrophysiological plasticity during sLTP.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> To understand the ultrastructural changes during synaptic plasticity, it is desired to efficiently image single dendritic spines that underwent structural plasticity in electron microscopy. We induced structural long-term potentiation (sLTP) in single dendritic spines by two-photon glutamate uncaging. We then identified the same spines at different phases of sLTP and performed ultrastructural analysis by using an efficient correlative light and electron microscopy method. We found that postsynaptic density undergoes dramatic modification in its structural complexity immediately after sLTP induction. Meanwhile, the nonsynaptic axon&ndash;spine interface area shows a rapid and sustained increase throughout sLTP. Our results indicate that the uneven modification of synaptic and nonsynaptic postsynaptic membrane might contribute to rapid electrophysiological plasticity during sLTP.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Regional White Matter Scaling in the Human Brain</a></h4>

              
                <p>Anatomical organization of the primate cortex varies as a function of total brain size, where possession of a larger brain is accompanied by disproportionate expansion of associative cortices alongside a relative contraction of sensorimotor systems. However, equivalent scaling maps are not yet available for regional white matter anatomy. Here, we use three large-scale neuroimaging datasets to examine how regional white matter volume (WMV) scales with interindividual variation in brain volume among typically developing humans (combined <I>N</I> = 2391: 1247 females, 1144 males). We show that WMV scaling is regionally heterogeneous: larger brains have relatively greater WMV in anterior and posterior regions of cortical white matter, as well as the genu and splenium of the corpus callosum, but relatively less WMV in most subcortical regions. Furthermore, regions of positive WMV scaling tend to connect previously-defined regions of positive gray matter scaling in the cortex, revealing a coordinated coupling of regional gray and white matter organization with naturally occurring variations in human brain size. However, we also show that two commonly studied measures of white matter microstructure, fractional anisotropy (FA) and magnetization transfer (MT), scale negatively with brain size, and do so in a manner that is spatially unlike WMV scaling. Collectively, these findings provide a more complete view of anatomic scaling in the human brain, and offer new contexts for the interpretation of regional white matter variation in health and disease.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Recent work has shown that, in humans, regional cortical and subcortical anatomy show systematic changes as a function of brain size variation. Here, we show that regional white matter structures also show brain-size related changes in humans. Specifically, white matter regions connecting higher-order cortical systems are relatively expanded in larger human brains, while subcortical and cerebellar white matter tracts responsible for unimodal sensory or motor functions are relatively contracted. This regional scaling of white matter volume (WMV) is coordinated with regional scaling of cortical anatomy, but is distinct from scaling of white matter microstructure. These findings provide a more complete view of anatomic scaling of the human brain, with relevance for evolutionary, basic, and clinical neuroscience.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Disengagement of Motor Cortex during Long-Term Learning Tracks the Performance Level of Learned Movements</a></h4>

              
                <p>Not all movements require the motor cortex for execution. Intriguingly, dependence on motor cortex of a given movement is not fixed, but instead can dynamically change over the course of long-term learning. For instance, rodent forelimb movements that initially require motor cortex can become independent of the motor cortex after an extended period of training. However, it remains unclear whether long-term neural changes rendering the motor cortex dispensable are a simple function of the training length. To address this issue, we trained mice (both male and female) to perform two distinct forelimb movements, forward versus downward reaches with a joystick, concomitantly over several weeks, and then compared the involvement of the motor cortex between the two movements. Most mice achieved different levels of motor performance between the two movements after long-term training. Of the two movements, the one that achieved higher trial-to-trial consistency (i.e., consistent-direction movement) was significantly less affected by inactivation of motor cortex than the other (i.e., variable-direction movement). Two-photon calcium imaging of motor cortical neurons revealed that the consistent-direction movement activates fewer neurons, producing weaker and less consistent population activity than the variable-direction movement. Together, the motor cortex was less engaged and less necessary for learned movements that achieved higher levels of consistency. Thus, the long-term reorganization of neural circuits that frees the motor cortex from the learned movement is not a mere function of training length. Rather, this reorganization tracks the level of motor performance that the animal achieves during training.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Long-term training of a movement reshapes motor circuits, disengaging motor cortex potentially for automatized execution of the learned movement. Acquiring new motor skills often involves learning of multiple movements (e.g., forehand and backhand strokes when learning tennis), but different movements do not always improve at the same time nor reach the same level of proficiency. Here we showed that the involvement of motor cortex after long-term training differs between similar yet distinct movements that reached different levels of expertise. Motor cortex was less engaged and less necessary for the more proficient movement. Thus, disengagement of motor cortex is not a simple function of training time, but instead tracks the level of expertise of a learned movement.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Sparse Coding in Temporal Association Cortex Improves Complex Sound Discriminability</a></h4>

              
                <p>The mouse auditory cortex is comprised of several auditory fields spanning the dorsoventral axis of the temporal lobe. The ventral most auditory field is the temporal association cortex (TeA), which remains largely unstudied. Using Neuropixels probes, we simultaneously recorded from primary auditory cortex (AUDp), secondary auditory cortex (AUDv), and TeA, characterizing neuronal responses to pure tones and frequency modulated (FM) sweeps in awake head-restrained female mice. As compared with AUDp and AUDv, single-unit (SU) responses to pure tones in TeA were sparser, delayed, and prolonged. Responses to FMs were also sparser. Population analysis showed that the sparser responses in TeA render it less sensitive to pure tones, yet more sensitive to FMs. When characterizing responses to pure tones under anesthesia, the distinct signature of TeA was changed considerably as compared with that in awake mice, implying that responses in TeA are strongly modulated by non-feedforward connections. Together, these findings provide a basic electrophysiological description of TeA as an integral part of sound processing along the cortical hierarchy.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> This is the first comprehensive characterization of the auditory responses in the awake mouse auditory temporal association cortex (TeA). The study provides the foundations for further investigation of TeA and its involvement in auditory learning, plasticity, auditory driven behaviors etc. The study was conducted using state of the art data collection tools, allowing for simultaneous recording from multiple cortical regions and numerous neurons.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Rhythmic Modulation of Visual Perception by Continuous Rhythmic Auditory Stimulation</a></h4>

              
                <p>At any given moment our sensory systems receive multiple, often rhythmic, inputs from the environment. Processing of temporally structured events in one sensory modality can guide both behavioral and neural processing of events in other sensory modalities, but whether this occurs remains unclear. Here, we used human electroencephalography (EEG) to test the cross-modal influences of a continuous auditory frequency-modulated (FM) sound on visual perception and visual cortical activity. We report systematic fluctuations in perceptual discrimination of brief visual stimuli in line with the phase of the FM-sound. We further show that this rhythmic modulation in visual perception is related to an accompanying rhythmic modulation of neural activity recorded over visual areas. Importantly, in our task, perceptual and neural visual modulations occurred without any abrupt and salient onsets in the energy of the auditory stimulation and without any rhythmic structure in the visual stimulus. As such, the results provide a critical validation for the existence and functional role of cross-modal entrainment and demonstrates its utility for organizing the perception of multisensory stimulation in the natural environment.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Our sensory environment is filled with rhythmic structures that are often multi-sensory in nature. Here, we show that the alignment of neural activity to the phase of an auditory frequency-modulated (FM) sound has cross-modal consequences for vision: yielding systematic fluctuations in perceptual discrimination of brief visual stimuli that are mediated by accompanying rhythmic modulation of neural activity recorded over visual areas. These cross-modal effects on visual neural activity and perception occurred without any abrupt and salient onsets in the energy of the auditory stimulation and without any rhythmic structure in the visual stimulus. The current work shows that continuous auditory fluctuations in the natural environment can provide a pacing signal for neural activity and perception across the senses.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Temporal Dynamics of Brain White Matter Plasticity in Sighted Subjects during Tactile Braille Learning: A Longitudinal Diffusion Tensor Imaging Study</a></h4>

              
                <p>The white matter (WM) architecture of the human brain changes in response to training, though fine-grained temporal characteristics of training-induced white matter plasticity remain unexplored. We investigated white matter microstructural changes using diffusion tensor imaging at five different time points in 26 sighted female adults during 8 months of training on tactile braille reading. Our results show that training-induced white matter plasticity occurs both within and beyond the trained sensory modality, as reflected by fractional anisotropy (FA) increases in somatosensory and visual cortex, respectively. The observed changes followed distinct time courses, with gradual linear FA increase along the training in the somatosensory cortex and sudden visual cortex cross-modal plasticity occurring after braille input became linguistically meaningful. WM changes observed in these areas returned to baseline after the cessation of learning in line with the supply&ndash;demand model of plasticity. These results also indicate that the temporal dynamics of microstructural plasticity in different cortical regions might be modulated by the nature of computational demands. We provide additional evidence that observed FA training-induced changes are behaviorally relevant to tactile reading. Together, these results demonstrate that WM plasticity is a highly dynamic process modulated by the introduction of novel experiences.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Throughout the lifetime the human brain is shaped by various experiences. Training-induced reorganization in white matter (WM) microstructure has been reported, but we know little about its temporal dynamics. To fill this gap, we scanned sighted subjects five times during tactile braille reading training. We observed different dynamics of WM plasticity in the somatosensory and visual cortices implicated in braille reading. The former showed a continuous increase in WM tissue anisotropy along with tactile training, while microstructural changes in the latter were observed only after the participants learned to read braille words. Our results confirm the supply&ndash;demand model of brain plasticity and provide evidence that WM reorganization depends on distinct computational demands and functional roles of regions involved in the trained skill.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">G-Protein-Gated Inwardly Rectifying Potassium (Kir3/GIRK) Channels Govern Synaptic Plasticity That Supports Hippocampal-Dependent Cognitive Functions in Male Mice</a></h4>

              
                <p>The G-protein-gated inwardly rectifying potassium (Kir3/GIRK) channel is the effector of many G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Its dysfunction has been linked to the pathophysiology of Down syndrome, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, psychiatric disorders, epilepsy, drug addiction, or alcoholism. In the hippocampus, GIRK channels decrease excitability of the cells and contribute to resting membrane potential and inhibitory neurotransmission. Here, to elucidate the role of GIRK channels activity in the maintenance of hippocampal-dependent cognitive functions, their involvement in controlling neuronal excitability at different levels of complexity was examined in C57BL/6 male mice. For that purpose, GIRK activity in the dorsal hippocampus CA3&ndash;CA1 synapse was pharmacologically modulated by two drugs: ML297, a GIRK channel opener, and Tertiapin-Q (TQ), a GIRK channel blocker. <I>Ex vivo</I>, using dorsal hippocampal slices, we studied the effect of pharmacological GIRK modulation on synaptic plasticity processes induced in CA1 by Schaffer collateral stimulation. <I>In vivo</I>, we performed acute intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injections of the two GIRK modulators to study their contribution to electrophysiological properties and synaptic plasticity of dorsal hippocampal CA3&ndash;CA1 synapse, and to learning and memory capabilities during hippocampal-dependent tasks. We found that pharmacological disruption of GIRK channel activity by i.c.v. injections, causing either function gain or function loss, induced learning and memory deficits by a mechanism involving neural excitability impairments and alterations in the induction and maintenance of long-term synaptic plasticity processes. These results support the contention that an accurate control of GIRK activity must take place in the hippocampus to sustain cognitive functions.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Cognitive processes of learning and memory that rely on hippocampal synaptic plasticity processes are critically ruled by a finely tuned neural excitability. G-protein-gated inwardly rectifying K<sup>+</sup> (GIRK) channels play a key role in maintaining resting membrane potential, cell excitability and inhibitory neurotransmission. Here, we demonstrate that modulation of GIRK channels activity, causing either function gain or function loss, transforms high-frequency stimulation (HFS)-induced long-term potentiation (LTP) into long-term depression (LTD), inducing deficits in hippocampal-dependent learning and memory. Together, our data show a crucial GIRK-activity-mediated mechanism that governs synaptic plasticity direction and modulates subsequent hippocampal-dependent cognitive functions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Untangling the Animacy Organization of Occipitotemporal Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>Some of the most impressive functional specializations in the human brain are found in the occipitotemporal cortex (OTC), where several areas exhibit selectivity for a small number of visual categories, such as faces and bodies, and spatially cluster based on stimulus animacy. Previous studies suggest this animacy organization reflects the representation of an intuitive taxonomic hierarchy, distinct from the presence of face- and body-selective areas in OTC. Using human functional magnetic resonance imaging, we investigated the independent contribution of these two factors&mdash;the face-body division and taxonomic hierarchy&mdash;in accounting for the animacy organization of OTC and whether they might also be reflected in the architecture of several deep neural networks that have not been explicitly trained to differentiate taxonomic relations. We found that graded visual selectivity, based on animal resemblance to human faces and bodies, masquerades as an apparent animacy continuum, which suggests that taxonomy is not a separate factor underlying the organization of the ventral visual pathway.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Portions of the visual cortex are specialized to determine whether types of objects are animate in the sense of being capable of self-movement. Two factors have been proposed as accounting for this animacy organization: representations of faces and bodies and an intuitive taxonomic continuum of humans and animals. We performed an experiment to assess the independent contribution of both of these factors. We found that graded visual representations, based on animal resemblance to human faces and bodies, masquerade as an apparent animacy continuum, suggesting that taxonomy is not a separate factor underlying the organization of areas in the visual cortex.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Strategic Distractor Suppression Improves Selective Control in Human Vision</a></h4>

              
                <p>Our visual environment is complicated, and our cognitive capacity is limited. As a result, we must strategically ignore some stimuli to prioritize others. Common sense suggests that foreknowledge of distractor characteristics, like location or color, might help us ignore these objects. But empirical studies have provided mixed evidence, often showing that knowing about a distractor before it appears counterintuitively leads to its attentional selection. What has looked like strategic distractor suppression in the past is now commonly explained as a product of prior experience and implicit statistical learning, and the long-standing notion the distractor suppression is reflected in &alpha; band oscillatory brain activity has been challenged by results appearing to link &alpha; to target resolution. Can we strategically, proactively suppress distractors? And, if so, does this involve &alpha;? Here, we use the concurrent recording of human EEG and eye movements in optimized experimental designs to identify behavior and brain activity associated with proactive distractor suppression. Results from three experiments show that knowing about distractors before they appear causes a reduction in electrophysiological indices of covert attentional selection of these objects and a reduction in the overt deployment of the eyes to the location of the objects. This control is established before the distractor appears and is predicted by the power of cue-elicited &alpha; activity over the visual cortex. Foreknowledge of distractor characteristics therefore leads to improved selective control, and &alpha; oscillations in visual cortex reflect the implementation of this strategic, proactive mechanism.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> To behave adaptively and achieve goals we often need to ignore visual distraction. Is it easier to ignore distracting objects when we know more about them? We recorded eye movements and electrical brain activity to determine whether foreknowledge of distractor characteristics can be used to limit processing of these objects. Results show that knowing the location or color of a distractor stops us from attentionally selecting it. A neural signature of this inhibition emerges in oscillatory alpha band brain activity, and when this signal is strong, selective processing of the distractor decreases. Knowing about the characteristics of task-irrelevant distractors therefore increases our ability to focus on task-relevant information, in this way gating information processing in the brain.</p>
