     alt="The effects of orexin-A and orexin receptors on anxiety- and depression-related behaviors in a male rat model of post-traumatic stress disorder"/>
<p>Single prolonged stress (SPS) rats exhibited enhanced levels of anxiety, reduced exploratory activities, and anhedonia. SPS reduced the expression levels of orexin-A in the hypothalamus and increased the expression levels of OX1R in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Moreover, the intracerebroventricular administration of orexin-A alleviated anxiety-like behaviors, improved the reduction of locomotor activity in SPS rats, and partly restored OX1R levels in the mPFC. Therefore, the orexin system plays a role in the anxiety- and depression-related symptoms observed in post-traumatic stress disorder.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Orexin neurons play an important role in stress-related mental disorders including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Anxiety- and depression-related symptoms commonly occur in combination with PTSD. However, the role of the orexin system in mediating alterations in these affective symptoms remains unclear. The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is implicated in both cognitive and emotional processing. In the present study, we investigated anxiety- and depression-related behavioral changes using the elevated plus maze, the sucrose preference test, and the open field test in male rats with single prolonged stress (SPS) induced-PTSD. The expression of orexin-A in the hypothalamus and orexin receptors (OX1R and OX2R) in the mPFC was detected and quantified by immunohistochemistry, western blotting, and real-time polymerase chain reaction. We found that the SPS rats exhibited enhanced levels of anxiety, reduced exploratory activities, and anhedonia. Furthermore, SPS resulted in reductions in the expression of orexin-A in the hypothalamus and the increased the expression of OX1R in the mPFC. The intracerebroventricular administration of orexin-A alleviated behavioral changes in SPS rats and partly restored the increased levels of OX1R in the mPFC. These results suggest that the orexin system plays a role in the anxiety- and depression-related symptoms observed in PTSD.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Strong gamma frequency oscillations in the adolescent prefrontal cortex</a></h4>

              
                Working memory ability continues to mature into adulthood in both humans and non-human primates. At the single neuron level, adolescent development is characterized by increased prefrontal firing rate in the delay period, but less is known about how coordinated activity between neurons is altered. Local field potentials (LFP) provide a window into the computation carried out by the local network. To address the effects of adolescent development on LFP activity, three male rhesus monkeys were trained to perform an oculomotor delayed response task and tested at both the adolescent and adult stage. Simultaneous single-unit and LFP signals were recorded from areas 8a and 46 of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). In both the cue and delay period, power relative to baseline increased in the gamma frequency range (32 - 128 Hz). In the adult stage, high-firing neurons were also more likely to reside at sites with strong gamma power increase from baseline. For both stages, the gamma power increase in the delay was selective for sites with neuron encoding stimulus information in their spiking. Gamma power and neuronal firing did not show stronger temporal correlations. Our results establish gamma power decrease to be a feature of prefrontal cortical maturation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Bantam regulates the adult sleep circuit in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Sleep is a highly conserved feature of animal life characterized by dramatic changes in behavior, neural physiology and gene expression. The gene regulatory factors responsible for these sleep-dependent changes remain largely unknown. microRNAs are post-transcriptional modulators of gene expression which have been implicated in sleep regulation. Our previous screen identified 25 sleep-regulating microRNAs in Drosophila melanogaster, including the developmental regulator bantam (ban). Here we show that ban promotes early nighttime sleep through a population of glutamatergic neurons- the {gamma}5{beta}'2a/{beta}'2mp/{beta}'2mp_bilateral Mushroom Body Output Neurons (MBONs). We found that knockdown of ban in these neurons led to a reduction in early night sleep. The {gamma}5{beta}'2a/{beta}'2mp/{beta}'2mp_bilateral MBONs were previously shown to be wake-promoting, suggesting that ban acts to inhibit these neurons. GCaMP calcium imaging revealed that bantam inhibits the neural activity of the {gamma}5{beta}'2a/{beta}'2mp/{beta}'2mp_bilateral MBONs during the night but not the day. Blocking synaptic transmission in the {gamma}5{beta}'2a/{beta}'2mp/{beta}'2mp_bilateral MBONs rescued the effect of ban knockdown on sleep. Together these results suggest that ban promotes night sleep via the inhibition of the {gamma}5{beta}'2a/{beta}'2mp/{beta}'2mp_bilateral MBONs. RNAseq further revealed that bantam negatively regulates the wake-promoting mRNAs Kelch and CCHamide-2 receptor in the {gamma}5{beta}'2a/{beta}'2mp/{beta}'2mp_bilateral MBONs. These experiments establish bantam as an active regulator of sleep and neural activity within the fly brain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">BIFURCATING NEURONS IN THE ANTERIOR THALAMIC NUCLEI</a></h4>

              
                The anterior thalamic nuclei (ATN) form a nodal point within a hippocampal-cingulate-diencephalic memory system. ATN projections to different brain structures are conventionally viewed as distinct, but ATN neurons may send collaterals to multiple structures. The anteromedial subregion (AM) is the primary source of efferents to the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Using a dual-retrograde neurotracer strategy, we discovered bifurcating AM neurons for tracers placed in the mPFC when paired with other regions. A semi-quantitative analysis found a high proportion of AM neurons (~36%) showed collateral projections when the mPFC was paired with dorsal subiculum (dSub); 20% were evident for mPFC paired with caudal retrosplenial cortex (cRSC); and 6% was found for mPFC and ventral hippocampal formation (vHF). About 10% of bifurcating AM neurons was also identified when the mPFC was not included, that is, for cRSC with dSub, and cRSC with vHF. Similar percentages of bifurcating neurons were also found within the anterior region of the adjacent nucleus reuniens (Re). The high frequency of bifurcating neurons suggests a new perspective for ATN function. These neurons would facilitate direct coordination among distal neural ensembles to support episodic memory and may explain why the ATN is a critical region for diencephalic amnesia.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Beyond dimension reduction: Stable electric fields emerge from and allow representational drift</a></h4>

              
                It is known that the exact neurons maintaining a given memory (the neural ensemble) change from trial to trial. This raises the question of how the brain achieves stability in the face of this representational drift. Here, we demonstrate that this stability emerges at the level of the electric fields that arise from neural activity. The electric fields, in turn, can act as 'guard rails' that funnel higher dimensional variable neural activity along stable lower dimensional routes. We show that electric fields carry information about working memory content. We obtained the latent space associated with each memory. We then confirmed the stability of the electric field by mapping the latent space to different cortical patches (that comprise a neural ensemble) and reconstructing information flow between patches. Stable electric fields can allow latent states to be transferred between brain areas, in accord with modern engram theory.

	<p>Background: Despite an alarming rise in the global prevalence of dementia, the available modalities for improving cognition and mental wellbeing of dementia patients remain limited. Environmental enrichment is an experimental paradigm that has shown promising anti-depressive and memory-enhancing effects in pre-clinical studies. However, its clinical utility has remained limited due to the lack of effective implementation strategies. Objective: The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the usability (tolerability and interactivity) of a long-term virtual reality (VR)- based environmental enrichment training program in older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and mild dementia. A secondary objective was to assess the effect of VR-based environmental enrichment on stabilization of cognitive functioning and improvement of mental wellbeing in older adults with MCI and mild dementia. Methods: A total of seven participants (four patients with MCI and three with mild dementia) received biweekly VR-based environmental enrichment over a course of 6 months. The tolerability and interactivity of the participants in the VR training was serially assessed via virtual reality sickness questionnaire (VRSQ) and recording of input-error ratio. Cognitive functioning was assessed through Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) before and after the study. Mental wellbeing was assessed through Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well Being Scale (WEMWBS). Results: VR-based environmental enrichment was well-tolerated by the patients with significant decrease in VRSQ scores (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01) and input-error ratio (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) overtime. VR training was also effective in stabilization of MoCA scores over the course of therapy (non-significant difference in the MoCA scores before and after the therapy) and was associated with a trend (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.1) towards improvement in WEMWBS scores between the first and the last assessments. Qualitative observations by the care-givers further corroborated a noticeable improvement in mental wellbeing of patients. Conclusions: This pilot study shows that VR can be a feasible, tolerable, and potentially effective tool in long-term support of older adults with MCI and mild dementia.</p>

	<p>Background: Coffin–Lowry syndrome (CLS) is a syndromic form of X-linked intellectual disability, in which specific associated facial, hand, and skeletal abnormalities are diagnostic features. Methods: In the present study, an unreported missense genetic variant of the ribosomal S6 kinase 2 (RSK2) gene has been identified, by next-generation sequencing, in two related males with two different phenotypes of intellectual disability (ID) and peculiar facial dysmorphisms. We performed functional studies on this variant and another one, already reported in the literature, involving the same amino acid residue but, to date, without an efficient characterization. Results: Our study demonstrated that the two variants involving residue 189 significantly impaired its kinase activity. Conclusions: We detected a loss-of-function RSK2 mutation with loss in kinase activity in a three-generation family with an X-linked ID.</p>

	<p>Altered connectivity within and between the resting-state networks (RSNs) brought about by anesthetics that induce altered consciousness remains incompletely understood. It is known that the dorsal attention network (DAN) and its anticorrelations with other RSNs have been implicated in consciousness. However, the role of DAN-related functional patterns in drug-induced sedative effects is less clear. In the current study, we investigated altered functional connectivity of the DAN during midazolam-induced light sedation. In a placebo-controlled and within-subjects experimental study, fourteen healthy volunteers received midazolam or saline with a 1-week interval. Resting-state fMRI data were acquired before and after intravenous drug administration. A multiple region of interest-driven analysis was employed to investigate connectivity within and between RSNs. It was found that functional connectivity was significantly decreased by midazolam injection in two regions located in the left inferior parietal lobule and the left middle temporal area within the DAN as compared with the saline condition. We also identified three clusters in anticorrelation between the DAN and other RSNs for the interaction effect, which included the left medial prefrontal cortex, the right superior temporal gyrus, and the right superior frontal gyrus. Connectivity between all regions and DAN was significantly decreased by midazolam injection. The sensorimotor network was minimally affected. Midazolam decreased functional connectivity of the dorsal attention network. These findings advance the understanding of the neural mechanism of sedation, and such functional patterns might have clinical implications in other medical conditions related to patients with cognitive impairment.</p>

	<p>Stress seems to contribute to the neuropathology of Parkinson’s disease (PD), possibly by dysregulation of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis. Oxidative distress and mitochondrial dysfunction are key factors involved in the pathophysiology of PD and neuronal glucocorticoid-induced toxicity. Animal PD models have been generated to study the effects of hormonal stress, but no in vitro model has yet been developed. Our aim was to examine the impact of corticosterone (CORT) administration on a dopaminergic neuronal cell model of PD induced by the neurotoxin MPP+, as a new combined PD model based on the marker of endocrine response to stress, CORT, and oxidative-mitochondrial damage. We determined the impact of CORT, MPP+ and their co-incubation on reactive oxygen species production (O2−•), oxidative stress cellular markers (advanced-oxidation protein products and total antioxidant status), mitochondrial function (mitochondrial membrane potential and mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate) and neurodegeneration (Fluoro-Jade staining). Accordingly, the administration of MPP+ or CORT individually led to cell damage compared to controls (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05), as determined by several methods, whereas their co-incubation produced strong cell damage (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). The combined model described here could be appropriate for investigating neuropathological hallmarks and for evaluating potential new therapeutic tools for PD patients suffering mild to moderate emotional stress.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The hippocampus is essential for spatial learning and memory. To assess learning we used contextual fear conditioning (cFC), where animals learn to associate a place with aversive events like foot-shocks. Candidate memory mechanisms for cFC are long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD), but there is little direct evidence of them operating in the hippocampus in vivo following cFC. Also, little is known about the behavioral state changes induced by cFC. To address these issues, we recorded local field potentials in freely behaving mice by stimulating in the left dorsal CA1 region and recording in the right dorsal CA1 region. Synaptic strength in the commissural pathway was monitored by measuring field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) before and after cFC. After cFC, the commissural pathway's synaptic strength was potentiated. Although recordings occurred during the wake phase of the light/dark cycle, the mice slept more in the post-conditioning period than in the pre-conditioning period. Relative to awake periods, in non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep the fEPSPs were larger in both pre- and post-conditioning periods. We also found a significant negative correlation between the animal's speed and fEPSP size. Therefore, to avoid confounds in the fEFSP potentiation estimates, we controlled for speed-related and sleep-related fEPSP changes and still found that cFC induced long-term potentiation, but no significant long-term depression. Synaptic strength changes were not found in the control group that simply explored the fear-conditioning chamber, indicating that exploration of the novel place did not produce the measurable effects caused by cFC. These results show that following cFC, the CA1 commissural pathway is potentiated, likely contributing to the functional integration of the left and right hippocampi in fear memory consolidation. In addition, the cFC paradigm produces significant changes in an animal's behavioral state, which are observable as proximal changes in sleep patterns.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cannabidiol activates neuronal Kv7 channels</a></h4>

              
                Cannabidiol (CBD), a chemical found in the Cannabis sativa plant, is a clinically effective antiepileptic drug whose mechanism of action is unknown. Using a fluorescence-based thallium flux assay, we performed a large-scale screen and found enhancement of flux through heterologously-expressed human Kv7.2/7.3 channels by CBD. Using patch clamp recordings, we found that CBD at low concentrations activates Kv7.2/7.3 channels at subthreshold voltages, with 100 nM CBD producing a doubling of current at -50 mV. CBD shifted the voltage-dependence of channels in the hyperpolarizing direction, producing a shift in the midpoint of activation by about ~-14 mV at 300 nM. CBD also effectively enhanced native M-current in both mouse superior cervical ganglion neurons and rat hippocampal neurons. The potent enhancement of Kv2/7.3 channels by CBD seems likely to contribute to its effectiveness as an antiepileptic drug by reducing neuronal hyperexcitability.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neuron-specific coding sequences are the most highly conserved in the mammalian brain</a></h4>

              
                Neurons have become highly diverse in cell size, morphology, phenotype and function in mammalian evolution, whereas glial cells are much less varied in size and types across species. This difference in diversity suggests that neuron-specific protein-coding gene sequences have admitted more variation in evolution, that is, are less evolutionarily conserved than those expressed in glial cells. We calculated values of dN/dS from Ensembl98 for coding sequences expressed specifically in neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, microglia and endothelial cells in the brain across 92 mammalian species with reference to either mouse or human. Surprisingly, we find that protein-coding sequences that are specifically expressed in neurons are far less variable than those specific to other cell types in the brain. We next analyzed phastCons values for the same genes and found that neuron-specific promoter sequences are at least as conserved as other cell type-specific promoter sequences. Moreover, neuron-specific coding sequences are as highly conserved across mammalian species as ATPase coding sequences, the benchmark of evolutionary conservation, followed by heart and skeletal muscle-specific sequences. Neuronal diversity in mammalian evolution thus arises despite high levels of negative selection on neuron-specific protein-coding sequences. We propose that such strong evolutionary conservation is imposed by excitability, which continually exposes cells to the risk of excitotoxic death, and speculate that variability of neuronal cell sizes arises as a consequence of variability in levels of activity, possibly constrained by energy supply to the developing brain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Age-related changes in Tau and Autophagy in human brain in the absence of neurodegeneration</a></h4>

              
                Tau becomes abnormally hyper-phosphorylated and aggregated in tauopathies like Alzheimers disease (AD). As age is the greatest risk factor for developing AD, it is important to understand how tau protein itself, and the pathways implicated in its turnover, change during aging. We investigated age-related changes in total and phosphorylated tau in brain samples from two cohorts of cognitively normal individuals spanning 19-74 years, without overt neurodegeneration. One cohort utilised resected tissue and the other used post-mortem tissue. Total soluble tau levels declined with age in both cohorts. Phosphorylated tau was undetectable in the post-mortem tissue but was clearly evident in the resected tissue and did not undergo significant age-related change. To ascertain if the decline in soluble tau was correlated with age-related changes in autophagy, three markers of autophagy were tested but only two appeared to increase with age and the third was unchanged. This implies that in individuals who do not develop neurodegeneration, there is an age-related reduction in soluble tau which could potentially be due to age-related changes in autophagy. Thus, to explore how an age-related increase in autophagy might influence tau-mediated dysfunctions in vivo, autophagy was enhanced in a Drosophila model and all age-related tau phenotypes were significantly ameliorated. These data shed light on age-related physiological changes in proteins implicated in AD and highlights the need to study pathways that may be responsible for these changes. It also demonstrates the therapeutic potential of interventions that upregulate turnover of aggregate-prone proteins during aging.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Different neural codes serve long and short-term memory functions in primate Hippocampus and Lateral Prefrontal Cortex during virtual navigation</a></h4>

              
                The primate hippocampus (HPC) and lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) are two brain structures deemed essential to long- and short-term memory functions respectively. Here we hypothesize that although both structures may encode similar information about the environment, the neural codes mediating neuronal communication in HPC and LPFC have differentially evolved to serve their corresponding memory functions. We used a virtual reality task in which animals navigated through a maze using a joystick and selected one of two targets in the arms of the maze according to a learned context-color rule. We found that neurons and neuronal populations in both regions encode similar information about the different task periods. Moreover, using statistical analyses and linear classifiers, we demonstrated that many HPC neurons concentrate spikes temporally into bursts, whereas most LPFC neurons sparsely distribute spikes over time. When integrating spike rates over short intervals, HPC neuronal ensembles reached maximum decoded information with fewer neurons than LPFC ensembles. We propose that HPC principal cells have evolved intrinsic properties that enable burst firing and temporal summation of synaptic potentials that ultimately facilitates synaptic plasticity and long-term memory formation. On the other hand, LPFC pyramidal cells have intrinsic properties that allow sparsely distributing spikes over time enabling encoding of short-term memories via persistent firing without necessarily triggering rapid changes in the synapses.

	<p>Little data are available for women diagnosed with a dual diagnosis. However, dual diagnosis in women presents increased stigma, social penalties, and barriers to access to treatment than it does for men. Indeed, it increases the probability of suffering physical or sexual abuse, violent victimization, gender-based violence, unemployment, social exclusion, social-role problems, and physical and psychiatric comorbidities. Thus, a transversal sex and gender-based perspective is required to adequately study and treat dual diagnosis. For this, sex and gender factors should be included in every scientific analysis; professionals should review their own prejudices and stereotypes and train themselves specifically from a gender perspective; administrations should design and provide specific treatment resources for women; and we could all contribute to a structural social transformation that goes beyond gender mandates and norms and reduces the risk of abuse and violence inflicted on women.</p>

	<p>Targeted memory reactivation (TMR) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) can enhance memory consolidation. It is currently unknown whether TMR reinforced by simultaneous tDCS has superior efficacy. In this study, we investigated the complementary effect of TMR and bilateral tDCS on the consolidation of emotionally neutral and negative declarative memories. Participants learned neutral and negative word pairs. Each word pair was presented with an emotionally compatible sound. Following learning, participants spent a 20 min retention interval awake under four possible conditions: (1) TMR alone (i.e., replay of 50% of the associated sounds), (2) TMR combined with anodal stimulation of the left DLPFC, (3) TMR combined with anodal stimulation of the right DLPFC and (4) TMR with sham tDCS. Results evidenced selective memory enhancement for the replayed stimuli in the TMR-only and TMR-sham conditions, which confirms a specific effect of TMR on memory. However, memory was enhanced at higher levels for all learned items (irrespective of TMR) in the TMR-anodal right and TMR-anodal left tDCS conditions, suggesting that the beneficial effects of tDCS overshadow the specific effects of TMR. Emotionally negative memories were not modulated by tDCS hemispheric polarity. We conclude that electrical stimulation of the DLPFC during the post-learning period globally benefits memory consolidation but does not potentiate the specific benefits of TMR.</p>

	<p>The distribution of single Stop Signal Reaction Times (SSRT) in the stop signal task (SST) has been modelled with two general methods: a nonparametric method by Hans Colonius (1990) and a Bayesian parametric method by Dora Matzke, Gordon Logan and colleagues (2013). These methods assume an equal impact of the preceding trial type (go/stop) in the SST trials on the SSRT distributional estimation without addressing the relaxed assumption. This study presents the required model by considering a two-state mixture model for the SSRT distribution. It then compares the Bayesian parametric single SSRT and mixture SSRT distributions in the usual stochastic order at the individual and the population level under ex-Gaussian (ExG) distributional format. It shows that compared to a single SSRT distribution, the mixture SSRT distribution is more varied, more positively skewed, more leptokurtic and larger in stochastic order. The size of the results’ disparities also depends on the choice of weights in the mixture SSRT distribution.

                Metabolism should drive demography by determining the rates of both biological work and resource demand. Long-standing “rules” for how metabolism should covary with demography permeate biology, from predicting the impacts of climate change to managing fisheries. Evidence for these rules is almost exclusively indirect and in the form of among-species...

The unique subsynaptic distribution of glutamate receptors, which cluster in nanoalignment with presynaptic sites of glutamate release, supports this hypothesis. However, testing it has been difficult because mechanisms controlling subsynaptic organization remain unknown. Reasoning that transcellular interactions could position AMPA receptors (AMPARs), we targeted a key transsynaptic adhesion molecule implicated in controlling AMPAR number, LRRTM2, using engineered, rapid proteolysis. Severing the LRRTM2 extracellular domain led quickly to nanoscale declustering of AMPARs away from release sites, not prompting their escape from synapses until much later. This rapid remodeling of AMPAR position produced significant deficits in evoked, but not spontaneous, postsynaptic receptor activation. These results dissociate receptor numbers from their nanopositioning in determination of synaptic function and support the novel concept that adhesion molecules acutely position receptors to dynamically control synaptic strength.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Self-contained soft electrofluidic actuators</a></h4>

              
                <p>Soft robotics revolutionized human-robot interactions, yet there exist persistent challenges for developing high-performance soft actuators that are powerful, rapid, controllable, safe, and portable. Here, we introduce a class of self-contained soft electrofluidic actuators (SEFAs), which can directly convert electrical energy into the mechanical energy of the actuators through electrically responsive fluids that drive the outside elastomer deformation. The use of special dielectric liquid enhances fluid flow capabilities, improving the actuation performance of the SEFAs. SEFAs are easily manufactured by using widely available materials and common fabrication techniques, and display excellent comprehensive performances in portability, controllability, rapid response, versatility, safety, and actuation. An artificial muscle stretching a joint and a soft bionic ray swimming in a tank demonstrate their effective performance. Hence, SEFAs offer a platform for developing soft actuators with potential applications in wearable assistant devices and soft robots.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Neuronal control of maternal provisioning in response to social cues</a></h4>

              
                <p>Mothers contribute cytoplasmic components to their progeny in a process called maternal provisioning. Provisioning is influenced by the parental environment, but the molecular pathways that transmit environmental cues between generations are not well understood. Here, we show that, in <I>Caenorhabditis elegans</I>, social cues modulate maternal provisioning to regulate gene silencing in offspring. Intergenerational signal transmission depends on a pheromone-sensing neuron and neuronal FMRFamide (Phe-Met-Arg-Phe)&ndash;like peptides. Parental FMRFamide-like peptide signaling dampens oxidative stress resistance and promotes the deposition of mRNAs for translational components in progeny, which, in turn, reduces gene silencing. This study identifies a previously unknown pathway for intergenerational communication that links neuronal responses to maternal provisioning. We suggest that loss of social cues in the parental environment represents an adverse environment that stimulates stress responses across generations.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">The climate and health benefits from intensive building energy efficiency improvements</a></h4>

              
                <p>Intensive building energy efficiency improvements can reduce emissions from energy use, improving outdoor air quality and human health, but may also affect ventilation and indoor air quality. This study examines the effects of highly ambitious, yet feasible, building energy efficiency upgrades in the United States. Our energy efficiency scenarios, derived from the literature, lead to a 6 to 11% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions and 18 to 25% reductions in particulate matter (PM<SUB>2.5</SUB>) emissions in 2050. These reductions are complementary with a carbon pricing policy on electricity. However, our results also point to the importance of mitigating indoor PM<SUB>2.5</SUB> emissions, improving PM<SUB>2.5</SUB> filtration, and evaluating ventilation-related policies. Even with no further ventilation improvements, we estimate that intensive energy efficiency scenarios could prevent 1800 to 3600 premature deaths per year across the United States in 2050. With further investments in indoor air quality, this can rise to 2900 to 5100.</p>

                <p>A three-dimensional microengineered human coronary artery&ndash;on&ndash;a&ndash;chip was developed for investigation of the mechanism by which low and oscillatory shear stress (OSS) induces pro-atherogenic changes. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that OSS induced distinct changes in endothelial cells (ECs) including pro-inflammatory endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT). OSS promoted pro-inflammatory EndMT through the Notch1/p38 MAPK&ndash;NF-B signaling axis. Moreover, OSS-induced EC phenotypic changes resulted in proliferation and extracellular matrix (ECM) protein up-regulation in smooth muscle cells (SMCs) through the RANTES-mediated paracrine mechanism. IL-37 suppressed OSS-induced pro-inflammatory EndMT and thereby abrogated SMC proliferation and ECM protein remodeling. Overall, this study provides insights into endothelial heterogeneity under atheroprone shear stress and identifies the mechanistic role of a novel EC subtype in promoting adverse vascular remodeling. Further, this study demonstrates that anti-inflammatory approach is capable of mitigating vascular pathobiology evoked by atheroprone shear stress.</p>

                <p>Transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD)/graphene (Gr) heterostructures constitute a key component for two-dimensional devices. The operation of TMD/Gr devices relies on interfacial charge/energy transfer processes, which remains unclear and challenging to unravel. Fortunately, the coupled spin and valley index in TMDs adds a new degree of freedom to the charges and, thus, another dimension to spectroscopy. Here, by helicity-resolved ultrafast spectroscopy, we find that photoexcitation in TMDs transfers to graphene by asynchronous charge transfer, with one type of charge transferring in the order of femtoseconds and the other in picoseconds. The rate correlates well with energy offset between TMD and graphene, regardless of compositions and charge species. Spin-polarized hole injection or long-lived polarized hole can be achieved with deliberately designed heterostructures. This study shows helicity-resolved ultrafast spectroscopy as a powerful and facile approach to reveal the fundamental and complex charge/spin dynamics in TMD-based heterostructures, paving the way toward valleytronic and optoelectronic applications.</p>

                <p>Although single-source white emissive perovskite has emerged as a class of encouraging light-emitting material, the synthesis of lead-free halide perovskite materials with high luminous efficiency is still challenging. Here, we report a series of zero-dimensional indium-antimony (In/Sb) alloyed halide single crystals, BAPPIn<SUB>2&ndash;2<I>x</I></SUB>Sb<SUB>2<I>x</I></SUB>Cl<SUB>10</SUB> (BAPP = C<SUB>10</SUB>H<SUB>28</SUB>N<SUB>4</SUB>, <I>x</I> = 0 to 1), with tunable emission. In BAPPIn<SUB>1.996</SUB>Sb<SUB>0.004</SUB>Cl<SUB>10</SUB>, bright yellow emission with near 100% photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) is yielded when it was excited at 320 nm, which turns into bright white-light emission with a PLQY of 44.0% when excited at 365 nm.

                <p>Tuberculosis-causing mycobacteria have thick cell-wall and capsule layers that are formed from complex structures. Protein secretion across these barriers depends on a specialized protein secretion system, but none has been reported. We show that <I>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</I> Rv3705c and its homologous MSMEG_6251 in <I>Mycobacterium smegmatis</I> are tube-forming proteins in the mycobacterial envelope (TiME). Crystallographic and cryo-EM structures of these two proteins show that both proteins form rotationally symmetric rings. Two layers of TiME rings pack together in a tail-to-tail manner into a ring-shaped complex, which, in turn, stacks together to form tubes. <I>M. smegmatis</I> TiME was detected mainly in the cell wall and capsule. Knocking out the TiME gene markedly decreased the amount of secreted protein in the <I>M. smegmatis</I> culture medium, and expression of this gene in knocked-out strain partially restored the level of secreted protein. Our structure and functional data thus suggest that TiME forms a protein transport tube across the mycobacterial outer envelope.</p>

                <p>Reef-building corals thriving in extreme thermal environments may provide genetic variation that can assist the evolution of populations to rapid climate warming. However, the feasibility and scale of genetic improvements remain untested despite ongoing population declines from recurrent thermal stress events. Here, we show that corals from the hottest reefs in the world transfer sufficient heat tolerance to a nai&#x0308;ve population sufficient to withstand end-of-century warming projections. Heat survival increased up to 84% when nai&#x0308;ve mothers were selectively bred with fathers from the hottest reefs because of strong heritable genetic effects. We identified genomic loci associated with tolerance variation that were enriched for heat shock proteins, oxidative stress, and immune functions. Unexpectedly, several coral families exhibited survival rates and genomic associations deviating from origin predictions, including a few nai&#x0308;ve purebreds with exceptionally high heat tolerance. Our findings highlight previously uncharacterized enhanced and intrinsic potential of coral populations to adapt to climate warming.</p>

                <p>Ecosystems provide multiple services to humans. However, agricultural systems are usually evaluated on their productivity and economic performance, and a systematic and quantitative assessment of the multifunctionality of agroecosystems including environmental services is missing. Using a long-term farming system experiment, we evaluated and compared the agronomic, economic, and ecological performance of the most widespread arable cropping systems in Europe: organic, conservation, and conventional agriculture. We analyzed 43 agroecosystem properties and determined overall agroecosystem multifunctionality. We show that organic and conservation agriculture promoted ecosystem multifunctionality, especially by enhancing regulating and supporting services, including biodiversity preservation, soil and water quality, and climate mitigation. In contrast, conventional cropping showed reduced multifunctionality but delivered highest yield. Organic production resulted in higher economic performance, thanks to higher product prices and additional support payments. Our results demonstrate that different cropping systems provide opposing services, enforcing the productivity&ndash;environmental protection dilemma for agroecosystem functioning.</p>

Combined with solution studies, the results reveal the importance of protein dynamics in regulating intermediate conformations during conversion of ACV to IPN. The results have implications for catalysis by multiple IPNS-related oxygenases, including those involved in the human hypoxic response, and highlight the power of serial femtosecond crystallography to provide insight into long-range enzyme dynamics during reactions presently impossible for nonprotein catalysts.</p>

                <p>Genome-wide loss-of-function screens have revealed genes essential for cancer cell proliferation, called cancer dependencies. It remains challenging to link cancer dependencies to the molecular compositions of cancer cells or to unscreened cell lines and further to tumors. Here, we present DeepDEP, a deep learning model that predicts cancer dependencies using integrative genomic profiles. It uses a unique unsupervised pretraining that captures unlabeled tumor genomic representations to improve the learning of cancer dependencies. We demonstrated DeepDEP&rsquo;s improvement over conventional machine learning methods and validated the performance with three independent datasets. By systematic model interpretations, we extended the current dependency maps with functional characterizations of dependencies and a proof-of-concept in silico assay of synthetic essentiality. We applied DeepDEP to pan-cancer tumor genomics and built the first pan-cancer synthetic dependency map of 8000 tumors with clinical relevance. In summary, DeepDEP is a novel tool for investigating cancer dependency with rapidly growing genomic resources.</p>

                <p>Integral membrane proteins are localized and/or regulated by lipids present in the surrounding bilayer. While bacteria have relatively simple membranes, there is ample evidence that many bacterial proteins bind to specific lipids, especially the anionic lipid cardiolipin. Here, we apply molecular dynamics simulations to assess lipid binding to 42 different <I>Escherichia coli</I> inner membrane proteins. Our data reveal an asymmetry between the membrane leaflets, with increased anionic lipid binding to the inner leaflet regions of the proteins, particularly for cardiolipin. From our simulations, we identify &gt;700 independent cardiolipin binding sites, allowing us to identify the molecular basis of a prototypical cardiolipin binding site, which we validate against structures of bacterial proteins bound to cardiolipin. This allows us to construct a set of metrics for defining a high-affinity cardiolipin binding site on bacterial membrane proteins, paving the way for a heuristic approach to defining other protein-lipid interactions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">A dual-phase alloy with ultrahigh strength-ductility synergy over a wide temperature range</a></h4>

              
                <p>High-entropy alloys (HEAs), as an emerging class of materials, have pointed a pathway in developing alloys with interesting property combinations. Although they are not exempted from the strength-ductility trade-off, they present a standing chance in overcoming this challenge. Here, we report results for a precipitation-strengthening strategy, by tuning composition to design a CoNiV-based face-centered cubic/B2 duplex HEA. This alloy sustains ultrahigh gigapascal-level tensile yield strengths and excellent ductility from cryogenic to elevated temperatures. The highest specific yield strength (~150.2 MPa&middot;cm<sup>3</sup>/g) among reported ductile HEAs is obtained. The ability of the alloy presented here to sustain this excellent strength-ductility synergy over a wide temperature range is aided by multiple deformation mechanisms i.e., twins, stacking faults, dynamic strain aging, and dynamic recrystallization. Our results open the avenue for designing precipitation-strengthened lightweight HEAs with advanced strength-ductility combinations over a wide service temperature range.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Gene therapy with AR isoform 2 rescues spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy phenotype by modulating AR transcriptional activity</a></h4>

              
                <p>Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is an X-linked, adult-onset neuromuscular condition caused by an abnormal polyglutamine (polyQ) tract expansion in androgen receptor (AR) protein. SBMA is a disease with high unmet clinical need. Recent studies have shown that mutant AR-altered transcriptional activity is key to disease pathogenesis. Restoring the transcriptional dysregulation without affecting other AR critical functions holds great promise for the treatment of SBMA and other AR-related conditions; however, how this targeted approach can be achieved and translated into a clinical application remains to be understood. Here, we characterized the role of AR isoform 2, a naturally occurring variant encoding a truncated AR lacking the polyQ-harboring domain, as a regulatory switch of AR genomic functions in androgen-responsive tissues. Delivery of this isoform using a recombinant adeno-associated virus vector type 9 resulted in amelioration of the disease phenotype in SBMA mice by restoring polyQ AR&ndash;dysregulated transcriptional activity.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">First two years of reimbursed enzyme replacement therapy in the treatment of Fabry disease in Poland [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Fabry disease (FD) is an ultra-rare genetic lysosomal storage disease caused by pathologic gene variants resulting in insufficient expression of α-galactosidase A. This enzyme deficiency leads to accumulation of globotriaosylceramide and globotriaosylsphingosine in plasma and in different cells throughout the body, causing major cardiovascular, renal, and nervous system complications. Until 2018, reimbursed enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) for FD was available in all European Union countries except Poland.             We present the preliminary results of the first two years of reimbursed ERT in Poland. We obtained data from the seven largest academic centers in Katowice, Kraków, Wrocław, Poznań, Gdańsk, Warszawa, and Łódź. The questionnaire included the following data: number of patients treated, number of patients qualified for ERT, and patient characteristics.             All centers returned completed questionnaires that included data for a total of 71 patients (28 men and 43 women) as of June 2021. Thirty-five patients with the diagnosis of FD confirmed by genetic testing (22 men and 13 women) had already qualified for reimbursed ERT. Mean (SD) age at the commencement of the ERT program was 39.6 (15.5) years (range 18-79 years). Mean time from the first clinical symptoms reported by the patients to the FD diagnosis was 21.1 (8.9) years, and the mean time from the final diagnosis of FD to the beginning of ERT was 4.7 (4.6) years.             FD is still underdiagnosed in Poland. To identify undiagnosed FD patients and to ensure that patients in Poland benefit fully from ERT, implementation of an effective nationwide screening strategy and close cooperation with a network of rare disease centers is advised.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Modifications to the delivery of NHS face-to-face general practice consultations during the COVID-19 pandemic in England [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: To minimise transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID-19, delivery of English general practice consultations was modified in March 2020 to enable separation of diagnosed or suspected COVID-19 patients from others. Remote triage and consultations became the default, with adapted face-to-face contact used only when clinically necessary. This study aimed to identify the modified face-to-face delivery models used nationwide in spring/summer 2020. Information was also sought concerning COVID-19 outbreaks linked to English general practice. Methods: In June 2020, a survey was sent by email to the 135 Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) in England to identify local organisation of face-to-face general practice consultations since March 2020. An email was  sent to Public Health England (PHE) requesting data on COVID-19 outbreaks linked to general practice. Results: All CCGs responded. Between March and July 2020, separation of COVID-19 patients from others was achieved using combinations of the following models: zoned surgeries (reported by 47% of CCGs), where COVID-19 and other patients were separated within their own practice; ‘hot’ or ‘cold’ hubs (reported by 90% of CCGs), separate sites where COVID-19 or other patients registered at one of several collaborating practices were seen; ‘hot’ and ‘cold’ home visits (reported by 70% of CCGs). One of seven combinations of these models was used across each CCG, with some flexibility shown according to changing demand through hub availability. PHE data indicated 25 possible or confirmed COVID-19 outbreaks or clusters in English general practice to July 31st 2020. Conclusions: Varied, flexible ways of delivering face-to-face general practice consultations were identified.  Analysis of the modified delivery in terms of management of COVID-19 and other conditions, and impacts on staff and patients, together with learning from investigations into confirmed COVID-19 outbreaks, may both aid future pandemic management and identify beneficial elements for practice beyond this.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">The interplay between vaccination and social distancing strategies affects COVID19 population-level outcomes</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Sharon Guerstein, Victoria Romeo-Aznar, Ma’ayan Dekel, Oren Miron, Nadav Davidovitch, Rami Puzis, Shai Pilosof</p>

Social distancing is an effective population-level mitigation strategy to prevent COVID19 propagation but it does not reduce the number of susceptible individuals and bears severe social consequences—a dire situation that can be overcome with the recently developed vaccines. Although a combination of these interventions should provide greater benefits than their isolated deployment, a mechanistic understanding of the interplay between them is missing. To tackle this challenge we developed an age-structured deterministic model in which vaccines are deployed during the pandemic to individuals who do not show symptoms. The model allows for flexible and dynamic prioritization strategies with shifts between target groups. We find a strong interaction between social distancing and vaccination in their effect on the proportion of hospitalizations. In particular, prioritizing vaccines to elderly (60+) before adults (20-59) is more effective when social distancing is applied to adults or uniformly. In addition, the temporal reproductive number <i>R</i><sub>t</sub> is only affected by vaccines when deployed at sufficiently high rates and in tandem with social distancing. Finally, the same reduction in hospitalization can be achieved via different combination of strategies, giving decision makers flexibility in choosing public health policies. Our study provides insights into the factors that affect vaccination success and provides methodology to test different intervention strategies in a way that will align with ethical guidelines.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Estimating the conditional probability of developing human papilloma virus related oropharyngeal cancer by combining machine learning and inverse Bayesian modelling</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Prerna Tewari, Eugene Kashdan, Cathal Walsh, Cara M. Martin, Andrew C. Parnell, John J. O’Leary</p>

The epidemic increase in the incidence of Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) related Oropharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinomas (OPSCCs) in several countries worldwide represents a significant public health concern. Although gender neutral HPV vaccination programmes are expected to cause a reduction in the incidence rates of OPSCCs, these effects will not be evident in the foreseeable future. Secondary prevention strategies are currently not feasible due to an incomplete understanding of the natural history of oral HPV infections in OPSCCs. The key parameters that govern natural history models remain largely ill-defined for HPV related OPSCCs and cannot be easily inferred from experimental data. Mathematical models have been used to estimate some of these ill-defined parameters in cervical cancer, another HPV related cancer leading to successful implementation of cancer prevention strategies. We outline a “double-Bayesian” mathematical modelling approach, whereby, a Bayesian machine learning model first estimates the probability of an individual having an oral HPV infection, given OPSCC and other covariate information. The model is then inverted using Bayes’ theorem to reverse the probability relationship. We use data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) cancer registry, SEER Head and Neck with HPV Database and the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES), representing the adult population in the United States to derive our model. The model contains 8,106 OPSCC patients of which 73.0% had an oral HPV infection. When stratified by age, sex, marital status and race/ethnicity, the model estimated a higher conditional probability for developing OPSCCs given an oral HPV infection in non-Hispanic White males and females compared to other races/ethnicities. The proposed Bayesian model represents a proof-of-concept of a natural history model of HPV driven OPSCCs and outlines a strategy for estimating the conditional probability of an individual’s risk of developing OPSCC following an oral HPV infection.

                Background: The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the education sector around the world. In order to control the spread of the virus, eLearning practice has been introduced in Saudi higher education. Such online communication has become an important tool to narrow the teaching practice gap. This study assessed the characteristics of eLearning and distance learning and the inclination of Imam Abdulrahman BinFaisal University (IAU) faculty members in terms of skills, and managing classes and tests using online learning tools. Methods: A QuestionPro questionnaire with 22 questions on eLearning experience, training experience, and skills and knowledge in the educational process of IAU teaching faculty was conducted through the online university e-mail domain. The questionnaire was sent to the IAU’s teaching faculty. The questionnaire’s reliability was studied using Cronbach’s a coefficient. The criterion value was statistically studied using the KMO (Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin) and Bartlett’s test. The variables associated with the present survey model were analysed using Structural Equation Modelling (SEM). Results: The study showed positive responses and readiness (skills and abilities) and the effectiveness of IAU’s faculty members to perform e-learning activities during COVID-19. IAU faculty received a strong positive response, and the respondents were also impressed with and agreed on trainer knowledge, session management, communication and expertise on training topics. Conclusions: The positive response indicates the readiness of IAU to provide the necessary support (tools, information and updates) required for a successful online educational process.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A signaling pathway-driven bioinformatics pipeline for predicting therapeutics against emerging infectious diseases [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), is a novel Betacoronavirus that was first reported in Wuhan, China in December of 2019. The virus has since caused a worldwide pandemic that highlights the need to quickly identify potential prophylactic or therapeutic treatments that can reduce the signs, symptoms, and/or spread of disease when dealing with a novel infectious agent. To combat this problem, we constructed a computational pipeline that uniquely combines existing tools to predict drugs and biologics that could be repurposed to combat an emerging pathogen. Methods: Our workflow analyzes RNA-sequencing data to determine differentially expressed genes, enriched Gene Ontology (GO) terms, and dysregulated pathways in infected cells, which can then be used to identify US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs that target human proteins within these pathways. We used this pipeline to perform a meta-analysis of RNA-seq data from cells infected with three Betacoronavirus species including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV; SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV; MERS), and SARS-CoV-2, as well as respiratory syncytial virus and influenza A virus to identify therapeutics that could be used to treat COVID-19.  Results: This analysis identified twelve existing drugs, most of which already have FDA-approval, that are predicted to counter the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection. These results were cross-referenced with interventional clinical trials and other studies in the literature to identify drugs on our list that had previously been identified or used as treatments for COIVD-19 including canakinumab, anakinra, tocilizumab, sarilumab, and baricitinib. Conclusions: While the results reported here are specific to Betacoronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, our bioinformatics pipeline can be used to quickly identify candidate therapeutics for future emerging infectious diseases.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">­­­Discovering research trends of urban geology based on a bibliometric analysis [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Urbanization contributes to the emerging urban areas across the world. The importance of geology to ensure sustainability, has led to many research publications in the urban geology. This paper aims to discover the research trends through a bibliometric analysis of articles indexed within the Scopus database from 1950 to 2018 on topics related to geology and urban. The analysis found a significant increase in publications during 1999-2016, especially after the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami disaster. The next finding of this study is related to research interest clusters: engineering geological hazard investigation and risk assessment in the urban area (EGR); social geology and urban sustainability (SGS); and urban hydrology and water management (HGW). The EGR studies were mostly in underground engineering geology (geotechnics). In contrast, the least attention was given to the interaction between geology and land-use planning, due to the SGS issues (e.g., urban planning and land use suitability assessment). This study may serve as a platform for scholars to understand the current status and future directions of urban geology.

     alt="A sex-specific feedback projection from aromatase-expressing neurons in the medial amygdala to the accessory olfactory bulb"/>
<p>Aromatase neurons are distributed in clustered populations primarily in a network of brain regions (red) devoted to social behavior. Out of all potential sources of aromatase neurons, only the ventral medial amygdala projects back to the accessory olfactory bulb. The population of aromatase-expressing neurons in the ventral medial amygdala also expresses Erα and displays two sex differences: 1) aromatase-expressing neurons are larger in females; 2) there are more aromatase-expressing neurons in male mice.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The accessory olfactory bulb (AOB) plays a critical role in classifying pheromonal signals. Here we identify two previously undescribed sources of aromatase signaling in the AOB: 1) A population of aromatase-expressing neurons in the AOB itself; 2) A tract of aromatase-expressing axons which originate in the ventral medial amygdala (MEA) and terminate in the AOB. Using a retrograde tracer in conjunction with a transgenic strategy to label aromatase-expressing neurons throughout the brain, we found that a single contiguous population of neurons in the ventral MEA provides the only significant feedback by aromatase-expressing neurons to the AOB. This population expresses the estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) and displayed anatomical sex-differences in the number of neurons (higher in male mice) and the size of cell bodies (larger in females). Given the previously established relationship between aromatase-expression, estrogen signaling, and the function of sexually dimorphic circuits, we suggest that this feed-back population is well-positioned to provide neuroendocrine feedback to modulate sensory processing of social stimuli in the AOB.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Mutations in genes encoding Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase α1, α2, and α3 subunits cause a wide range of disabling neurological disorders, and dysfunction of Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase may contribute to neuronal injury in stroke and dementia. To better understand the pathogenesis of these diseases, it is important to determine the expression patterns of the different Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase subunits within the brain and among specific cell types. Using two available scRNA-Seq databases from the adult mouse nervous system, we examined the mRNA expression patterns of the different isoforms of the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase α, β and <i>Fxyd</i> subunits at the single cell level among brain regions and various neuronal populations. We subsequently identified specific types of neurons enriched with transcripts for α1 and α3 isoforms and elaborated how α3-expressing neuronal populations govern cerebellar neuronal circuits. We further analyzed the co-expression network for α1 and α3 isoforms, highlighting the genes that positively correlated with α1 and α3 expression. The top ten genes for α1 were <i>Chn2</i>, <i>Hpcal1</i>, <i>Nrgn</i>, <i>Neurod1</i>, <i>Selm, Kcnc1</i>, <i>Snrk, Snap25, Ckb and Ccndbp1</i> and for α3 were <i>Sorcs3</i>, <i>Eml5</i>, <i>Neurod2</i>, <i>Ckb</i>, <i>Tbc1d4, Ptprz1, Pvrl1, Kirrel3, Pvalb, and Asic2</i>.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">TRAIT2D: a Software for Quantitative Analysis of Single Particle Diffusion Data [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Single particle tracking (SPT) is one of the most widely used tools in optical microscopy to evaluate particle mobility in a variety of situations, including cellular and model membrane dynamics. Recent technological developments, such as Interferometric Scattering microscopy, have allowed recording of long, uninterrupted single particle trajectories at kilohertz framerates. The resulting data, where particles are continuously detected and do not displace much between observations, thereby do not require complex linking algorithms. Moreover, while these measurements offer more details into the short-term diffusion behaviour of the tracked particles, they are also subject to the influence of localisation uncertainties, which are often underestimated by conventional analysis pipelines. we thus developed a Python library, under the name of TRAIT2D (Tracking Analysis Toolbox – 2D version), in order to track particle diffusion at high sampling rates, and analyse the resulting trajectories with an innovative approach. The data analysis pipeline introduced is more localisation-uncertainty aware, and also selects the most appropriate diffusion model for the data provided on a statistical basis. A trajectory simulation platform also allows the user to handily generate trajectories and even synthetic time-lapses to test alternative tracking algorithms and data analysis approaches. A high degree of customisation for the analysis pipeline, for example with the introduction of different diffusion modes, is possible from the source code. Finally, the presence of graphical user interfaces lowers the access barrier for users with little to no programming experience.

                Background: Intensified efforts to improve tuberculosis (TB) diagnosis, treatment, and prevention are needed to meet global EndTB targets. Community health workers’ (CHWs) knowledge with respect to case finding is vital in tuberculosis elimination. This study aimed to determine the effect of tuberculosis training on the knowledge of community health workers in Nigeria. Methods: As part of a larger multicomponent intervention study, a randomised control trial was conducted with CHWs in 18 primary health care (PHC) clusters in Nigeria. The clusters were allocated to three arms: training and cash incentive (A), training only (B), and control (C) arms. Arms (A) and (B) received training on tuberculosis symptoms, prevention, diagnosis and treatment while the control arm (C) did not receive training. Participants’ knowledge on tuberculosis was assessed using questionnaires administered pre- and post-intervention. Data was analyzed using GraphPad Prism. Descriptive data was presented in tables and bivariate data was analyzed using chi square. Statistical significance was set as P<0.05. Results: There was a significant increase in the total knowledge score (25.4%), knowledge of general symptoms (24.4%), prevention (22.6%) and diagnosis and treatment (30.0%) across all study arms post-intervention (p<0.0001). Compared with the control arm, the training arm (A) had a higher proportion of good total knowledge score (94.4%) and arm (B) had a lower proportion of good total knowledge score (83.1%) when compared to the control group (93.1%). These were, however, not statistically significant. Conclusions: An improvement in the CHWs’ knowledge of symptoms, prevention, diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis was observed after a training intervention was done. Integration of routine tuberculosis training is recommended to improve tuberculosis case finding in high burden communities.

                Performance monitoring is a key cognitive function, allowing to detect mistakes and adapt future behavior. Post-decisional neural signals have been identified that are sensitive to decision accuracy, decision confidence and subsequent adaptation. Here, we review recent work that supports an understanding of late error/confidence signals in terms of the computational process of post-decisional evidence accumulation. We argue that the error positivity, a positive-going centro-parietal potential measured through scalp electrophysiology, reflects the post-decisional evidence accumulation process itself, which follows a boundary crossing event corresponding to initial decision commitment. This proposal provides a powerful explanation for both the morphological characteristics of the signal and its relation to various expressions of performance monitoring. Moreover, it suggests that the error positivity –a signal with thus far unique properties in cognitive neuroscience – can be leveraged to furnish key new insights into the inputs to, adaptation, and consequences of the post-decisional accumulation process.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">N501Y mutation of spike protein in SARS-CoV-2 strengthens its binding to receptor ACE2</a></h4>

              
                SARS-CoV-2 is spreading around the world for the past year. Recently, several variants such as B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.351 (Beta), and P.1 (Gamma), sharing a key mutation N501Y on the RBD, appear to be more infectious to humans. To understand the underlying mechanism, we performed cell surface binding assay, kinetics study, single-molecule technique, and computational method to investigate the interaction between these RBD (mutations) and ACE2. Remarkably, RBD with the N501Y mutation exhibited a considerably stronger interaction, with a faster association rate and slower dissociation rate. Consistently, atomic force microscopy-based single-molecule force microscopy quantifies their strength showing a higher binding probability and unbinding force for the mutation. Molecular dynamics simulations of RBD-ACE2 complexes indicated that the N501Y introduced additional π-π and π-cation interaction for the higher force/interaction. Taken together, we suggested that the reinforced interaction from N501Y mutation in RBD should play an essential role in the higher transmission of SARS-CoV-2 variants and future mutations in the RBD of the virus should be under surveillance.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">An engineered transcriptional reporter of protein localization identifies regulators of mitochondrial and ER membrane protein trafficking in high-throughput CRISPRi screens</a></h4>

              
                The trafficking of specific protein cohorts to correct subcellular locations at correct times is essential for every signaling and regulatory process in biology. Gene perturbation screens could provide a powerful approach to probe the molecular mechanisms of protein trafficking, but only if protein localization or mislocalization can be tied to a simple and robust phenotype for cell selection, such as cell proliferation or fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). To empower the study of protein trafficking processes with gene perturbation, we developed a genetically-encoded molecular tool named HiLITR. HiLITR converts protein colocalization into proteolytic release of a membrane-anchored transcription factor, which drives the expression of a chosen reporter gene. Using HiLITR in combination with FACS-based CRISPRi screening in human cell lines, we identified genes that influence the trafficking of mitochondrial and ER tail-anchored proteins. We show that loss of the SUMO E1 component SAE1 results in mislocalization and destabilization of many mitochondrial tail-anchored proteins. We also demonstrate a distinct regulatory role for EMC10 in the ER membrane complex, opposing the transmembrane-domain insertion activity of the complex. Through transcriptional integration of complex cellular functions, HiLITR expands the scope of biological processes that can be studied by genetic perturbation screening technologies.

                Using a self-generated hypoxic assay, we show that the amoeba <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> displays a remarkable collective aerotactic behavior. When a cell colony is covered, cells quickly consume the available oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) and form a dense ring moving outwards at constant speed and density. To decipher this collective process, we combined two technological developments: porphyrin-based O<sub>2</sub> -sensing films and microfluidic O<sub>2</sub> gradient generators. We showed that <i>Dictyostelium</i> cells exhibit aerotactic and aerokinetic response in a low range of O<sub>2</sub> concentration indicative of a very efficient detection mechanism. Cell behaviors under self-generated or imposed O<sub>2</sub> gradients were modeled using an in silico cellular Potts model built on experimental observations. This computational model was complemented with a parsimonious ‘Go or Grow’ partial differential equation (PDE) model. In both models, we found that the collective migration of a dense ring can be explained by the interplay between cell division and the modulation of aerotaxis.

                Identifying the key vector and host species that drive the transmission of zoonotic pathogens is notoriously difficult but critical for disease control. We present a nested approach for quantifying the importance of host and vectors that integrates species' physiological competence with their ecological traits. We apply this framework to a medically important arbovirus, Ross River virus (RRV), in Brisbane, Australia. We find that vertebrate hosts with high physiological competence are not the most important for community transmission; interactions between hosts and vectors largely underpin the importance of host species. For vectors, physiological competence is highly important. Our results identify primary and secondary vectors of RRV and suggest two potential transmission cycles in Brisbane: an enzootic cycle involving birds and an urban cycle involving humans. The framework accounts for uncertainty from each fitted statistical model in estimates of species' contributions to transmission and has has direct application to other zoonotic pathogens.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Probing the effect of clustering on EphA2 receptor signaling efficiency by subcellular control of ligand-receptor mobility</a></h4>

              
                Clustering of ligand:receptor complexes on the cell membrane is widely presumed to have functional consequences for subsequent signal transduction. However, it is experimentally challenging to selectively manipulate receptor clustering without altering other biochemical aspects of the cellular system. Here, we develop a microfabrication strategy to produce substrates displaying mobile and immobile ligands that are separated by roughly one micron, and thus experience an identical cytoplasmic signaling state, enabling precision comparison of downstream signaling reactions. Applying this approach to characterize the ephrinA1:EphA2 signaling system reveals that EphA2 clustering enhances both receptor phosphorylation and downstream signaling activity. Single molecule imaging clearly resolves increased molecular binding dwell times at EphA2 clusters for both Grb2:SOS and NCK:N-WASP signaling modules. This type of intracellular comparison enables a substantially higher degree of quantitative analysis than is possible when comparisons must be made between different cells and essentially eliminates the effects of cellular response to ligand manipulation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">FKBPL and FKBP8 regulate DLK degradation and neuronal responses to axon injury</a></h4>

              
                DLK is a key regulator of axon regeneration and degeneration in response to neuronal injury. To understand the molecular mechanisms controlling the DLK function, we performed yeast two-hybrid screening analysis and identified FKBPL as a DLK-binding protein that bound to the kinase domain and inhibited the kinase enzymatic activity of DLK. FKBPL regulated DLK stability through ubiquitin-dependent DLK degradation. We tested other members in the FKBP protein family and found that FKBP8 also induced DLK degradation as FKBPL did. We found that Lysine 271 residue in the kinase domain of DLK was a major site of ubiquitination and SUMO3-conjugation and responsible for FKBP8-mediated degradation. In vivo overexpression of FKBP8 delayed progression of axon degeneration and neuronal death following axotomy in sciatic and optic nerves, respectively, although axon regeneration efficiency was not enhanced. This research identified FKBPL and FKBP8 as new DLK-interacting proteins that regulated DLK stability by MG-132 or bafilomycin A1-sensitive protein degradation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Voltage imaging identifies spinal circuits that modulate locomotor adaptation in zebrafish</a></h4>

              
                Motor systems must continuously adapt their output to maintain a desired trajectory. While the spinal circuits underlying rhythmic locomotion are well described, little is known about how the network modulates its output strength. A major challenge has been the difficulty of recording from spinal neurons during behavior. Here, we use voltage imaging to map the membrane potential of glutamatergic neurons throughout the spinal cord of the larval zebrafish during fictive swimming in a virtual environment. We mapped the spiking, subthreshold dynamics, relative timing, and sub-cellular electrical propagation across large populations of simultaneously recorded cells. We validated the approach by confirming properties of known sub-types, and we characterized a yet undescribed sub-population of tonic-spiking ventral V3 neurons whose spike rate correlated with swimming strength and bout length. Optogenetic activation of V3 neurons led to stronger swimming and longer bouts but did not affect tail-beat frequency. Genetic ablation of V3 neurons led to reduced locomotor adaptation. The power of voltage imaging allowed us to identify V3 neurons as a critical driver of locomotor adaptation in zebrafish.

                Perception cycles through periods of enhanced and reduced sensitivity to external information. Here, we asked whether such infra-slow oscillations arise as a noise-related epiphenomenon of limited processing capacity or, alternatively, represent a structured mechanism of perceptual inference. Using two large-scale datasets, we found that humans and mice waver between alternating intervals of externally- and internally-oriented modes of sensory analysis. During external mode, perception was more sensitive to external sensory information, whereas internal mode was characterized by enhanced biases toward perceptual history. Computational modeling indicated that dynamic changes in mode are governed by two interlinked factors: (i), the integration of subsequent stimuli over time and, (ii), infra-slow anti-phase oscillations in the perceptual impact of external sensory information versus internal predictions that are provided by perceptual history. Between-mode fluctuations may benefit perception by enabling the generation of stable representations of the environment despite an ongoing stream of noisy sensory inputs.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Alpha blocking and 1/fβ spectral scaling in resting EEG can be accounted for by a sum of damped alpha band oscillatory processes</a></h4>

              
                The dynamical and physiological basis of alpha band activity and 1/f{beta} noise in the EEG are the subject of continued speculation. Here we conjecture, on the basis of empirical data analysis, that both of these features may be economically accounted for through a single process if the resting EEG is conceived of being the sum of multiple stochastically perturbed alpha band damped linear oscillators with a distribution of dampings (relaxation rates). The modulation of alpha-band and 1/f{beta} noise activity by changes in damping is explored in eyes closed (EC) and eyes open (EO) resting state EEG. We aim to estimate the distribution of dampings by solving an inverse problem applied to EEG power spectra. The characteristics of the damping distribution are examined across subjects, sensors and recording condition (EC/EO). We find that there are robust changes in the damping distribution between EC and EO recording conditions across participants. The estimated damping distributions are found to be predominantly bimodal, with the number and position of the modes related to the sharpness of the alpha resonance and the scaling ({beta}) of the power spectrum (1/f{beta}). The results suggest that there exists an intimate relationship between resting state alpha activity and 1/f{beta} noise with changes in both governed by changes to the damping of the underlying alpha oscillatory processes. In particular, alpha-blocking is observed to be the result of the most weakly damped distribution mode becoming more heavily damped. The results suggest a novel way of characterizing resting EEG power spectra and provides new insight into the central role that damped alpha-band activity may play in characterising the spatio-temporal features of resting state EEG.

                Understanding the function of brain cortices requires simultaneous investigation at multiple spatial and temporal scales and to link neural activity to an animal's behavior. A major challenge is to measure within- and across-layer information in actively behaving animals, in particular in mice that have become a major species in neuroscience due to an extensive genetic toolkit. Here we describe the Hybrid Drive, a new chronic implant for mice that combines tetrode arrays to record within-layer information with silicon probes to simultaneously measure across-layer information. The flexible, open-source design allows custom spatial arrangements of tetrode arrays and silicon probes to generate areas-specific layouts. We show that large numbers of neurons and layer-resolved local field potentials can be recorded from the same brain region across weeks without loss in electrophysiological signal quality. The drive's light-weight structure (3.5 g) leaves animal behavior largely unchanged during a variety of experimental paradigms, enabling the study of rich, naturalistic behaviors. We demonstrate the power of the Hybrid Drive in a series of experiments linking the spiking activity of CA1 pyramidal layer neurons to the oscillatory activity across hippocampal layers.

                Despite the evident benefit of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to probe human brain function and treat neurological diseases, current technology allows only a slow, mechanical adjustment of the electric filed orientation. Automated and fast control of the TMS orientation is critical to enable synchronizing the stimulation with the ongoing brain activity. We overcome these limitations with a two-coil electronically controlled TMS transducer to define precisely the pulse orientation (~1-degree steps) without mechanical movement. We validated the technology by determining the dependency of motor evoked responses on the stimulus orientation and intensity with high angular resolution. The motor response was found to follow a logistic function of the stimulus orientation, which helps to disentangle the TMS neuronal effects. The electronic control of the TMS electric field is a decisive step towards automated brain stimulation protocols with enhanced accuracy of stimulus targeting and timing for better diagnostics and improved clinical efficacy.

                Normal cellular function requires a rate of ATP production sufficient to meet demand. In most neurodegenerative diseases (including Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, ALS), mitochondrial dysfunction is postulated raising the possibility of impaired ATP production and a need for compensatory maneuvers to sustain the ATP production/demand balance. We find in our rodent models of familial ALS (fALS), impairment in neuronal glycolytic flux with maintained or enhanced activity of the citric acid cycle. This rewiring of metabolism is associated with normal ATP levels and redox status, supporting the notion that mitochondrial function is not compromised in neurons expressing fALS genes. Genetic loss-of-function manipulation of individual steps in the glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway blunt the negative phenotypes seen in various fALS models. We propose that neurons adjust fuel utilization in the setting of neurodegenerative disease-associated mitochondrial dysfunction in a baleful manner and targeting this process can be healthful.

                NG2 glia represent a distinct type of macroglial cells in the CNS and are unique among glia because they receive synaptic input from neurons. They are abundantly present in white and grey matter. While the majority of white matter NG2 glia differentiates into oligodendrocytes, the physiological impact of grey matter NG2 glia and their synaptic input are ill defined yet. Here we asked whether dysfunctional NG2 glia affect neuronal signaling and behavior. We generated mice with inducible deletion of the K+ channel Kir4.1 in NG2 glia and performed comparative electrophysiological, immunohistochemical, molecular and behavioral analyses. Focussing on the hippocampus, we found that loss of the Kir4.1 potentiated synaptic depolarizations of NG2 glia and enhanced the expression of myelin basic protein. Notably, while mice with targeted deletion of the K+ channel in NG2 glia showed impaired long term potentiation at CA3-CA1 synapses, they demonstrated improved spatial memory as revealed by testing new object location recognition. Our data demonstrate that proper NG2 glia function is critical for normal brain function and behavior.

                Induced pluripotent stem cells generated from patients with geographic atrophy as well as healthy individuals were differentiated to retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells. By integrating transcriptional profiles of 127,659 RPE cells generated from 43 individuals with geographic atrophy and 36 controls with genotype data, we identified 439 expression Quantitative Trait (eQTL) loci in cis that were associated with disease status and specific to subpopulations of RPE cells. We identified loci linked to two genes with known associations with geographic atrophy - PILRB and PRPH2, in addition to 43 genes with significant genotype x disease interactions that are candidates for novel genetic associations for geographic atrophy. On a transcriptome-only level, we identified molecular pathways significantly upregulated in geographic atrophy-RPE including in extracellular cellular matrix reorganisation, neurodegeneration, and mitochondrial functions. We subsequently implemented a large-scale proteomics analysis, confirming modification in proteins associated with these pathways. We also identified six significant protein (p) QTL that regulate protein expression in the RPE cells and in geographic atrophy - two of which share variants with cis-eQTL. Transcriptome-wide association analysis identified genes at loci previously associated with age-related macular degeneration. Further analysis conditional on disease status, implicated statistically significant RPE-specific eQTL. This study uncovers important differences in RPE homeostasis associated with geographic atrophy.

                Glycine receptor-mediated inhibitory neurotransmission is key for spinal cord function. Recent observations suggested that by largely elusive mechanisms also glycinergic synapses display synaptic plasticity. We here identify syndapin I as critical player. Interestingly, syndapin I cooperates but in part also competes with gephyrin. Syndapin I deficiency led to fragmentation of glycine receptor fields, more disperse receptors and increased receptor mobility. Kainate treatment highlighted syndapin Is importance even more. Our analyses unveiled that PKC-mediated S403 phosphorylation-mediated glycine receptor {beta} decoupling from gephyrin scaffolds simultaneously promoted syndapin I association. In line, kainate-treated syndapin I KO spinal cords showed even more severe receptor field fragmentation. Furthermore, syndapin I deficiency completely disrupted kainate-induced glycine receptor internalization. Together, this unveiled important mechanisms controlling the number and organization of glycine receptor fields at inhibitory postsynapses during both steady-state and kainate-induced synaptic rearrangement - principles organizing and fine-tuning synaptic efficacy of inhibitory synapses in the spinal cord.

	<p>Survivors of severe brain injury may require care in a neurointensive care unit (neuro-ICU), where the brain is vulnerable to secondary brain injury. Thus, there is a need for noninvasive, bedside, continuous cerebral blood flow monitoring approaches in the neuro-ICU. Our goal is to address this need through combined measurements of EEG and functional optical spectroscopy (EEG-Optical) instrumentation and analysis to provide a complementary fusion of data about brain activity and function. We utilized the diffuse correlation spectroscopy method for assessing cerebral blood flow at the neuro-ICU in a patient with traumatic brain injury. The present case demonstrates the feasibility of continuous recording of noninvasive cerebral blood flow transients that correlated well with the gold-standard invasive measurements and with the frequency content changes in the EEG data.</p>

	<p>Mirror visual feedback (MVF) has been shown to increase the excitability of the primary motor cortex (M1) during asynchronous bimanual movement. However, the functional networks underlying this process remain unclear. We recruited 16 healthy volunteers to perform asynchronous bimanual movement, that is, their left hand performed partial range of movement while their right hand performed normal full range of movement. Their ongoing brain activities were recorded by whole-head magnetoencephalography during the movement. Participants were required to keep both hands stationary in the control condition. In the other two conditions, participants were required to perform asynchronous bimanual movement with MVF (Asy_M) and without MVF (Asy_w/oM). Greater M1 excitability was found under Asy_M than under Asy_w/oM. More importantly, when receiving MVF, the visual cortex reduced its functional connection to brain regions associated with perceptuo-motor-attentional process (i.e., M1, superior temporal gyrus, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex). This is the first study to demonstrate a global functional network of MVF during asynchronous bimanual movement, providing a foundation for future research to examine the neural mechanisms of mirror illusion in motor control.</p>

	<p>Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) is the standard procedure for feeding severely dysphagic patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). It is associated with prolonged survival and improvement in quality of life. Nasal inspiratory pressure during a sniff (SNIP) is a respiratory test used extensively in ALS for the assessment of inspiratory muscle strength. In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of SNIP at baseline to predict PEG placement in ALS. Data from a clinical incident cohort of 179 ALS cases attending the multidisciplinary ALS unit of the University of Bari between April 2006 and December 2012 were retrospectively analysed. At baseline, patients underwent detailed neurological, nutritional and respiratory assessments, including measurements of SNIP and forced vital capacity (FVC). Patients were therefore followed up approximately every three to six months until they were able to attend the centre. The censoring date for the survival analysis was 15 April 2014, with PEG placement as the main outcome. Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to examine the association between SNIP and PEG placement, adjusted for possible confounders. During the follow-up period, 75 participants (42%) received PEG implant. PEG placement was more frequent (57% vs. 31%; p = 0.001) and earlier (after 11.6 ± 14.0 months from the first visit, vs. 23.3 ± 15.5 months; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001) in the group of patients with baseline SNIP ≤ 40 cm H2O. Baseline SNIP was a predictor of PEG placement even after correction for multiple potential confounders (HR 0.98; 95% CI: 0.96–0.99; p = 0.02). To conclude, the present study showed that SNIP at baseline is an early indicator of disease progression and therefore of the need for enteral nutrition in ALS.</p>

	<p>The phonology of prosody has received little attention in studies of motor speech disorders. The present study investigates the phonology of intonation (nuclear contours) and speech chunking (prosodic phrasing) in Parkinson’s disease (PD) as a function of medication intake and duration of the disease. Following methods of the prosodic and intonational phonology frameworks, we examined the ability of 30 PD patients to use intonation categories and prosodic phrasing structures in ways similar to 20 healthy controls to convey similar meanings. Speech data from PD patients were collected before and after a dopaminomimetic drug intake and were phonologically analyzed in relation to nuclear contours and intonational phrasing. Besides medication, disease duration and the presence of motor fluctuations were also factors included in the analyses. Overall, PD patients showed a decreased ability to use nuclear contours and prosodic phrasing. Medication improved intonation regardless of disease duration but did not help with dysprosodic phrasing. In turn, disease duration and motor fluctuations affected phrasing patterns but had no impact on intonation. Our study demonstrated that the phonology of prosody is impaired in PD, and prosodic categories and structures may be differently affected, with implications for the understanding of PD neurophysiology and therapy.</p>

	<p>Interhemispheric inhibition (IHI) between the left and right primary motor cortices (M1) plays an important role when people perform an isolated unilateral limb movement. Moreover, negative blood oxygenation-level dependent signal (deactivation) obtained from the M1 ipsilateral to the limb could be a surrogate IHI marker. Studies have reported deactivation in the hand section of the ipsilateral M1 during simple unilateral hand movement. However, deactivation in the foot section during unilateral foot movement has not been reported. Therefore, IHI between the foot sections of the bilateral M1s has been considered very weak or absent. Thirty-seven healthy adults performed active control of the right foot and also passively received vibration to the tendon of the tibialis anterior muscle of the right foot, which activates the foot section of the contralateral M1, with brain activity being examined through functional magnetic resonance imaging. The vibration and active tasks significantly and non-significantly, respectively, deactivated the foot section of the ipsilateral M1, with a corresponding 86% and 60% of the participants showing decreased activity. Thus, there could be IHI between the foot sections of the bilateral M1s. Further, our findings demonstrate between-task differences and similarities in cross-somatotopic deactivation.</p>

	<p>Microglia are the first line of defense at the level of the central nervous system (CNS). Phenotypic change in microglia can be regulated by various factors, including the orexin system. Neuroinflammation is an inflammatory process mediated by cytokines, by the lack of interaction of specific receptors such as the OX2-OX2R complex, caused by systemic tissue damage or, more often, associated with direct damage to the CNS. Chronic activation of microglia could lead to long-term neurodegenerative diseases. This review aims to explore how tocopherol (vitamin E) and the orexin system may play a role in the prevention and treatment of microglia inflammation and, consequently, in neurodegenerative diseases thanks to its antioxidant properties. The results of animal and in vitro studies provide evidence to support the use of tocopherol for a reduction in microglia inflammation as well as a greater activation of the orexinergic system. Although there is much in vivo and in vitro evidence of vitamin E antioxidant and protective abilities, there are still conflicting results for its use as a treatment for neurodegenerative diseases that speculate that vitamin E, under certain conditions or genetic predispositions, can be pro-oxidant and harmful.</p>

	<p>The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of aquatic exercise (AE) and land-based exercise (LE) on cardiorespiratory fitness, motor function, balance, and functional independence in stroke patients. Design: Through searching PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, CNKI, VIP and Wanfang Database, only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were collected to study the effects of AE and LE on cardiorespiratory fitness, motor function, balance, and functional independence in patients with stroke. The included studies were evaluated for methodological quality by the Cochrane bias risk assessment tool, and statistical analysis was carried out by the Review Manage 5.3 and Stata 15.1 software. Results: The RCTs were collected between the earliest available date and April 2021. Eleven RCTs were included, including five studies with low risk and six studies with moderate risk. The total sample size used in the study was 369, which included 187 patients undertaking AE and 182 patients undertaking LE. The results of the meta-analysis showed that AE can significantly improve patients’ Berg Balance Scale (BBS) (MD = 5.19, 95% CI: 2.66 to 7.71, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001), peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak) (MD = 3.49, 95% CI: 0.17 to 6.8, p = 0.04), Fugl–Meyer Assessment (FMA) (MD = 3.84, 95% CI: 1.64 to 6.04, p = 0.0006), and Functional Independence Measure (FIM) (MD = 6.1, 95% CI: 4.05 to 8.15, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.00001). However, there was no statistically significant difference between the two exercise modes in the Timed Up and Go Test (TUGT) (MD = −2.52, 95% CI: −5.95 to 0.91, p = 0.15) or the Functional Ambulation Category scale (FAC) (MD = 0.28, 95% CI: −0.21 to 0.76, p = 0.26). Conclusion: Based on the improvement in the Berg Balance Scale, peak oxygen uptake, Fugl–Meyer Assessment, and Functional Independence Measure, we can state that aquatic exercise offers better advantages than land-based exercise for patients’ balance, motor function, cardiorespiratory fitness, and functional independence.</p>

	<p>Decision making is crucial for animal survival because the choices they make based on their current situation could influence their future rewards and could have potential costs. This review summarises recent developments in decision making, discusses how rewards and costs could be encoded in the brain, and how different options are compared such that the most optimal one is chosen. The reward and cost are mainly encoded by the forebrain structures (e.g., anterior cingulate cortex, orbitofrontal cortex), and their value is updated through learning. The recent development on dopamine and the lateral habenula’s role in reporting prediction errors and instructing learning will be emphasised. The importance of dopamine in powering the choice and accounting for the internal state will also be discussed. While the orbitofrontal cortex is the place where the state values are stored, the anterior cingulate cortex is more important when the environment is volatile. All of these structures compare different attributes of the task simultaneously, and the local competition of different neuronal networks allows for the selection of the most appropriate one. Therefore, the total value of the task is not encoded as a scalar quantity in the brain but, instead, as an emergent phenomenon, arising from the computation at different brain regions.</p>

	<p>Developing effective tools and strategies to promote motor learning is a high-priority scientific and clinical goal. In particular, motor-related areas have been investigated as potential targets to facilitate motor learning by noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS). In addition to shedding light on the relationship between motor function and oscillatory brain activity, transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS), which can noninvasively entrain oscillatory brain activity and modulate oscillatory brain communication, has attracted attention as a possible technique to promote motor learning. This review focuses on the use of tACS to enhance motor learning through the manipulation of oscillatory brain activity and its potential clinical applications. We discuss a potential tACS–based approach to ameliorate motor deficits by correcting abnormal oscillatory brain activity and promoting appropriate oscillatory communication in patients after stroke or with Parkinson’s disease. Interpersonal tACS approaches to manipulate intra- and inter-brain communication may result in pro-social effects and could promote the teaching–learning process during rehabilitation sessions with a therapist. The approach of re-establishing oscillatory brain communication through tACS could be effective for motor recovery and might eventually drive the design of new neurorehabilitation approaches based on motor learning.</p>

	<p>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)/motor neuron disease (MND) is a systemic and fatal neurodegenerative condition for which there is currently no cure. Informal caregivers play a vital role in supporting the person with ALS, and it is essential to support their wellbeing. This multi-centre, mixed methods descriptive exploratory study describes the complexity of burden and self-defined difficulties as described by the caregivers themselves. Quantitative and qualitative data were collected during face-to-face interviews with informal caregivers from centres in the Netherlands, England, and Ireland. Standardised measures assessed burden, quality of life, and psychological distress; furthermore, an open-ended question was asked about difficult aspects of caregiving. Most caregivers were female, spouse/partners, and lived with the person with ALS for whom they provided care. Significant differences between national cohorts were identified for burden, quality of life, and anxiety. Among the difficulties described were the practical issues associated with the caregiver role and emotional factors such as witnessing a patient’s health decline, relationship change, and their own distress. The mixed-methods approach allows for a more nuanced understanding of the burden and difficulties experienced. It is important to generate an evidence base to support the psychosocial wellbeing and brain health of informal caregivers.</p>

However, in cuprates, the relationship between these electronic symmetry-breaking phases and the enigmatic pseudogap phase remains unclear. Here, we...

                <p>Understanding the response of Himalayan-Karakoram (HK) rivers to climate change is crucial for ~1 billion people who partly depend on these water resources. Policy-makers tasked with sustainable water resources management require an assessment of the rivers&rsquo; current status and potential future changes. We show that glacier and snow melt are important components of HK rivers, with greater hydrological importance for the Indus basin than for the Ganges and Brahmaputra basins. Total river runoff, glacier melt, and seasonality of flow are projected to increase until the 2050s, with some exceptions and large uncertainties. Critical knowledge gaps severely affect modeled contributions of different runoff components, future runoff volumes, and seasonality. Therefore, comprehensive field observation&ndash;based and remote sensing&ndash;based methods and models are needed.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">A DNA repair pathway can regulate transcriptional noise to promote cell fate transitions</a></h4>

              
                <p>Stochastic fluctuations in gene expression ("noise") are often considered detrimental, but fluctuations can also be exploited for benefit (e.g., dither). We show here that DNA base excision repair amplifies transcriptional noise to facilitate cellular reprogramming. Specifically, the DNA repair protein Apex1, which recognizes both naturally occurring and unnatural base modifications, amplifies expression noise while homeostatically maintaining mean expression levels. This amplified expression noise originates from shorter-duration, higher-intensity transcriptional bursts generated by Apex1-mediated DNA supercoiling. The remodeling of DNA topology first impedes and then accelerates transcription to maintain mean levels. This mechanism, which we refer to as "discordant transcription through repair" ("DiThR," which is pronounced "dither"), potentiates cellular reprogramming and differentiation. Our study reveals a potential functional role for transcriptional fluctuations mediated by DNA base modifications in embryonic development and disease.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Accurate prediction of protein structures and interactions using a three-track neural network</a></h4>

              
                <p>DeepMind presented notably accurate predictions at the recent 14th Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction (CASP14) conference. We explored network architectures that incorporate related ideas and obtained the best performance with a three-track network in which information at the one-dimensional (1D) sequence level, the 2D distance map level, and the 3D coordinate level is successively transformed and integrated. The three-track network produces structure predictions with accuracies approaching those of DeepMind in CASP14, enables the rapid solution of challenging x-ray crystallography and cryo&ndash;electron microscopy structure modeling problems, and provides insights into the functions of proteins of currently unknown structure. The network also enables rapid generation of accurate protein-protein complex models from sequence information alone, short-circuiting traditional approaches that require modeling of individual subunits followed by docking. We make the method available to the scientific community to speed biological research.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Mechanisms that ensure speed and fidelity in eukaryotic translation termination</a></h4>

              
                <p>Translation termination, which liberates a nascent polypeptide from the ribosome specifically at stop codons, must occur accurately and rapidly. We established single-molecule fluorescence assays to track the dynamics of ribosomes and two requisite release factors (eRF1 and eRF3) throughout termination using an in vitro&ndash;reconstituted yeast translation system. We found that the two eukaryotic release factors bound together to recognize stop codons rapidly and elicit termination through a tightly regulated, multistep process that resembles transfer RNA selection during translation elongation. Because the release factors are conserved from yeast to humans, the molecular events that underlie yeast translation termination are likely broadly fundamental to eukaryotic protein synthesis.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Mammalian retrovirus-like protein PEG10 packages its own mRNA and can be pseudotyped for mRNA delivery</a></h4>

              
                <p>Eukaryotic genomes contain domesticated genes from integrating viruses and mobile genetic elements. Among these are homologs of the capsid protein (known as Gag) of long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons and retroviruses. We identified several mammalian Gag homologs that form virus-like particles and one LTR retrotransposon homolog, PEG10, that preferentially binds and facilitates vesicular secretion of its own messenger RNA (mRNA). We showed that the mRNA cargo of PEG10 can be reprogrammed by flanking genes of interest with <I>Peg10</I>&rsquo;s untranslated regions. Taking advantage of this reprogrammability, we developed selective endogenous encapsidation for cellular delivery (SEND) by engineering both mouse and human PEG10 to package, secrete, and deliver specific RNAs. Together, these results demonstrate that SEND is a modular platform suited for development as an efficient therapeutic delivery modality.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Spatiotemporal invasion dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7 emergence</a></h4>

              
                <p>Understanding the causes and consequences of the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants of concern is crucial to pandemic control yet difficult to achieve because they arise in the context of variable human behavior and immunity. We investigated the spatial invasion dynamics of lineage B.1.1.7 by jointly analyzing UK human mobility, virus genomes, and community-based polymerase chain reaction data. We identified a multistage spatial invasion process in which early B.1.1.7 growth rates were associated with mobility and asymmetric lineage export from a dominant source location, enhancing the effects of B.1.1.7&rsquo;s increased intrinsic transmissibility. We further explored how B.1.1.7 spread was shaped by nonpharmaceutical interventions and spatial variation in previous attack rates. Our findings show that careful accounting of the behavioral and epidemiological context within which variants of concern emerge is necessary to interpret correctly their observed relative growth rates.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Large-sample evidence on the impact of unconventional oil and gas development on surface waters</a></h4>

              
                <p>The impact of unconventional oil and gas development on water quality is a major environmental concern. We built a large geocoded database that combines surface water measurements with horizontally drilled wells stimulated by hydraulic fracturing (HF) for several shales to examine whether temporal and spatial well variation is associated with anomalous salt concentrations in United States watersheds. We analyzed four ions that could indicate water impact from unconventional development. We found very small concentration increases associated with new HF wells for barium, chloride, and strontium but not bromide. All ions showed larger, but still small-in-magnitude, increases 91 to 180 days after well spudding. Our estimates were most pronounced for wells with larger amounts of produced water, wells located over high-salinity formations, and wells closer and likely upstream from water monitors.</p>

                <p>The interfaces of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are important in determining their efficiency and stability, but the morphology and stability of imbedded perovskite-substrate interfaces have received less attention than have top interfaces. We found that dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), which is a liquid additive broadly applied to enhance perovskite film morphology, was trapped during film formation and led to voids at perovskite-substrate interfaces that accelerated the film degradation under illumination. Partial replacement of DMSO with solid-state carbohydrazide reduces interfacial voids. A maximum stabilized power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.6% was realized for blade-coated p-type/intrinsic/n-type (p-i-n) structure PSCs with no efficiency loss after 550-hour operational stability tests at 60&deg;C. The perovskite mini-modules showed certified PCEs of 19.3 and 19.2%, with aperture areas of 18.1 and 50.0 square centimeters, respectively.</p>

                <p>Many correlated systems feature an insulator-to-metal transition that can be triggered by an electric field. Although it is known that metallization takes place through filament formation, the details of how this process initiates and evolves remain elusive. We use in-operando optical reflectivity to capture the growth dynamics of the metallic phase with space and time resolution. We demonstrate that filament formation is triggered by nucleation at hotspots, with a subsequent expansion over several decades in time. By comparing three case studies (VO<SUB>2</SUB>, V<SUB>3</SUB>O<SUB>5</SUB>, and V<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>3</SUB>), we identify the resistivity change across the transition as the crucial parameter governing this process. Our results provide a spatiotemporal characterization of volatile resistive switching in Mott insulators, which is important for emerging technologies, such as optoelectronics and neuromorphic computing.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Hierarchical crack buffering triples ductility in eutectic herringbone high-entropy alloys</a></h4>

              
                <p>In human-made malleable materials, microdamage such as cracking usually limits material lifetime. Some biological composites, such as bone, have hierarchical microstructures that tolerate cracks but cannot withstand high elongation. We demonstrate a directionally solidified eutectic high-entropy alloy (EHEA) that successfully reconciles crack tolerance and high elongation. The solidified alloy has a hierarchically organized herringbone structure that enables bionic-inspired hierarchical crack buffering. This effect guides stable, persistent crystallographic nucleation and growth of multiple microcracks in abundant poor-deformability microstructures. Hierarchical buffering by adjacent dynamic strain&ndash;hardened features helps the cracks to avoid catastrophic growth and percolation. Our self-buffering herringbone material yields an ultrahigh uniform tensile elongation (~50%), three times that of conventional nonbuffering EHEAs, without sacrificing strength.</p>

                <p>Zoonotic avian influenza A virus (IAV) infections are rare. Sustained transmission of these IAVs between humans has not been observed, suggesting a role for host genes. We used whole-genome sequencing to compare avian IAV H7N9 patients with healthy controls and observed a strong association between H7N9 infection and rare, heterozygous single-nucleotide variants in the <I>MX1</I> gene. <I>MX1</I> codes for myxovirus resistance protein A (MxA), an interferon-induced antiviral guanosine triphosphatase known to control IAV infections in transgenic mice. Most of the MxA variants identified lost the ability to inhibit avian IAVs, including H7N9, in transfected human cell lines. Nearly all of the inactive MxA variants exerted a dominant-negative effect on the antiviral function of wild-type MxA, suggesting an MxA null phenotype in heterozygous carriers. Our study provides genetic evidence for a crucial role of the <I>MX1</I>-based antiviral defense in controlling zoonotic IAV infections in humans.</p>

                <p>Babbling is a production milestone in infant speech development. Evidence for babbling in nonhuman mammals is scarce, which has prevented cross-species comparisons. In this study, we investigated the conspicuous babbling behavior of <I>Saccopteryx bilineata</I>, a bat capable of vocal production learning. We analyzed the babbling of 20 bat pups in the field during their 3-month ontogeny and compared its features to those that characterize babbling in human infants. Our findings demonstrate that babbling in bat pups is characterized by the same eight features as babbling in human infants, including the conspicuous features reduplication and rhythmicity. These parallels in vocal ontogeny between two mammalian species offer future possibilities for comparison of cognitive and neuromolecular mechanisms and adaptive functions of babbling in bats and humans.</p>

                <p>The relationship between community prevalence of <I>Plasmodium falciparum</I> and the burden of severe, life-threatening disease remains poorly defined. To examine the three most common severe malaria phenotypes from catchment populations across East Africa, we assembled a dataset of 6506 hospital admissions for malaria in children aged 3 months to 9 years from 2006 to 2020. Admissions were paired with data from community parasite infection surveys. A Bayesian procedure was used to calibrate uncertainties in exposure (parasite prevalence) and outcomes (severe malaria phenotypes). Each 25% increase in prevalence conferred a doubling of severe malaria admission rates. Severe malaria remains a burden predominantly among young children (3 to 59 months) across a wide range of community prevalence typical of East Africa. This study offers a quantitative framework for linking malaria parasite prevalence and severe disease outcomes in children.</p>

                <p>There is an urgent need for antiviral agents that treat severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. We screened a library of 1900 clinically safe drugs against OC43, a human beta coronavirus that causes the common cold, and evaluated the top hits against SARS-CoV-2. Twenty drugs significantly inhibited replication of both viruses in cultured human cells. Eight of these drugs inhibited the activity of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease, 3CLpro, with the most potent being masitinib, an orally bioavailable tyrosine kinase inhibitor. X-ray crystallography and biochemistry show that masitinib acts as a competitive inhibitor of 3CLpro. Mice infected with SARS-CoV-2 and then treated with masitinib showed &gt;200-fold reduction in viral titers in the lungs and nose, as well as reduced lung inflammation. Masitinib was also effective in vitro against all tested variants of concern (B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1).</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Unbiased K-L estimator for the linear regression model [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: In the linear regression model, the ordinary least square (OLS) estimator performance drops when multicollinearity is present. According to the Gauss-Markov theorem, the estimator remains unbiased when there is multicollinearity, but the variance of its regression estimates become inflated. Estimators such as the ridge regression estimator and the K-L estimators were adopted as substitutes to the OLS estimator to overcome the problem of multicollinearity in the linear regression model. However, the estimators are biased, though they possess a smaller mean squared error when compared to the OLS estimator. Methods: In this study, we developed a new unbiased estimator using the K-L estimator and compared its performance with some existing estimators theoretically, simulation wise and by adopting real-life data. Results: Theoretically, the estimator even though unbiased also possesses a minimum variance when compared with other estimators.  Results from simulation and real-life study showed that the new estimator produced smaller mean square error (MSE) and had the smallest mean square prediction error (MSPE). This further strengthened the findings of the theoretical comparison using both the MSE and the MSPE as criterion. Conclusions: By simulation and using a real-life application that focuses on modelling, the high heating values of proximate analysis was conducted to support the theoretical findings. This new method of estimation is recommended for parameter estimation with and without multicollinearity in a linear regression model.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Enhancing oscillations in intracranial electrophysiological recordings with data-driven spatial filters</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Natalie Schaworonkow, Bradley Voytek</p>

In invasive electrophysiological recordings, a variety of neural oscillations can be detected across the cortex, with overlap in space and time. This overlap complicates measurement of neural oscillations using standard referencing schemes, like common average or bipolar referencing. Here, we illustrate the effects of spatial mixing on measuring neural oscillations in invasive electrophysiological recordings and demonstrate the benefits of using data-driven referencing schemes in order to improve measurement of neural oscillations. We discuss referencing as the application of a spatial filter. Spatio-spectral decomposition is used to estimate data-driven spatial filters, a computationally fast method which specifically enhances signal-to-noise ratio for oscillations in a frequency band of interest. We show that application of these data-driven spatial filters has benefits for data exploration, investigation of temporal dynamics and assessment of peak frequencies of neural oscillations. We demonstrate multiple use cases, exploring between-participant variability in presence of oscillations, spatial spread and waveform shape of different rhythms as well as narrowband noise removal with the aid of spatial filters. We find high between-participant variability in the presence of neural oscillations, a large variation in spatial spread of individual rhythms and many non-sinusoidal rhythms across the cortex. Improved measurement of cortical rhythms will yield better conditions for establishing links between cortical activity and behavior, as well as bridging scales between the invasive intracranial measurements and noninvasive macroscale scalp measurements.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Elucidating relationships between P.falciparum prevalence and measures of genetic diversity with a combined genetic-epidemiological model of malaria</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jason A. Hendry, Dominic Kwiatkowski, Gil McVean</p>

There is an abundance of malaria genetic data being collected from the field, yet using these data to understand the drivers of regional epidemiology remains a challenge. A key issue is the lack of models that relate parasite genetic diversity to epidemiological parameters. Classical models in population genetics characterize changes in genetic diversity in relation to demographic parameters, but fail to account for the unique features of the malaria life cycle. In contrast, epidemiological models, such as the Ross-Macdonald model, capture malaria transmission dynamics but do not consider genetics. Here, we have developed an integrated model encompassing both parasite evolution and regional epidemiology. We achieve this by combining the Ross-Macdonald model with an intra-host continuous-time Moran model, thus explicitly representing the evolution of individual parasite genomes in a traditional epidemiological framework. Implemented as a stochastic simulation, we use the model to explore relationships between measures of parasite genetic diversity and parasite prevalence, a widely-used metric of transmission intensity. First, we explore how varying parasite prevalence influences genetic diversity at equilibrium. We find that multiple genetic diversity statistics are correlated with prevalence, but the strength of the relationships depends on whether variation in prevalence is driven by host- or vector-related factors. Next, we assess the responsiveness of a variety of statistics to malaria control interventions, finding that those related to mixed infections respond quickly (∼months) whereas other statistics, such as nucleotide diversity, may take decades to respond. These findings provide insights into the opportunities and challenges associated with using genetic data to monitor malaria epidemiology.
