">Education Shapes the Link Between EEG Aperiodic Components and Cognitive Aging</a></h4>

              
                Healthy aging brings widespread shifts in aperiodic (non-oscillatory) electroencephalographic (EEG) components, which may underlie physiological changes in cognitive performance. Education, a known protective factor against age-related decline in cognitive performance, has been largely overlooked in studies linking aperiodic EEG components to cognition. This study addresses this gap, hypothesizing that education moderates the interplay between age, aperiodic components, and cognitive performance, as measured by Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores. We reanalyzed an open-source EEG dataset of 714 healthy individuals aged 18-91 years using Generalized Additive Mixed Models. Aperiodic exponent and offset both declined with age, but higher education levels mitigated these declines. Notably, exponent and offset interacted with age and education in predicting MMSE performance in the bilateral cingulate, left hippocampus, bilateral parietal, right occipital, and left temporal regions. Among older adults, the relationship between the aperiodic components and cognitive performance diverged by education: those with lower education showed worse cognitive outcomes with lower exponents and offsets, whereas higher-educated individuals after 60 years showed a reverse pattern, with lower exponents and offsets predicting better MMSE performance. Our findings suggest that the link between aperiodic components and cognitive aging is not straightforward but depends on moderating factors such as education. These results underscore the importance of accounting for individual differences, like educational background, when exploring age-related changes in EEG aperiodic components and cognition.

">Neural mechanisms of structural inference: an EEG investigation of linguistic phrase structure categorization</a></h4>

              
                Language comprehension is a complex cognitive process of understanding spoken or written language, during which the brain derives meanings and interprets messages by constructing hierarchical structures from word sequences. A key component underlying this process is structural inference. This computation determines the syntactic category ('head') of phrases, such as noun phrases (NP) and verb phrases (VP). Categorization confers distinct semantic and distributional properties. However, isolating neural correlates of structural inference is challenging, as modulations of syntactic category usually alter lexical content. Here, we collected the electroencephalography (EEG) data while participants read Mandarin NPs and VPs, which differ in their syntactic 'headedness' but with lexical-semantics, lexical-syntactic categories and word order strictly conserved. We found significant theta power increases at left central-parietal scalp sites in NPs relative to VPs around the presentation (0-210 ms) of the nouns, where only the nouns in NPs project a head. Both NPs and VPs relative to one-word phrases exhibited spatiotemporally consistent low-frequency power increases at the point of linguistic composition, consistent with previous studies. Overall, our findings offer novel constraints on neurocomputational accounts of linguistic structure-building through these previously undocumented signatures of syntactic inference.

">Neural Timescale of Adolescents Major Depressive Disorder</a></h4>

              
                Adolescent major depressive disorder (MDD) is characterized by heterogeneous symptomatology and complex neurodevelopmental underpinnings. Here, we investigated whether cortical intrinsic neural timescales (INT), a measure of temporal stability in neural activity, are altered in adolescents with MDD and whether these alterations relate to clinical symptoms, suicidality, early life adversity, and underlying neurobiological mechanisms. Using resting state fMRI in adolescents with MDD and healthy controls (HCs), we found widespread reductions in INT in frontal, parietal, and sensorimotor regions, with a notable prolongation in the left temporoparietal junction. Disrupted timescales significantly impaired network modularity and clustering, and SVR based machine learning revealed that altered INT patterns predicted individual depression and anxiety severity. INT abnormalities were further associated with suicidal ideation and childhood trauma, particularly emotional and physical neglect. Biophysical modeling linked INT variations to local recurrent excitation and external input strength, differing between HCs and MDD. Spatial correlations with PET derived neurotransmitter receptor maps demonstrated that INT alterations colocalize with serotonergic, dopaminergic, and cholinergic systems. Transcriptomic enrichment analysis revealed associations with genes involved in mitochondrial function, synaptic signaling, and metabolic regulation. Together, these findings identify neural timescale disruption as a core pathophysiological feature of adolescent MDD, bridging macroscale dynamics with microcircuit and molecular architecture. INT may serve as a promising biomarker and mechanistic target for precision psychiatry in youth depression.

">Long-term independent use of an intracortical brain-computer interface for speech and cursor control</a></h4>

              
                Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) can provide naturalistic communication and digital access to people with severe paralysis by decoding neural activity associated with attempted speech and movement. Recent work has demonstrated highly accurate intracortical BCIs for speech and cursor control, but two critical capabilities needed for practical viability were unmet: independent at-home operation without researcher assistance, and reliable long-term performance supporting accurate speech and cursor decoding. Here, we demonstrate the independent and near-daily use of a multimodal BCI with novel brain-to-text speech and computer cursor decoders by a man with paralysis and severe dysarthria due to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Over nearly two years, the participant used the BCI for more than 3,800 cumulative hours to maintain rich interpersonal communication with his family and friends, independently control his personal computer, and sustain full-time employment -- despite being paralyzed. He communicated 183,060 sentences -- totaling 1,960,163 words -- at an average rate of 56.1 words per minute. He labeled 92.3% of sentences as being decoded at least mostly correctly. In formal quantifications of performance where he was asked to say words presented on a screen, attempted speech was consistently decoded with over 99% word accuracy (125,000 word vocabulary). The participant also used the speech BCI as keyboard input and the cursor BCI as mouse input to control his personal computer, enabling him to send text messages, emails, and to browse the internet. These results demonstrate that intracortical BCIs have the potential to support independent use in the home, marking a critical step toward practical assistive technology for people with severe motor impairment.

">Towards Precision Functional Brain Network Mapping in Parkinsons Disease</a></h4>

              
                Background: Parkinsons disease (PD) is a complex neurodegenerative condition that leads to widespread disruption of large-scale brain networks and is further complicated by substantial individual variability in symptomology, progression rates, and treatment response. Consequently, the investigation of individual differences in networks measured via resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) may provide insight. However, most RSFC studies are unable to identify interindividual differences due to poor reliability and group average network definitions. Precision RSFC addresses these shortcomings through extended data collection, strict denoising, and individual network definition, but remains untested in PD. Objectives: To evaluate the feasibility and reliability of precision RSFC studies in PD. Methods: We collected >100 minutes of RSFC data from 20 PD and 6 healthy controls participants. We evaluated the level of motion, reliability and stability of RSFC measures in each participant and contrasted these measures between the PD and HC groups, as well as compared to a conventional 5 minutes of RSFC data. In addition, we created individualized brain network measures in PD participants to establish feasibility in this population. Results: Using precision methods, the PD group produced reliable and stable RSFC measures of brain networks of similar quality to healthy controls and substantially better than conventional methods. Individualized network maps from individuals with PD demonstrate differences from group averages and from each other, including in key motor systems. Conclusion: Precision RSFC is feasible and reliable in individuals with PD. This approach holds promise for advancing personalized diagnostics and identifying brain-based biomarkers underlying clinical variability in PD.

">Neuroplasticity of directed connectivity in long-term meditation: Evidence from EEG Granger causality</a></h4>

              
                The objective of the present study was to characterize the effects of long-term meditation (LTM) on directed connectivity patterns during resting-state and meditative brain states. Specifically, it was aimed to identify major cortical sources of information flow and target regions of information influx, and to reveal which frequency-specific oscillatory networks are critically involved in directing information flux in experienced meditators. Multivariate Granger causality (GC) was computed from high-resolution EEG signals recorded from long-term (LTM, n = 22) and short-term meditators (STM, n = 17) in four conditions: rest, Focused Attention Meditation, Open Monitoring Meditation, and Loving Kindness Meditation. GC was analyzed in the time and frequency domains to assess frequency-specific networks supporting the directed connectivity between key cortical regions (frontal and parietal) in the two hemispheres. According to the results, long-practice meditation was characterized by a significant increase of information flow (1) from posterior to frontal cortical regions, and (2) across frontal regions of the two hemispheres. These dominant transfers were supported by multi-spectral oscillatory networks involving theta, alpha and beta frequency bands, with most prominent expression of GC alpha peak. This pattern of enhanced information transfer in LTM relative to STM was observed in both resting state and each meditation state. These results suggest that long-term meditation is associated with a shift in resting-state brain dynamics toward reduced reliance on slow, undirected intrinsic oscillations, and enhanced directional connectivity in frequencies linked to attention and cognitive control. The dominant posterior-to-anterior directionality points to a reorganization of cognitive control networks that may support the phenomenological qualities of extensive meditation (sustained attention, internal attention, present-moment awareness, and reduced cognitive elaboration). The similarity of between-group differences in directionality patterns across states points to a neuroplastic effect of long-term meditation and highlights meditation as a potential model for investigating adaptive neuroplasticity in large-scale brain networks.

                Visual perception appears largely stable in time. However, psychophysical studies have revealed that theta waves (4-8 Hz) can modulate perception and have been linked to various cognitive states and functions. Neither the contribution of theta waves to cortical activity nor their impact during aberrant brain states have been resolved at high spatiotemporal scales. Here, using cortex-wide population voltage imaging in awake mice, we found that bouts of 5-Hz oscillations in the visual cortex are accompanied by similar oscillations in the retrosplenial cortex, occurring both spontaneously and evoked by visual stimulation. Injection of psychotropic 5-HT2AR agonist induced a significant increase in spontaneous 5-Hz oscillations, and also increased the power, occurrence probability and temporal persistence of visually evoked 5-Hz oscillations. This modulation of 5-Hz oscillations in both cortical areas indicates a strengthening of top-down control of perception, supporting an underlying mechanism of perceptual filling and visual hallucinations.

">Satiety Does Not Silence Food Attention: BMI Modulates Attentional Bias Toward High-Calorie Cues</a></h4>

              
                Background: Attentional bias (AB) for palatable foods has been linked to overeating, yet data on its modulation with body-mass index (BMI) and hunger/satiety are inconsistent. We tested whether hunger, sensory-specific satiety and BMI interact to shape automatic capture of attention by real high-calorie snack foods. Methods: Two emotional-attentional-blink (EAB) experiments presented food distractors either 300 msec (lag-3) or 900 msec (lag-9) before a neutral target. Experiment 1 (N = 183; whole BMI range) randomly assigned participants to taste (non-satiated), satiated or non-eating conditions; the snacks eaten (or not eaten) subsequently re-appeared as distractors in the EAB task. Experiment 2 (N = 61; 31 overweight/obese, 30 normal-weight) manipulated hunger/satiety states and snack type (consumed vs. novel) orthogonally, in a double session design. Results: Experiment 1; food images presented at lag-3 reduced target detection compared with lag-9 (OR = 0.61, CI 0.50 - 0.75, p < .01. Higher BMI predicted a larger AB when hungry, but a smaller AB when satiated (OR = 0.65, CI 0.48 - 0.88, p < 0.01). Experiment 2; For novel snacks, an interaction revealed that participants with overweight/obesity retained robust AB after satiation, whereas AB declined for participants with normal-weight (OR = 2.45, CI 1.09 - 5.51, p = 0.03). For snacks just eaten, AB remained significant in both groups (lag-3 vs. lag-9: OR = 0.37, CI 0.25 - 0.55, p < .001). Conclusions: Real-food cues automatically biased attention regardless of metabolic state, with BMI modulating this effect: even when satiated, individuals with overweight/obesity continue to orient their attention toward both familiar and novel high-calorie foods. These findings suggest that satiety signals alone may be insufficient to curb attentional capture by food in obesity, highlighting the need for interventions that target attentional control and limit food availability.

                Repeatedly processing an object leads to subsequent behavioral improvements in its identification and reductions in associated neural activity, a form of neural processing efficiency that multiple theoretical models have attempted to explain. Using simultaneous fMRI-EEG in humans during object naming, we find that stimulus-driven oscillatory power from high (gamma) to low frequencies (theta) increases and resolves earlier with repetition in task-engaged frontal and occipitotemporal brain regions identified as showing repetition suppression in fMRI. Changes in gamma oscillatory power in these regions were correlated with behavioral priming across subjects and additionally with fMRI repetition suppression in left frontal cortex, providing multimodal support for a novel mixture of the previously proposed Synchrony and Facilitation models.

">Music-evoked reactivation during continuous perception is associated with enhanced subsequent recall of naturalistic events</a></h4>

              
                Music is a potent cue for recalling personal experiences, yet the neural basis of music-evoked memory remains elusive. We address this question by using the full-length film Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind to examine how repeated musical themes reactivate previously encoded events in cortex and shape next-day recall. Participants in an fMRI study viewed either the original film (with repeated musical themes) or a no-music version. By comparing neural activity patterns between these groups, we found that music-evoked reactivation of neural patterns linked to earlier scenes in the default mode network was associated with improved subsequent recall. This relationship was specific to the music condition and persisted when we controlled for a proxy measure of initial encoding strength (spatial intersubject correlation), suggesting that music-evoked reactivation may play a role in making event memories stick that is distinct from what happens at initial encoding.

">Sleep promotes aversive value coding in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Sleep is a state of reduced behavioural responsiveness to the external world. Lowered arousal is thought to arise from sensory gating in the brain, yet there is compelling evidence that stimuli can still be processed to some degree. Which aspects of sensory information are processed during sleep remains largely unknown. Here, we perform comprehensive recordings of activity from multiple neuron types during sleep and wakefulness in the Drosophila olfactory association center. We find that baseline activity of dopamine neurons (DANs) is distinct between active, rest and sleep states, enabling a decoder to predict when the fly is asleep. Optogenetic inhibition of DANs acutely induces sleep and lowers odor-evoked arousal, suggesting causality between DAN activity and behavior. We then examine odor processing during sleep, and find that whereas coding of odor identity in Kenyon cells (KCs) remains intact, coding of odor value in DANs is altered. Specifically, DANs encoding positive (attractive) and negative (aversive) values change their odor responses in an opposing manner, producing more aversive odor representations during sleep. Consistent with these changes in neural activity, sleeping flies awoken by odors show reduced approach and increased avoidance behaviour. Taken together, our data reveal that the brain does not simply suppress the propagation of sensory signals during sleep; rather, it utilizes different cell types to retain or modify specific aspects of sensory information. The aversive odor evaluation in DANs may have ethological benefits as it suppresses the motivation to pursue attractive odors during sleep and primes defensive action when aroused by the scent of potential dangers.

">Cortico-striatal dynamics across working memory stages</a></h4>

              
                Working memory depends on the temporary retention and manipulation of information, bridging the gap between short-term memory and information processing functions. Working memory relies on the temporary retention and manipulation of information, bridging short-term storage with broader cognitive processing. However, when the same working memory task is repeated over several days, it raises the question of whether the rule or task set becomes automated (or proceduralized). The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is crucial for working memory. Yet, the role of the dorsolateral striatum (DLS) in the automation (proceduralization) of rules or task sets remains to be clarified. Using a longitudinal approach of the delay non-match to place (DNMP) task in a T-maze combined to silencing the mPFC or DLS in mice, we show that the mPFC becomes less critical in the maintenance phase of the task as behaviour progressively shifts toward automation. During this phase, the DLS facilitates automated processing. Accordingly, silencing the DLS during maintenance of the task triggers an adaptation in learning strategies, reactivating a goal-directed behaviour. Our findings strengthen the view that memory traces result from a dynamic reorganization of neural networks, challenging the classical view that information merely migrates between brain structures. We here propose that the memory trace remains in a dormant state less energy-consuming for the system while still allowing for rapid flexibility in case of task modification.

">Inhibiting Clarinet/CLA-1 restores function to injured motor neurons</a></h4>

              
                To regain function, injured axons must both regenerate and reform synapses with appropriate postsynaptic cells. We found that inhibiting the scaffolding protein Clarinet/CLA-1, a C. elegans ortholog of Piccolo and Fife, robustly improves axon regeneration. Despite the importance of CLA-1 during synapse development, disrupting the medium isoform of CLA-1 increases the number of axons that regenerate to the neuromuscular junction without significantly influencing synapse reformation. Consequently, the axons that do regenerate are capable of regaining function. Mechanistically, the enhanced axon regeneration observed in cla-1(-) mutants depends on the function of PTRN-1, a microtubule minus-end binding protein. Our data supports a model where loss of CLA-1 promotes PTRN-1 function, which speeds trafficking of injury-related cargo to and from the lesion, thus improving repair. Together, our results reveal a highly conserved synaptic active zone protein that can be manipulated to enhance axon regeneration without sacrificing the function of the repaired axons.

                Acquired spatial representations are not static. Each re-exposure to the spatial environment stimulates retrieval of the stored experience followed by information re-encoding, including updating if the environment has changed. It remains unclear if the same neurons are involved in these three events. Here, we used a multiplexed fluorescence in situ hybridization(FISH) approach that detected time-locked nuclear immediate early gene(IEG) expression to identify hippocampal neuronal ensembles that were engaged in the acquisition of a spatial representation, as well as its subsequent stabilization and/or updating. Responses were assessed in distal(dCA1) and proximal CA1(pCA1) of male rats. Homer1a was used to detect neuronal recruitment triggered by novel learning of a holeboard environment(HB). cFos and Arc expression was used to detect ensemble stability and/or expansion, or ensemble remodeling, respectively, that was triggered by animal exposure to the now familiar HB that included novel objects(HBO) 25min after the initial HB exposure. Novel HB exposure resulted in nuclear Homer1a expression in both dCA1 and pCA1. Subsequent HBO triggered significant cFos and Arc expression only in dCA1. IEG co-labelling (Homer1a/cFos, Homer1a/Arc and Homer1a/cFos/Arc) was also only evident in dCA1, reflecting both re-iteration and remodeling of dCA1, but not pCA1 ensembles. In sum, we show that the contiguous acquisition and updating of spatial representations recruits distinct populations of CA1-neurons reflecting ensemble selection and stabilization, as well as ensemble remodeling. Moreover, whereas dCA1 and pCA1 are involved in the acquisition of the original spatial representation, only dCA1 is engaged in representation updating related to changes in spatial content information.

">Genome-wide analysis reveals pathways important for the development and maturation of excitatory synaptic connections to GABAergic neurons</a></h4>

              
                A high degree of cell and circuit-specific regulation has presented challenges for efforts to precisely define molecular mechanisms controlling synapse formation and maturation. Here, we pursue an unbiased forward genetic approach to identify C. elegans genes involved in the formation and maturation of cholinergic synaptic connections with GABAergic motor neurons as indicated by the distribution of GFP-tagged postsynaptic AChRs in GABAergic dendrites. We identified mutations in 3 genes that identify key processes in synapse/circuit maturation: postsynaptic receptor assembly, cargo trafficking, and synapse structural organization. Mutation of the RUN domain (RPIP8, UNC-14, and NESCA) cargo adaptor unc-14 dramatically impacted both dendritic spines and overall GABAergic neuron morphology. In contrast, mutation of the nicotinic acetylcholine alpha subunit unc-63 caused a failure in AChR assembly in GABAergic neurons but did not significantly alter dendritic spine structure or abundance. Notably, specific expression of wild type unc-14 cDNA in either GABAergic neurons or presynaptic cholinergic neurons was not sufficient to rescue the unc-14 mutant phenotype while pan neuronal expression provided significant rescue, indicating that disruptions in GABAergic neuron morphology arise from compound effects. Finally, we obtained a mutation in the Liprin-; synaptic scaffold syd-2 that produces a stop codon in a C-terminal SAM domain and has severe effects on dendritic spines and AChR localization. Our unbiased strategy identified key genes that implicate three distinct cellular processes important for synapse/circuit development and maturation. The identification of these genes from our screen highlights how mechanisms for receptor assembly, cargo trafficking and synapse structural organization each contribute to circuit connectivity.

">Intravital Multimodal Imaging of Human Cortical Organoids for Chronic Stroke Treatment in Mice</a></h4>

              
                Chronic stroke leads to enduring neurological deficits and remains a major clinical challenge. Human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived cortical organoids (COs) offer promise for regenerative therapies, yet their application in chronic stroke remains understudied, in part due to limited tools for monitoring graft in vivo. Here, we present a Multimodal Imaging Platform for Organoid Tracking (MIPOT), which integrates MRI, bioluminescence imaging, light microscopy, and two-photon fluorescence microscopy to noninvasively track transplanted COs in the post-stroke brain over time. Using MIPOT, we verified precise delivery of COs into cleaned stroke cavities, observed progressive declines in viability within the first 10 days, and introduced labeling methods for functional in vivo tracking of COs at subcellular resolution. By 4 weeks post-transplantation, histological analysis revealed survival of COs in the cerebral cortex. Notably, COs engrafted into the hippocampus displayed enhanced maturation, underscoring the role of local microenvironments in graft integration. MIPOT enables dynamic, noninvasive evaluation of hiPSC COs in chronic stroke, providing a foundation for mechanistic studies and translational development of organoid-based therapies.

">Progressive Remodeling of Global Protein Interaction Networks in a Mouse Model of Tauopathy</a></h4>

              
                Neurodegenerative disease is marked not just by loss of proteins or cells, but by dynamic rewiring of macromolecular interaction networks that precede and drive pathology. Here, we present the first temporally resolved, systems-scale map of multi-protein complex remodeling in a tauopathy model, integrating cofractionation mass spectrometry, quantitative phosphoproteomics, and machine learning to decode phosphorylation-dependent shifts in protein interactomes across disease progression. This interactomic atlas identifies functionally validated assemblies, including MAPT::Dpysl2 and Cyfip1::actin complexes that modulate early disease phenotypes in vivo. By revealing how phosphorylation tunes macromolecular complex architecture and function, this work reframes tauopathy as a disease of dynamic network instability, and establishes a generalizable framework for early detection and mechanistic dissection of neurodegeneration.

">Neuromodulation of Swarming Behavior in C. elegans: Insights into the Conserved role of Calsyntenins</a></h4>

              
                Collective animal behaviors arise from a complex interplay between internal physiological states and external environmental cues. In Caenorhabditis elegans, favorable conditions promote dispersal, while stressors like food scarcity or overcrowding trigger aggregation. Here, we describe a distinct behavior termed as swarming, where C. elegans move and feed in aggregates despite abundant food availability. While environmental factors have been implicated in this behavior, the underlying genetic and molecular mechanisms remain unclear. We identify a novel role for the conserved calsyntenin protein CASY-1 in regulating swarming. Through genetic, behavioral, and optogenetic approaches, we show that CASY-1 functions in sensory neurons to modulate the neuropeptide pigment-dispersing factor (PDF) signaling. Mutants in casy-1 show impaired PDF-1 signaling and reduced inhibition of the serotonin pathway, a known regulator of social behaviors. This dysregulation, along with its associated mechanosensory and foraging defects, likely contributes to the swarming phenotype. Our findings reveal a putative neuromodulatory pathway critical for swarming behavior in C. elegans.

">Cerebrospinal fluid-driven ependymal motile cilia defects are implicated in multiple sclerosis pathophysiology</a></h4>

              
                Background: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurodegenerative autoimmune disorder of the central nervous system (CNS) in which autoreactive immune cells migrate through a damaged blood brain barrier, resulting in focal demyelinating lesions of both the white and grey matter. Of increasing interest is the repeated observation that beyond focal lesions, there are also diffuse, surface-in gradients of pathology in MS, wherein damage is most severe directly adjacent to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-contacting surfaces, such as the subpial and periventricular areas. This observation suggests that toxic factors within MS CSF may be contributing to the emergence and/or evolution of surface-in gradients. Directly separating the CSF from the periventricular parenchyma are ependymal cells - a glial epithelium that are equipped with tufts of motile cilia which are critical for circulating CSF solutes and regulating local fluid flow. While damage to ependymal cilia has the potential to drastically modify CSF homeostasis and thus contribute to the damage of CSF exposed regions, these motile cellular structures have yet to be investigated in the context of MS. Methods: We first conducted single cell RNA sequencing of fresh human periventricular brain tissue containing ependymal cells from MS patients and non-MS disease controls. We subsequently collected CSF from MS patients and exposed cultured rodent ependymal cells to this CSF in order to evaluate impact on ependymal ciliary function. To complement our direct evaluation of cilia in the context of MS, we also confirmed whether cilia were altered in a classic animal model of MS, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), and also designed a novel transgenic animal model to evaluate the cellular and behavioural effect(s) of adult ependymal ciliary disruption. Results: Single cell RNA sequencing analysis of human ependymal cells in MS demonstrated largescale dysregulation of ciliary genes and in situ stains of MS brain tissue confirmed a loss of ependymal cilia. Exposure of ependymal cells to MS CSF led to transcriptional modification of ciliary gene and protein expression and reduced ciliary beating frequency. Likewise, analysis of ependymal cells in EAE also demonstrated altered cilia gene and protein expression. Conditional knockout in adult mice, of the critical cilia-associated gene Ccdc39 in ependymal cells led to transient ventricular enlargement, increased periventricular microglial density, and alterations in nesting behaviour. Conclusion: These data suggest that motile cilia in ependymal cells are dysregulated in CNS autoimmunity. More importantly, however, they provide evidence to suggest that ependymal cilia disruption could play an active role in the development of periventricular pathology in MS and can lead to behavioural deficits that may underlie aspects of non-motor MS symptomatology.

">Sensory-evoked perturbational complexity in human EEG: Effects of stimulus temperature and peripheral sensitisation in nociceptive processing</a></h4>

              
                The perturbational complexity index (PCI), grounded in systems dynamic and information theory, quantifies the brain's capacity for differentiation and integration of neural activity. While it has been used to characterise consciousness states following transcranial magnetic stimulation, its responsiveness to sensory perturbations remains underexplored. Here, using two publicly available datasets, we computed state-transition PCI from thermal-evoked responses recorded over 3264 scalp channels. Dataset 1 combined three stimulus intensities (10{degrees}C, 42{degrees}C, 60{degrees}C) with topical application of thermosensitive TRP; channel agonists (menthol 20%, capsaicin 1%) or vehicle; Dataset 2 manipulated the block wise transition probability of receiving cold (15{degrees}C) or hot (58{degrees}C) stimulation. PCI scaled non-linearly with temperature, being lowest at the intermediate 42{degrees}C and highest at the cold and hot extremes (Datasets 1 and 2). PCI was sensitive both to peripheral sensitisation, as topical menthol and capsaicin selectively reduced PCI during cold stimulation (Dataset 1), and to changes in block-wise stimulus probability (Dataset 2). Across all analyses, classical ERP peak measures (N2-P2 amplitude/latency) failed to explain PCI variance. These findings demonstrate that sensory-evoked PCI reflects the brain's response to exogenous, sensory-driven perturbations, quantifying changes in neural complexity associated with both stimulus intensity, peripheral sensitisation and probabilistic manipulations. This supports its broader applicability as a measure of temporal and spatial differentiation in the domain of sensory and pain neuroscience.

">Discourse Focus and Memory Encoding: The Role of Trial-Level Alpha Power</a></h4>

              
                The rapid, continuous flow of spoken language places strong demands on attention, and it is thought that listeners meet these demands by predicting when important information will occur and allocating attention accordingly. However, to date there is little direct evidence for the involvement of preparatory attention during language processing. In this study, we investigate preparatory attention during spoken language comprehension by measuring alpha neural activity with EEG, a known measure of temporal attentional preparation. Alpha activity leading up to target words that were either focused or defocused by a preceding discourse question did not vary as a function of focus, challenging the assumption that attention is pre-allocated to the timing of focused words. On the other hand, we found that trial-by-trial fluctuations in alpha activity predicted both the depth of processing and the subsequent memory for new information. Specifically, pre-target alpha modulated a centro-parietal Dm subsequent memory effect for focused words, linking preparatory attention to memory encoding during comprehension. Together, these findings bridge psycholinguistic studies on information structure and cognitive neuroscience research on temporal attention, offering novel insights into the role of alpha activity in attentional dynamics during spoken language processing.

">Eccentric cycling enhances primary motor cortex excitability</a></h4>

              
                Acute aerobic exercise (AAE) can modulate primary motor cortex (M1) excitability. To date, studies evaluating the effects of AAE on M1 excitability have focused almost exclusively on concentric cycling. Interestingly, eccentric cycling increases frontal-parietal brain activation more than concentric cycling. Critically, we recently found eccentric AAE enhances motor learning more than concentric AAE. Yet, the M1 excitability mechanisms underlying these effects remain unknown. Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of eccentric cycling AAE on M1 excitability using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Thirty adults performed three 20 min-conditions: i) eccentric cycling AAE, ii) concentric cycling AAE, and iii) rest. Cycling AAE was carried out at a workload corresponding to 70% of peak heart rate (%HRpeak) measured during concentric incremental cycling exercise. TMS assessments were conducted before (Pre), immediately (Post0) and 20 minutes after (Post20) AAE/rest to evaluate changes in corticospinal excitability (CSE) and short interval-intracortical inhibition (SICI). We found CSE increased and SICI decreased at Post20 following eccentric and concentric cycling AAE compared to rest. Also, %HRpeak, muscle pain and perceived effort were lower during eccentric cycling AAE compared to concentric cycling AAE. Our results showed that eccentric cycling impacted M1 excitability change to a comparable degree as concentric cycling, while requiring less cardiovascular response, eliciting less muscle pain and lower perceived effort. Taken together, our results suggest that eccentric cycling AAE may be a valuable intervention to modulate M1 excitability for populations with limited cardiovascular capacity and have potential implications in clinical and sports-related contexts.

">Realistic coupling enables flexible macroscopic traveling waves in the mouse cortex</a></h4>

              
                Traveling waves are ubiquitous in neuronal systems across different spatial scales. While microscopic and mesoscopic waves are relatively well studied, the mechanisms underlying the emergence of macroscopic traveling waves remain less understood. Here, by modeling the mouse cortex using spatial transcriptomic and connectivity data, we show that realistic cortical connectivity can generate a significantly higher level of macroscopic traveling waves than local and uniform connectivity. By quantifying the traveling waves in the 3-D domain, we discovered that the level of macroscopic traveling waves depends not only on the network connectivity but also non-monotonically depends on the coupling strength between neurons in the network. We also found that slow oscillations (0.5 - 4 Hz) are more likely to form large-scale, macroscopic traveling waves than other faster oscillations in the network with realistic connectivity. Together, our work shows how flexible macroscopic traveling waves can emerge in the mouse cortex and offers a computational framework to further study traveling waves in the mouse brain at the single-cell level.

">Reframing Sleep Architecture: A Compositional and Temporal Approach to Sleep Data Analysis</a></h4>

              
                Significant progress has been made in developing sleep staging methodologies; however, less attention has been devoted to the analysis of sleep architecture. Two critical aspects remain underexplored: the choice of binning window (i.e., grouping data into time intervals) and the statistical treatment of the interdependencies among sleep phases. While one-hour bins are commonly used, this choice is often based on convention rather than empirical justification. Additionally, sleep architecture data are typically expressed as proportions of time spent in each sleep phase, forming compositional datasets, non-negative values that represent parts of a whole and are constrained by a constant sum (e.g., 100%). Such data violate the assumptions of traditional statistical methods, yet their compositional nature is often overlooked, compromising analytical validity. In this study, we address two key methodological challenges in sleep architecture analysis: (1) determining the optimal binning window through a data-driven approach that balances information retention and noise reduction, and (2) applying isometric log-ratio (ILR) transformation to account for the compositional structure of the data, enabling the use of conventional statistical tests. By addressing these issues, we propose a more rigorous and interpretable framework for analyzing sleep architecture, aiming to enhance the accuracy and reproducibility of findings in sleep research.

">Dissociating the Effects of Light at Night from Circadian Misalignment in a Neurodevelopmental Disorder Mouse Model Using Ultradian Light-Dark Cycles.</a></h4>

              
                Individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) often experience sleep disturbances and are frequently exposed to light during nighttime hours. Our previous studies using the Cntnap2 knockout (KO) mouse model of NDDs demonstrated that nighttime light exposure increases behaviors such as excessive grooming, reduces social interactions, and disrupts daily locomotor rhythms. To further evaluate the effects of nighttime light exposure, we exposed wild-type (WT) and Cntnap2 KO mice to an ultradian lighting cycle (T7), which alternates 3.5 hours of light and 3.5 hours of darkness. Circadian rhythms in activity, corticosterone levels, and clock gene expression are maintained under T7 lighting despite the presence of light during the usual night phase, whilst animals display increased depressive-like behaviors and reduce performance on the novel object recognition test. Based on these observations, we hypothesized that T7 lighting would mimic the impact of nighttime light exposure seen in standard light-dark cycles with dim light at night (DLaN). However, in this study, adult WT and Cntnap2 KO mice held under the T7 cycle did not show the increased grooming behavior or reduced social interaction observed in Cntnap2 KO mice exposed to DLaN. Regarding locomotor activity rhythms, the T7 cycle lengthened the circadian period and weakened the rhythm amplitude but did not abolish rhythmicity in either genotype. Finally, opposite to DLaN, neither the T7 cycle nor constant darkness (DD) elicited an increase in cFos expression in the basolateral amygdala in WT and KO mice. These results demonstrate that the adverse behavioral and neurobiological effects of nighttime light exposure in a model of a neurodevelopmental disorder depend on circadian disruption rather than light exposure alone, highlighting the importance of circadian stability as a protective factor in NDDS.

">Differential encoding of social identity, valence and unfamiliarity in the amygdala and piriform cortex</a></h4>

              
                To appropriately respond to social situations, animals must rapidly identify conspecifics as individuals, gauge their familiarity and recall any good or bad associations. In previous work (Mazuski & OKeefe, 2022), we characterized populations of neurons in the basolateral amygdala complex (BLA) that were strongly tuned to social conspecifics. In this current study, we asked whether these or other populations in the BLA encode properties necessary for social interaction: individual recognition, familiarity detection and reward association. In addition to cells in the rat lateral amygdala (LA) and basolateral amygdala (BLA), we recorded from cells in the anatomically-related piriform cortex (PIR) to see how much of the amygdala response was inherited from this input. Here, we show that these three interrelated areas encode distinct features of social conspecifics at the population and single neuron level. We recorded from large populations of neurons using 4-shank Neuropixels probes while rats learned a social discrimination task, where one male conspecific was paired with a food reward (S+) and the other its absence (S-). For comparison, two unfamiliar animals were presented on occasional probe trials. After successful discrimination learning, we looked for transfer effects to our previously studied task where implanted rats freely interacted with all four conspecifics in an open-field environment. The LA dynamically encoded social reward learning. Initially, LA neuronal population activity could not distinguish between the S+ and S- conspecifics, but after learning distinct representations emerged. In contrast, the PIR showed no effect of social reward learning. Single PIR units encoded social identity with strong tuning to individual conspecifics both before and after learning. The BLA encoded both reward learning and social identity suggesting this is where the PIR and LA information streams converge. Unexpectedly, the BLA and LA strongly coded for the unfamiliarity of the rat - single neurons responded to the probe trial animals with firing rates 2-5x higher than to the task animals. This cross-region encoding of identity, reward and unfamiliarity was reactivated during social interaction in the new open-field environment, demonstrating that the learning was not context specific. The results throw light on how distinct neural circuits contribute to social recognition and memory and how they interact with each other.

">The c-Src inhibitor eCF506 diminishes opioid tolerance creating bias against β-arrestin2 recruitment</a></h4>

              
                Opioids reduce severe pain, but persistent use is compromised by tolerance, attenuated by either {beta}-arrestin2 depletion, prompting development of biased opioids limited by partial efficacy, or c-Src kinase inhibitors, potentially acting through off-target effects. We tested eCF506, a conformationally selective c-Src inhibitor, on morphine antinociception and examined its effect on  receptor signaling and {beta}-arrestin2 recruitment. Oral eCF506 inhibited morphine tolerance in C57BL/6J mice. Exposure of PathHunter CHO cells to eCF506 did not affect inhibition of cAMP accumulation by the  agonist, DAMGO, but reduced {beta}-arrestin2 recruitment. This effect, mimicked by targeted degradation of c-Src, occurred through inhibition of c-Src catalytic function as evidenced by its diminution by the catalytically inactive Src250-536(K298M) construct. This mutant also restricted the effect of c-Src inhibitors on {beta}-arrestin2 recruitment. eCF506 additionally increased surface expression of  receptors and limited their internalization by endomorphin-2 but did not alter DAMGO-evoked GRK-mediated receptor phosphorylation. These findings suggest that eCF506 prolongs opioid antinociception by inducing signalling bias, diminishing {beta}-arrestin2-mediated  receptor regulation.

">Electrocorticographic Detection of Speech Networks in Glioma-infiltrated Cortex</a></h4>

              
                Direct cortical stimulation (DCS) is the clinical gold standard for identifying functional cortex in the human brain, which is essential for the safe removal of brain lesions. Defining the electro-physiological properties of DCS-positive cortical regions may facilitate the identification of critical language regions, thereby permitting safe glioma resections in communities without access. Leveraging a multicenter electrophysiologic dataset of DCS-positive language regions spatially matched with subdural arrays, we analyzed regions identified as functionally critical (DCS+) versus functionally non-critical (DCS-) during intraoperative language mapping. In IDH-mutant gliomas, DCS+ regions exhibited significantly greater speech-related neural activity and enhanced encoding and decoding of linguistic and semantic features. We demonstrate that resting-state classifiers distinguish DCS+ from DCS- regions in IDH-mutant tumors. Task-based and resting-state electrophysiologic distinctions were pathology-specific and not present in IDH-wildtype glioblastomas. These findings may accelerate DCS mapping by guiding surgeons to priority regions, improving efficiency, and patient outcomes.

">Progressive Supranuclear Palsy PERK haplotype B selectively translates DLX1 promoting tau toxicity</a></h4>

              
                The unfolded protein response sensor PERK exists in haplotypes A and B. PERK-B confers increased risk for tauopathies like progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), but the mechanisms distinguishing its function from PERK-A and contributing to its association with tauopathy remain unknown. Here, we developed a controlled cellular model for a pair-wise comparison of the two PERK haplotypes, finding their UPR functions nearly indistinguishable. However, a careful examination employing puromycin-based proteomics revealed that a subset of mRNA translation events were permissible under PERK-B, but not PERK-A, dependent UPR. One of the targets that escaped PERK-B suppression was the transcription factor DLX1, which is genetically linked to PSP risk. We found that DLX1 solubility shifted in human PSP brain tissue. Furthermore, silencing the fly homolog of DLX1 was sufficient to decrease tau-induced toxicity, in vivo. Our results detail the haplotype-specific PERK-B/DLX-1 pathway as a novel driver of tau pathology in cells, flies, and likely human brain, revealing new insights into PSP pathogenesis and potential therapeutic targets.

                Introduction This scoping review aims to map the current status, challenges, and best practices in translating health sciences curricula into indigenous languages in Sub-Saharan Africa. While learning in one’s native language enhances comprehension and retention, there is limited synthesis of translation practices in the region. The review will examine which indigenous languages are represented in curricula, what aspects of the curricula have been translated, and the methodologies employed in translation efforts. Methods The review will follow the JBI methodology for scoping reviews and adhere to the PRISMA-ScR guidelines. Relevant literature will be sourced from MEDLINE, EMBASE, ERIC, African Journals Online (AJOL), and African Index Medicus, alongside gray literature from organizational websites and government repositories. Three independent reviewers will screen titles, abstracts, and full texts, with data extracted using a customized form aligned with the research questions. The analysis will identify patterns, trends, and gaps in current translation practices. Results This review will provide insights for educational institutions, policymakers, and researchers, offering recommendations for improving healthcare education accessibility in Sub-Saharan Africa. It will inform evidence-based guidelines for curriculum translation and highlight areas for further research. Discussion Understanding translation practices and identifying challenges will support efforts to enhance the delivery of healthcare education and reduce health disparities in indigenous communities. The findings will help inform policy and practice aimed at improving health education access, cultural inclusivity, and the overall effectiveness of health curricula in the region. The scoping review has been registered on OSF: https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/AU2SD

                Introduction Autoimmune diseases often require long-term management and significantly affect patients’ physical and mental health. Conventional management strategies emphasize disease control and symptom relief, notwithstanding, the integration of positive health models such as the flourishing framework remains underexplored. Objective This protocol outlines a scoping review aimed to map and analyze how the flourishing framework has been applied in research and practice in autoimmune context. Methods Following the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) methodology for scoping reviews and the PRISMA-ScR guidelines, we will systematically search across multiple databases, including MEDLINE, Scopus, CINAHL, and PsycINFO. Studies will be screened using predetermined eligibility criteria. Data will be extracted and charted using a standardize form and will be analyzed narratively by presenting key characteristics and thematic trends. Conclusion The findings from this scoping review will provide a foundational insight into how flourishing is conceptualized, measured, and applied in the context of autoimmune disease. Thus, informing future research and integrative care models.

                Background Disability is widely acknowledged as a major contributor to depression, which is a prevalent mental health condition that profoundly affects individuals, especially those with visual impairments. Objectives This develops a protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis aim to examine the prevalence and incidence of depression among visually impaired people globally. Methods This systematic review and meta-analysis will be conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA-P) guidelines. A thorough search will be conducted using the PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and ProQuest databases to identify relevant studies published between January 1, 2011, and August 31, 2024, without limitations on language. Two out of three independent reviewers will screen the abstracts and full-text articles, extract data, and assess the risk of bias. Heterogeneity among the included studies will be evaluated individually. Meta-analysis of the pooled prevalence and incidence estimates will be conducted using the metaprop function in StataBE 18.0. Publication bias will be assessed through funnel plot analysis and Egger’s test. Conclusion This protocol defines the planned scope and methodology for a forthcoming systematic review and meta-analysis, which aims to provide updated evidence on the prevalence and incidence of depression among individuals with visual impairment. Accordingly, it will facilitate a systematic review and meta-analysis to address the existing research gap by providing precise estimates of the pooled prevalence and incidence of depression in this population. The findings will offer valuable insights to inform public health policy, advocate for further research, and underscore the critical need to prioritize the mental health concerns of individuals with visual impairment. Systematic review registration The protocol has been registered on the Open Science Framework (OSF) Registries with the Registration DOI: 10.17605/OSF.IO/6J4Y2.

                Background There is an ongoing need to develop diverse career paths that support the vital contributions of staff scientists, research engineers, scientific officers, and other knowledge professionals in scientific discovery. Research infrastructures and core facilities have a particular need to support sustainable and diverse careers, as they either employ – if being a legal entity – or daily manage research professionals in a broad variety of roles to enable resources, services, and innovation. Methods In 2019, a survey of the facility staff at SciLifeLab, a large national research infrastructure in Sweden, led to a recommendation for universities to develop career paths for their staff scientists. Five years later, we have conducted a survey and workshop to determine current views of infrastructure staff on career path diversity in Sweden. Results Our results indicate there is a strong need for clarity and communication about planning and implementation of career path structures at Swedish universities, as well as opportunities to foster excellence in infrastructure staff. While the workshop participants ranked Sweden as a stable and attractive place to work and reported continuous development of their technical and service skills, the lack of recognition of this expertise presents a barrier to a sustainable career. Conclusions We conclude that there is a need to continue advocating for increased clarity and diversity in career paths for staff scientists in Sweden, and raise the views presented by infrastructure staff on the challenges and opportunities unique to their roles.

<p>Curumin exerted neuroprotective and anti-epileptic effects through the PPARγ/PTEN/Akt pathway.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Chronic epilepsy is mainly characterized by spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRS). The peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma/phosphatase and tensin homolog/protein kinase B (PPARγ/PTEN/Akt) pathway is involved in the pathogenesis of SRS and neuronal loss. Curcumin is a natural compound, and previous studies have shown it provides neuroprotection via anti-inflammation and anti-oxidant effects in many central nervous system (CNS) diseases. In the present study, we show that curcumin regulates the abnormal expression of PTEN and Akt in the SRS phase, improves the neuronal loss in the hippocampus, and suppresses SRS development and seizure spike activity in epileptic rats. More importantly, these effects are reversed by the PPARγ antagonist, T0070907, suggesting that curcumin exerts neuroprotective and anti-epileptic effects through the PPARγ/PTEN/Akt signaling pathway. Other studies have shown that curcumin can cross the BBB and has a safety profiles and pleiotropic pharmacological effects. Thus, our data support the proposition that curcumin might be a potential neuroprotective and anti-epileptic agent for chronic epilepsy.</p>

                Background Early and accurate prediction of Ischemic Heart Disease (IHD) is critical to reducing cardiovascular mortality through timely intervention. While deep learning (DL) models have shown promise in disease prediction, many lack interpretability, generalizability, and fairness—particularly when deployed across demographically diverse populations. These shortcomings limit clinical adoption and risk reinforcing healthcare disparities. Methods This study proposes a novel model: X-TLRABiLSTM (Explainable Transfer Learning–based Residual Attention Bidirectional LSTM). The architecture integrates transfer learning from pre-trained cardiovascular models into a BiLSTM framework with residual attention layers to improve temporal feature extraction and convergence. To ensure transparency, the model incorporates SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to quantify the contribution of each clinical feature to the final prediction. Additionally, a demographic reweighting strategy is applied to the training process to reduce bias across subgroups defined by age, gender, and ethnicity. The model was evaluated on the UCI Heart Disease dataset using 10-fold cross-validation. Results The X-TLRABiLSTM model achieved a classification accuracy of 98.2%, with an F1-score of 98.1% and an AUC of 99.1%, outperforming standard ML classifiers and state-of-the-art DL baselines. SHAP-based interpretability analysis highlighted clinically relevant predictors such as chest pain type, ST depression, and thalassemia. Fairness evaluation revealed minimal performance disparity across demographic subgroups, with F1-score gaps ≤ 0.6% and error rate gaps ≤ 0.4%. Confusion matrix analysis demonstrated low false-positive and false-negative rates, reinforcing the model’s reliability for clinical deployment. Conclusions X-TLRABiLSTM offers a highly accurate, interpretable, and demographically fair framework for IHD prognosis. By combining transfer learning, residual attention, explainable AI, and fairness-aware optimization, this model advances trustworthy AI in healthcare. Its successful performance on benchmark clinical data supports its potential for real-world integration in ethical, AI-assisted cardiovascular diagnostics.

                Chen et al. demonstrate that B cells imprinted by ancestral SARS-CoV-2 have tremendous potential to develop neutralizing breadth and potency in repeated immune recalls driven by Omicron variants, supporting that ancestral SARS-CoV-2 immune imprinting can be harnessed in developing pan-SARS-CoV-2 and even cross-sarbecovirus vaccines.

                Feng et al. determine high-resolution cryo-EM structures of KP.3.1.1 and other mutant spike proteins and find that an S31 deletion introduces N30 glycosylation. They demonstrate that S31 deletion and N30 glycosylation do not affect the spike conformation, hACE2 binding, and antibody RBD binding but do knock out some antibody NTD binding.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104164">Drosophila hamlet mediates epithelial tissue assembly of the reproductive system</a></h4>

              
                Epithelial tissue fusion requires coordinated molecular events at the ends of two epithelial structures. Regulatory mechanisms controlling these events remain largely elusive. In the <i>Drosophila</i> reproductive system (RS), this fusion unites the gonad and the genital disc-derived tissues, into a continuous tube. This study unveils the pivotal role of Hamlet (Ham), a <i>Drosophila</i> PR domain containing transcription factor, in orchestrating epithelial tissue fusion in the RS. Loss of <i>ham</i> leads to sterility and disconnection between the testes and seminal vesicles. Systematic analysis of Ham downstream genes reveals cytoskeletal, metabolic regulators and signaling pathway components. Ham activates genes for epithelial differentiation and remodeling, while repressing genes required for tissue growth and patterning. Using multiplexed in situ hybridization, we demonstrate spatial–temporal gene expression dynamics in contacting epithelia. Key Ham downstream effectors include E-Cadherin (E-Cad), Toll (Tl), and Wnt2 signaling pathways, regulating tissue interaction and fusion. Our findings present a comprehensive gene network crucial for heterotypic epithelial tissue fusion. Mammalian Ham orthologs PRDM3 and PRDM16 are highly expressed in epithelial tissues, suggesting a conserved role across species.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88174">Cestode larvae excite host neuronal circuits via glutamatergic signalling</a></h4>

              
                Neurocysticercosis (NCC) is caused by infection of the brain by larvae of the parasitic cestode <i>Taenia solium</i>. It is the most prevalent parasitic infection of the central nervous system and one of the leading causes of adult-acquired epilepsy worldwide. However, little is known about how cestode larvae affect neurons directly. To address this, we used whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology and calcium imaging in rodent and human brain slices to identify direct effects of cestode larval products on neuronal activity. We found that both whole cyst homogenate and excretory/secretory products of cestode larvae have an acute excitatory effect on neurons, which can trigger seizure-like events <i>in vitro</i>. This effect was mediated by glutamate receptor activation but not by nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, acid-sensing ion channels, or Substance P. Glutamate-sensing fluorescent reporters (iGluSnFR) and amino acid assays revealed that the larval homogenate of the cestodes <i>Taenia crassiceps</i> and <i>Taenia solium</i> contained high concentrations of the amino acids glutamate and aspartate. Furthermore, we found that larvae of both species consistently produce and release these excitatory amino acids into their immediate environment. Our findings suggest that perturbations in glutamatergic signalling may play a role in seizure generation in NCC.

                During root nodule symbiosis (RNS), cell-division activity is reinitiated and sustained in the root cortex to create a hospitable cellular niche. Such a temporary and spatially confined site is required to render host cells compatible with the intracellular progression of rhizobia. Although it has been suggested that early infection events might involve a pre-mitotic cell-cycle arrest, this process has not been dissected with cellular resolution. Here, we show that a dual-color <i>Medicago</i> histone reporter robustly identifies cells with different mitotic or endoreduplication activities in the root cortex. By imaging deep root tissues, we found that a confined trajectory of cortical cells that are transcellularly passed by infection threads is in a stage of the cell cycle that is distinct from directly adjacent cells. Distinctive features of infected cells include nuclear widening and large-scale chromatin rearrangements consistent with a cell-cycle exit prior to differentiation. Using a combination of fluorescent reporters demarcating cell-cycle phase progression, we confirmed that a reduced proliferation potential and modulating the G2/M transition, a process possibly controlled by the NF-YA1 transcription factor, mark the success of rhizobial delivery to nodule cells.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98634">Multifaceted role of galanin in brain excitability</a></h4>

              
                Galanin is a neuropeptide, which is critically involved in homeostatic processes like controlling arousal, sleep, and regulation of stress. This extensive range of functions aligns with implications of galanin in diverse pathologies, including anxiety disorders, depression, and epilepsy. Here, we investigated the regulatory function of galanin on whole-brain activity in larval zebrafish using wide-field Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging. Combining this with genetic perturbations of galanin signaling and pharmacologically increasing neuronal activity, we are able to probe actions of galanin across the entire brain. Our findings demonstrate that under unperturbed conditions and during epileptic seizures, galanin exerts a sedative influence on the brain, primarily through the galanin receptor 1 a (<i>galr1a</i>). However, exposure to acute stressors like pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) compromises galanin’s sedative effects, leading to overactivation of the brain and increased seizure occurrence. Interestingly, galanin’s impact on seizures appears to be bidirectional, as it can both decrease seizure severity and increase seizure occurrence, potentially through different galanin receptor subtypes. This nuanced interplay between galanin and various physiological processes underscores its significance in modulating stress-related pathways and suggests its potential implications for neurological disorders such as epilepsy. Taken together, our data sheds light on a multifaceted role of galanin, where galanin regulates whole-brain activity but also shapes acute responses to stress.

However, the role of structural plasticity as a homeostatic mechanism remains less consistently reported, particularly under activity inhibition, leading to an incomplete understanding of its functional impact. In this study, we combined live-cell microscopy of eGFP-labeled neurons in mouse organotypic entorhinal-hippocampal tissue cultures (Thy1-eGFP mice of both sexes) with computational modeling to investigate how synapse-number-based structural plasticity responds to activity perturbations and interacts with homeostatic synaptic scaling. Tracking individual dendritic segments, we found that inhibiting excitatory neurotransmission does not monotonically regulate dendritic spine density. Specifically, inhibition of AMPA receptors with 200 nM 2,3-dioxo-6-nitro-7-sulfamoyl-benzo[f]quinoxaline (NBQX) increased spine density, whereas complete AMPA receptor blockade with 50 μM NBQX reduced it. Motivated by these findings, we developed network simulations incorporating a biphasic structural plasticity rule governing activity-dependent synapse formation. These simulations showed that the biphasic rule maintains neural activity homeostasis under stimulation and permits either synapse formation or synapse loss depending on the degree of activity deprivation. Homeostatic synaptic scaling further modulated recurrent connectivity, network activity, and structural plasticity outcomes. It reduced stimulation-triggered synapse loss by downscaling synaptic weights and rescued silencing-induced synapse loss by upscaling recurrent input, thus reactivating silent neurons. The interaction between these mechanisms provides a mechanistic explanation for divergent findings in the literature. In summary, homeostatic synaptic scaling and homeostatic structural plasticity dynamically compete and compensate for each other, ensuring efficient and robust control of firing rate homeostasis.

">Natural gradient Bayesian sampling: an innate algorithm emerges in canonical cortical circuits</a></h4>

              
                Accumulating evidence suggests the canonical cortical circuit, consisting of excitatory (E) and diverse classes of inhibitory (I) interneurons, implement sampling-based Bayesian inference to compute stimulus posteriors. However, most of the identified sampling algorithms in the circuit are still simpler than the nonlinear circuit dynamics. Through comprehensive theoretical analyses of the nonlinear circuit dynamics, we discover the canonical circuit dynamics innately implements natural gradient Bayesian sampling, which is an advanced sampling algorithm that adaptively adjusts the sampling step size based on the local geometry of stimulus posteriors measured by Fisher information. Specifically, the nonlinear circuit dynamics can implement natural gradient Langevin and Hamiltonian sampling of uni- and multi-variate stimulus posteriors, and these algorithms can be switched by interneurons. We also find that the non-equilibrium circuit dynamics when transitioning from the resting to evoked state can further accelerate natural gradient sampling, and analytically identify the neural circuit's annealing strategy. Remarkably, we identify the approximated computational strategies employed in the circuit dynamics, which even resemble the ones widely used in machine learning. Our work provides an overarching connection between canonical circuit dynamics and advanced sampling algorithms, deepening our understanding of the circuit algorithms of Bayesian sampling.

In this study, we investigated whether structural and functional connectivity between and within the attention networks, thalamus, and early visual areas is differentially associated with performance on a conjunction search task in participants with CVI as compared to controls. Data from 26 participants was collected and analyzed (10 CVI, four female, 17.4 years, 5.38 s.d., 16 control, 10 female, 22.25 years, 4.25 s.d.). White matter tracts associated with the dorsal and ventral attention networks as well as structural and functional connectivity matrices of the dorsal and ventral attention networks were generated for each participant. Group differences in conjunction search outcomes, tract volume, and network connectivity strength were evaluated. General linear models were used to investigate the relationship between neuroimaging predictor variables and each of the four conjunction search primary outcomes. All analyses were adjusted for age and verbal cognition. In the CVI group impaired visual search was associated with weaker structural and stronger functional connectivity, while in the control group the opposite effect was observed. Together, these results suggest that functional over-recruitment may be a maladaptive compensatory mechanism.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Agreement and disagreement are essential brain processes that enable effective communication and decision-making. However, a clear neurophysiological framework explaining their organization is still lacking. The present study aimed to identify EEG correlates of implicit agreement and disagreement, developing a novel experimental paradigm to model these internal responses. Participants were tasked with mentally responding to binary (“yes” or “no”) questions and evaluating the accuracy of a computer system’s attempts to “guess” their responses. Event-related potentials (ERP) revealed distinct patterns associated with agreement and disagreement in two key contexts: when participants read the final word of a question and when they observed the computer’s “guess.” Disagreement, compared to agreement, elicited larger ERP amplitudes, specifically an enhanced N400 component in the first context and increased feedback-related negativity in the second. Considering the associations of these ERP components with cognitive processes, this research offers robust evidence linking agreement and disagreement to the brain’s effort in reconciling personal beliefs and expectations with new information. Furthermore, the experimental framework and findings provide a foundation for the development of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) capable of detecting “yes” and “no” commands based on their intrinsic EEG predictors, offering promising applications in assistive technologies and neural communication systems.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The ability to proficiently play a musical instrument requires a fine-grained synchronization between several sensorimotor and cognitive brain regions. Previous studies have demonstrated that the brain undergoes functional changes with musical training, identifiable also in resting-state data. These studies analyzed functional MRI or electrophysiological frequency-specific brain networks in isolation. While the analysis of such “mono-layer” networks has proven useful, it fails to capture the complexities of multiple interacting networks. To this end, we applied a multilayer network framework for analyzing publicly available data (Open MEG Archive) obtained with magnetoencephalography. We investigated resting-state differences between participants with musical training (<span style="font-style:italic;">n</span> = 31) and those without (<span style="font-style:italic;">n</span> = 31). While single-layer analysis did not demonstrate any group differences, multilayer analysis revealed that musicians show a modular organization that spans visuo-motor and fronto-temporal areas, known to be involved in musical performance execution, which is significantly different from non-musicians. Differences between the two groups are primarily observed in the theta (6.5 to 8 Hz), alpha1 (8.5 to 10 Hz), and beta1 (12.5 to 16 Hz) frequency bands. We demonstrate that the multilayer method provides additional information that single-layer analysis cannot. Overall, the multilayer network method provides a unique opportunity to explore the pan-spectral nature of oscillatory networks, with studies of brain plasticity as a potential future application.</span>

                <p>We have documented the early embryonic development of hypothalamic neurons expressing &beta;-endorphin, &alpha;-melanocyte&ndash;stimulating hormone, neuropeptide Y, and kisspeptin in rhesus macaques, an animal model that is very similar to humans. Neurons expressing both &beta;-End and &alpha;MSH are the first to develop and are initially located in the lateral basal hypothalamus (LBH) as early as day 32&ndash;34 of gestation. By day 45 of gestation, these neurons have migrated into the medial basal hypothalamic (MBH) area as their final destination. NPY neurons within the ARH develop later and first appear at day 44 of fetal life, at which time a cluster of neurons is present within the ARH&ndash;MBH area. NPY neurons continue to be expressed within the ARH area at all of the later fetal ages analyzed. Similarly, kisspeptin neurons develop later compared with &beta;-End, although only a few cells are present in the ARH by day 44 of gestation, at which time kisspeptin is also expressed in the developing anterior lobe of the pituitary. By day 70 of gestation, the rostral to caudal distribution and cell size of Kiss1 neurons within the MBH are similar in females and males. In addition, Kiss1 fibers are also expressed in the POA by day 70. By day 130 of gestation, Kiss1 neurons exhibit a wider dorsal and lateral distribution within the MBH, with highly increased fiber distribution. Therefore, the development of these neurons is much earlier than what had been described previously for &alpha;MSH and NPY in primates.</p>

                Background Early and accurate prediction of ischemic heart disease (IHD) is essential for reducing mortality and enabling timely intervention. Misdiagnosis can lead to severe health outcomes, emphasizing the need for robust and intelligent predictive models. Deep learning approaches have shown strong potential in identifying hidden patterns in medical data and aiding clinical decision-making. Methods This study proposes a novel Hybrid Residual Attention with Echo State Network (HRAESN) model that integrates Attention Residual Learning (ARL) with Echo State Networks (ESN) to enhance feature extraction and temporal data learning. The hybrid model is designed to refine feature attention through residual learning while leveraging ESN for efficient time-series prediction. Two publicly available benchmark datasets were used for evaluation: the Kaggle Cardiovascular Disease dataset comprising 70,000 instances and the UCI Heart Disease dataset containing 303 instances. Missing values in both datasets were handled using a multiple imputation technique tailored for ischemic heart disease. Model performance was assessed using standard classification metrics, including accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, recall, and F-measure. Results The proposed HRAESN model demonstrated superior classification performance compared to traditional machine learning and deep learning approaches. It achieved an accuracy of 98.4% on the Kaggle dataset and 97.7% on the UCI dataset. Additionally, the model showed high sensitivity and specificity, indicating strong diagnostic capability and reliability in identifying both diseased and non-diseased cases. Conclusions The HRAESN model effectively combines the strengths of residual attention mechanisms and echo state networks, resulting in improved accuracy and stability for ischemic heart disease prediction. Its strong performance on benchmark datasets confirms its potential as a valuable clinical decision support tool for early detection of IHD. Future work may focus on optimizing model complexity and integrating real-time medical IoT data to enhance practical deployment in healthcare systems.

                Background Complications during the puerperium present abnormal conditions that can jeopardize the health and well-being of both mother and newborn. These complications are significant contributors to maternal morbidity and mortality worldwide. This systematic review aims to identify and synthesize evidence on the factors associated with postpartum disease complications. Methods This systematic review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD420251013692). A comprehensive search was performed using electronic databases, including Scopus and PubMed, to identify relevant studies published between 2014 and 2024. Eligible studies included full-text, peer-reviewed articles that used quantitative or qualitative designs and addressed postpartum complications in accordance with the PEO framework. Descriptive analysis was used to synthesize findings. Results A total of 907 records were identified, and 13 studies met the inclusion criteria. The findings highlight a range of factors significantly associated with postpartum complications, including postpartum hemorrhage, maternal age >35 years, depressive and anxiety disorders, preeclampsia, multiple pregnancies, type of vaginal delivery, infant-related health concerns, childhood trauma, low social support, low educational attainment of both mothers and husbands, perceived social isolation, and marital dissatisfaction. While early detection and intervention were not directly evaluated in these studies, the identification of these risk factors suggests that targeted screening and supportive strategies may be beneficial in mitigating postpartum complications. Conclusions This review identifies multiple psychosocial, demographic, and clinical factors associated with postpartum complications. These findings underscore the importance of early detection and comprehensive postpartum care to mitigate risks and improve maternal health outcomes.

                Abstract* Introduction Bilateral medial medullary infarction (BMMI) is a rare ischemic lesion that typically presents as dysarthria, dysphagia, tetraplegia, and respiratory failure. It is known for its characteristic « heart-shaped » appearance on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The etiological profile of this disease has not been studied previously. Considering the unfavorable outcome of BMMI, it is crucial to investigate the clinical and etiological profile to optimize the management of these patients. Case presentation A 49-year-old north-african smoker male patient was admitted to the neurology department of the military hospital of Tunis-Tunisia 24 hours after acute-onset slurred speech, weakness and impaired sensation in all four limbs, predominantly in the lower limb. His family history was remarkable for young-onset brainstem ischemic stroke (IS) in a brother. Neurological examination a right hemiparesis with tactile hemihypoesthesia and right astereognosia (modified Rankin scale of 2). Cerebral MRI showed radiological aspect compatible with diagnosis of « heart-shaped » BMMI. A heterozygous mutation R506 of Leiden Factor V was identified. The patient’s condition remained stable at 15 months follow-up (Modified Rankins Scale at 2) and no recurrence of IS was noted under anticoagulation to date. Conclusions BMMI is a rare case of medial medullary infarction, accounting for less than 1% of IS cases. To our knowledge, this is the first case of « heart-shaped » BMMI linked to Leiden Factor V mutation.

                Abstract* Background The digital age has brought numerous technological advances that have transformed our way of living and relating. Among them, Social media have revolutionized how we communicate and share information. However, there is a silent danger behind this seemingly harmless tool: Social media addiction. For this reason, the objective of this re-search was to determine if emotional intelligence and self-esteem predict addiction to Social media in Peruvian university students. Methods Therefore, a cross-sectional predictive design study was developed, in which 289 Peruvian university students participated voluntarily, whose ages fluctuated between 23.61 years with a standard deviation of 5.88 years, of which 54.06% were female and 45.94% were male. In addition, to measure the variables, the Wong-Law Emotional Intelligence Scale (WLEIS), the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale – EAR, and the Social media addiction questionnaire (ARS) were used. Results Linear regression results show that self-esteem (SELF) is the strongest predictor across all models, with beta coefficients of -0.293 for Social Media Obsession (SMO), -0.225 for Lack of Control, and -0.153 (LAU) for Excessive Social Media Use (USO). Regarding the emotional intelligence dimensions, it is observed that Appraisal of Own Emo-tions (SEA) and Use of Own Emotions (UEO) have weak negative effects on SMO addiction, with beta coefficients ranging from -0.072 to -0.136. Conclusions It is concluded that the models explain 17.2% of the variance in SMO, 14.8% in LAU, and 9.2% in USO. These values suggest that, while self-esteem and emotional intelligence influence SMO addiction, other additional factors may also play an important role.

The colonic epithelium plays a key role in the host-microbiome interactions, allowing uptake of various nutrients and driving important metabolic processes. To unravel detailed metabolic activities in the human colonic epithelium, our present study focuses on the generation of the first cell-type specific genome-scale metabolic model (GEM) of human colonic epithelial cells, named iColonEpithelium. GEMs are powerful tools for exploring reactions and metabolites at the systems level and predicting the flux distributions at steady state. Our cell-type-specific iColonEpithelium metabolic reconstruction captures genes specifically expressed in the human colonic epithelial cells. iColonEpithelium is also capable of performing metabolic tasks specific to the colonic epithelium. A unique transport reaction compartment has been included to allow for the simulation of metabolic interactions with the gut microbiome. We used iColonEpithelium to identify metabolic signatures associated with inflammatory bowel disease. We used single-cell RNA sequencing data from Crohn’s Diseases (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) samples to build disease-specific iColonEpithelium metabolic networks in order to predict metabolic signatures of colonocytes in both healthy and disease states. We identified reactions in nucleotide interconversion, fatty acid synthesis and tryptophan metabolism were differentially regulated in CD and UC conditions, relative to healthy control, which were in accordance with experimental results. The iColonEpithelium metabolic network can be used to identify mechanisms at the cellular level, and we show an initial proof-of-concept for how our tool can be leveraged to explore the metabolic interactions between host and gut microbiota.

                <p>by Shayna A. Sura, James O. Lloyd-Smith, Peggy Fong</p>

Ecological communities globally are shifting to degraded states, motivating research into attributes supporting resilience or leading to alternative stable states. Coral reef communities are particularly vulnerable as they are facing myriad anthropogenic impacts that contribute to shifts away from coral dominance, motivating much research on whether these shifts are gradual and reversible transitions versus alternative stable states. Empirical studies demonstrate functionally-diverse herbivorous fish communities support coral reef resilience to anthropogenic impacts. However, few coral reef models incorporate herbivore and algal functional groups and quantify their effects on reef resilience and alternative stable states. We built a coral reef model that includes herbivorous fish functional groups and their algal targets and explored how this expansion affects predictions of resilience and alternative stable states under different scenarios of human impacts. We found evenness across the functional groups of herbivores is increasingly important for reef recovery as fishing pressure increases, and recovery is promoted when algal communities begin with more turf than macroalgae. Our findings also highlight that models omitting functional groups that comprise real communities will miss crucial phenomena, such as loss of alternative stable states for browser-dominated communities, or continued presence of alternative stable states in grazer-dominated communities even when fishing pressure is removed entirely. This work advances our ability to understand and predict coral reef resilience and alternative stable states in the Anthropocene, and provides guidance for conservation policy on fishing practices.

Nucleotide recoding RNA sequencing methods (NR-seq; TimeLapse-seq, SLAM-seq, TUC-seq, etc.) are powerful approaches for assaying transcript population dynamics. In addition, these methods have been extended to probe a host of regulated steps in the RNA life cycle. Current bioinformatic tools significantly constrain analyses of NR-seq data. To address this limitation, we developed EZbakR (https://github.com/isaacvock/EZbakR), an R package to facilitate a more comprehensive set of NR-seq analyses, and fastq2EZbakR (https://github.com/isaacvock/fastq2EZbakR), a Snakemake pipeline for flexible preprocessing of NR-seq datasets, collectively referred to as the EZbakR suite. Together, these tools generalize many aspects of the NR-seq analysis workflow. The fastq2EZbakR pipeline can assign reads to a diverse set of genomic features (e.g., genes, exons, splice junctions), and EZbakR can perform analyses on any combination of these features. EZbakR extends standard NR-seq mutational modeling to support multi-label analyses (e.g., s<sup>4</sup>U and s<sup>6</sup>G dual labeling), and implements an improved hierarchical model to better account for transcript-to-transcript variance in metabolic label incorporation. EZbakR also generalizes dynamical systems modeling of NR-seq data to support analyses of premature mRNA processing and flow between subcellular compartments. Finally, EZbakR implements flexible and well-powered comparative analyses of all estimated parameters via design matrix-specified generalized linear modeling. The EZbakR suite will thus allow researchers to make full, effective use of NR-seq data.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) significantly affects morbidity and mortality rates. Class III antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) play a crucial role in managing AF but often exhibit gender-specific complications. Our study aims to identify gender-specific Class III AADs by integrating in vitro measurements, in silico models, and machine learning (ML). By simulating drug effects on a diverse cardiomyocyte model population (5,663 males and 6,184 females), we classified drugs based on changes in action potentials and calcium transients. Using sex-dependent Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms, we achieved high prediction accuracy (>89%) and F1 score (>87%). Key features included changes in resting membrane potential and action potential amplitude, duration and area. Gender differences in drug responses were attributed to lower IK1, INa, and Ito in females.

                <p>by Paul Züge, Natalie Schieferstein, Raoul-Martin Memmesheimer</p>

A hallmark of biological and artificial neural networks is that neurons tile the range of continuous sensory inputs and intrinsic variables with overlapping responses. It is characteristic for the underlying recurrent connectivity in the cortex that neurons with similar tuning predominantly excite each other. The reason for such an architecture is not clear. Using an analytically tractable model as well as spiking neural networks, we show that it can naturally arise from a cooperative coding scheme. In this scheme neurons with similar responses specifically support each other by sharing their computations to obtain the desired population code. This sharing allows each neuron to effectively respond to a broad variety of inputs, while only receiving few feedforward and recurrent connections. Few strong, specific recurrent connections then replace many feedforward and less specific recurrent connections, such that the resulting connectivity optimizes the number of required synapses. This suggests that the number of required synapses may be a crucial constraining factor in biological neural networks. Synaptic savings increase with the dimensionality of the encoded variables. We find a trade-off between saving synapses and response speed. The response speed improves by orders of magnitude when utilizing the window of opportunity between excitatory and delayed inhibitory currents that arises if, as found in experiments, spike frequency adaptation is present or strong recurrent excitation is balanced by strong, shortly-lagged inhibition.

                <p>by Alex S. Nicholson, David A. Priestman, Robin Antrobus, James C. Williamson, Reuben Bush, Shannon J. McKie, Henry G. Barrow, Emily Smith, Kostantin Dobrenis, Nicholas A. Bright, Frances M. Platt, Janet E. Deane</p>

Glycosphingolipids (GSL) are important bioactive membrane components. GSLs containing sialic acids, known as gangliosides, are highly abundant in the brain and diseases of ganglioside metabolism cause severe early-onset neurodegeneration. The ganglioside GM2 is processed by β-hexosaminidase A and when non-functional GM2 accumulates causing Tay–Sachs and Sandhoff diseases. We have developed i3Neuron-based disease models demonstrating storage of GM2 and severe endolysosomal dysfunction. Additionally, the plasma membrane (PM) is significantly altered in its lipid and protein composition. These changes are driven in part by lysosomal exocytosis causing inappropriate accumulation of lysosomal proteins on the cell surface. There are also significant changes in synaptic protein abundances with direct functional impact on neuronal activity. Lysosomal proteins are also enriched at the PM in GM1 gangliosidosis supporting that lysosomal exocytosis is a conserved mechanism of PM proteome change in these diseases. This work provides mechanistic insights into neuronal dysfunction in gangliosidoses highlighting that these are severe PM disorders with implications for other lysosomal and neurodegenerative diseases.

                <p>by Hyunwoo Kim, Joon-Goon Kim, Jueun Sim, Hoyeon Nam, In Cho, Hyejin Shin, Junyoung Kwon, Dae-Hyeon Song, Seoungbin Bae, Young-Gyu Yoon, Taeyun Ku, Jae-Byum Chang</p>

Multiplexed cyclic imaging in expandable tissue gels has been extensively studied to visualize numerous biomolecules at a nanoscale resolution in situ. Previous studies have employed sparse labels, such as DAPI or lectin staining, as registration markers. However, these sparse labels do not adequately capture the full extent of deformation across the entire region of interest. To overcome this challenge, we propose the use of dense labels, specifically fluorophore <i>N</i>-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS)-ester staining, as registration markers to achieve highly accurate image registration. We first tested several NHS-functionalized fluorophores as fiducial markers and identified the proper candidates for three-dimensional (3D) multiplexed cyclic imaging. We analyzed the registration accuracy between DAPI and NHS-ester staining and illustrated that dense label-based registration provides a more accurate registration performance. In the multiplexed imaging of expanded specimens, we observed that repetitive expansion/shrinking processes and chemical treatments for signal elimination can induce 3D nonlinear distortion. This sample distortion can be mitigated by re-embedding the tissue gel or replacing the chemical de-staining process with photobleaching-based signal removal or computational signal unmixing. With such an optimized experimental setup, we demonstrated 3D multiplexed cyclic imaging with nanoscale precision image registration. Finally, we prove that dense biological structures, such as actin, can be used as registration markers to achieve high registration accuracy. We anticipate that the proposed dense labeling strategy will overcome the technical limitations of multiplexed cyclic imaging in expandable tissue gels, offering high-precision registration. We expect it to be widely adopted by the biological and medical communities.

                <p>by Sumedha Ravishankar, Samantha M. Tuohey, Nicole O. Ramos, Satoshi Uchiyama, Megan I. Hayes, Kalisa Kang, Victor Nizet, Cressida A. Madigan</p>

To cause meningitis, bacteria move from the bloodstream to the brain, crossing the endothelial cells of the blood–brain barrier. Most studies on how bacteria cross the blood–brain barrier have been performed in vitro using cultured endothelial cells, due to a paucity of animal models. Group B <i>Streptococcus</i> (GBS) is the leading cause of bacterial meningitis in neonates and is primarily thought to cross the blood–brain barrier by transcytosis through endothelial cells. To test this hypothesis <i>in vivo</i>, we used optically transparent zebrafish larvae. Time-lapse confocal microscopy revealed that GBS forms extracellular microcolonies in brain blood vessels and causes perforation and lysis of blood–brain barrier endothelial cells, which promotes bacterial entry into the brain. Vessels infected with GBS microcolonies were distorted and contained thrombi. Inhibition of clotting worsened brain invasion, suggesting a host-protective role for thrombi. The GBS lysin cylE, implicated in brain invasion <i>in vitro</i>, was found dispensable <i>in vivo</i>. Instead, pro-inflammatory mediators associated with endothelial cell damage and blood–brain barrier breakdown were specifically upregulated in the zebrafish head upon GBS entry into the brain. Therefore, GBS crosses the blood–brain barrier <i>in vivo</i> not by transcytosis, but by endothelial cell lysis and death. Given that we observe the same invasion route for a meningitis-associated strain of <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i>, our findings suggest that streptococcal infection of brain blood vessels triggers endothelial cell inflammation and lysis, thereby facilitating brain invasion.

     alt="Chronic Striatal Cholinergic Interneuron Excitation Causes Cerebral Palsy-Related Dystonic Behavior in Mice"/>
<p>
</p>
<br/>
<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Mouse models of genetic dystonias have demonstrated abnormal striatal cholinergic interneuron excitability, but do not consistently demonstrate subjective dystonic features. To determine whether striatal cholinergic interneuron excitation can cause potentially dystonic motor behaviors, we first determined features correlated specifically with dystonia severity in people and then determined whether these features emerged in mice following striatal cholinergic interneuron excitation.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Eight movement disorders experts rated dystonia severity in 193 videos of people with cerebral palsy doing a seated task. Leg adduction variability metrics, which are known to correlate with leg dystonia severity during gait, were quantified in these videos of seated tasks. Metrics significantly associated with leg dystonia severity during seated tasks in people were then quantified in mice and compared between mice who underwent chemogenetic striatal cholinergic interneuron excitation (n = 17) and mice who did not (n = 17).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Leg adduction variability correlated well with experts' leg dystonia severity scores in people. Leg adduction variability was also significantly increased in mice that underwent striatal cholinergic interneuron excitation compared to mice that did not (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). This difference was not present with acute excitation and emerged only after 14 days of ongoing excitation.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We demonstrate that leg adduction variability correlates with leg dystonia severity in people with cerebral palsy and that chronic, but not acute, striatal cholinergic interneuron excitation can cause leg adduction variability in mice. These results support targeting striatal cholinergic interneurons for dystonia drug development and demonstrate the potential value of using quantifiable leg adduction metrics to study dystonia pathophysiology.

<p>The influence of P2X7R activation on the biological behavior of glioma and its potential value as a therapeutic target for glioma.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Glioma is the most common primary brain tumor, characterized by high invasiveness and poor prognosis. The purinergic ligand-gated ion channel 7 receptor (P2X7R), an ion channel-type purinergic receptor with adenosine triphosphate (ATP) as its ligand, is widely expressed in various tumor cells, including glioma. Moreover, it plays crucial biological functions in the progression of glioma. P2X7R promotes the proliferation, invasion, and metastasis of glioma by activating multiple signaling pathways, facilitating epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT), promoting the release of extracellular vesicles (EVs) and regulating the tumor microenvironment (TME) of glioma. However, the activation of P2X7R by high concentrations of ATP can induce cell necrosis or pyroptosis, exerting an anti-glioma effect. The bidirectional nature of its functions may be related to differences in the subtypes of P2X7R, cell types, as well as the TME. P2X7R antagonists can inhibit its effect in glioma, while the expression of P2X7R can enhance the efficacy of radiotherapy and chemotherapy. In this review, the structure and function of P2X7R, its role in tumor, especially its mechanism of action in glioma, and its latent capacity value as a target for therapeutic of glioma were reviewed in detail.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-646/v1?src=rss">Comparison of effects of 0.5 % levobupivacaine with buprenorphine and nalbuphine in ultrasound-guided supraclavicular brachial plexus block- A Randomised Control Trial [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction The brachial plexus block is one of the most commonly used anaesthesia techniques for upper limb surgeries. The supraclavicular brachial plexus block (SCBB) has been a frequently performed technique because it provides excellent quality of blockade, faster onset, and dense blockade. Different adjuvants and local anaesthetics are used to improve the onset and quality of the blockade. In our study, the local anaesthetic used was 0.5% levobupivacaine, and the adjuvants used were buprenorphine and nalbuphine. Materials and Methods Our study, a randomised, prospective double-blinded investigation, was conducted on 60 patients scheduled for elective upper limb orthopaedic surgeries. We performed the Supraclavicular brachial plexus block with 25 ml of 0.5% levobupivacaine plain (Group L) or with buprenorphine (Group LB) or with nalbuphine (Group LN) as adjuvants. We recorded the onset, duration of blockade (motor and sensory), sedation score, and time for rescue analgesia. Results The onset of sensorimotor blockade was notably faster in Group LB than in Group LN or Group L. The sensorimotor blockade duration was significantly prolonged in Group LB compared to LN and L. Group LB also had a delayed time after 12 hrs for rescue analgesia compared to the other two groups. Conclusion Buprenorphine as an adjuvant to 0.5% levobupivacaine in ultrasound-guided supraclavicular brachial plexus block significantly shortens the onset of sensorimotor blockade and enhances the duration of blockade when compared to nalbuphine. Both the adjuvants delayed the time for request of rescue analgesia compared to plain levobupivacaine.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-645/v1?src=rss">Technology Support Fraud Analysis for the Elderly [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Older adults often fall victim to technology (tech) support fraud, with criminals leveraging on psychological manipulation and perceived authority to exploit victims. Often unfamiliar with evolving digital threats, they may be particularly susceptible due to cognitive aging, social isolation, and trust in perceived authoritative figures. Despite growing awareness of cyber fraud, there are insufficient tailored fraud preventive strategies that address the specific vulnerabilities of older victims. This study investigates how psychological manipulation tactics influence compliance and reporting behavior among elderly victims of tech support fraud, filling a critical gap in fraud prevention research. Method The authors conducted a literature search on Google’s scholar to identify research papers related to elderly fraud and tech support scams. In addition, using qualitative analysis, the authors analyzed tech support fraud cases sourced from the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) to identify recurring themes in victim experiences. Three dominant themes emerged: emotional manipulation, perceived authority, and barriers to reporting. Scammers exploit fear and legitimacy, posing as trusted entities to gain compliance. Results Findings reveal that financial loss, shame, and family support affect victims’ likelihood of reporting these incidents. Victims who do not suffer monetary harm often refrain from reporting due to shame, embarrassment, or skepticism about law enforcement response. Family involvement appears to positively influence reporting behavior, reinforcing the importance of social networks in fraud prevention. Conclusion This study underscores the urgent need for targeted education programs that equip elderly individuals to recognize fraud tactics and report incidents irrespective of financial impact. It calls for fraud prevention strategies that incorporate accessible training materials, social network engagement, and multi-channel awareness campaigns. Future research should incorporate diverse data sources to expand and refine these findings and explore intervention strategies that mitigate psychological barriers to report fraud among elderly victims.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-644/v1?src=rss">Implementation of didactic strategies for assurance of learning with students at risk of academic failure in general chemistry [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Assurance of Learning is a process focused on ensuring the quality and effectiveness of education. It involves implementing practices, policies, and procedures intended to ensure the development of skills, competencies, and knowledge expected in a specific educational program or course. In the subjects Chemistry and General Chemistry I at the Universidad de La Sabana, persistent issues with low academic performance have resulted in rising course repetition rates, lack of motivation, and student dropout. Methods The present study examines targeted didactic strategies for students at risk of academic failure in these subjects, representing an innovation in the field of education and contributing to the domain of learning assurance in Chemistry. It was conducted under a mixed-methods approach with a quasi-experimental and cross-sectional design. A predictive trend analysis was carried out, and strategies were identified, selected, and implemented with consideration for students’ perceptions and assessments. Two samples were analyzed: a characterization sample of 411 students who took the subjects between the second semester of 2020 and the first semester of 2023, and an experimental sample comprising students from the second semester of 2023 and the first semester of 2024. Results The results revealed that participation in the implemented strategies led to improved academic performance, particularly for students with lower Saber 11 scores. Strategy 1 (leveling course) showed the greatest positive impact, with statistically significant differences in performance. Moreover, students reported high satisfaction with the strategies, especially regarding their usefulness, engagement, and relevance. Conclusions These findings suggest that personalized and contextualized didactic strategies are effective in supporting students at risk of academic failure in general chemistry courses.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-643/v1?src=rss">Vietnam's foreign policy (1945-1946): Proactive in a fragile independence [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background The August Revolution of 1945 established the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, but the nascent government immediately faced immense challenges from external forces like French colonialists and Chiang Kai-shek’s army, alongside internal difficulties. In this precarious situation, diplomacy emerged as a crucial strategic tool for the Vietnamese revolution during the 1945-1946 period, demonstrating a skillful blend of struggle and negotiation to safeguard independence. Methods This study is grounded in the principles of dialectical and historical materialism, consistent with the viewpoint of the Communist Party of Vietnam. The main methods include: the historical method (systematic examination of events and policies), the logical method (reconstructing diplomatic strategies), intertextual analysis (comparing Party directives with diplomatic actions), critical discourse analysis (Ho Chi Minh’s statements), and comparative assessment (with other decolonization movements). Data were collected from declassified archival materials, legal texts, diplomatic records, and contemporary press. Results During 1945-1946, Vietnam implemented an independent, self-reliant, and open foreign policy based on principles of equality and mutual assistance, with the core objective of protecting independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity. This policy demonstrated strategic flexibility by conciliating Chiang Kai-shek’s forces to free up resources against the French, and by signing the Preliminary Accord and Provisional Agreement with France to gain time for resistance preparation. Vietnamese diplomacy also proactively established friendly relations with neighboring countries and major powers, sought international recognition, and committed to multilateral cooperation, thereby strengthening the legitimacy of the revolutionary government. Conclusion In an extremely challenging situation, foreign affairs activities, under the leadership of the Party and President Ho Chi Minh, successfully protected Vietnam’s independence and enhanced the Democratic Republic of Vietnam’s prestige. The strategic lessons on foreign policy thinking from 1945-1946 have become a firm foundation for Vietnam’s modern foreign policy. They emphasize the harmonious combination of national independence, socialism, genuine patriotism, and internationalism, striving towards the ultimate goal of building a “prosperous people, strong country, democracy, justice, and civilization” in Vietnam.

                Background Gastric metastasis from melanoma is rare and often presents as an unexpected finding, rarely revealing an underlying primary skin melanoma. Case presentation We report a case of a 62-year-old male who presented with abdominal pain, dyspepsia, anorexia, and weight loss. On physical examination abdominal masses and hepatomegaly were detected. Radiological imaging showed widespread masses in the abdominal and thoracic regions. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy identified an umbilicated protruded lesion with central dark pigmentation at the antro-fundic junction. Histopathological examination and immunohistochemical staining were consistent with melanoma. A subsequent rigorous skin examination uncovered a primary malignant skin melanoma. Due to worsening general condition, the patient received palliative hospice care. Conclusion This report highlights the critical need for vigilant skin examination when dealing with widespread metastatic disease.

     alt="Cellular Organization and Migration Pathways of the Ventricular–Subventricular Zone in the Juvenile Swine Brain (Sus scrofa domesticus)"/>
<p>A detailed structural analysis of the juvenile swine ventricular–subventricular zone reveals four distinct cellular layers and diverse neuroblast migration routes, including pathways toward the olfactory bulb and cortical regions. These features underscore the swine brain's value as a translational model for studying postnatal neurogenesis in large-brained, gyrencephalic mammals.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The ventricular–subventricular zone (V-SVZ), lining the lateral walls of the lateral ventricles, is a major neurogenic region in the adult brain of many mammals. This study investigates the structural organization and cellular composition of the V-SVZ in the juvenile swine brain (3–5 months), providing novel insights into neuroblast migration in gyrencephalic species. Using immunohistochemistry combined with transmission and scanning electron microscopy, we redefined the cytoarchitecture of the swine V-SVZ, identifying four distinct cellular layers. Layer 1 consists of a pseudostratified epithelium of glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive ependymal cells, whose cilia and microvilli extend into the ventricular lumen, frequently surrounding supraependymal axons. Beneath it, layer 2 is composed of astrocytic and radial glia processes and contains occasional clusters of doublecortin (DCX)-positive cells with prominent microtubules and elongated cytoplasm, indicative of a migratory phenotype. Layer 3 is further subdivided into a low-cell-density sublayer 3a, enriched with myelinated axons and scattered DCX<sup>+</sup> clusters, and a high-cell-density sublayer 3b, characterized by large groups of DCX<sup>+</sup> migratory cells. In sagittal sections, these cells form long chains oriented parallel to the ventricular surface. Neuroblasts emerging from the dorsal V-SVZ migrate caudorostrally through the rostral migratory stream toward the olfactory bulb. The layered organization of the swine V-SVZ resembles that of humans, where DCX<sup>+</sup> chains persist up to 18 months of age, positioning the swine as a valuable model for investigating postnatal plasticity and neurogenic potential in gyrencephalic brains. The persistence of immature neurons in the V-SVZ of gyrencephalic mammals, including infant humans, underscores the relevance of this region for neurogenesis and plasticity in large-brained species.</p>

                Wu et al. developed a graph deep learning-based algorithm, “DeepMeta,” that can accurately predict the metabolic vulnerability of cancer patients based on the transcriptome and metabolic network information. DeepMeta can reveal metabolic dependency and provide new strategies for targeting cancer with undruggable driver mutations.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96414">The human cytomegalovirus-encoded pUS28 antagonizes CD4+ T cell recognition by targeting CIITA</a></h4>

              
                Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a relevant pathogen, especially for individuals with impaired immunity. Harnessing potent immune antagonists, HCMV circumvents sterile immunity. Given that HCMV prevents the upregulation of <i>human leukocyte antigen</i> (HLA)-DP and HLA-DR, we screened a library of HCMV genes by co-expression with the HLA class II (HLA-II)-inducing transcription coordinator <i>class II transactivator</i> (CIITA). We identified the latency regulator pUS28 as an interaction factor and potent viral antagonist of CIITA-driven expression of CD74, HLA-DR, HLA-DM, HLA-DQ, and HLA-DP. Both wt-pUS28 and a mutant incapable of inducing G protein-coupled signaling (R129A), but not a mutant lacking the C-terminus, drastically reduced the CIITA protein abundance post-transcriptionally. While control CD4 + T cells from HCMV-seropositive individuals vigorously responded to CIITA-expressing cells decorated with HCMV antigens, pUS28 expression was sufficient to inhibit HLA-II induction and immune recognition by HCMV-specific CD4 + T cells. Our data uncover pUS28 to be employed by HCMV to evade HLA-II-mediated recognition by CD4 + T cells.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104996">Intrinsic dynamic shapes responses to external stimulation in the human brain</a></h4>

              
                Sensory stimulation of the brain reverberates in its recurrent neural networks. However, current computational models of brain activity do not separate immediate sensory responses from this intrinsic dynamic. We apply a vector-autoregressive model with external input (VARX), combining the concepts of ‘functional connectivity’ and ‘encoding models’, to intracranial recordings in humans. This model captures the extrinsic effect of the stimulus and separates that from the intrinsic effect of the recurrent brain dynamic. We find that the intrinsic dynamic enhances and prolongs the neural responses to scene cuts, eye movements, and sounds. Failing to account for these extrinsic inputs leads to spurious recurrent connections that govern the intrinsic dynamic. We also find that the recurrent connectivity during rest is reduced during movie watching. The model shows that an external stimulus can reduce intrinsic noise. It also shows that sensory areas have mostly outward, whereas higher-order brain areas have mostly incoming connections. We conclude that the response to an external audiovisual stimulus can largely be attributed to the intrinsic dynamic of the brain, already observed during rest.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101850">Assemblies, synapse clustering, and network topology interact with plasticity to explain structure-function relationships of the cortical connectome</a></h4>

              
                Synaptic plasticity underlies the brain’s ability to learn and adapt. While experiments in brain slices have revealed mechanisms and protocols for the induction of plasticity between pairs of neurons, how these synaptic changes are coordinated in biological neuronal networks to ensure the emergence of learning remains poorly understood. Simulation and modeling have emerged as important tools to study learning in plastic networks, but have yet to achieve a scale that incorporates realistic network structure, active dendrites, and multi-synapse interactions, key determinants of synaptic plasticity. To rise to this challenge, we endowed an existing large-scale cortical network model, incorporating data-constrained dendritic processing and multi-synaptic connections, with a calcium-based model of functional plasticity that captures the diversity of excitatory connections extrapolated to in vivo-like conditions. This allowed us to study how dendrites and network structure interact with plasticity to shape stimulus representations at the microcircuit level. In our exploratory simulations, plasticity acted sparsely and specifically, firing rates and weight distributions remained stable without additional homeostatic mechanisms. At the circuit level, we found plasticity was driven by co-firing stimulus-evoked functional assemblies, spatial clustering of synapses on dendrites, and the topology of the network connectivity. As a result of the plastic changes, the network became more reliable with more stimulus-specific responses. We confirmed our testable predictions in the MICrONS datasets, an openly available electron microscopic reconstruction of a large volume of cortical tissue. Our results quantify at a large scale how the dendritic architecture and higher-order structure of cortical microcircuits play a central role in functional plasticity and provide a foundation for elucidating their role in learning.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99752">Heterogeneous efflux pump expression underpins phenotypic resistance to antimicrobial peptides</a></h4>

              
                Antimicrobial resistance threatens the viability of modern medical interventions. There is a dire need to develop novel approaches to counter resistance mechanisms employed by starved or slow-growing pathogens that are refractory to conventional antimicrobial therapies. Antimicrobial peptides have been advocated as potential therapeutic solutions due to the low levels of genetic resistance observed in bacteria against these compounds. However, here we show that subpopulations of stationary phase <i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> survive tachyplesin treatment without acquiring genetic mutations. These phenotypic variants display enhanced efflux activity to limit intracellular peptide accumulation. Differential regulation of genes involved in outer membrane vesicle secretion, membrane modification, and protease activity was also observed between phenotypically resistant and susceptible cells. We discovered that the formation of these phenotypic variants could be prevented by administering tachyplesin in combination with sertraline, a clinically used antidepressant, suggesting a novel approach for combatting antimicrobial-refractory stationary phase bacteria.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101830">C-C chemokine receptor 4 deficiency exacerbates early atherosclerosis in mice</a></h4>

              
                Chronic inflammation via dysregulation of T cell immune responses is critically involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Improving the balance between proinflammatory T cells and anti-inflammatory regulatory T cells (Tregs) may be an attractive approach for treating atherosclerosis. Although C-C chemokine receptor 4 (CCR4) has been shown to mediate the recruitment of T cells to inflamed tissues, its role in atherosclerosis is unclear. Here, we show that genetic deletion of CCR4 in hypercholesterolemic mice accelerates the development of early atherosclerotic lesions characterized by an inflammatory plaque phenotype. This was associated with the augmentation of proinflammatory T helper type 1 (Th1) cell responses in peripheral lymphoid tissues, para-aortic lymph nodes, and atherosclerotic aorta. Mechanistically, CCR4 deficiency in Tregs impaired their suppressive function and tended to inhibit their migration to the atherosclerotic aorta, and subsequently augmented Th1 cell-mediated immune responses through defective regulation of dendritic cell function, which accelerated aortic inflammation and atherosclerotic lesion development. Thus, we revealed a previously unrecognized role for CCR4 in controlling the early stage of atherosclerosis via Treg-dependent regulation of proinflammatory T cell responses. Our data suggest that CCR4 is an important negative regulator of atherosclerosis.
