                Circular RNAs (circRNAs) comprise a novel class of regulatory RNAs that are abundant in the brain, particularly within synapses. They are highly stable, dynamically regulated, and display a range of functional roles, including as decoys for miRNAs and proteins and, in some cases, translation. Early work in animal models revealed an association between circRNAs and neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders; however, relatively few studies have shown a causal link between circRNA function and memory. To address this knowledge gap, we sequenced circRNAs in the synaptosome compartment of the medial prefrontal cortex of fear extinction trained male C57BL/6J mice and found 12837 circRNAs enriched at the synapse, including Cdr1as. Targeted knockdown of Cdr1as in the neural processes of the infralimbic prefrontal cortex of male C57BL/6J mice led to impaired fear extinction memory. Altogether, our findings highlight the importance of localised circRNA activity at the synapse for memory formation and suggest that circRNAs may have a more widespread effect on brain function than previously thought.

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Navigating the Statistical Minefield of Model Selection and Clustering in Neuroscience</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Model selection is often implicit: when performing an ANOVA, one assumes that the normal distribution is a good model of the data; fitting a tuning curve implies that an additive and a multiplicative scaler describes the behavior of the neuron; even calculating an average implicitly assumes that the data were sampled from a distribution that has a finite first statistical moment: the mean. Model selection may be explicit, when the aim is to test whether one model provides a better description of the data than a competing one. As a special case, clustering algorithms identify groups with similar properties within the data. They are widely used from spike sorting to cell type identification to gene expression analysis. We discuss model selection and clustering techniques from a statistician&rsquo;s point of view, revealing the assumptions behind, and the logic that governs the various approaches. We also showcase important neuroscience applications and provide suggestions how neuroscientists could put model selection algorithms to best use as well as what mistakes should be avoided.</p>

                <p>by Isaac Fradkin, Eran Eldar</p>

To attain goals, people must proactively prevent interferences and react to interferences once they occur. Whereas most research focuses on how people deal with external interferences, here we investigate the use of proactive and reactive control in dealing with unwanted thoughts. To examine this question, we asked people to generate an association to each of several repeating cue words, while forbidding the repetition of associations. Reactively rejecting and replacing unwanted repeated associations after they occur entails slower response times. Conversely, proactive control entails constricting the search space and thus faster response times. To gain further insight into different potential proactive thought control mechanisms, we augmented the analysis of raw response times with a novel, hypothesis-based, tractable computational model describing how people serially sample associations. Our results indicate that people primarily react to unwanted thoughts after they occur. Yet, we found evidence for two latent proactive control mechanisms: one that allows people to mitigate the episodic strengthening of repeated thoughts, and another that helps avoid looping in a repetitive thought. Exploratory analysis showed a relationship between model parameters and self-reported individual differences in the control over unwanted thoughts in daily life. The findings indicate the novel task and model can advance our understanding of how people can and cannot control their thoughts and memories, and benefit future research on the mechanisms responsible for unwanted thought in different psychiatric conditions. Finally, we discuss implications concerning the involvement of associative thinking and various control processes in semantic fluency, decision-making and creativity.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">NucleoMap: A computational tool for identifying nucleosomes in ultra-high resolution contact maps</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yuanhao Huang, Bingjiang Wang, Jie Liu</p>

Although poorly positioned nucleosomes are ubiquitous in the eukaryotic genome, they are difficult to identify with existing nucleosome identification methods. Recently available enhanced high-throughput chromatin conformation capture techniques such as Micro-C, DNase Hi-C, and Hi-CO characterize nucleosome-level chromatin proximity, probing the positions of mono-nucleosomes and the spacing between nucleosome pairs at the same time, enabling nucleosome profiling in poorly positioned regions. Here we develop a novel computational approach, NucleoMap, to identify nucleosome positioning from ultra-high resolution chromatin contact maps. By integrating nucleosome read density, contact distances, and binding preferences, NucleoMap precisely locates nucleosomes in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes and outperforms existing nucleosome identification methods in both precision and recall. We rigorously characterize genome-wide association in eukaryotes between the spatial organization of mono-nucleosomes and their corresponding histone modifications, protein binding activities, and higher-order chromatin functions. We also find evidence of two tetra-nucleosome folding structures in human embryonic stem cells and analyze their association with multiple structural and functional regions. Based on the identified nucleosomes, nucleosome contact maps are constructed, reflecting the inter-nucleosome distances and preserving the contact distance profiles in original contact maps.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Modelling livestock infectious disease control policy under differing social perspectives on vaccination behaviour</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Edward M. Hill, Naomi S. Prosser, Eamonn Ferguson, Jasmeet Kaler, Martin J. Green, Matt J. Keeling, Michael J. Tildesley</p>

The spread of infection amongst livestock depends not only on the traits of the pathogen and the livestock themselves, but also on the veterinary health behaviours of farmers and how this impacts their implementation of disease control measures. Controls that are costly may make it beneficial for individuals to rely on the protection offered by others, though that may be sub-optimal for the population. Failing to account for socio-behavioural properties may produce a substantial layer of bias in infectious disease models. We investigated the role of heterogeneity in vaccine response across a population of farmers on epidemic outbreaks amongst livestock, caused by pathogens with differential speed of spread over spatial landscapes of farms for two counties in England (Cumbria and Devon). Under different compositions of three vaccine behaviour groups (precautionary, reactionary, non-vaccination), we evaluated from population- and individual-level perspectives the optimum threshold distance to premises with notified infection that would trigger responsive vaccination by the reactionary vaccination group. We demonstrate a divergence between population and individual perspectives in the optimal scale of reactive voluntary vaccination response. In general, minimising the population-level perspective cost requires a broader reactive uptake of the intervention, whilst optimising the outcome for the average individual increased the likelihood of larger scale disease outbreaks. When the relative cost of vaccination was low and the majority of premises had undergone precautionary vaccination, then adopting a perspective that optimised the outcome for an individual gave a broader spatial extent of reactive response compared to a perspective wanting to optimise outcomes for everyone in the population. Under our assumed epidemiological context, the findings identify livestock disease intervention receptiveness and cost combinations where one would expect strong disagreement between the intervention stringency that is best from the perspective of a stakeholder responsible for supporting the livestock industry compared to a sole livestock owner. Were such discord anticipated and achieving a consensus view across perspectives desired, the findings may also inform those managing veterinary health policy the requisite reduction in intervention cost and/or the required extent of nurturing beneficial community attitudes towards interventions.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Ten simple rules for designing and running a computing minor for bio/chem students</a></h4>

Science students increasingly need programming and data science skills to be competitive in the modern workforce. However, at our university (San Francisco State University), until recently, almost no biology, biochemistry, and chemistry students (from here bio/chem students) completed a minor in computer science. To change this, a new minor in computing applications, which is informally known as the Promoting Inclusivity in Computing (PINC) minor, was established in 2016. Here, we present the lessons we learned from our experience in a set of 10 rules. The first 3 rules focus on setting up the program so that it interests students in biology, chemistry, and biochemistry. Rules 4 through 8 focus on how the classes of the program are taught to make them interesting for our students and to provide the students with the support they need. The last 2 rules are about what happens “behind the scenes” of running a program with many people from several departments involved.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Neural dynamics differentially encode phrases and sentences during spoken language comprehension</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Fan Bai, Antje S. Meyer, Andrea E. Martin</p>

Human language stands out in the natural world as a biological signal that uses a structured system to combine the meanings of small linguistic units (e.g., words) into larger constituents (e.g., phrases and sentences). However, the physical dynamics of speech (or sign) do not stand in a one-to-one relationship with the meanings listeners perceive. Instead, listeners infer meaning based on their knowledge of the language. The neural readouts of the perceptual and cognitive processes underlying these inferences are still poorly understood. In the present study, we used scalp electroencephalography (EEG) to compare the neural response to phrases (e.g., the red vase) and sentences (e.g., the vase is red), which were close in semantic meaning and had been synthesized to be physically indistinguishable. Differences in structure were well captured in the reorganization of neural phase responses in delta (approximately <2 Hz) and theta bands (approximately 2 to 7 Hz),and in power and power connectivity changes in the alpha band (approximately 7.5 to 13.5 Hz). Consistent with predictions from a computational model, sentences showed more power, more power connectivity, and more phase synchronization than phrases did. Theta–gamma phase–amplitude coupling occurred, but did not differ between the syntactic structures. Spectral–temporal response function (STRF) modeling revealed different encoding states for phrases and sentences, over and above the acoustically driven neural response. Our findings provide a comprehensive description of how the brain encodes and separates linguistic structures in the dynamics of neural responses. They imply that phase synchronization and strength of connectivity are readouts for the constituent structure of language. The results provide a novel basis for future neurophysiological research on linguistic structure representation in the brain, and, together with our simulations, support time-based binding as a mechanism of structure encoding in neural dynamics.

     alt="An atlas of the developing Tribolium castaneum brain reveals conservation in anatomy and divergence in timing to Drosophila melanogaster"/>
<p>We examined the developing brain of the beetle <i>Tribolium castaneum</i>. We determined tracts, fascicles, and compartments (a) by combining tubulin and synapsin stainings (b) in three developing stages (b’). The result is a comprehensive anatomical atlas (c) that was compared with the fruitfly and is provided for user-friendly interaction (d).

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Insect brains are formed by conserved sets of neural lineages whose fibers form cohesive bundles with characteristic projection patterns. Within the brain neuropil, these bundles establish a system of fascicles constituting the macrocircuitry of the brain. The overall architecture of the neuropils and the macrocircuitry appear to be conserved. However, variation is observed, for example, in size, shape, and timing of development. Unfortunately, the developmental and genetic basis of this variation is poorly understood, although the rise of new genetically tractable model organisms such as the red flour beetle <i>Tribolium castaneum</i> allows the possibility to gain mechanistic insights. To facilitate such work, we present an atlas of the developing brain of <i>T. castaneum</i>, covering the first larval instar, the prepupal stage, and the adult, by combining wholemount immunohistochemical labeling of fiber bundles (acetylated tubulin) and neuropils (synapsin) with digital 3D reconstruction using the TrakEM2 software package. Upon comparing this anatomical dataset with the published work in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, we confirm an overall high degree of conservation. Fiber tracts and neuropil fascicles, which can be visualized by global neuronal antibodies like antiacetylated tubulin in all invertebrate brains, create a rich anatomical framework to which individual neurons or other regions of interest can be referred to. The framework of a largely conserved pattern allowed us to describe differences between the two species with respect to parameters such as timing of neuron proliferation and maturation. These features likely reflect adaptive changes in developmental timing that govern the change from larval to adult brain.</p>

     alt="Neuronal density and expression of calcium-binding proteins across the layers of the superior colliculus in the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus)"/>
<p>Using stereological sampling, we demonstrate that neuronal density decreases across layers of the superior colliculus in marmoset monkeys. Neuronal density in this structure tends to be lower at rostral levels, compared to caudal levels. Neurons expressing different calcium-binding proteins (calbindin, calretinin, and parvalbumin) display variable gradients of density across layers in the superior colliculus. Calbindin- and calretinin-expressing neurons show markedly higher densities in the upper layers, while the distribution of parvalbumin-expressing neurons is more uniform.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The superior colliculus (SC) is a layered midbrain structure with functions that include polysensory and sensorimotor integration. Here, we describe the distribution of different immunohistochemically identified classes of neurons in the SC of adult marmoset monkeys (<i>Callithrix jacchus</i>). Neuronal nuclei (NeuN) staining was used to determine the overall neuronal density in the different SC layers. In addition, we studied the distribution of neurons expressing different calcium-binding proteins (calbindin [CB], parvalbumin [PV] and calretinin [CR]). Our results indicate that neuronal density in the SC decreases from superficial to deep layers. Although the neuronal density within the same layer varies little across the mediolateral axis, it tends to be lower at rostral levels, compared to caudal levels. Cells expressing different calcium-binding proteins display differential gradients of density according to depth. Both CB- and CR-expressing neurons show markedly higher densities in the stratum griseum superficiale (SGS), compared to the stratum opticum and intermediate and deep layers. However, CR-expressing neurons are twice as common as CB-expressing neurons outside the SGS. The distribution of PV-expressing cells follows a shallow density gradient from superficial to deep layers. When normalized relative to total neuronal density, the proportion of CR-expressing neurons increases between the superficial and intermediate layers, whereas that of CB-expressing neurons declines toward the deep layers. The proportion of PV-expressing neurons remains constant across layers. Our data provide layer-specific and accurate estimates of neuronal density, which may be important for the generation of biophysical models of how the primate SC transforms sensory inputs into motor signals.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Regulation of presynaptic Ca2+ channel abundance at active zones through a balance of delivery and turnover</a></h4>

              
                Voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (VGCCs) mediate Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx to trigger neurotransmitter release at specialized presynaptic sites termed active zones (AZs). The abundance of VGCCs at AZs regulates neurotransmitter release probability (<i>P<sub>r</sub></i>), a key presynaptic determinant of synaptic strength. Although biosynthesis, delivery and recycling cooperate to establish AZ VGCC abundance, experimentally isolating these distinct regulatory processes has been difficult. Here we describe how the AZ levels of Cacophony (Cac), the sole VGCC mediating synaptic transmission in <i>Drosophila</i>, are determined. We also analyzed the relationship between Cac, the conserved VGCC regulatory subunit α2δ, and the core AZ scaffold protein Bruchpilot (BRP) in establishing a functional AZ. We find Cac and BRP are independently regulated at growing AZs, as Cac is dispensable for AZ formation and structural maturation, and BRP abundance is not limiting for Cac accumulation. Additionally, AZs stop accumulating Cac after an initial growth phase, whereas BRP levels continue to increase given extended developmental time. AZ Cac is also buffered against moderate increases or decreases in biosynthesis, whereas BRP lacks this buffering. To probe mechanisms that determine AZ Cac abundance, intravital FRAP and Cac photoconversion were used to separately measure delivery and turnover at individual AZs over a multi-day period. Cac delivery occurs broadly across the AZ population, correlates with AZ size, and is rate-limited by α2δ. Although Cac does not undergo significant lateral transfer between neighboring AZs over the course of development, Cac removal from AZs does occur and is promoted by new Cac delivery, generating a cap on Cac accumulation at mature AZs. Together these findings reveal how Cac biosynthesis, synaptic delivery, and recycling set the abundance of VGCCs at individual AZs throughout synapse development and maintenance.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Impaired astrocytic Ca2+ signaling in awake-behaving Alzheimer's disease transgenic mice</a></h4>

              
                Increased astrocytic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling has been shown in Alzheimer's disease mouse models, but to date no reports have characterized behaviorally induced astrocytic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in such mice. Here, we employ an event-based algorithm to assess astrocytic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in the neocortex of awake-behaving tg-ArcSwe mice and non-transgenic wildtype littermates while monitoring pupil responses and behavior. We demonstrate an attenuated astrocytic Ca<sup>2+</sup> response to locomotion and an uncoupling of pupil responses and astrocytic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in 15-months old plaque-bearing mice. Using the genetically encoded fluorescent norepinephrine sensor GRAB<sub>NE</sub> we demonstrate a reduced norepinephrine signaling during spontaneous running and startle responses in the transgenic mice, providing a possible mechanistic underpinning of the observed reduced astrocytic Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses. Our data points to a dysfunction in the norepinephrine-astrocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity-axis, which may account for some of the cognitive deficits observed in Alzheimer's disease.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Transgenic quails reveal dynamic TCF/β-catenin signaling during avian embryonic development</a></h4>

              
                The Wnt/bβ-catenin signaling pathway is highly conserved throughout evolution, playing crucial roles in several developmental and pathological processes. Wnt ligands can act at a considerable distance from their sources and it is therefore necessary to examine not only the Wnt-producing but also the Wnt-receiving cells and tissues to fully appreciate the many functions of this pathway. To monitor Wnt activity, multiple tools have been designed which consist of multimerized Wnt signaling response elements (TCF/LEF binding sites) driving the expression of fluorescent reporter proteins (e.g. GFP, RFP) or of LacZ. The high stability of those reporters leads to a considerable accumulation in cells activating the pathway, thereby making them easily detectable. However, this makes them unsuitable to follow temporal changes of the pathway's activity during dynamic biological events. Even though fluorescent transcriptional reporters can be destabilized to shorten their half-lives, this dramatically reduces signal intensities, particularly when applied <i>in vivo</i>. To alleviate these issues, we developed two transgenic quail lines in which high copy number (12x or 16x) of the TCF/LEF binding sites drive the expression of destabilized GFP variants. Translational enhancer sequences derived from viral mRNAs were used to increase signal intensity and specificity. This resulted in transgenic lines efficient for the characterisation of TCF/β-catenin transcriptional dynamic activities during embryogenesis, including using <i>in vivo</i> imaging. Our analyses demonstrate the use of this transcriptional reporter to unveil novel aspects of Wnt signaling, thus opening new routes of investigation into the role of this pathway during amniote embryonic development.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Arl15 upregulates the TGFβ family signaling by promoting the assembly of the Smad-complex</a></h4>

              
                The hallmark event of the canonical transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) family signaling is the assembly of the Smad-complex, consisting of the common Smad, Smad4, and phosphorylated receptor-regulated Smads. How the Smad-complex is assembled and regulated is still unclear. Here, we report that active Arl15, an Arf-like small G protein, specifically binds to the MH2 domain of Smad4 and colocalizes with Smad4 at the endolysosome. The binding relieves the autoinhibition of Smad4, which is imposed by the intramolecular interaction between its MH1 and MH2 domains. Activated Smad4 subsequently interacts with phosphorylated receptor-regulated Smads, forming the Smad-complex. Our observations suggest that Smad4 functions as an effector and a GTPase activating protein (GAP) of Arl15. Assembly of the Smad-complex enhances the GAP activity of Smad4 toward Arl15, therefore dissociating Arl15 before the nuclear translocation of the Smad-complex. Our data further demonstrate that Arl15 positively regulates the TGFβ family signaling.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Fitness consequences of outgroup conflict</a></h4>

              
                In social species across the animal kingdom, conspecific outsiders threaten the valuable resources of groups and their members. This outgroup conflict is recognised as a powerful selection pressure, but we argue that studies explicitly quantifying the fitness consequences need to be broader in scope: more attention should be paid to delayed, cumulative, and third-party fitness consequences, not just those arising immediately to group members involved in physical contests. In the first part of this review, we begin by documenting how single contests can have survival and reproductive consequences either immediately or with a delay. Then, we step beyond contests to describe fitness consequences that can also result from interactions with cues of rival presence and the general landscape of outgroup threat, and beyond single interactions to describe cumulative effects of territorial pressure and elevated outgroup-induced stress. Using examples from a range of taxa, we discuss which individuals are affected negatively and positively, considering both interaction participants and third-party group members of the same or the next generation. In the second part of the review, we provide suggestions about how to move forward. We highlight the importance of considering how different types of outgroup conflict can generate different selection pressures and of investigating variation in fitness consequences within and between species. We finish by discussing the value of theoretical modelling and long-term studies of natural populations, experimental manipulations, and meta-analyses to develop further our understanding of this crucial aspect of sociality.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Neural tracking of phrases in spoken language comprehension is automatic and task-dependent</a></h4>

              
                Linguistic phrases are tracked in sentences even though there is no one-to-one acoustic phrase marker in the physical signal. This phenomenon suggests an automatic tracking of abstract linguistic structure that is endogenously generated by the brain. However, all studies investigating linguistic tracking compare conditions where either relevant information at linguistic timescales is available, or where this information is absent altogether (e.g., sentences versus word lists during passive listening). It is therefore unclear whether tracking at phrasal timescales is related to the content of language, or rather, results as a consequence of attending to the timescales that happen to match behaviourally relevant information. To investigate this question, we presented participants with sentences and word lists while recording their brain activity with magnetoencephalography (MEG). Participants performed passive, syllable, word, and word-combination tasks corresponding to attending to four different rates: one they would naturally attend to, syllable-rates, word-rates, and phrasal-rates, respectively. We replicated overall findings of stronger phrasal-rate tracking measured with mutual information for sentences compared to word lists across the classical language network. However, in the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) we found a task effect suggesting stronger phrasal-rate tracking during the word-combination task independent of the presence of linguistic structure, as well as stronger delta-band connectivity during this task. These results suggest that extracting linguistic information at phrasal rates occurs automatically with or without the presence of an additional task, but also that IFG might be important for temporal integration across various perceptual domains.

                Sequencing the regional progression of neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD) informs disease mechanisms and facilitates identification and staging of individuals at greatest risk of imminent cognitive decline, which may aid the development of early therapeutic interventions. Previous attempts to sequence neurodegeneration have analysed measures of regional volume and identified the initial sites of atrophy. However, focal microstructural alterations in white matter have also been reported in early AD. Yet, the temporal ordering of abnormality in measures of white matter microstructure relative to grey matter volume has not been established. In this study we used event-based modelling of disease progression (EBM) to provide a data-driven evaluation of the temporal sequence of abnormality in markers of white matter microstructure relative to grey matter volume. Regional microstructural metrics derived from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and regional volumes from Freesurfer cortical parcellation were obtained from the Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database for 441 amyloid-positive participants (81 AD-dementia, 159 mild cognitive impairment, 201 cognitively normal). The estimated sequence shows a series of abnormalities in markers of white matter microstructure, followed by sequential grey matter volumetric decline, with no overlap between the two. Analysis of positional variance and cross-validation supports the robustness of our findings. These results provide the first data-driven evidence that markers of white matter microstructural degeneration precede those of cortical volumetric decline in the AD cascade. This prompts a re-evaluation of the view that regional volumetric decline can be used to characterise the very earliest stages of AD neurodegeneration. Instead, we suggest that white matter microstructural markers provide an earlier window into AD neurodegeneration. An early staging system of AD neurodegeneration based on measures of brain microstructure may find application in selecting AD subjects with early but minimal brain damage for clinical trials that aim to prevent cognitive decline.

                Natural vision is dynamic: as an animal moves, its visual input changes dramatically. How can the visual system reliably extract local features from an input dominated by self-generated signals? In Drosophila, diverse local visual features are represented by a group of projection neurons with distinct tuning properties. Here we describe a connectome-based volumetric imaging strategy to measure visually evoked neural activity across this population. We show that local visual features are jointly represented across the population, and that a shared gain factor improves trial-to-trial coding fidelity. A subset of these neurons, tuned to small objects, is modulated by two independent signals associated with self-movement, a motor-related signal and a visual motion signal. These two inputs adjust the sensitivity of these feature detectors across the locomotor cycle, selectively reducing their gain during saccades and restoring it during intersaccadic intervals. This work reveals a strategy for reliable feature detection during locomotion.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Rewiring Dynamics of Functional Connectome in Motor Cortex during Motor Skill Learning</a></h4>

              
                The brain's connectome continually rewires throughout the life of an organism. In this study, we sought to elucidate the operational principles of such rewiring by analyzing the functional connectomes in mouse primary motor cortex (M1) during a 14-session (day) lever-press task learning in response to an auditory cue. Specifically, we employed Calcium imaging recordings of L2/3 and L5 of M1 in awake mice to reconstruct and analyze functional connectomes across learning sessions. Our results show that L2/3 and L5 functional connectomes follow a similar learning-induced rewiring trajectory. More specifically, the connectomes rewire in a biphasic manner, where functional connectivity increases over the first few learning sessions, and then, it is gradually pruned to return to a homeostatic level of network density. We demonstrated that the increase of network connectivity in L2/3 connectomes, but not in L5, generates neuronal co-firing activity that correlates with higher motor performance (shorter cue-to-reward time), while motor performance remains relatively stable throughout the pruning phase. The results show a biphasic rewiring principle that involves the maximization of reward / performance and maintenance of network density. Finally, we demonstrated that the connectome rewiring in L2/3 is clustered around a core set of movement-associated neurons that form a highly interconnected hub in the connectomes, and that the activity of these core neurons stably encodes movement throughout learning.

                While early life drug use reliably predicts addiction liability in adulthood, the molecular mechanism by which this occurs, and the degree genetic predisposition is involved is not known. We used a unique genetic rat model of temperament to determine the impact of adolescent cocaine experience on adult psychomotor sensitization and epigenetic profiles in the striatum. Relative to adult bred low-responder (bLR) rats, bred high-responders (bHR) are more sensitive to the psychomotor-activating effects of cocaine and reinstate drug-seeking behavior more readily following prolonged cocaine exposure and a period of abstinence. We found that a 7-day sensitizing cocaine regimen (15 mg/kg/day) during either adolescence or adulthood produced psychomotor sensitization in bHRs only, while a dual cocaine exposure prevents further sensitization, suggesting limits on neuroplasticity. By contrast, adolescent cocaine in bLRs shifted their resilient phenotype, rendering them more responsive to cocaine in adulthood when initially challenged with cocaine We then assessed two functionally opposite epigenetic chromatin modifications, previously implicated in addiction liability, permissive acetylation (ac) and repressive tri-methylation (me3), on histone 3 lysine 9 (H3K9) in four sub-regions of the striatum. In bHRs, decreased repressive histone, H3K9me3, and increased permissive histone, acH3K9, in nucleus accumbens core associated with cocaine sensitization. However, there were limits on these epigenetic changes that paralleled the behavioral limits on further sensitization. In bLRs, the combination of cocaine exposure in adolescence and adulthood, which lead to an increase in their responsiveness to a cocaine challenge, also increased acH3K9 expression in the core. Thus, adolescent cocaine experience interacts with genetic background to elicit different behavioral profiles relevant to addiction in adulthood, with concurrent modifications in the epigenetic histone profiles in the nucleus accumbens that associate with cocaine sensitization and with metaplasticity.

                Coupling neural simulators operating on different scales enhances the explanatory power of models in neuroscience. Individual regions of interest can be simulated on the cellular level to address mechanistic questions, while the remaining network is efficiently simulated on the population level. To offer this new co-simulation capability in neuroscience, we present a design template for coupling simulators which is implemented for the workflow between The Virtual Brain and NEST. The workflow is illustrated by the use case modelling the cellular-level hippocampus of the mouse embedded into a full brain network involving micro and macro electrode recordings. This new tool of simulation will allow integrating knowledge across scales in the same simulation and validate them against multiscale experiments. Moreover it will support the interrogation on the transformation between scales.

                Calcium ions serve as key intracellular signals. Local, transient increases in calcium concentrations can activate calcium sensor proteins that in turn trigger downstream effectors. In neurons, calcium transients play a central role in regulating key neuronal processes including neurotransmitter release and synaptic plasticity. However, it is challenging to capture the molecular events associated with these localized and ephemeral calcium signals. Here we report the development of an engineered biotin ligase that combines the power of genetically encoded calcium indicators with protein proximity labeling. The enzyme, Cal-ID, biotinylates nearby proteins within minutes in response to elevated local calcium levels. The biotinylated proteins can be visualized by microscopy and identified via mass spectrometry. Cal-ID applied to mouse neurons showed increased biotinylation in active neurons, and mass spectrometry revealed active calcium signaling near Plasma Membrane Ca2+ ATPases. Therefore, we present Cal-ID as a biochemical recorder of calcium signaling and neuronal activity.

                Efforts to understand microglia function in health and diseases have been hindered by the lack of culture models that recapitulate in situ cellular properties. In recent years, the use of serum-free media with brain-derived growth factors (CSF1R ligands and TGF-{beta}1/2) have been favored for the maintenance of rodent microglia as they promote morphological features observed in situ. Here we study the functional and transcriptomic impacts of such media on human microglia. Media formulation had little impact on microglia transcriptome assessed by RNA sequencing which was sufficient to significantly alter microglia capacity to phagocytose myelin debris and to elicit an inflammatory response to lipopolysaccharide. When compared to immediately ex vivo microglia from the same donors, the addition of fetal bovine serum to culture media, but not growth factors, was found to aid in the maintenance of key signature genes including those involved in phagocytic processes. A phenotypic shift characterized by CSF1R downregulation in culture correlated with a lack of reliance on CSF1R signaling for survival. Consequently, no improvement in cell survival was observed following culture supplementation with CSF1R ligands. Our study provides better understanding of human microglia in culture, with observations that diverge from those previously made in rodent microglia.

                Purpose: To extend and optimize a non-contrast MRI technique to obtain whole head 4D (time-resolved 3D) angiographic and perfusion images from a single scan. Methods: 4D combined angiography and perfusion using radial imaging and arterial spin labeling (CAPRIA) uses pseudocontinuous labeling with a 3D golden ratio ("koosh ball") readout to continuously image the blood water as it travels through the arterial system and exchanges into the tissue. High spatial/temporal resolution angiograms and low spatial/temporal resolution perfusion images can be flexibly reconstructed from the same raw k-space data at any timepoint within the readout. A constant flip angle (CFA) and a quadratic variable flip angle (VFA) excitation schedule were optimized through simulations and tested in healthy volunteers. A conventional sensitivity encoding (SENSE) reconstruction was compared against a locally low rank (LLR) reconstruction, which leverages spatiotemporal correlations to improve reconstruction quality. Differences in image quality were assessed through split-scan repeatability. Results: The optimized VFA schedule (2-9{degrees}) reduced initial signal attenuation whilst boosting the signal at later timepoints, resulting in a significant (p < 0.001) improvement in image quality (up to 84%), particularly for the lower SNR perfusion images. The LLR reconstruction provided effective denoising without biasing the signal timecourses, significantly improving angiographic and perfusion imaging repeatability (up to 143%, p < 0.001) and enabling the clear depiction of small distal vessels and late tissue perfusion. Conclusion: 4D CAPRIA can be optimized using a VFA schedule and LLR reconstruction to yield whole head 4D angiograms and perfusion images from a single scan.

                Purpose: Magnetization transfer saturation (MTsat) is a useful marker to probe tissue macromolecular content and myelination in the brain. The increased B1+-inhomogeneity at [&ge;] 7T and significantly larger saturation pulse flip angles which are often used for postmortem studies exceed the limits where previous MTsat B1+ correction methods are applicable. Here, we develop a calibration-based correction model and procedure, and validate and evaluate it in postmortem 7T data of whole chimpanzee brains. Theory: The B1+ dependence of MTsat was investigated by varying the off-resonance saturation pulse flip angle. For the range of saturation pulse flip angles applied in typical experiments on postmortem tissue, the dependence was close to linear. A linear model with a single calibration constant C is proposed to correct bias in MTsat by mapping it to the reference value of the saturation pulse flip angle. Methods: C was estimated voxel-wise in five postmortem chimpanzee brains. Individual-based global parameters were obtained by calculating the mean C within individual specimen 15 brains and group-based global parameters by calculating the means of the individual-based global parameters across the five brains. Results: The linear calibration model described the data well, though C was not entirely independent of the underlying tissue and B1+. Individual-based and group-based global correction parameters (C = 1.2) led to visible, quantifiable reductions of B1+-biases in high resolution MTsat maps. Conclusion: The presented model and calibration approach effectively corrects for B1+ inhomogeneities in postmortem 7T data.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The neural determinants of abstract beauty</a></h4>

              
                Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we have enquired into the neural activity which correlates with the experience of beauty aroused by abstract paintings consisting of arbitrary assemblies of lines and colours. During the imaging experiments, 18 subjects viewed and rated 120 images of abstract paintings according to how beautiful they perceived them to be. There was a low agreement on the aesthetic classification of these paintings among participants. In contrast, a re-analysis of behavioural data from our previous study on face beauty revealed a much stronger inter-subject agreement for faces compared with abstract art. Representational similarity analysis (RSA) revealed that the experience of beauty when viewing abstract paintings correlated with the emergence of decodable patterns of activity in visual areas implicated in the processing of lines and colours (V1 through V4). Additionally, a parametric univariate analysis revealed higher activity in medial frontal cortex with higher aesthetic appeal. Both univariate and multivariate analyses of the imaging experiments gave broadly similar results to those obtained in previous studies on facial beauty. With abstract art, it was the involvement of visual areas implicated in the processing of lines and colours while with faces it was of visual areas implicated in the processing of faces. Both categories of aesthetic experience correlated with increased activity in medial frontal cortex. We conclude that, as with the experience of beauty in human faces, it is fundamentally the co-operative activity in these two geographically and functionally distant areas of the brain that is the basis for the experience of beauty. Further, this co-operation is enabled by "experience dependent" functional connections, in the sense that currently the existence and high specificity of these connections can only be demonstrated during certain aesthetic experiences. This does not exclude a role in aesthetic experiences for other areas which our imaging experiments have also revealed. We also conclude that the sensory areas of the visual brain have the additional role of participating in the selection of stimuli according to certain significant configurations which make them aesthetically appealing to the observer.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Interrelated effects of age and parenthood on whole-brain controllability: protective effects of parenthood in mothers</a></h4>

              
                Background: Controllability is a measure of the brain's ability to orchestrate neural activity which can be quantified in terms of the properties of the brain network connectivity. Evidence from the literature suggests that aging can exert a general effect on whole-brain controllability. Mounting evidence, on the other hand, suggests that parenthood and motherhood in particular lead to long-lasting changes in brain architecture that effectively slow down brain aging. We hypothesize that parenthood might preserve brain controllability properties from aging. Methods: In a sample of 814 healthy individuals (aged 33.9 {+/-} 12.7 years, 522 females), we estimate whole-brain controllability and compare the aging effects in subjects with vs. those without children. We use diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to estimate the brain structural connectome. The level of brain control is then calculated from the connectomic properties of the brain structure. Specifically, we measure the network control over many low-energy state transitions (average controllability) and the network control over difficult-to-reach states (modal controllability). Results and conclusion: In nulliparous females, whole-brain average controllability increases, and modal controllability decreases with age, a trend that we do not observe in parous females. Statistical comparison of the controllability metrics shows that modal controllability is higher and average controllability is lower in parous females compared to nulliparous females. In men, we observed the same trend, but the difference between nulliparous and parous males do not reach statistical significance. Our results provide strong evidence that parenthood contradicts aging effects on brain controllability and the effect is stronger in mothers.

                The blind spot is both a necessity and a nuisance for seeing. It is the portion of the visual field projecting to where the optic nerve crosses the retina, a region devoid of photoreceptors and hence visual input. The precise way in which vision transitions into blindness at the blind spot border is to date unknown. A chief challenge to map this transition is the incessant movement of the eye, which unavoidably smears measurements across space. In this study, we used high-resolution eye-tracking and state-of-the-art retinal stabilization to finely map the blind spot borders. Participants reported the onset of tiny high-contrast probes that were briefly flashed at precise positions around the blind spot. This method has sufficient resolution to enable mapping of blood vessels from psychophysical measurements. Our data show that, even after accounting for eye movements, the transition zones at the edges of the blind spot are considerable. On the horizontal meridian, the regions with detection rates between 80% and 20% span approximately 25% of the overall width of the blind spot. These borders also vary considerably in size across different axes. These data show that the transition from full visibility to blindness at the blind spot border is not abrupt but occurs over a broad area.

                Stem cells in the adult brain are specialized astrocytes capable of generating neurons and glial cells. While neural stem cells (NSCs) and common astrocytes have clearly distinct functions, they share highly similar transcriptome profiles. How stemness is molecularly encoded is therefore unclear. Here we use single-cell NMT-seq to simultaneously characterize the transcriptome, DNA methylome and chromatin accessibility of astrocytes and the NSC lineage in the healthy and ischemic brain. Our data reveal distinct methylation profiles associated with either astrocyte or stem cell function. Stemness is conferred by methylation of astrocyte genes and demethylation of neurogenic genes that are expressed only later. Surprisingly, ischemic injury unlocks the stemness-methylome in common astrocytes enabling generation of neuroblasts. Furthermore, we show that oligodendrocytes employ Tet-mediated demethylation to regulate expression of myelin-related genes, many of which are abnormally methylated in multiple sclerosis. Overall, we show that DNA methylation is a promising target for regenerative medicine.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Familiarity of Background Music Modulates the Cortical Tracking of Target Speech at the Cocktail Party</a></h4>

              
                The cocktail party problem, or how a listener perceives speech in noisy environments, is typically studied using speech (multi-talker babble) or noise maskers. However, realistic cocktail party scenarios often include background music (e.g., coffee shops, concerts). Studies investigating the effect of music on concurrent speech perception have predominantly used highly controlled synthetic music or shaped noise which do not reflect naturalistic listening environments. Behaviorally, familiar background music and songs with vocals/lyrics inhibit concurrent speech recognition. Here, we investigated the neural bases of these effects. While recording multichannel EEG, participants listened to an audiobook while popular songs (or silence) played in the background at 0 dB signal-to-noise ratio. Songs were either familiar or unfamiliar to listeners and featured either vocals or isolated instrumentals from the original audio recordings. Comprehension questions probed task engagement. We used temporal response functions (TRFs) to isolate cortical tracking to the target speech envelope and analyzed neural responses around 100 ms (i.e., auditory N1 wave). We found that speech comprehension was, expectedly, impaired during background music(s) compared to silence. Target speech tracking was further hindered by the presence of vocals. When masked by familiar music, response latencies to speech were less susceptible to informational masking, suggesting concurrent neural tracking of speech was easier during music known to the listener. These differential effects of music familiarity were further exacerbated in listeners with less musical ability. Our neuroimaging results and their dependence on listening skills are consistent with early attentional gain mechanisms where familiar music is easier to tune out (listeners already know the song expectancies) and thus can allocate fewer attentional resources to the background music to better monitor concurrent speech material.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Hippocampal and caudate network specificity is altered in older adults</a></h4>

              
                The hippocampal and the caudate networks, defined by their intrinsic resting state functional connectivity (FC), exhibit strong network specificity. This is reflected as strong within network and weak between-network FC, as well as their dissociable roles in cognition. Aging typically reduces the specificity of brain networks. However, whether the hippocampal and caudate networks show age-related decreases in network specificity is unclear. Further, whether any age-related decreases in network specificity are due to reduced within-network FC, increased between-network FC, or some combination of both, is also unclear. Using a large-scale fMRI data set acquired from healthy younger (n = 101, aged 18 to 40 years) and older (n = 101, 55 to 75 years) adults, networks centered on the left anterior hippocampus and the head of the right caudate nucleus were compared. These sub regions were chosen based on their distinct contributions to cognition, their known interactions, and their susceptibility to age related changes. A mixed effect model was used to identify brain regions where network specificity differed between groups. For younger adults, hippocampal network specificity was strong in the medial frontal gyrus (MFG), while caudate network specificity was strong in the basal nuclei. However, network specificity in these same regions was significantly reduced in older adults. Reduced specificity in each network was due to a weakening of within-network connectivity rather than an increase in between-network connectivity. These results indicate that hippocampal and caudate network specificity decreases with advancing age, raising the possibility that these reductions may contribute to age-related changes in memory.

                Experiments employing chronic monitoring of neurophysiological signals and video are commonly used in studies of epilepsy to characterize behavioral correlates of seizures. Our objective was to design a low-cost platform that enables chronic monitoring of several animals simultaneously, synchronizes bilateral local field potential and video streams in real-time, and parses recorded data into manageable file sizes. We present a hardware solution leveraging Intan and Open Ephys acquisition systems and a software solution implemented in Bonsai. The platform was tested in 48-hour continuous recordings simultaneously from multiple mice (male and female) with chronic epilepsy. To enable seizure detection and scoring, we developed a graphical user interface (GUI) that reads the data produced by our workflow and allows a user with no coding expertise to analyze events. Our Bonsai workflow was designed to maximize flexibility for a wide variety of experimental applications, and our use of the Open Ephys acquisition board would allow for scaling recordings up to 128 channels per animal.

                People can seamlessly integrate a vast array of information from what we see and hear in the noisy and uncertain world. However, the neural underpinnings of audiovisual integration continue to be the topic of debate. Using strict inclusion criteria, we performed activation likelihood estimation meta-analysis on 121 neuroimaging experiments with a total of 2,092 participants. We found that audiovisual integration is linked with the coexistence of multiple integration sites including early cortical, subcortical, and higher association areas. Although activity was consistently found within the superior temporal cortex, different portions of this cortical region were identified depending on the analytical contrast used, complexity of the stimuli, and modality within which attention was directed. The context-dependent neural activity related to audiovisual integration suggests a flexible rather than fixed neural pathway for audiovisual integration. Together, our findings highlight a flexible multiple pathways model for audiovisual integration, with superior temporal cortex as the central node in these neural assemblies.

                Luminance causes the pupillary light response (PLR), a constriction of the pupil. Surprisingly, mere illusions of brightness evoke a pupil constriction in humans. Since brightness illusions depend on scene and context, this suggests that high-level visual processing has a top-down influence onto the brainstem neurons controlling the PLR. The influence of high-level vision on this brainstem-mediated reflex is thought to be restricted to primates that perform foveal fixation. Here, we report that the same brightness illusions that evoke a pupil constriction in humans also do so in rats (N = 14). This response occurred only for stimuli that matched the spectral sensitivity of the rat retina. We recorded 32-channel cortex-wide EEG and found that illusory brightness stimuli also evoked a larger primary visual cortex event-related potential. This neural response preceded pupil constriction by ~335 msec. Thus, primary visual cortex may contribute to the PLR evoked by passive viewing of brightness illusions. Our results resolve whether this phenomenon is confined to primates by showing that it can also be found in rats.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Reproducibility of Principal and Independent Genomic Components of Brain Structure and Function</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Human brain structure and function, as measured using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), is heritable. The genetic associations are highly polygenic and pleiotropic, complicating translation of genetic association studies to concrete biological processes. We recently proposed genomic independent component analysis (ICA) to reduce a large array of genome-wide association study (GWAS) statistics into a number of more interpretable multivariate components. Here, we extend this work with genomic principal component analysis (PCA). We also estimate the inter-trait stability and test-retest reliability of genomic PCA and ICA. As a benchmark, we provide a head-to-head comparison with the reproducibility of original (i.e., raw univariate) GWAS variant effect sizes from which the components were derived. Methods: We considered summary statistics of two rounds of brain MRI GWAS in UK biobank encompassing 22,138 and 11,086 subjects and thousands of imaging-derived phenotypes (IDPs) retrieved from Oxford BIG-40 server. We decomposed the clumped brain-wide genome-wide matrix (n=157,893 variants and m=2,240 brain IDPs) by PCA and ICA to obtain up to 50 principal and independent genome-wide components. We tested the reproducibility of these genomic components using tail overlap coefficient and Pearson's correlation. Decompositions were repeated 20 times on randomly permuted split-half matrices to arrive at an empirical distribution of the above reproducibility metrics. As a benchmark, we also provide comparisons with the reproducibility of the original univariate GWAS effect sizes from which the components were derived. Results: The first ten principal genomic components were highly stable across trait-subsets within samples (r=0.82 {+/-} 0.15; mean {+/-} standard deviation). PCA cross-sample reproducibility dropped to r=0.16 {+/-} 0.07 (r-max=0.30) was still a substantial improvement over univariate GWAS reproducibility r=0.09 {+/-} 0.05. ICA components showed higher within-sample reproducibility at lower dimensions (ICA dimension-5: r=0.81 {+/-} 0.16 vs. ICA dimension-50: r=0.41 {+/-} 0.13). The same trend was observed for their cross-sample reproducibility, achieving an r-max of 0.27 at the lowest ICA dimension of five (average r=0.20 {+/-} 0.3) vs. r-max of 0.11 at dimension 50 (average r=0.05 {+/-} 0.02). Conclusion: Overall, the cross-sample reproducibility of PCA and ICA components are moderate, but considerably better than the reproducibility of the raw univariate GWAS effect sizes. Genomic PCA identified highly reproducible and pleiotropic genomic effects across many brain traits in just 1-3 factors. Genomic ICA captured mutually independent genome-wide effects that may be more sensitive to distinct biological pathways. As GWAS samples continue to increase and more (endo)phenotypes become available in biobanks, multi-trait genome-wide associations of the brain decomposed by ICA and PCA will likely become more reproducible and interpretable.

                The ability to view human tissue samples in 3D, with both cellular resolution and a large field of view (FOVs), can considerably improve fundamental and clinical investigations. Here, we demonstrate the feasibility of light-sheet imaging of ~50 x 35 x 3 mm (i.e., ~5 cm3) sized formalin fixed human brain and up to ~40 x 35 x 5 mm (i.e. ~7 cm3) sized formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) prostate (prostatectomy) cancer samples, which have been processed with the FFPE-MASH clearing and labelling protocol. To this end, we present a light-sheet microscopy prototype, the cleared-tissue dual view Selective Plane Illumination Microscope (ct-dSPIM), capable of fast, high-resolution acquisitions, as well as cubic centimetre-scale (many cm in lateral size and up to 5 mm thick) imaging of cleared tissue in 3D. To focus on fast 3D overview scans of entire tissue samples or cubic centimetre-scale selected regions of Interest (ROIs), we explored the use of stage scanned acquisitions with slice spacing on the order of the axial resolution (i.e. light-sheet thickness) and corresponding in-plane down sampling to achieve isotropic resolution, which we term Mosaic scans. These Mosaic scans allow for fast 3D overview scans of entire tissue samples (Mosaic 16 with 16.4 microns isotropic resolution) at approx. 8-16 hrs, ~1 cm3/h, or higher resolution overviews of large, selected ROIs (Mosaic with 4.1 microns isotropic resolution) 3-4 hrs, ~1 cm3/h, speed. We were able to select and visualise ROIs around the border of human brain area V1 and V2, as well as 3D prostate morphology in human prostatectomy cancer biopsies. We show that ct-dSPIM imaging, including Mosaic scans is an excellent technique to assess entire MASH prepared large-scale human tissue samples and enable multiscale investigations and quantification (e.g. cell count) in 3D.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Time-dependent maximum entropy model for populations of retinal ganglion cells</a></h4>

              
                The inverse Ising model is used in computational neuroscience to infer probability distributions of the synchronous activity of large neuronal populations. This method allows for finding the Boltzmann distribution with single neuron biases and pairwise interactions that maximizes the entropy and reproduces the empirical statistics of the recorded neuronal activity. Here we apply this strategy to large populations of retinal output neurons (ganglion cells) of different types, stimulated by multiple visual stimuli with their own statistics. The activity of retinal output neurons is driven by both the inputs from upstream neurons, which encode the visual information and reflect stimulus statistics, and the recurrent connections, which induce network effects. We first apply the standard inverse Ising model approach, and show that it accounts well for the system's collective behavior when the input visual stimulus has short-ranged spatial correlations, but fails for long-ranged ones. This happens because stimuli with long-ranged spatial correlations synchronize the activity of neurons over long distances. This effect cannot be accounted for by pairwise interactions, and so by the pairwise Ising model. To solve this issue, we apply a previously proposed framework that includes a temporal dependence in the single neurons biases to model how neurons are driven in time by the stimulus. Thanks to this addition, the stimulus effects are taken into account by the biases, and the pairwise interactions allow for characterizing the network effect in the population activity and for reproducing the structure of the recurrent functional connections in the retinal architecture. In particular, the inferred interactions are strong and positive only for nearby neurons of the same type. Inter-type connections are instead small and slightly negative. Therefore, the retinal architecture splits into weakly interacting subpopulations composed of strongly interacting neurons. Overall, this temporal framework fixes the problems of the standard, static, inverse Ising model and accounts for the system's collective behavior, for stimuli with either short or long-range correlations.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">In search of a brain microbiome: A machine learning search pipeline for electron microscopy images of brain tissue</a></h4>

              
                The healthy human brain has long been considered a sterile environment, with the blood brain barrier preventing the formation of a bacterial brain microbiome. Recent electron microscopy (EM) imaging of brain tissue has, however, provided the first preliminary evidence of bacteria in otherwise healthy brain slices. Whether due to contamination, disease, or a previously unknown relationship of bacteria to healthy brain tissue, novel tools are needed to detect and search for bacteria in nanoscale, volumetric EM images. While computer vision tools are widely used in cell segmentation and object detection problems in EM imaging, no bacteria detection tool or dataset exists. Overcoming the rarity of training data, this work presents the first pipeline for training a bacteria detection network for EM images, leveraging existing deep networks for object detection. A deployment and proofreading pipeline is presented, along with characterization of deployment to public EM image datasets. While bacteria in healthy brain tissue were not discovered in this work, this tool presents an opportunity for large scale bacteria search in EM imaging for both scientific discovery and experimental quality control, and serves more generally as a framework for sparse object detection in large imagery datasets.

                We explore neural avalanches, and the scaling relation among critical exponents, in overnight EEG recordings in human healthy subjects, during NREM sleep. Notably, the distributions of the avalanches size and duration are well described by a power law, with critical exponents in agreement with mean-field directed percolation class. Moreover, we study the correlation between the avalanches spatiotemporal structure and the sleep macro and microstructure as reflected by the CAP framework. Overall, our findings provide evidence of a link between the avalanches occurrence, slow-wave sleep dynamics, sleep stages transitions and CAP-phase A.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Innexin-mediated adhesion between glia is required for axon ensheathment in the peripheral nervous system</a></h4>

              
                Glia are essential to protecting and enabling nervous system function and a key glial function is the formation of the glial sheath around peripheral axons. Each peripheral nerve in the Drosophila larva is ensheathed by three glial layers, which structurally support and insulate the peripheral axons. How peripheral glia communicate with each other and between layers is not well established and we investigated the role of Innexins in mediating glial function in the Drosophila periphery. Of the eight Drosophila Innexins, we found two (Inx1 and Inx2) are important for peripheral glia development. In particular loss of Inx1 and Inx2 resulted in defects in the wrapping glia leading to disruption of the glia wrap. Of interest loss of Inx2 in the subperineurial glia also resulted in defects in the neighbouring wrapping glia. Inx plaques were observed between the subperineurial glia and the wrapping glia suggesting that gap junctions link these two glial cell types. We found Inx2 is key to Ca+2 pulses in the peripheral subperineurial glia but not in the wrapping glia, and we found no evidence of gap junction communication between subperineurial and wrapping glia. Rather we have clear evidence that Inx2 plays an adhesive and channel-independent role between the subperineurial and wrapping glia to ensure the integrity of the glial wrap.

                Microglia regulate multiple processes in the central nervous system, exhibiting a significant level of cellular plasticity which is facilitated by an equally dynamic transcriptional environment. While many gene networks that regulate microglial functions have been characterised, the influence of epigenetic regulators such as small non-coding microRNAs (miRNAs) is less well defined. We have sequenced the miRNAome and mRNAome of mouse microglia during brain development and adult homeostasis, identifying unique profiles of known and novel miRNAs. Microglia express both a consistently enriched miRNA signature as well as temporally distinctive subsets of miRNAs. We generated robust miRNA-mRNA networks related to fundamental developmental processes, in addition to networks associated with immune function and dysregulated disease states. There was no apparent influence of sex on miRNA expression. This study reveals a unique developmental trajectory of miRNA expression in microglia during critical stages of CNS development, establishing miRNAs as important modulators of microglial phenotype.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Asymmetric learning of dynamic spatial regularities in visual search: facilitation of anticipated target locations, no suppression of predictable distractor locations</a></h4>

              
                Static statistical regularities in the placement of targets and salient distractors within the search display can be learned and used to optimize attentional guidance. Whether statistical learning also extends to dynamic regularities governing the placement of targets and distractors on successive trials has been less investigated. Here, we applied the same dynamic cross-trial regularity (one-step shift of the critical item in clock-/counterclockwise direction) either to the target or a distractor, and additionally varied whether the distractor was defined in a different (color) or the same dimension (shape) as the target. We found robust learning of the predicted target location: processing of the target at this (vs. a random) location was facilitated. But we found no evidence of proactive suppression of the predictable distractor location. Facilitation of the anticipated target location was associated with explicit awareness of the dynamic regularity, whereas participants showed no awareness of the distractor regularity. We propose that this asymmetry arises because, owing to the target's central role in the task set, its location is explicitly encoded in working memory, enabling the learning of dynamic regularities. In contrast, the distractor is not explicitly encoded; so, statistical learning of distractor locations is limited to static regularities.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Fast-local and slow-global neural ensembles in the mouse brain</a></h4>

              
                Ensembles of neurons are thought to be co-active when participating in brain computations. However, it is unclear what principles determine whether an ensemble remains localised within a single brain region, or spans multiple brain regions. To address this, we analysed electrophysiological neural population data from hundreds of neurons recorded simultaneously across nine brain regions in awake mice. At fast sub-second timescales, spike count correlations between pairs of neurons in the same brain region were stronger than for pairs of neurons spread across different brain regions. In contrast at slower timescales, within- and between-region spike count correlations were similar. Correlations between high-firing-rate neuron pairs showed a stronger dependence on timescale than low-firing-rate neuron pairs. We applied an ensemble detection algorithm to the neural correlation data and found that at fast timescales each ensemble was mostly contained within a single brain region, whereas at slower timescales ensembles spanned multiple brain regions. These results suggest that the mouse brain performs fast-local and slow-global computations in parallel.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">ModelArray: a memory-efficient R package for statistical analysis of fixel data</a></h4>

              
                Diffusion MRI is the dominant non-invasive imaging method used to characterize white matter organization in health and disease. Increasingly, fiber-specific properties within a voxel are analyzed using fixels. While tools for conducting statistical analyses of fixel data exist, currently available tools are memory intensive, difficult to scale to large datasets, and support only a limited number of statistical models. Here we introduce ModelArray, a memory-efficient R package for mass-univariate statistical analysis of fixel data. With only several lines of code, even large fixel datasets can be analyzed using a standard personal computer. At present, ModelArray supports linear models as well as generalized additive models (GAMs), which are particularly useful for studying nonlinear effects in lifespan data. Detailed memory profiling revealed that ModelArray required only limited memory even for large datasets. As an example, we applied ModelArray to fixel data derived from diffusion images acquired as part of the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (n=938). ModelArray required far less memory than existing tools and revealed anticipated nonlinear developmental effects in white matter. Moving forward, ModelArray is supported by an open-source software development model that can incorporate additional statistical models and other imaging data types. Taken together, ModelArray provides an efficient and flexible platform for statistical analysis of fixel data.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Noise correlations in the owl optic tectum are differentially impacted by unimodal vs crossmodal competitors</a></h4>

              
                Multisensory integration in mammalian superior colliculus and its avian homolog, the optic tectum, is essential for rapid orienting towards salient stimuli. The benefits of combining across modalities is expected to depend in part on interneuronal noise correlations (NCs) and trial-to-trial response variance (Fano factor; FF), yet there is scant data on these topics. Here we used multielectrode arrays (MEAs) to record simultaneously from cohorts of single units in the deep layers of the owl optic tectum (OTd). Stimuli were presented individually or simultaneously as spatially aligned or non-aligned competitors. NC values varied from -0.35 to 0.94, an unexpectedly large range, and decreased only modestly as receptive fields diverged. Spatially aligned bimodal stimuli summed in a largely additive fashion over a wide range of response magnitudes. Most of the observed variance in bimodal NCs and FFs could be accounted for by an additive rule without accounting for internal noise. For non-aligned stimuli, crossmodal competitors decreased FFs, whereas unimodal competitors did not. Most striking, visual competitors decreased NCs for auditory drivers but increased NCs for visual drivers, indicating that the OTd network is differentially wired to process bimodal competitors. In total, these data provide novel descriptive information regarding the correlational structure of OTd neurons underlying multisensory processing.

	<p>Disease modification trials in dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) have not met with success. One potential criticism of these trials is the lack of sensitive outcome measures. A large number of outcome measures have been employed in dementia and MCI trials. This review aims to describe and analyze the utility of cognitive/clinical outcome measures in Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD) and MCI trials. Methods: A PubMed search was conducted using relevant MeSH terms and exploded keywords. The search was confined to English language publications of human studies from the last five years which describe the latest trends in the use of outcome measures. Results: Despite broad use, the outcome measures employed are heterogeneous, with little data on correlations between scales. Another problem is that most studies are over-reliant on clinician/researcher assessment and cognitive outcomes, and there is a definite lack of stakeholder input. Finetuning of the paradigm is also required for people with early-stage disease, mild to moderate disease, and advanced dementia, as the outcome measures in these subgroups have varying relevance. Disease modification/prevention is an appropriate goal in early disease, whereas palliation and freedom from discomfort are paramount in later stages. The outcome measures selected must be suitable for and sensitive to these particular care goals. Although there is a shift to enrich MCI cohorts using a biomarker-based approach, the clinical relevance of such outcome measures remains uncertain. Conclusions: Outcome measures in dementia/MCI trials remain inhomogeneous and diverse, despite extensive use. Outcome measures fall within several paradigms, including cognitive, functional, quality-of-life, biomarker-based, and patient-reported outcome measures. The success of future disease-modifying trials is reliant to a large extent on the selection of outcome measures which combine all outcomes of clinical relevance as well as clinical meaning. Outcome measures should be tied to the type and stage of dementia and to the specific interventions employed.</p>

	<p>Although cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is effective for patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), 40% of OCD patients show a poor response to CBT. This study aimed to identify the cortical structural factors that predict CBT outcomes in OCD patients. A total of 56 patients with OCD received baseline structural MRI (sMRI) scanning and 14 individual CBT sessions. The linear support vector regression (SVR) models were used to identify the predictive performance of sMRI indices, including gray matter volume, cortical thickness, sulcal depth, and gyrification value. The patients&amp;amp;rsquo; OC symptoms decreased significantly after CBT intervention (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). We found the model with the comprehensive variables exhibited better performance than the models with single structural indices (MAE = 0.14, MSE = 0.03, R2 = 0.36), showing a significant correlation between the true value and the predicted value (r = 0.63, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). The results indicated that a model integrating four cortical structural features can accurately predict the effectiveness of CBT for OCD. Future models incorporating other brain indicators, including brain functional indicators, EEG indicators, neurotransmitters, etc., which might be more accurate for predicting the effectiveness of CBT for OCD, are needed.</p>

	<p>In this study, we compared the differences in brain activation associated with the different types of objects using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Twenty-six participants in their 20s underwent fMRI while grasping four different types of objects. After the experiment, all of the participants completed a questionnaire based on the Likert Scale, which asked them about the sensations they experienced while grasping each object (comfort, hardness, pain, ease in grasping). We investigated the relationship between brain activity and the results of the survey; characteristic brain activity for each object was correlated with the results of the questionnaire, indicating that each object produced a different sensation response in the participants. Additionally, we observed brain activity in the primary somatosensory cortex (postcentral gyrus), the primary motor cortex (precentral gyrus), and the cerebellum exterior during the gripping task. Our study shows that gripping different objects produces activity in specific and distinct brain regions and suggests an &amp;amp;ldquo;action appraisal&amp;amp;rdquo; mechanism, which is considered to be the act of integrating multiple different sensory information and connecting it to actual action. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to observe brain activity in response to tactile stimuli and motor activity simultaneously.</p>

	<p>Apathy is a neurobehavioural symptom affecting Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease patients of all disease stages. Apathy seems to be associated with a specific underlying non-motor disease subtype and reflects dysfunction of separate neural networks with distinct neurotransmitter systems. Due to the complicated neuropsychiatric aetiology of apathy, clinical assessment of this invalidating non-motor symptom remains challenging. We aim to summarize the current findings on apathy in Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease and highlight knowledge gaps. We will discuss the prevalence rates across the different disease stages and suggest screening tools for clinically relevant apathetic symptoms. We will approach the fundamental knowledge on the neural networks implicated in apathy in a practical manner and formulate recommendations on patient-tailored treatment. We will discuss the Park apathy phenotype in detail, shedding light on different clinical manifestations and implications for prognosis. With this review, we strive to distil the vast available theoretical knowledge into a clinical and patient-oriented perspective.</p>

                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>Neuropathological studies have shown that multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions are heterogeneous in terms of myelin/axon damage and repair as well as iron content. However, it remains a challenge to identify specific chronic lesion types, especially remyelinated lesions, in vivo in patients with MS.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed 3 studies: (1) a cross-sectional study in a prospective cohort of 115 patients with MS and 76 healthy controls, who underwent 3 T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM), myelin water fraction (MWF), and neurite density index (NDI) maps. White matter (WM) lesions in QSM were classified into 5 QSM lesion types (iso-intense, hypo-intense, hyperintense, lesions with hypo-intense rims, and lesions with paramagnetic rim legions [PRLs]); (2) a longitudinal study of 40 patients with MS to study the evolution of lesions over 2 years; (3) a postmortem histopathology-QSM validation study in 3 brains of patients with MS to assess the accuracy of QSM classification to identify neuropathological lesion types in 63 WM lesions.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>At baseline, hypo- and isointense lesions showed higher mean MWF and NDI values compared to other QSM lesion types (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001). Further, at 2-year follow-up, hypo-/iso-intense lesions showed an increase in MWF. Postmortem analyses revealed that QSM highly accurately identifies (1) fully remyelinated areas as hypo-/iso-intense (sensitivity = 88.89% and specificity = 100%), (2) chronic inactive lesions as hyperintense (sensitivity = 71.43% and specificity = 92.00%), and (3) chronic active/smoldering lesions as PRLs (sensitivity = 92.86% and specificity = 86.36%).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These results provide the first evidence that it is possible to distinguish chronic MS lesions in a clinical setting, hereby supporting with new biomarkers to develop and assess remyelinating treatments. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

                Background: Benzodiazepines and antidepressants are known to alter responses to empathic pain when used alone, however the effects of their combined use on empathy are unknown. In order to examine the effects of concomitant benzodiazepines and antidepressants long-term use on perspective-taking, we analyzed behavioral and neural changes on perspective-taking ability using event-related potentials. Methods: To this purpose, 13 long-term concomitant benzodiazepines and antidepressants users and 13 healthy controls performed a task designed to assess affective perspective-taking with simultaneous EEG recording. Results: The behavioral results revealed similar performance between groups. The neural results showed no significant differences between groups for the N170 and late positive potential (LPP) components. These results seem to suggest that long-term use of benzodiazepines and antidepressants together does not affect perspective-taking abilities nor the processing of related information. Conclusions: The concomitant benzodiazepines and antidepressants long-term use seem to preserve the perspective-taking ability of social cognition.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To assess the effects of demographics, lifestyle factors, and comorbidities on serum neurofilament light chain (sNfL) levels in people without neurologic disease and establish demographic-specific reference ranges of sNfL.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is a representative sample of the US population in which detailed information on demographic, lifestyle, routine laboratory tests, and overall health status are systematically collected. From stored serum samples, we measured sNfL levels using a novel high-throughput immunoassay (Siemens Healthineers). We evaluated the predictive capacity of 52 demographic, lifestyle, comorbidity, anthropometric, or laboratory characteristics in explaining variability in sNfL levels. Predictive performance was assessed using cross-validated <i>R</i>
<sup>2</sup> (<i>R</i>
<sup>2</sup>
<sub>cv</sub>) and forward selection was used to obtain a set of best predictors of sNfL levels. Adjusted reference ranges were derived incorporating characteristics using generalized additive models for location, scale, and shape.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We included 1,706 NHANES participants (average age: 43.6 ± 14.8 y; 50.6% male, 35% non-white) without neurological disorders. In univariate models, age explained the most variability in sNfL (<i>R</i>
<sup>2</sup>
<sub>cv</sub> = 26.8%). Multivariable prediction models for sNfL contained three covariates (in order of their selection): age, creatinine, and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) (standardized β—age: 0.46, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.43, 0.50; creatinine: 0.18, 95% CI: 0.13, 0.22; HbA1c: 0.09, 95% CI: 0.06, 0.11). Adjusted centile curves were derived incorporating identified predictors. We provide an interactive R Shiny application to translate our findings and allow other investigators to use the derived centile curves.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Results will help to guide interpretation of sNfL levels as they relate to neurologic conditions. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

                Didelphys uterus is one of the rarest Müllerian duct anomalies (MDA) of the female genital tract. Many remain undiagnosed due to possibilities of successful pregnancies and vaginal deliveries in those without or with mild forms of associated cervical and/or vaginal anomalies.  Due to this, data on didelphys uterus in pregnancy are rare, with most cases seen during routine ultrasound in pregnancies’ Caesarean section for other obstetric indications. This case was a 36-year-old G4P1+2 female who had successful vaginal delivery in her preceding pregnancy; in index pregnancy, she presented with fetal footling breech in labour and had an emergency caesarean section during which uterine didelphys was diagnosed. Many pregnant women with didelphys uterus will deliver vaginally and, as such, remain undiagnosed.  Its presence is one of the possible reasons for persistent abnormal presentations like fetal breech presentation, especially in women with prior successful vaginal deliveries. Early recognition and availability of facilities for management of such incidentally found cases of uterine didelphys will prevent many of the complications associated with pregnancy with them.

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Direct Observation of Compartment-Specific Localization and Dynamics of Voltage-Gated Sodium Channels</a></h4>

              
                <p>Brain enriched voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) Na<SUB>v</SUB>1.2 and Na<SUB>v</SUB>1.6 are critical for electrical signaling in the CNS. Previous studies have extensively characterized cell-type-specific expression and electrophysiological properties of these two VGSCs and how their differences contribute to fine-tuning of neuronal excitability. However, because of a lack of reliable labeling and imaging methods, the subcellular localization and dynamics of these homologous Na<SUB>v</SUB>1.2 and Na<SUB>v</SUB>1.6 channels remain understudied. To overcome this challenge, we combined genome editing, super-resolution, and live-cell single-molecule imaging to probe subcellular composition, relative abundances, and trafficking dynamics of Na<SUB>v</SUB>1.2 and Na<SUB>v</SUB>1.6 in cultured mouse and rat neurons and in male and female mouse brain. We discovered a previously uncharacterized trafficking pathway that targets Na<SUB>v</SUB>1.2 to the distal axon of unmyelinated neurons. This pathway uses distinct signals residing in the intracellular loop 1 between transmembrane domain I and II to suppress the retention of Na<SUB>v</SUB>1.2 in the axon initial segment and facilitate its membrane loading at the distal axon. As mouse pyramidal neurons undergo myelination, Na<SUB>v</SUB>1.2 is gradually excluded from the distal axon as Na<SUB>v</SUB>1.6 becomes the dominant VGSC in the axon initial segment and nodes of Ranvier. In addition, we revealed exquisite developmental regulation of Na<SUB>v</SUB>1.2 and Na<SUB>v</SUB>1.6 localizations in the axon initial segment and dendrites, clarifying the molecular identity of sodium channels in these subcellular compartments. Together, these results unveiled compartment-specific localizations and trafficking mechanisms for VGSCs, which could be regulated separately to modulate membrane excitability in the brain.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Direct observation of endogenous voltage-gated sodium channels reveals a previously uncharacterized distal axon targeting mechanism and the molecular identity of sodium channels in distinct subcellular compartments.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">The Antiseizure Drug Perampanel Is a Subunit-Selective Negative Allosteric Modulator of Kainate Receptors</a></h4>

              
                <p>Perampanel (PMP) is a third-generation antiseizure drug reported to be a potent and selective noncompetitive negative allosteric modulator of one subfamily of ionotropic glutamate receptor (iGluR), the &alpha;-amino-3-hydroxy-S-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid receptors (AMPARs). However, the recent structural resolution of AMPARs in complex with PMP revealed that its binding pocket is formed from residues that are largely conserved in two members of another family of iGluRs, the GluK4 and GluK5 kainate receptor (KAR) subunits. We show here that PMP inhibits both recombinant and neuronal KARs, contrary to the previous reports, and that the negative allosteric modulator (NAM) activity requires GluK5 subunits to be channel constituents. PMP inhibited heteromeric GluK1/GluK5 and GluK2/GluK5 KARs at IC<SUB>50</SUB> values comparable to that for AMPA receptors but was much less potent on homomeric GluK1 or GluK2 KARs. The auxiliary subunits Neto1 or Neto2 also made GluK2-containing KARs more sensitive to inhibition. Finally, PMP inhibited mouse neuronal KARs containing GluK5 subunits and Neto proteins in nociceptive dorsal root ganglia neurons and hippocampal mossy fiber&ndash;CA3 pyramidal neuron synapses. These data suggest that clinical actions of PMP could arise from differential inhibition of AMPAR or KAR signaling and that more selective drugs might maintain antiseizure efficacy while reducing adverse effects.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> PMP is a regulatory approved antiseizure drug used for refractory partial-onset and generalized tonic-clonic seizures that acts as a selective negative allosteric modulator of AMPARs. Here, we demonstrate that PMP inhibits KARs, a second family of ionotropic glutamate receptors, in addition to AMPARs. NAM activity on KARs required GluK5 subunits or Neto auxiliary subunits as channel constituents. KAR inhibition, therefore, could contribute to PMP antiseizure action or the adverse effects that are significant with this drug. Drug discovery aimed at more selective allosteric modulators that discriminate between AMPARs and KARs could yield next-generation drugs with improved therapeutic profiles for treatment of epilepsy.</p>

                <p>During mammalian neocortex development, nascent pyramidal neurons migrate along radial glial cells and overtake earlier-born neurons to terminate at the front of the developing cortical plate (CP), leading to the outward expansion of the CP border. While much has been learned about the cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie the migration of pyramidal neurons, how migrating neurons bypass the preceding neurons at the end of migration to reach their final positions remains poorly understood. Here, we report that Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule (DSCAM) is required for migrating neurons to bypass their postmigratory predecessors during the expansion of the upper cortical layers. DSCAM is a type I transmembrane cell adhesion molecule. It has been linked to Down syndrome through its location on Chromosome 21 trisomy and to autism spectrum disorders through loss-of-function mutations. <I>Ex vivo</I> time-lapse imaging demonstrates that DSCAM is required for migrating neurons to bypass their postmigratory predecessors, crossing the CP border to expand the upper cortical layers. In <I>DSCAM</I>-deficient cortices, migrating neurons stop prematurely under the CP border, leading to thinner upper cortical layers with higher neuronal density. We further show that DSCAM weakens cell adhesion mediated by N-cadherin in the upper cortical plate, allowing migrating neurons to traverse the CP border and expand the CP. These findings suggest that DSCAM is required for proper migratory termination and final positioning of nascent pyramidal neurons, which may provide insight into brain disorders that exhibit thinner upper layers of the cerebral cortex without neuronal loss.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Newly born neurons in the developing mammalian neocortex migrate outward toward the cortical surface, bypassing earlier born neurons to expand the developing cortex. How migrating neurons bypass the preceding neurons and terminate at the front of the expanding cortex remains poorly understood. We demonstrate that Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule (DSCAM), linked to Down syndrome and autism spectrum disorder, is required by migrating neurons to bypass their postmigratory predecessors and terminate migration in the outwardly expanding cortical layer. Migrating neurons deficient in <I>DSCAM</I> stop prematurely, failing to expand the cortex. We further show that DSCAM likely mediates migratory termination by weakening cell adhesion mediated by N-cadherin.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Astrocytes Sustain Circadian Oscillation and Bidirectionally Determine Circadian Period, But Do Not Regulate Circadian Phase in the Suprachiasmatic Nucleus</a></h4>

              
                <p>The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is the master circadian clock of mammals, generating and transmitting an internal representation of environmental time that is produced by the cell-autonomous transcriptional/post-translational feedback loops (TTFLs) of the 10,000 neurons and 3500 glial cells. Recently, we showed that TTFL function in SCN astrocytes alone is sufficient to drive circadian timekeeping and behavior, raising questions about the respective contributions of astrocytes and neurons within the SCN circuit. We compared their relative roles in circadian timekeeping in mouse SCN explants, of either sex. Treatment with the glial-specific toxin fluorocitrate revealed a requirement for metabolically competent astrocytes for circuit-level timekeeping. Recombinase-mediated genetically complemented Cryptochrome (Cry) proteins in Cry1-deficient and/or Cry2-deficient SCNs were used to compare the influence of the TTFLs of neurons or astrocytes in the initiation of <I>de novo</I> oscillation or in pacemaking. While neurons and astrocytes both initiated <I>de novo</I> oscillation and lengthened the period equally, their kinetics were different, with astrocytes taking twice as long. Furthermore, astrocytes could shorten the period, but not as potently as neurons. Chemogenetic manipulation of Gi- and Gq-coupled signaling pathways in neurons acutely advanced or delayed the ensemble phase, respectively. In contrast, comparable manipulations in astrocytes were without effect. Thus, astrocytes can initiate SCN rhythms and bidirectionally control the SCN period, albeit with lower potency than neurons. Nevertheless, their activation does not influence the SCN phase. The emergent SCN properties of high-amplitude oscillation, initiation of rhythmicity, pacemaking, and phase are differentially regulated: astrocytes and neurons sustain the ongoing oscillation, but its phase is determined by neurons.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) encodes and disseminates time-of-day information to allow mammals to adapt their physiology to daily environmental cycles. Recent investigations have revealed a role for astrocytes, in addition to neurons, in the regulation of this rhythm. Using pharmacology, genetic complementation, and chemogenetics, we compared the abilities of neurons and astrocytes in determining the emergent SCN properties of high-amplitude oscillation, initiation of rhythmicity, pacemaking, and determination of phase. These findings parameterize the circadian properties of the astrocyte population in the SCN and reveal the types of circadian information that astrocytes and neurons can contribute within their heterogeneous cellular network.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Subthalamic Nucleus Modulation of the Pontine Nuclei and Its Targeting of the Cerebellar Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>The subthalamic nucleus (STN) has been implicated in motor and nonmotor tasks, and is an effective target of deep brain stimulation for the treatment of Parkinson's disease, likely in part because of the STN's projections outside of the basal ganglia to other brain regions. While there is some evidence of a disynaptic connection between the STN and the cerebellum via the pontine nuclei (PN), how the STN modulates the activity of the neurons in the PN remains unknown. Here we addressed this question using a combination of anatomical tracings, optogenetics, and <I>in vivo</I> electrophysiology in both wild-type (WT) and transgenic mice of both sexes. Approximately half of recorded neurons in the PN, which were located primarily in the medial area, responded with short latency to both single pulses and trains of optogenetic stimulation of channelrhodopsin (ChR2)-expressing STN axons in awake, head-restrained mice. Furthermore, the increase in the activity of PN neurons correlated with the strength of activation of STN axons, suggesting that the STN projections to the PN could, in principle, encode information in a graded manner. In addition, transsynaptic retrograde tracing confirmed that the STN sends disynaptic projections to the cerebellar cortex. These results suggest that the STN sends robust functional projections to the PN, which then propagate to the cerebellum, and have important implications for understanding motor control of normal conditions, and Parkinsonian symptoms, where this pathway may have a role in the therapeutic efficacy of STN deep brain stimulation.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The primary excitatory nucleus in the basal ganglia, the subthalamic nucleus, is known to play a role in pathways modulating movement. The pontine nuclei are the main precerebellar nuclei, which transmit signals through their axonal projections to the cerebellum as mossy fibers. The pathway we have functionally characterized in this paper represents an additional cortex-independent pathway capable of relaying information between the basal ganglia and cerebellum. The effectiveness of subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation in Parkinson's disease suggests that this pathway could be explored as an avenue of investigation for therapeutic purposes.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Muscarinic Acetylcholine M2 Receptors Regulate Lateral Habenula Neuron Activity and Control Cocaine Seeking Behavior</a></h4>

              
                <p>The lateral habenula (LHb) balances reward and aversion by opposing activation of brain reward nuclei and is involved in the inhibition of responding for cocaine in a model of impulsive behavior. Previously, we reported that the suppression of cocaine seeking was prevented by LHb inactivation or nonselective antagonism of LHb mAChRs. Here, we investigate mAChR subtypes mediating the effects of endogenous acetylcholine in this model of impulsive drug seeking and define cellular mechanisms in which mAChRs alter LHb neuron activity. Using <I>in vitro</I> electrophysiology, we find that LHb neurons are depolarized or hyperpolarized by the cholinergic agonists oxotremorine-M (Oxo-M) and carbachol (CCh), and that mAChRs inhibit synaptic GABA and glutamatergic inputs to these cells similarly in male and female rats. Synaptic effects of CCh were blocked by the M<SUB>2</SUB>-mAChR (M<SUB>2</SUB>R) antagonist AFDX-116 and not by pirenzepine, an M<SUB>1</SUB>-mAChR (M<SUB>1</SUB>R) antagonist. Oxo-M-mediated depolarizing currents were also blocked by AFDX-116. Although M<SUB>2</SUB>R activation inhibited excitatory and inhibitory inputs to LHb neurons, the effect on excitation was greater, suggesting a shift in excitatory-inhibitory balance toward net inhibition. Activation of VTA inhibitory inputs to LHb neurons, via channelrhodopsin-2 expression, evoked IPSCs that were inhibited by M<SUB>2</SUB>Rs. Finally, we measured LHb-dependent operant response inhibition for cocaine and found it impaired by antagonism of M<SUB>2</SUB>Rs, and not M<SUB>1</SUB>Rs. In summary, we show that a cholinergic signal to LHb and activation of M<SUB>2</SUB>Rs are critical to enable inhibition of responding for cocaine, and we define cellular mechanisms through which this may occur.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The lateral habenula (LHb) is a brain region receiving information from brain areas involved in decision-making, and its output influences motivation, reward, and movement. This interface between thoughts, emotions, and actions is how the LHb permits adaptive behavior, and LHb dysfunction is implicated in psychiatric and drug use disorders. Silencing the LHb impairs control over cocaine seeking in rats, and mAChRs are also implicated. Here, we measured cocaine seeking while blocking different mAChRs and examined mechanisms of mAChR effects on LHb neurons. M<SUB>2</SUB>-mAChRs were necessary for control of cocaine seeking, and these receptors altered LHb neuron activity in several ways. Our study reveals that LHb M<SUB>2</SUB>-mAChRs represent a potential target for treating substance use disorders.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Neuromodulatory Mechanisms Underlying Contrast Gain Control in Mouse Auditory Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>Neural adaptation enables the brain to efficiently process sensory signals despite large changes in background noise. Previous studies have established that recent background spectro- or spatio-temporal statistics scale neural responses to sensory stimuli via a canonical normalization computation, which is conserved among species and sensory domains. In the auditory pathway, one major form of normalization, termed contrast gain control, presents as decreasing instantaneous firing-rate gain, the slope of the neural input-output relationship, with increasing variability of background sound levels (contrast) across time and frequency. Despite this gain rescaling, mean firing-rates in auditory cortex become invariant to sound level contrast, termed contrast invariance. The underlying neuromodulatory mechanisms of these two phenomena remain unknown. To study these mechanisms in male and female mice, we used a 2-photon calcium imaging preparation in layer 2/3 neurons of primary auditory cortex (A1), along with pharmacological and genetic KO approaches. We found that neuromodulatory cortical synaptic zinc signaling is necessary for contrast gain control but not contrast invariance in mouse A1.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> When sound levels in the acoustic environment become more variable across time and frequency, the brain decreases response gain to maintain dynamic range and thus stimulus discriminability. This gain adaptation accounts for changes in perceptual judgments in humans and mice; however, the underlying neuromodulatory mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we report context-dependent neuromodulatory effects of synaptic zinc that are necessary for contrast gain control in A1. Understanding context-specific neuromodulatory mechanisms, such as contrast gain control, provides insight into A1 cortical mechanisms of adaptation and also into fundamental aspects of perceptual changes that rely on gain modulation, such as attention.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Value, Confidence, Deliberation: A Functional Partition of the Medial Prefrontal Cortex Demonstrated across Rating and Choice Tasks</a></h4>

              
                <p>Deciding about courses of action involves minimizing costs and maximizing benefits. Decision neuroscience studies have implicated both the ventral and dorsal medial PFC (vmPFC and dmPFC) in signaling goal value and action cost, but the precise functional role of these regions is still a matter of debate. Here, we suggest a more general functional partition that applies not only to decisions but also to judgments about goal value (expected reward) and action cost (expected effort). In this conceptual framework, cognitive representations related to options (reward value and effort cost) are dissociated from metacognitive representations (confidence and deliberation) related to solving the task (providing a judgment or making a choice). We used an original approach aimed at identifying consistencies across several preference tasks, from likeability ratings to binary decisions involving both attribute integration and option comparison. fMRI results in human male and female participants confirmed the vmPFC as a generic valuation system, its activity increasing with reward value and decreasing with effort cost. In contrast, more dorsal regions were not concerned with the valuation of options but with metacognitive variables, confidence being reflected in mPFC activity and deliberation time in dmPFC activity. Thus, there was a dissociation between the effort attached to choice options (represented in the vmPFC) and the effort invested in deliberation (represented in the dmPFC), the latter being expressed in pupil dilation. More generally, assessing commonalities across preference tasks might help in reaching a unified view of the neural mechanisms underlying the cost/benefit tradeoffs that drive human behavior.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Decision neuroscience studies have implicated the medial PFC in forming the cognitive representations that drive human choice behavior. However, different studies using different tasks have suggested somewhat inconsistent links between precise computational variables and specific brain regions. Here, we use fMRI to demonstrate a robust functional partition of the medial PFC that generalizes across tasks involving an estimation of goal value and/or action cost to provide a judgment or make a choice. This general functional partition makes a critical dissociation between neural representations of decisional factors (the expected costs and benefits attached to a given option) and metacognitive estimates (confidence in the judgment or choice, and effort invested in the deliberation process).</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Selective Prefrontal-Amygdala Circuit Interactions Underlie Social and Nonsocial Valuation in Rhesus Macaques</a></h4>

              
                <p>Lesion studies in macaques suggest dissociable functions of the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and medial frontal cortex (MFC), with OFC being essential for goal-directed decision-making and MFC supporting social cognition. Bilateral amygdala damage results in impairments in both of these domains. There are extensive reciprocal connections between these prefrontal areas and the amygdala; however, it is not known whether the dissociable roles of OFC and MFC depend on functional interactions with the amygdala. To test this possibility, we compared the performance of male rhesus macaques (<I>Macaca mulatta</I>) with crossed surgical disconnection of the amygdala and either MFC (MFC <FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">x</FONT> AMY, <I>n</I> = 4) or OFC (OFC <FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">x</FONT> AMY, <I>n</I> = 4) to a group of unoperated controls (CON, <I>n</I> = 5). All monkeys were assessed for their performance on two tasks to measure the following: (1) food-retrieval latencies while viewing videos of social and nonsocial stimuli in a test of social interest and (2) object choices based on current food value using reinforcer devaluation in a test of goal-directed decision-making. Compared with the CON group, the MFC <FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">x</FONT> AMY group, but not the OFC <FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">x</FONT> AMY group, showed significantly reduced food-retrieval latencies while viewing videos of conspecifics, indicating reduced social valuation and/or interest. By contrast, on the devaluation task, group OFC <FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">x</FONT> AMY, but not group MFC <FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">x</FONT> AMY, displayed deficits on object choices following changes in food value. These data indicate that the MFC and OFC must functionally interact with the amygdala to support normative social and nonsocial valuation, respectively.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Ascribing value to conspecifics (social) versus objects (nonsocial) may be supported by distinct but overlapping brain networks. Here, we test whether two nonoverlapping regions of the prefrontal cortex, the medial frontal cortex and the orbitofrontal cortex, must causally interact with the amygdala to sustain social valuation and goal-directed decision-making, respectively. We found that these prefrontal-amygdala circuits are functionally dissociable, lending support for the idea that medial frontal and orbital frontal cortex make independent contributions to cognitive appraisals of the environment. These data provide a neural framework for distinct value assignment processes and may enhance our understanding of the cognitive deficits observed following brain injury or in the development of mental health disorders.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Pain, But Not Physical Activity, Is Associated with Gray Matter Volume Differences in Gulf War Veterans with Chronic Pain</a></h4>

              
                <p>Chronic musculoskeletal pain (CMP) is a significant burden for Persian Gulf War Veterans (GWVs), yet the causes are poorly understood. Brain structure abnormalities are observed in GWVs, however relationships with modifiable lifestyle factors such as physical activity (PA) are unknown. We evaluated gray matter volumes and associations with symptoms, PA, and sedentary time in GWVs with and without CMP. Ninety-eight GWVs (10 females) with CMP and 56 GWVs (7 females) controls completed T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, pain and fatigue symptom questionnaires, and PA measurement via actigraphy. Regional gray matter volumes were analyzed using voxel-based morphometry and were compared across groups using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). Separate multiple linear regression models were used to test associations between PA intensities, sedentary time, symptoms, and gray matter volumes. Familywise cluster error rates were used to control for multiple comparisons (&alpha; = 0.05). GWVs with CMP reported greater pain and fatigue symptoms, worse mood, and engaged in less moderate-to-vigorous PA and more sedentary time than healthy GWVs (all <I>p</I> values &lt; 0.05). GWVs with CMP had smaller gray matter volumes in the bilateral insula and larger volumes in the frontal pole (<I>p</I> &lt; 0.05<SUB>adjusted</SUB>). Gray matter volumes in the left insula were associated with pain symptoms (<I>r</I><SUB>partial</SUB> = 0.26, &ndash;0.29; <I>p</I> &lt; 0.05<SUB>adjusted</SUB>). No significant associations were observed for either PA or sedentary time (<I>p</I> &gt; 0.05<SUB>adjusted</SUB>). GWVs with CMP had smaller gray matter volumes within a critical brain region of the descending pain processing network and larger volumes within brain regions associated with pain sensation and affective processing, which may reflect pain chronification.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The pathophysiology of chronic pain in Gulf War veterans is understudied and not well understood. In a large sample of Gulf War veterans, we report veterans with chronic musculoskeletal pain have smaller gray matter volumes in brain regions associated with pain regulation and larger volumes in regions associated with pain sensitivity compared with otherwise healthy Gulf War veterans. Gray matter volumes in regions of pain regulation were significantly associated with pain symptoms and encompassed the observed group brain volume differences. These results are suggestive of deficient pain modulation that may contribute to pain chronification.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Somatic Genetics Analysis of Sleep in Adult Mice</a></h4>

              
                <p>Classical forward and reverse mouse genetics require germline mutations and, thus, are unwieldy to study sleep functions of essential genes or redundant pathways. It is also time-consuming to conduct EEG/EMG-based mouse sleep screening because of labor-intensive surgeries and genetic crosses. Here, we describe a highly accurate SleepV (video) system and adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based adult brain chimeric (ABC)-expression/KO platform for somatic genetics analysis of sleep in adult male or female mice. A pilot ABC screen identifies CREB and CRTC1, of which constitutive or inducible expression significantly reduces quantity and/or quality of non-rapid eye movement sleep. Whereas ABC-KO of exon 13 of <I>Sik3</I> by AAV-Cre injection in <I>Sik3-E13<sup>flox/flox</sup></I> adult mice phenocopies <I>Sleepy (Sik3</I><sup><I>Slp</I>/+</sup><I>)</I> mice, ABC-CRISPR of <I>Slp/Sik3</I> reverses hypersomnia of <I>Sleepy</I> mice, indicating a direct role of SLP/SIK3 kinase in sleep regulation. Multiplex ABC-CRISPR of both orexin/hypocretin receptors causes narcolepsy episodes, enabling one-step analysis of redundant genes in adult mice. Therefore, this somatic genetics approach should facilitate high-throughput analysis of sleep regulatory genes, especially for essential or redundant genes, in adult mice by skipping mouse development and minimizing genetic crosses.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The molecular mechanisms of mammalian sleep regulation remain unclear. Classical germline mouse genetics are unwieldy to study sleep functions of essential genes or redundant pathways. The EEG/EMG-based mouse sleep screening is time-consuming because of labor-intensive surgeries and lengthy genetic crosses. To overcome these "bottlenecks," we developed a highly accurate video-based sleep analysis system and adeno-associated virus-mediated ABC-expression/KO platform for somatic genetics analysis of sleep in adult mice. These methodologies facilitate rapid identification of sleep regulatory genes, but also efficient mechanistic studies of the molecular pathways of sleep regulation in mice.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Unbalanced Regulation of Sec22b and Ykt6 Blocks Autophagosome Axonal Retrograde Flux in Neuronal Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury</a></h4>

              
                <p>Cerebral ischemia&ndash;reperfusion (I/R) injury in ischemic penumbra is accountable for poor outcome of ischemic stroke patients receiving recanalization therapy. Compelling evidence previously demonstrated a dual role of autophagy in stroke. This study aimed to understand the traits of autophagy in the ischemic penumbra and the potential mechanism that switches the dual role of autophagy. We found that autophagy induction by rapamycin and lithium carbonate performed before ischemia reduced neurologic deficits and infarction, while autophagy induction after reperfusion had the opposite effect in the male murine middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R) model, both of which were eliminated in mice lacking autophagy (Atg7<sup>flox/flox</sup>; Nestin-Cre). Autophagic flux determination showed that reperfusion led to a blockage of axonal autophagosome retrograde transport in neurons, which then led to autophagic flux damage. Then, we found that I/R induced changes in the protein levels of Sec22b and Ykt6 in neurons, two autophagosome transport-related factors, in which Sec22b significantly increased and Ykt6 significantly decreased. In the absence of exogenous autophagy induction, Sec22b knock-down and Ykt6 overexpression significantly alleviated autophagic flux damage, infarction, and neurologic deficits in neurons or murine exposed to cerebral I/R in an autophagy-dependent manner. Furthermore, Sec22b knock-down and Ykt6 overexpression switched the outcome of rapamycin posttreatment from deterioration to neuroprotection. Thus, Sec22b and Ykt6 play key roles in neuronal autophagic flux, and modest regulation of Sec22b and Ykt6 may help to reverse the failure of targeting autophagy induction to improve the prognosis of ischemic stroke.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The highly polarized architecture of neurons with neurites presents challenges for material transport, such as autophagosomes, which form at the neurite tip and need to be transported to the cell soma for degradation. Here, we demonstrate that Sec22b and Ykt6 act as autophagosome porters and play an important role in maintaining the integrity of neuronal autophagic flux. Ischemia&ndash;reperfusion (I/R)-induced excess Sec22b and loss of Ykt6 in neurons lead to axonal autophagosome retrograde trafficking failure, autophagic flux damage, and finally neuronal injury. Facilitated axonal autophagosome retrograde transport by Sec22b knock-down and Ykt6 overexpression may reduce I/R-induced neuron injury and extend the therapeutic window of pharmacological autophagy induction for neuroprotection.</p>

                 Abstract: Industry players are encouraged to automate as a result of technological advancements. However, due to lack of finances several businesses continue to require human labor in the production process, particularly in the operation of transferring items . Transportation activities at Dock 16 Ilir in Palembang City, starts  with delivering items from the shop to the ship or vice versa by utilizing human strength in less ergonomic work positions with little consideration for the weight of the load. Whencarrying goods , the body is bent, the neck is bent, and the arms are distant from the body, putting the body  at a very high risk of injury. This type of working position causes muscle aches ranging from mild to severe. The personnel seen in this investigation were rice transporters and cement transporters. The aim  of this study is to quantify the workload and provide a design tool to help lessen worker concerns. The Nordic Body Map, Rapid Upper Limb Assessment (RULA), and Ovako Working Analysis System (OWAS)methodologies were used in this investigation. The study's findings showed that the five cement transport workers and four rice transport workers were at risk of developing muscoskeletal illnesses, with a risk level of 3 to 4, indicating that the risk category is very high and comprehensive treatment is required as soon as feasible. According to the OWAS technique, the posture of rice transportation employees has a value of 3, indicating that they are at high danger. Meanwhile, the working posture of cement transportation has a score of 7 with a risk level of 4, indicating that the danger of MSDS is very high. The developing aids are projected to lower the danger of Muscoskeletal Disorders in a backpack-like style that can resist large loads and reduce the risk of Muscoskeletal Disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Fides: Reliable trust-region optimization for parameter estimation of ordinary differential equation models</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Fabian Fröhlich, Peter K. Sorger</p>

Ordinary differential equation (ODE) models are widely used to study biochemical reactions in cellular networks since they effectively describe the temporal evolution of these networks using mass action kinetics. The parameters of these models are rarely known <i>a priori</i> and must instead be estimated by calibration using experimental data. Optimization-based calibration of ODE models on is often challenging, even for low-dimensional problems. Multiple hypotheses have been advanced to explain why biochemical model calibration is challenging, including non-identifiability of model parameters, but there are few comprehensive studies that test these hypotheses, likely because tools for performing such studies are also lacking. Nonetheless, reliable model calibration is essential for uncertainty analysis, model comparison, and biological interpretation.
We implemented an established trust-region method as a modular Python framework (fides) to enable systematic comparison of different approaches to ODE model calibration involving a variety of Hessian approximation schemes. We evaluated fides on a recently developed corpus of biologically realistic benchmark problems for which real experimental data are available. Unexpectedly, we observed high variability in optimizer performance among different implementations of the same mathematical instructions (algorithms). Analysis of possible sources of poor optimizer performance identified limitations in the widely used Gauss-Newton, BFGS and SR1 Hessian approximation schemes. We addressed these drawbacks with a novel hybrid Hessian approximation scheme that enhances optimizer performance and outperforms existing hybrid approaches. When applied to the corpus of test models, we found that fides was on average more reliable and efficient than existing methods using a variety of criteria. We expect fides to be broadly useful for ODE constrained optimization problems in biochemical models and to be a foundation for future methods development.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">What are housekeeping genes?</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Chintan J. Joshi, Wenfan Ke, Anna Drangowska-Way, Eyleen J. O’Rourke, Nathan E. Lewis</p>

The concept of “housekeeping gene” has been used for four decades but remains loosely defined. Housekeeping genes are commonly described as “essential for cellular existence regardless of their specific function in the tissue or organism”, and “stably expressed irrespective of tissue type, developmental stage, cell cycle state, or external signal”. However, experimental support for the tenet that gene essentiality is linked to stable expression across cell types, conditions, and organisms has been limited. Here we use genome-scale functional genomic screens together with bulk and single-cell sequencing technologies to test this link and optimize a quantitative and experimentally validated definition of housekeeping gene. Using the optimized definition, we identify, characterize, and provide as resources, housekeeping gene lists extracted from several human datasets, and 10 other animal species that include primates, chicken, and <i>C</i>. <i>elegans</i>. We find that stably expressed genes are not necessarily essential, and that the individual genes that are essential and stably expressed can considerably differ across organisms; yet the pathways enriched among these genes are conserved. Further, the level of conservation of housekeeping genes across the analyzed organisms captures their taxonomic groups, showing evolutionary relevance for our definition. Therefore, we present a quantitative and experimentally supported definition of housekeeping genes that can contribute to better understanding of their unique biological and evolutionary characteristics.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">AC-PCoA: Adjustment for confounding factors using principal coordinate analysis</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yu Wang, Fengzhu Sun, Wei Lin, Shuqin Zhang</p>

Confounding factors exist widely in various biological data owing to technical variations, population structures and experimental conditions. Such factors may mask the true signals and lead to spurious associations in the respective biological data, making it necessary to adjust confounding factors accordingly. However, existing confounder correction methods were mainly developed based on the original data or the pairwise Euclidean distance, either one of which is inadequate for analyzing different types of data, such as sequencing data.
In this work, we proposed a method called Adjustment for Confounding factors using Principal Coordinate Analysis, or AC-PCoA, which reduces data dimension and extracts the information from different distance measures using principal coordinate analysis, and adjusts confounding factors across multiple datasets by minimizing the associations between lower-dimensional representations and confounding variables. Application of the proposed method was further extended to classification and prediction. We demonstrated the efficacy of AC-PCoA on three simulated datasets and five real datasets. Compared to the existing methods, AC-PCoA shows better results in visualization, statistical testing, clustering, and classification.

                Background: Lipoma arborescens (LA) is an infrequent benign tumor made of mature sub-synovial fatty cell proliferation that may arise into the synovial joint, the bursae or the tendon sheaths. This condition affects mainly the knee joint, but the bicipitoradial bursa is an exceptional location. We report herein a case of a synchronous bilateral (LA) of the bicipitoradial bursa. Case presentation: A 52-year-old patient, with no medical history, presented with a swelling of both front arms that had been progressing for nine years. Physical examination showed a mass in the antecubital fossae of 3cm on the left side and 0.5cm on the right side. Both masses were tender, well-defined, fixed, without inflammatory signs and painful on elbow flexion. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan was performed, revealing the presence of a septate soft-tissue mass of the distal portion of the brachial muscle of 70x46x27mm. This mass had a heterogeneous fat signal in its depth and a homogeneous fat composition on the outside. The diagnosis of liposarcoma was suspected. The patient underwent surgery to remove both masses. Gross examination showed a characteristic frond-like or digitiform pattern. Microscopical examination demonstrated papillary proliferation of the synovial villi. The final diagnosis was of LA. The patient had no complications and there was no recurrence of LA. Conclusions: LA is a rare condition, and the bicipitoradial bursa is an exceptional location. Histological confirmation is mandatory to correct the diagnosis.

                Acute kidney injury (AKI) remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients, particularly critically ill patients. It poses a public health challenge in resource-constrained settings due to high administrative costs. AKI is commonly misdiagnosed due to its painless onset and late disruption of serum creatinine, which is the gold standard biomarker for AKI diagnosis. There is increasing research into the use of early biomarkers and the development of predictive models for early AKI diagnosis using clinical, laboratory, and imaging data. This field note provides insight into the challenges of using available AKI prediction models in resource-constrained environments, as well as perspectives that practitioners in these settings may find useful

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Emergency contraception from historical myth to modern reality: a historical timeline and updated interpretation [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Emergency contraception is the use of a birth control method after coitus has taken place and there is a fear that it may lead to a pregnancy. Historical attempts were more likely to be harmful rather than effective. Oral estrogens, progestins, anti-progesterone, and partial agonist/antagonists of progesterone have all been used with varying degrees of efficacy. Currently ethinyl estradiol/levonorgestrel combinations, levonorgestrel alone, ulipristal acetate, and mifepristone are the usual oral methods depending on availability. Copper carrying and more recently levonorgestrel releasing intrauterine devices have also been used successfully. The intrauterine devices appear to be more effective than the oral methods and are also regular contraceptive methods and in addition have therapeutic properties. Background: The evolution from longer duration oral treatments with side effects to the current single tablet of levonorgestrel, ulipristal acetate, or mifepristone with low side effects and reasonable efficacy is described. The role of the highly effective copper intrauterine device and now also the levonorgestrel intrauterine device for emergency contraception is examined. Conclusion: Oral emergency contraception is a short term solution. Expanding emergency contraception to include the levonorgestrel releasing intrauterine device may provide long term contraception and health benefits as well as providing emergency contraception.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Records of antibodies in breast milk in postpartum women who have been vaccinated or exposed to COVID-19: A systematic review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Breast milk is a critical element in developing a baby's immunity through immune transfer. Antibodies are an essential unit of immunity against infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This paper explores antibodies in breast milk in postpartum women who have been vaccinated or exposed to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Duration of antibody appearance was studied to determine the adequate time in transferring antibodies by breastfeeding. Methods: Three databases, PubMed, Google Scholar, and ScienceDirect, were used as sources of articles. Inclusion criteria applied in selecting articles were prospective observational study or experimental design study in English, evaluating antibodies in breast milk, and conducted between 2019–2021. Article quality and risk of bias were assessed with Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP). The data found were synthesized in a narrative manner. Results: This systematic review included 20 articles. A total of 306 postpartum women who were infected with COVID-19, 20 postpartum women who had viral symptoms and 495 postpartum women who had been vaccinated were studied. Immunoglobulin A (IgA) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies were found in the breast milk of infected and vaccinated postpartum women. SARS CoV-2 infection is associated with the presence of IgA dominant, whereas vaccination is related to the presence of IgG dominant. Antibodies persisted from day 10 of onset to 10 months in infected postpartum women and started from three days to six weeks in vaccinated postpartum women. Meta-analysis could not be carried out due to the variety of articles. Conclusions: Antibodies found in breast milk in infected and vaccinated postpartum women have different dominant types. Further research needs to be done regarding the mechanism of antibody transfer in breast milk, longer research duration and studies that directly examine the comparison of antibodies in breast milk in vaccinated and infected postpartum women.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Complementary representations of time in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Episodic memory binds the spatial and temporal relationships between the elements of experience. The hippocampus encodes space through place cells that fire at specific spatial locations. Similarly, time cells fire sequentially at specific time points within a temporally organized experience. Recent studies in rodents, monkeys, and humans have identified time cells with discrete firing fields and cells with monotonically changing activity in supporting the temporal organization of events across multiple timescales. Using in vivo electrophysiological tetrode recordings, we simultaneously recorded neurons from the prefrontal cortex and dorsal CA1 of the hippocampus while rats performed a delayed match to sample task. During the treadmill mnemonic delay, hippocampal time cells exhibited sparser firing fields with decreasing resolution over time, consistent with previous results. In comparison, temporally modulated cells in the prefrontal cortex showed more monotonically changing firing rates, ramping up or decaying with the passage of time, and exhibited greater temporal precision for Bayesian decoding of time at long time lags. These time cells show exquisite temporal resolution both in their firing fields and in the fine timing of spikes relative to the phase of theta oscillations. Here, we report evidence of theta phase precession in both the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus during the temporal delay, however, hippocampal cells exhibited steeper phase precession slopes and more punctate time fields. To disentangle whether time cell activity reflects elapsed time or distance traveled, we varied the treadmill running speed on each trial. While many neurons contained multiplexed representations of time and distance, both regions were more strongly influenced by time than distance. Overall, these results demonstrate the flexible integration of spatiotemporal dimensions and reveal complementary representations of time in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus in supporting memory-guided behavior.</p>

<p>Oxidative stress is induced by Kainate in neuroglobin KO and WT mice. In Ngb-KO mice this is not counter balanced and c-fos (a transcription factor) expression is increased leading to activation of downstream targets resulting in seizure.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Neuroglobin (Ngb) is found in the neurones of several different brain areas and is known to bind oxygen and other gaseous molecules and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in vitro, but it does not seem to act as a respiratory molecule for neurones. Using male and female Ngb-knockout (KO) mice, we addressed the role of Ngb in neuronal brain activity using behavioral tests but found no differences in general behaviors, memory processes, and anxiety−/depression-like behaviors. Oxidative stress and ROS play key roles in epileptogenesis, and oxidative injury produced by an excessive production of free radicals is involved in the initiation and progression of epilepsy. The ROS binding properties led us to hypothesize that lack of Ngb could affect central coping with excitatory stimuli. We consequently explored whether exposure to the excitatory molecule kainate (KA) would increase severity of seizures in mice lacking Ngb. We found that the duration and severity of seizures were increased, while the latency time to develop seizures was shortened in Ngb-KO compared to wildtype adult female mice. Consistently, c-fos expression after KA was significantly increased in Ngb-KO mice in the amygdala and piriform cortex, regions rich in Ngb and known to be centrally involved in seizure generation. Moreover, the measured c-fos expression levels were correlated with seizure susceptibility. With these new findings combined with previous studies we propose that Ngb could constitute an intrinsic defense mechanism against neuronal hyperexcitability and oxidative stress by buffering of ROS in amygdala and other Ngb-containing brain regions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=10974547&type=etoc&feed=rss">Diversity in neuroscience education: A perspective from a Historically Black institution</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The events of 2020, including the pandemic which highlighted the extent of health disparities in the United States, combined with the Black Lives Matter protests, have focused public attention on the systemic inequities that continue to afflict our nation. Publicly available data from the National Center for Education Statistics show that our discipline of neuroscience shows the same types of disparities, particularly for African-American students. I have drawn on data from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data Survey of U.S. colleges and universities to show that while the number of graduates from neuroscience undergraduate and graduate degree programs has grown dramatically in this century, only a small percentage of those graduates are African American, and the numbers are growing very slowly. I also present data on the neuroscience PhD program at my institution, Delaware State University, the only Historically Black University in the United States to offer a PhD in neuroscience. Because a high percentage of our students and graduates are African American, our small, young program has the potential for great impact in diversifying our discipline of neuroscience. While elite colleges and research-intensive universities have been engaged for decades in efforts to increase diversity in their academic programs, change is slow, and large inequities remain. With Delaware State University's neuroscience PhD program as an example, I hope to convince readers that it is time for our nation to recognize the institutions that are best positioned to serve students from communities of color, and direct resources to support their growth and success.</p>

<p>Research innovation that leads to discovery in the battle against neurological disease and disorders requires diverse ideas. The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, one of the National Institutes of Health's 27 institutes and centers, strives to reduce the burden of neurological disease and disorders. The National Institutes of Neurologic Disorders and Stroke is very interested in increasing the diversity of researchers by addressing the existing barriers responsible for the low numbers of underrepresented populations from traditionally minority-serving institutions (MSIs) and non-minority serving institutions (non-MSIs). This commentary provides insight on the persistent underrepresentation of racial/ethnic minorities entering neuroscience research careers paths, focusing on multiples levels within the scientific academy and the supportive role that both MSIs and non-MSIs play in increasing diversity in the biomedical research workforce.</p>

<p>Females displayed a greater withdrawal-induced increase in interpeduncular nucleus (IPN) γ-aminobutyric acid levels than males. This measure of inhibitory tone was suppressed to a larger extent in females following blockade of corticotropin-releasing factor type 1 (CRF1) receptors, an effect that was likely due to greater CRF innervation of the IPN in females following chronic nicotine exposure.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Prior work in male rodents established that the medial habenula-interpeduncular nucleus (MHb-IPN) pathway modulates nicotine withdrawal. Specifically, withdrawal severity has been closely associated with inhibitory tone in the IPN via interneurons that release γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Inhibitory tone in the IPN is regulated by projections from the MHb that co-release glutamate and acetylcholine. Within the IPN, inhibitory tone is also regulated via corticotropin-releasing factor type 1 (CRF1) receptors that control GABA release from local interneurons. This study extends previous work by comparing sex differences in GABA, glutamate, as well serotonin levels in the IPN during precipitated nicotine withdrawal. Sex differences in withdrawal-induced neurochemical effects were also compared following systemic administration of a CRF1 receptor antagonist. The results revealed that there were no group differences in serotonin levels in the IPN. A major finding was that females displayed a larger withdrawal-induced increases in GABA levels in the IPN than males. Also, withdrawal increased IPN glutamate levels in a similar manner in females and males. Blockade of CRF1 receptors produced a larger suppression of the withdrawal-induced increases in GABA levels in the IPN of females versus males, an effect that was likely related to the robust increase in glutamate following administration of the CRF1 receptor antagonist in females. These data suggest that amino acid systems in the IPN modulate sex differences in the behavioral effects of nicotine withdrawal. Furthermore, our data imply that medications that target stress-induced activation of the IPN may reduce withdrawal severity, particularly in females.</p>

Long-term changes in open field behavior were observed in male and female C57BL/6J mice.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>With alcohol readily accessible to adolescents, its consumption leads to many adverse effects, including impaired learning, attention, and behavior. Adolescents report higher rates of binge drinking compared to adults. They are also more prone to substance use disorder in adulthood due to physiological changes during the adolescent developmental period. We used C57BL/6J male and female mice to investigate the long-lasting impact of binge ethanol exposure during adolescence on voluntary ethanol intake and open field behavior during later adolescence (Experiment 1) and during emerging adulthood (Experiment 2). The present set of experiments were divided into four stages: (1) adolescent intermittent vapor inhalation exposure, (2) abstinence, (3) voluntary ethanol intake, and (4) open field behavioral testing. During adolescence, male and female mice were exposed to air or ethanol using intermittent vapor inhalation from postnatal day (PND) 28–42. Following this, mice underwent short-term abstinence from PND 43–49 (Experiment 1) or protracted abstinence from PND 43–69 (Experiment 2). Beginning on PND 50–76 or PND 70–97, mice were assessed for intermittent voluntary ethanol consumption using a two-bottle choice drinking procedure over 28 days. Male adolescent ethanol-exposed mice showed increased ethanol consumption following short-term abstinence and following protracted abstinence. In contrast, female mice showed no changes in ethanol consumption following short-term abstinence and decreased ethanol consumption following protracted abstinence. There were modest changes in open field behavior following voluntary ethanol consumption in both experiments. These data demonstrate a sexually divergent shift in ethanol consumption following binge ethanol exposure during adolescence and differences in open field behavior. These results highlight sex-dependent vulnerability to developing substance use disorders in adulthood.</p>

     alt="The dopamine membrane transporter plays an active modulatory role in synaptic dopamine homeostasis"/>
<p>The pH-sensitive fluorescent sensor remains OFF inside neurotransmitter vesicles due to low pH. Upon fusion of the vesicle with the synaptic membrane, the sensor is exposed to the neutral extra-cellular pH which switches it to the ON configuration. Fluorescence recovery after photo-bleaching imaging of vesicle fusion dynamics reveals an active role for the dopamine membrane transporter in synaptic dopamine homeostasis.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Modulatory mechanisms of neurotransmitter release and clearance are highly controlled processes whose finely tuned regulation is critical for functioning of the nervous system. Dysregulation of the monoamine neurotransmitter dopamine can lead to several neuropathies. Synaptic modulation of dopamine is known to involve pre-synaptic D2 auto-receptors and acid sensing ion channels. In addition, the dopamine membrane transporter (DAT), which is responsible for clearance of dopamine from the synaptic cleft, is suspected to play an active role in modulating release of dopamine. Using functional imaging on the <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> model system, we show that DAT-1 acts as a negative feedback modulator to neurotransmitter vesicle fusion. Results from our fluorescence recovery after photo-bleaching (FRAP) based experiments were followed up with and reaffirmed using swimming-induced paralysis behavioral assays. Utilizing our numerical FRAP data we have developed a mechanistic model to dissect the dynamics of synaptic vesicle fusion, and compare the feedback effects of DAT-1 with the dopamine auto-receptor. Our experimental results and the mechanistic model are of potential broader significance, as similar dynamics are likely to be used by other synaptic modulators including membrane transporters for other neurotransmitters across species.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Despite the prevalence and public health impact of substance use disorders (SUDs), effective long-term treatments remain elusive. Aerobic exercise is a promising, nonpharmacological treatment currently under investigation as a strategy for preventing drug relapse. Aerobic exercise could be incorporated into the comprehensive treatment regimens for people with substance abuse disorders. Preclinical studies of SUD with animal models have shown that aerobic exercise diminishes drug-seeking behavior, which leads to relapse, in both male and female rats. Nevertheless, little is known regarding the effects of substance abuse-induced cellular and physiological adaptations believed to be responsible for drug-seeking behavior. Accordingly, the overall goal of this review is to provide a summary and an assessment of findings to date, highlighting evidence of the molecular and neurological effects of exercise on adaptations associated with SUD.</p>

     alt="Pharmacological activation of the Sonic hedgehog pathway with a Smoothened small molecule agonist ameliorates the severity of alcohol-induced morphological and behavioral birth defects in a zebrafish model of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder"/>
<p>Exposure of zebrafish embryos to acute ethanol during the late gastrulation phase (8–10 hpf) results in defects in brain development (midbrain–hindbrain boundary formation; microphthalmia) and long-lasting behavioral deficits (increase in risk taking behavior). The addition of a sonic hedgehog pathway agonist to the zebrafish embryos immediately after the ethanol exposure (10–12 hpf) rescues both the short-term morphological and long-term behavioral defects.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Ethanol exposure during the early stages of embryonic development can lead to a range of morphological and behavioral differences termed fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs). In a zebrafish model, we have shown that acute ethanol exposure at 8–10 hr postfertilization (hpf), a critical time of development, produces birth defects similar to those clinically characterized in FASD. Dysregulation of the Sonic hedgehog (Shh) pathway has been implicated as a molecular basis for many of the birth defects caused by prenatal alcohol exposure. We observed in zebrafish embryos that <i>shh</i> expression was significantly decreased by ethanol exposure at 8–10 hpf, while <i>smo</i> expression was much less affected. Treatment of zebrafish embryos with SAG or purmorphamine, small molecule Smoothened agonists that activate Shh signaling, ameliorated the severity of ethanol-induced developmental malformations including altered eye size and midline brain development. Furthermore, this rescue effect of Smo activation was dose dependent and occurred primarily when treatment was given after ethanol exposure. Markers of Shh signaling (<i>gli1/2</i>) and eye development (<i>pax6a</i>) were restored in embryos treated with SAG post-ethanol exposure. Since embryonic ethanol exposure has been shown to produce later-life neurobehavioral impairments, juvenile zebrafish were examined in the novel tank diving test. Our results further demonstrated that in zebrafish embryos exposed to ethanol, SAG treatment was able to mitigate long-term neurodevelopmental impairments related to anxiety and risk-taking behavior. Our results indicate that pharmacological activation of the Shh pathway at specific developmental timing markedly diminishes the severity of alcohol-induced birth defects.</p>

<p>Minority serving institutions (MSIs) are in a unique position to contribute to the Neuroscience field by increasing the diversity in the workforce through trainees, but those institutions, trainees, and their faculty mentors are able to simultaneously propel the field forward in advances in cutting-edge neuroscience research. Enclosed are a few examples of neuroscience laboratories at MSIs from across the country who are engaged in neuroscience research, including North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, Delaware State University, the University of Texas at El Paso, North Carolina Central University, University of North Texas, and Ponce Health Sciences University. In this neuronal depiction, the “dendritic” inputs from various categories of MSIs are diversifying the workforce and producing data that feeds into the field’s “axon”. (Special Note: MSIs also include Alaska Native & Native Hawaiian Serving Institutions; Native American Indian Serving, Non-Tribal Institutions; and Predominately Black Institutions.)

                Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) produce interferons (IFNs) in response to viral infections, including SARS-CoV-2. IFNs need to be controlled, as sustained levels have detrimental effects on disease outcome. van der Sluis et al examine the importance of pCDs in protection against SARS-CoV-2, but also how they contribute to chronic inflammation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Intracerebral mechanisms explaining the impact of incidental feedback on mood state and risky choice</a></h4>

              
                Identifying factors whose fluctuations are associated with choice inconsistency is a major issue for rational decision theory. Here, we investigated the neuro-computational mechanisms through which mood fluctuations may bias human choice behavior. Intracerebral EEG data were collected in a large group of subjects (n = 30), while they were performing interleaved quiz and choice tasks that were designed to examine how a series of unrelated feedbacks affects decisions between safe and risky options. Neural baseline activity preceding choice onset was confronted first to mood level, estimated by a computational model integrating the feedbacks received in the quiz task, and then to the weighting of option attributes, in a computational model predicting risk attitude in the choice task. Results showed that 1) elevated broadband gamma activity (BGA) in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and dorsal anterior insula (daIns) was respectively signaling periods of high and low mood, 2) increased vmPFC and daIns BGA respectively promoted and tempered risk taking by overweighting gain versus loss prospects. Thus, incidental feedbacks induce brain states that correspond to different moods and bias the evaluation of risky options. More generally, these findings might explain why people experiencing positive (or negative) outcome in some part of their life tend to expect success (or failure) in any other.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Meta-Research: How parenthood contributes to gender gaps in academia</a></h4>

              
                Being a parent has long been associated with gender disparities in academia. However, details of the mechanisms by which parenthood and gender influence academic career achievement and progression are not fully understood. Here, using data from a survey of 7,764 academics in North America and publication data from the Web of Science, we analyze gender differences in parenthood and academic achievements and explore the influence of work-family conflict and partner support on these gender gaps. Our results suggest that gender gaps in academic achievement are, in fact, 'parenthood gender gaps'. Specifically, we found significant gender gaps in all measures of academic achievement (both objective and subjective) in the parent group but not in the non-parent group. Mothers are more likely than fathers to experience higher levels of work-family conflict and to receive lower levels of partner support, contributing significantly to the gender gaps in academic achievement for the parent group. We also discuss possible interventions and actions for reducing gender gaps in academia.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Using adopted individuals to partition indirect maternal genetic effects into prenatal and postnatal effects on offspring phenotypes</a></h4>

              
                Maternal genetic effects can be defined as the effect of a mother's genotype on the phenotype of her offspring, independent of the offspring's genotype. Maternal genetic effects can act via the intrauterine environment during pregnancy and/or via the postnatal environment. In this manuscript, we present a simple extension to the basic adoption design that uses structural equation modelling (SEM) to partition maternal genetic effects into prenatal and postnatal effects. We assume that in biological families, offspring phenotypes are influenced prenatally by their mother's genotype and postnatally by both parents' genotypes, whereas adopted individuals' phenotypes are influenced prenatally by their biological mother's genotype and postnatally by their adoptive parents' genotypes. Our SEM framework allows us to model the (potentially) unobserved genotypes of biological and adoptive parents as latent variables, permitting us in principle to leverage the thousands of adopted singleton individuals in the UK Biobank. We examine the power, utility and type I error rate of our model using simulations and asymptotic power calculations. We apply our model to polygenic scores of educational attainment and birth weight associated variants, in up to 5178 adopted singletons, 943 trios, 2687 mother-offspring pairs, 712 father-offspring pairs and 347980 singletons from the UK Biobank. Our results show the expected pattern of maternal genetic effects on offspring birth weight, but unexpectedly large prenatal maternal genetic effects on offspring educational attainment. Sensitivity and simulation analyses suggest this result may be at least partially due to adopted individuals in the UK Biobank being raised by their biological relatives. We show that accurate modelling of these sorts of cryptic relationships is sufficient to bring type I error rate under control and produce asymptotically unbiased estimates of prenatal and postnatal maternal genetic effects. We conclude that there would be considerable value in following up adopted individuals in the UK Biobank to determine whether they were raised by their biological relatives, and if so, to precisely ascertain the nature of these relationships. These adopted individuals could then be incorporated into informative statistical genetics models like the one described in our manuscript to further elucidate the genetic architecture of complex traits and diseases.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A CD4+ T cell reference map delineates subtype-specific adaptation during acute and chronic viral infections</a></h4>

              
                CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells are critical orchestrators of immune responses against a large variety of pathogens, including viruses. The multifaceted roles of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, including their help to innate cells, CD8<sup>+</sup> T and B cells and their support for long-lived immunity rely on a profound functional heterogeneity. While multiple CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell subtypes and their key transcriptional regulators have been identified, there is a lack of consistent definition for CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell transcriptional states. In addition, the progressive changes affecting CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell subtypes during and after immune responses remain poorly defined. Taking advantage of single-cell transcriptomics, efficient computational methods, and robust animal models, we characterize the transcriptional landscape of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells responding to self-resolving and chronic viral infections. We build a comprehensive map of virus-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and their evolution over time, and identify six major distinct cell states that are consistently observed in acute and chronic infections in mice. During the course of acute infections, T cell composition progressively changes from effector to memory states, with subtype-specific gene modules and kinetics. Conversely, T cells in persistent infections fail to transition from effector to memory states, and acquire distinct, chronicity-associated transcriptional programs. By single-cell T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing analysis, we characterize the clonal structure of virus-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells across individuals and T cell subtypes. We find that virus-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses are essentially private across individuals and that most T cells differentiate into both Tfh and Th1 subtypes irrespective of their TCR, in both acute and chronic infections. Finally, we show that our CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell map can be used as a reference to accurately interpret cell states in external single-cell datasets across tissues and disease models. Overall, this study describes a previously unappreciated level of adaptation of the transcriptional states of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells responding to viruses and provides a new computational resource for CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell analysis, available online at https://spica.unil.ch.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">HIF-1α induces glycolytic reprograming in tissue-resident alveolar macrophages to promote cell survival during acute lung injury</a></h4>

              
                Cellular metabolism is a critical regulator of macrophage effector function. Tissue-resident alveolar macrophages (TR-AMs) inhabit a unique niche marked by high oxygen and low glucose. We have recently shown that in contrast to bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs), TR-AMs do not utilize glycolysis and instead predominantly rely on mitochondrial function for their effector response. It is not known how changes in local oxygen concentration that occur during conditions such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) might affect TR-AM metabolism and function; however, ARDS is associated with progressive loss of TR-AMs, which correlates with the severity of disease and mortality. Here, we demonstrate that hypoxia robustly stabilizes HIF-1α in TR-AMs to promote a glycolytic phenotype. Hypoxia altered TR-AM metabolite signatures, cytokine production, and decreased their sensitivity to the inhibition of mitochondrial function. By contrast, hypoxia had minimal effects on BMDM metabolism. The effects of hypoxia on TR-AMs were mimicked by FG-4592, a HIF-1α stabilizer. Treatment with FG-4592 decreased TR-AM death and attenuated acute lung injury in mice. These findings reveal the importance of microenvironment in determining macrophage metabolic phenotype, and highlight the therapeutic potential in targeting cellular metabolism to improve outcomes in diseases characterized by acute inflammation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Human muscle spindles are wired to function as controllable signal-processing devices</a></h4>

              
                Muscle spindles are encapsulated sensory organs found in most of our muscles. Prevalent models of sensorimotor control assume the role of spindles is to reliably encode limb posture and movement. Here, I argue that the traditional view of spindles is outdated. Spindle organs can be tuned by spinal γ motor neurons that receive top-down and peripheral input, including from cutaneous afferents. A new model is presented, viewing γ motor activity as an intermediate coordinate transformation that allows multimodal information to converge on spindles, creating flexible coordinate representations at the level of the peripheral nervous system. That is, I propose that spindles play a unique overarching role in the nervous system: that of a peripheral signal-processing device that flexibly facilitates sensorimotor performance, according to task characteristics. This role is compatible with previous findings and supported by recent studies with naturalistically active humans. Such studies have so far shown that spindle tuning enables the independent preparatory control of reflex muscle stiffness, the selective extraction of information during implicit motor adaptation, and for segmental stretch reflexes to operate in joint space. Incorporation of advanced signal-processing at the periphery may well prove a critical step in the evolution of sensorimotor control theories.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Cryo-EM structures reveal that RFC recognizes both the 3′- and 5′-DNA ends to load PCNA onto gaps for DNA repair</a></h4>

              
                RFC uses ATP to assemble PCNA onto primed sites for replicative DNA polymerases d and e. The RFC pentamer forms a central chamber that binds 3′ ss/ds DNA junctions to load PCNA onto DNA during replication. We show here five structures that identify a 2<sup>nd</sup> DNA binding site in RFC that binds a 5′ duplex. This 5′ DNA site is located between the N-terminal BRCT domain and AAA+ module of the large Rfc1 subunit. Our structures reveal ideal binding to a 7-nt gap, which includes 2 bp unwound by the clamp loader. Biochemical studies show enhanced binding to 5 and 10 nt gaps, consistent with the structural results. Because both 3′ and 5′ ends are present at a ssDNA gap, we propose that the 5′ site facilitates RFC’s PCNA loading activity at a DNA damage-induced gap to recruit gap-filling polymerases. These findings are consistent with genetic studies showing that base excision repair of gaps greater than 1 base requires PCNA and involves the 5′ DNA binding domain of Rfc1. We further observe that a 5′ end facilitates PCNA loading at an RPA coated 30-nt gap, suggesting a potential role of the RFC 5′-DNA site in lagging strand DNA synthesis.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Correction of susceptibility distortion in EPI: a semi-supervised approach with deep learning.</a></h4>

              
                Echo planar imaging (EPI) is the most common approach for acquiring diffusion and functional MRI data due to its high temporal resolution. However, this comes at the cost of higher sensitivity to susceptibility-induced B0 field inhomogeneities around air/tissue interfaces. This leads to severe geometric distortions along the phase encoding direction (PED). To correct this distortion, the standard approach involves an analogous acquisition using an opposite PED leading to images with inverted distortions and then non-linear image registration, with a transformation model constrained along the PED, to estimate the voxel-wise shift that undistorts the image pair and generates a distortion-free image. With conventional image registration approaches, this type of processing is computationally intensive. Recent advances in unsupervised deep learning-based approaches to image registration have been proposed to drastically reduce the computational cost of this task. However, they rely on maximizing an intensity-based similarity measure, known to be suboptimal surrogate measures of image alignment. To address this limitation, we propose a semi-supervised deep learning algorithm that directly leverages ground truth spatial transformations during training. Simulated and real data experiments demonstrate improvement to distortion field recovery compared to the unsupervised approach, improvement image similarity compared to supervised approach and precision similar to TOPUP but with much faster processing.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Spatiotemporal properties of glutamate input support direction selectivity in the dendrites of retinal starburst amacrine cells</a></h4>

              
                The asymmetric summation of kinetically distinct glutamate inputs across the dendrites of retinal "starburst" amacrine cells is proposed to underlie their direction selective properties, but experimentally verifying input kinetics has been challenging. Here, we used two-photon glutamate sensor (iGluSnFR) imaging to directly measure the input kinetics across individual starburst dendrites. We found that signals measured from proximal dendrites were relatively sustained compared to those measured from distal dendrites. These differences were observed across a range of stimulus sizes and appeared to be shaped mainly by excitatory rather than inhibitory network interactions. Temporal deconvolution analysis suggests that the steady-state vesicle release rate was ~ 3 times larger at proximal sites compared to distal sites. Using a connectomics-inspired computational model, we demonstrate that input kinetics play an important role in shaping direction selectivity at low stimulus velocities. Together, these results provide direct support for the  space-time wiring model for direction selectivity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A branching model of cell fate decisions in the enteric nervous system</a></h4>

              
                How neurogenesis and gliogenesis are coordinated during development and why mature glial cells often share properties with neuroectodermal progenitors remains unclear. Here, we have used single cell RNA sequencing to map the regulatory landscape of neuronal and glial differentiation in the mammalian enteric nervous system (ENS). Our analysis indicates that neurogenic trajectories branch directly from a linear gliogenic axis defined by autonomic neural crest cells adopting sequential states as they progressively lose their strong neurogenic bias and acquire properties of adult enteric glia. We identify gene modules associated with transcriptional programs driving enteric neurogenesis and cell state transitions along the gliogenic axis. By comparing the chromatin accessibility profile of autonomic neural crest and adult enteric glia we provide evidence that the latter maintain an epigenetic memory of their neurogenic past. Finally, we demonstrate that adult enteric glia maintain neurogenic potential and are capable of generating enteric neurons in certain contexts by activating transcriptional programs employed by early ENS progenitors. Our studies uncover a novel configuration of enteric neurogenesis and gliogenesis that enables the coordinate development of ENS lineages and provides a mechanistic explanation for the ability of enteric glia to be functionally integrated into the adult intestine and simultaneously maintain attributes of early ENS progenitors.

                Geometric descriptions of deep neural networks (DNNs) have the potential to uncover core principles of computational models in neuroscience, while abstracting over the details of model architectures and training paradigms. Here we examined the geometry of DNN models of visual cortex by quantifying the latent dimensionality of their natural image representations. The prevailing view holds that optimal DNNs compress their representations onto low-dimensional manifolds to achieve invariance and robustness, which suggests that better models of visual cortex should have low-dimensional geometries. Surprisingly, we found a strong trend in the opposite direction---neural networks with high-dimensional image manifolds tend to have better generalization performance when predicting cortical responses to held-out stimuli in both monkey electrophysiology and human fMRI data. These findings held across a diversity of design parameters for DNNs, and they suggest a general principle whereby high-dimensional geometry confers a striking benefit to DNN models of visual cortex.

                Numerous T1- and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have separately assessed the contribution of hippocampal gray matter macrostructure (volume) and macrostructure (diffusion) to age-related declines in episodic memory, respectively. Here, we simultaneously examined the unique and joint contribution of these distinct imaging modalities in the same sample of 84 young and 66 older adults who underwent a structural MRI protocol and completed the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test. As expected, older age was significantly related to smaller volume and higher diffusion (intracellular, dispersion, and free) in bilateral hippocampus and to worse episodic memory performance (immediate and delayed free recall, recognition). Structural equation modelling further revealed that the age-memory relationship was significantly mediated by hippocampal diffusion, but not volume. A non-significant influential indirect effect further revealed that volume and diffusion did not jointly mediate the age-memory relationship. These findings indicate that hippocampal microstructure uniquely contributes to age-related declines in episodic memory and suggest that microstructure and macrostructure capture distinct neurobiological properties of hippocampal gray matter.

                Risky decisions involve choosing between options where the outcomes are uncertain. Cognitive tasks such as the CANTAB Cambridge Gamble Task (CGT) have revealed that patients with depression make more conservative decisions, but the mechanisms of choice evaluation underlying such decisions, and how they lead to the observed differences in depression, remain unknown. To test this, we used a computational modelling approach in a broad general-population sample (N = 753) who performed the CANTAB CGT and completed questionnaires assessing symptoms of mental illness, including depression. We fit five different computational models to the data, including two novel ones, and found that a novel model that uses an inverse power function in the loss domain (contrary to standard Prospect Theory accounts), and is influenced by the probabilities but not the magnitudes of different outcomes, captures the characteristics of our dataset very well. Surprisingly, model parameters were not significantly associated with any mental health questionnaire scores, including depression scales; but they were related to demographic variables, particularly age, with stronger associations than typical model-agnostic task measures. This study showcases a new methodology to analyse data from CANTAB CGT, describes a noteworthy null finding with respect to mental health symptoms, and demonstrates the added precision that a computational approach can offer.

                Recently, a new kind of sensor applicable in magnetoencephalography (MEG) has been presented: a solid-state yttrium-iron garnet magnetometer (YIGM). The feasibility of YIGM was proved in alpha-rhythm registration experiment. In the current paper, we propose the analysis of lead-field matrices for different possible YIGM multi-channel on-scalp sensor layouts with respect to the information theory. We use real noise level of the new sensor to compute signal power, signal-to-noise ration (SNR) and total information capacity, and compare them with corresponding metrics that can be obtained with well-established MEG systems: based on superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) and optically-pumped magnetometers (OPMs). This simulation study is aimed to shed some light on the direction for further development of YIGM sensor, namely creation of multi-channel YIG-MEG.

                To understand how pharmacological interventions can exert their powerful effects on brain function, we need to understand how they engage the brain's rich neurotransmitter landscape. Here, we bridge microscale molecular chemoarchitecture and pharmacologically-induced macroscale functional reorganisation, by relating the regional distribution of 18 neurotransmitter receptors and transporters obtained from Positron Emission Tomography, and the regional changes in functional MRI connectivity induced by 7 different mind-altering drugs including anaesthetics, psychedelics, and cognitive enhancers. Our results reveal that psychoactive drugs exert their effects on brain function by engaging multiple neurotransmitter systems. Intriguingly, the effects of both anaesthetics and psychedelics on brain function, though opposite, are organised along hierarchical gradients of brain structure and function. Finally, we show that regional co-susceptibility to pharmacological interventions recapitulates co-susceptibility to disorder-induced structural alterations. Collectively, these results highlight rich statistical patterns relating molecular chemoarchitecture and drug-induced reorganisation of the brain's functional architecture.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">How tactile afferents in the human fingerpad encode tangential torques associated with manipulation: are we better than monkeys?</a></h4>

              
                Dexterous object manipulation depends critically on information about forces normal and tangential to the fingerpads, and also on torque associated with object orientation at grip surfaces. In this study we investigated how torque information is encoded by human tactile afferents, including slowly adapting type-II (SA-II) afferents, in the fingerpads. SA-II afferent properties seemed perfectly suited for torque encoding but could not be previously investigated as they are absent in the glabrous skin of monkeys. Torques of different magnitudes (3.5-7.5 mNm) were applied in clockwise and anticlockwise directions to a standard central site on the fingerpads of 34 participants. Torques were superimposed on a 2 N, 3 N, or 4 N background normal force. Unitary microneurography recordings were made from fast adapting type-I (FA-I, n=39), slowly adapting type-I (SA-I, n=31), and type-II (SA-II, n=13) afferents supplying the fingerpads. All three afferent types encoded torque magnitude and direction, with SA-II afferents showing excitatory and inhibitory modulation depending on torque direction. Most afferents of all three types had higher torque sensitivity with smaller normal force. FA-I afferents showed the best torque magnitude and worst directional discrimination abilities in both species. Human SA-I afferent response to static torque was inferior to dynamic stimuli, while in monkeys the opposite was true. In humans this might be compensated by the addition of a sustained SA-II afferent input. In comparison to monkeys the performance of each afferent type was inferior in humans, likely due to differences in fingertip tissue compliance and skin friction.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">"Leap before you look": Conditions that promote implicit visuomotor adaptation without explicit learning</a></h4>

              
                When learning a novel visuomotor mapping (e.g., mirror writing), accuracy can improve quickly through explicit learning (e.g., move left to go right) but after considerable practice, implicit learning takes over, producing fast, natural movements. This implicit learning occurs automatically, but it has been unknown whether explicit learning is similarly obligatory. Using a reaching task with a 90-degree rotation between screen position and movement direction, we found that explicit learning could be "turned off" by introducing the rotation gradually (increments of 10-degrees) and instructing participants to move quickly. These specific conditions were crucial, because both explicit and implicit learning occurred if the rotation occurred suddenly, if participants were told to emphasize accuracy, or if visual feedback during movement was removed. We reached these conclusions by examining the time course of learning (e.g., whether there was fast improvement followed by a long tail of additional improvement), by examining the aftereffects of learning when the rotation was abruptly removed, and by using formal model comparison between a dual-state (explicit and implicit) versus a single-state learning model as applied to the data.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cervical Spinal Cord Modulation with Repeated Epidural Stimulation in Healthy Adult Rats</a></h4>

              
                The effects of spinal epidural stimulation (ES) in regaining various physiological functions after a spinal cord injury (SCI) are well documented. Spinal evoked motor responses (SEMR) are commonly utilized experimental outcomes in longitudinal pre-clinical and human studies to reflect the in-vivo physiological changes in neural networks secondary to a neurological insult or neuro-rehabilitative treatments utilizing ES. However, it remains unknown if the repeated exposure to ES during SEMRs testing itself modulates the spinal cord physiology and hence the SEMRs characteristics. To address this issue, cervical ES was delivered to the healthy adult rats' cervical cord using standard stimulation paradigms during multiple sessions (~17 hours that spanned across 100 days). Cervical SEMR and electromyography (EMG) activity from forelimb muscles during a reaching & grasping task were collected before and after 100 days. We noted persistent increase in the cervical SEMR and forelimb muscle activity during reaching & grasping task relative to baseline at the end of the stimulation period indicating increased spinal and cortical excitability. Findings from the present work suggests that cervical SEMRs are amenable to modulation by routine ES testing protocols, with prominent changes in the mono and poly synaptic component of evoked responses. Additionally, since multiple testing sessions of cervical ES alone increases the excitability of the intact spinal cord, we suggest that SEMR data be used with caution to infer the physiological status of the spinal circuitry in longitudinal studies involving multiple SEMR testing sessions. Our findings also recommend involving appropriate control groups, motor behavior correlates, and practicing caution while utilizing normalization methods to allow meaningful functional interpretation of SEMR profiles following a SCI.

                Psychological loss is a common experience that erodes well-being and negatively impacts quality of life. The molecular underpinnings of loss are poorly understood, making it challenging to develop treatment strategies. Here, we investigate the mechanisms of loss using an enrichment removal (ER) paradigm in rats. A comprehensive multi-omics investigation of the basolateral amygdala (BLA), spanning multiple cohorts, platforms, and analyses, revealed alterations in microglia and extracellular matrix (ECM). Follow-up studies indicated that ER decreased microglia size, complexity, and phagocytosis, suggesting reduced immune surveillance. Loss also substantially increased ECM coverage, specifically targeting perineuronal nets surrounding parvalbumin interneurons, suggesting decreased plasticity and increased inhibition in the BLA. Behavioral analyses suggests that these molecular effects are linked to impaired BLA salience evaluation and flexibility, phenotypes that resemble emotional blunting observed in human loss. Taken together, these experiments help us understand the mechanisms underlying loss and reveal novel molecular targets to ameliorate its impact.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Plan versus motion-referenced generalization of fast and slow processes in reach adaptation</a></h4>

              
                Generalization in motor learning refers to the transfer of a learned compensation to other relevant contexts. The generalization function is typically assumed to be of Gaussian shape, centered on the planned motion, although more recent studies associate generalization with the actual motion. Because motor learning is thought to involve multiple adaptive processes with different time constants, we hypothesized that these processes have different time-dependent contributions to the generalization. Guided by a model-based approach, the objective of the present study was to experimentally examine these contributions. We first reformulated a validated two-state adaptation model as a combination of weighted motor primitives, each specified as a Gaussian-shaped tuning function. Adaptation in this model is achieved by updating individual weights of the primitives of the fast and slow adaptive process separately. Depending on whether updating occurred in a plan-referenced or a motion-referenced manner, the model predicted distinct contributions to the overall generalization by the slow and fast process. We tested 23 participants in a reach adaptation task, using a spontaneous recovery paradigm consisting of five successive blocks of a long adaptation phase to a viscous force field, a short adaptation phase with the opposite force, and an error-clamp phase. Generalization was assessed in eleven movement directions relative to the trained target direction. Results of our participant population fell within a continuum of evidence for plan-referenced to evidence for motion-referenced updating. This mixture may reflect the differential weighting of explicit and implicit compensation strategies among participants.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Intense light unleashes male courtship behaviorin wild-type Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Studies of the Drosophila courtship repertoire have elucidated several principles of the neurogenetic organization of complex behavior. Based on a multi-modal integration of olfactory, gustatory, visual, and acoustic cues, males perform stereotypic patterns of chasing, courtship song production, and copulation attempts (Hall, 1994; Yamamoto & Koganezawa, 2013). Here we report a serendipitous finding that intense light (~18 klx, comparable to direct sunlight) induces courtship-associated motor activity in wild-type (WT) male flies, including chasing with wing extension and song production. The intensified male courtship behavior was directed to both male or female targets, as shown in both male-only and mixed sex arenas. However, in male-only chambers, we found extreme behavioral manifestations such as "chaining" and "wheeling", which resembled previously reported homosexual behavior in certain mini-white+ constructs (Zhang & Odenwald, 1995; Yin Hing & Carlson, 1996) and fruitless mutants (Ito et al., 1996). Investigations into the required sensory systems, yielded results of strong implications. In visual system mutants with defective photo-sensitive or screening pigments (norpA), the phenomenon was absent. Even in sevenless mutants, where the high-acuity blue/UV channels are disrupted but motion sensitivity is preserved (Yamaguchi, Wolf, Desplan, & Heisenberg, 2008), light-triggered courtship was greatly attenuated. However, light-induced courtship was unhampered in flies lacking acoustic signals (with wings cut to disrupt song production). Strikingly, we observed unrestrained male-male courtship behavior in olfactory mutants (orco and sbl). Particularly, orco males displayed maximum courtship scores regardless of light intensity. Together our observations support the notion that male courtship is restrained by olfactory cues and can be unleashed by strong visual stimulation in Drosophila.
