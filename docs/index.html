	<p>Over the past twenty years, scientific research on body representations has grown significantly, with Body Memory (BM) emerging as a prominent area of interest in neurorehabilitation. Compared to other body representations, BM stands out as one of the most obscure due to the multifaceted nature of the concept of &amp;amp;ldquo;memory&amp;amp;rdquo; itself, which includes various aspects (such as implicit vs. explicit, conscious vs. unconscious). The concept of body memory originates from the field of phenomenology and has been developed by research groups studying embodied cognition. In this narrative review, we aim to present compelling evidence from recent studies that explore various definitions and explanatory models of BM. Additionally, we will provide a comprehensive overview of the empirical settings used to examine BM. The results can be categorized into two main areas: (i) how the body influences our memories, and (ii) how memories, in their broadest sense, could generate and/or influence metarepresentations&amp;amp;mdash;the ability to reflect on or make inferences about one&amp;amp;rsquo;s own cognitive representations or those of others. We present studies that emphasize the significance of BM in experimental settings involving patients with neurological and psychiatric disorders, ultimately analyzing these findings from an ontogenic perspective.</p>

                <p>Seizures are generally associated with epilepsy but may also be a symptom of many other neurological conditions. A hallmark of a seizure is the intensity of the local neuronal activation, which can drive large-scale gene transcription changes. Such changes in the transcriptional profile likely alter neuronal function, thereby contributing to the pathological process. Therefore, there is a strong clinical imperative to characterize how gene expression is changed by seizure activity. To this end, we developed a simplified ex vivo technique for studying seizure-induced transcriptional changes. We compared the RNA sequencing profile in mouse neocortical tissue with up to 3&nbsp;h of epileptiform activity induced by 4-aminopyridine (4AP) relative to control brain slices not exposed to the drug. We identified over 100 genes with significantly altered expression after 4AP treatment, including multiple genes involved in MAPK, TNF, and neuroinflammatory signaling pathways, all of which have been linked to epilepsy previously. Notably, the patterns in male and female brain slices were almost identical. Various immediate early genes were among those showing the largest upregulation. The set of down-regulated genes included ones that might be expected either to increase or to decrease neuronal excitability. In summary, we found the seizure-induced transcriptional profile complex, but the changes aligned well with an analysis of published epilepsy-associated genes. We discuss how simple models may provide new angles for investigating seizure-induced transcriptional changes.</p>

                <p>High-density linear probes, such as Neuropixels, provide an unprecedented opportunity to understand how neural populations within specific laminar compartments contribute to behavior. Marmoset monkeys, unlike macaque monkeys, have a lissencephalic (smooth) cortex that enables recording perpendicular to the cortical surface, thus making them an ideal animal model for studying laminar computations. Here we present a method for acute Neuropixels recordings in the common marmoset (<I>Callithrix jacchus</I>). The approach replaces the native dura with an artificial silicon-based dura that grants visual access to the cortical surface, which is helpful in avoiding blood vessels, ensures perpendicular penetrations, and could be used in conjunction with optical imaging or optogenetic techniques. The chamber housing the artificial dura is simple to maintain with minimal risk of infection and could be combined with semichronic microdrives and wireless recording hardware. This technique enables repeated acute penetrations over a period of several months. With occasional removal of tissue growth on the pial surface, recordings can be performed for a year or more. The approach is fully compatible with Neuropixels probes, enabling the recording of hundreds of single neurons distributed throughout the cortical column.</p>

                <p>by Samuel H. Church, Jasmine L. Mah, Casey W. Dunn</p>

Comparisons of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data across species can reveal links between cellular gene expression and the evolution of cell functions, features, and phenotypes. These comparisons evoke evolutionary histories, as depicted by phylogenetic trees, that define relationships between species, genes, and cells. This Essay considers each of these in turn, laying out challenges and solutions derived from a phylogenetic comparative approach and relating these solutions to previously proposed methods for the pairwise alignment of cellular dimensional maps. This Essay contends that species trees, gene trees, cell phylogenies, and cell lineages can all be reconciled as descriptions of the same concept—the tree of cellular life. By integrating phylogenetic approaches into scRNA-seq analyses, challenges for building informed comparisons across species can be overcome, and hypotheses about gene and cell evolution can be robustly tested.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002519">Male allocation to ejaculation and mating effort imposes different life history trade-offs</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Meng-Han Joseph Chung, Rebecca J. Fox, Michael D. Jennions</p>

When males compete, sexual selection favors reproductive traits that increase their mating or fertilization success (pre- and postcopulatory sexual selection). It is assumed that males face a trade-off between these 2 types of sexual traits because they both draw from the same pool of resources. Consequently, allocation into mate acquisition or ejaculation should create similar trade-offs with other key life history traits. Tests of these assumptions are exceedingly rare. Males only ejaculate after they mate, and the costs of ejaculation are therefore highly confounded with those of mating effort. Consequently, little is known about how each component of reproductive allocation affects a male’s future performance. Here, we ran an experiment using a novel technique to distinguish the life history costs of mating effort and ejaculation for mosquitofish (<i>Gambusia holbrooki</i>). We compared manipulated males (mate without ejaculation), control males (mate and ejaculate), and naïve males (neither mate nor ejaculate) continuously housed with a female and 2 rival males. We assessed their growth, somatic maintenance, mating and fighting behavior, and sperm traits after 8 and 16 weeks. Past mating effort significantly lowered a male’s future mating effort and growth, but not his sperm production, while past sperm release significantly lowered a male’s future ejaculate quantity, but not his mating effort. Immune response was the only trait impacted by both past mating effort and past ejaculation. These findings challenge the assumption that male reproductive allocation draws from a common pool of resources to generate similar life history costs later in life. Instead, we provide clear evidence that allocation into traits under pre- and postcopulatory sexual selection have different trait-specific effects on subsequent male reproductive performance.

                Background The application of disinfectants on dental instruments is one way to prevent cross-infection. Cross infection can occur due to microorganisms found in blood, saliva and dental plaque which can contaminate the instruments used by dental health workers. Thus, indirect contact transmission of pathogenic microorganisms occurs from instruments that have been contaminated by dental health workers. Ozone water and 4.8% chloroxylenol are disinfecting agents used to disinfect medical instruments. This study aimed to determine the effectiveness of disinfection of ozone water and 4.8% chloroxylenol in reducing the number of bacterial colonies on dental extraction instruments at the USU Dental and Oral Hospital between October-December 2022. Methods The samples used were mandibular molar pliers that have been used in tooth extraction procedures. This study was experimental and used three sample groups, where each group consisted of 10 tooth extraction instruments. The treatment group used ozone water and 4.8% chloroxylenol and the negative control group was cleaned with distilled water. The test effectiveness in this study used bacteria colony counter using the scatter cup method. Data were analyzed using the Kruskal Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests. Results The results of the data analysis showed a p-value ≤0.001, which means that there was a significant difference in the disinfection using ozone water and 4.8% chloroxylenol on the number of bacterial colonies on dental extraction instruments. The results of this study show that the average number of bacterial colonies formed in the ozone water treatment group was 4.00 ± 4.32, 16.00 ± 6.65 in the 4.8% chloroxylenol treatment group, and 217.50 ± 39.24 in the negative control group (Aquadest). Conclusions From this study it can be said that ozone water is more effective in disinfecting dental extraction instruments than 4.8% chloroxylenol.

                Background: Home-based rehabilitation exercise following Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA) shows similar outcomes compared to supervised outpatient rehabilitation exercise. Little is known about patients’ experiences with home-based rehabilitation, and this study aimed to investigate patient-perceived facilitators and barriers to home-based rehabilitation exercise and general physical activity after THA. Methods: Semi-structured interviews of qualitative design were conducted with 22 patients who had undergone THA and who had performed home-based rehabilitation exercise. The study took place in a regional hospital in Denmark between January 2018 and May 2019. Data was analyzed using an interpretive thematic analysis approach, with theoretical underpinning from the concept ‘conduct of everyday life’. The study is embedded within the Pragmatic Home-Based Exercise Therapy after Total Hip Arthroplasty-Silkeborg trial (PHETHAS-1), which aims to quantitatively investigate recovery outcomes after a home-based rehabilitation exercise program. Results: The main theme, ‘wishing to return to the well-known everyday life’, and the subtheme ‘general physical activity versus rehabilitation exercise’ were identified. Generally, participants found the home-based rehabilitation exercise boring but were motivated by the goal of returning to their habitual conduct of everyday life and performing their usual general physical activities. Participants enrolled in the PHETHAS-1 study used the enrollment as part of their motivation for doing the exercises.  Both pain and the absence of pain were identified as barriers for doing home-based rehabilitation exercise. Pain could cause insecurity about possible medical complications, while the absence of pain could lead to the rehabilitation exercise being perceived as pointless. Conclusions: The overall goal for the THA patients was to return to their habitual everyday life. This goal served as a facilitator for undertaking home-based rehabilitation exercise. Being able to perform usual activities paradoxically became a barrier for some participants, as they were more motivated to engage in general physical activity than the rehabilitation exercise.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-393/v2?src=rss">Clinical efficacy of titanium prepared platelet rich fibrin in periodontal regeneration: A systematic review and meta-analysis [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Periodontal regeneration therapies frequently involve autologous platelet concentrates (APCs). They can be used in sinus lift surgeries and socket preservation, among other clinical settings. Platelet rich fibrin (PRF) membrane has been used to treat gingival recession in individuals or groups of individuals using a coronally progressed or lateral pedicle flap. In the treatment of mixed periodontic endodontic lesion/furcation defect, PRF functions as a healing and interpositional biomaterial, filling a cystic cavity. PRF is known to help the bone regeneration process. In the last few years, efforts have been made to enhance the PRFs characteristics and quality. One of them is titanium platelet rich fibrin (T-PRF). Third-generation platelet concentrate no longer contains silica, and its preparation in glass vacuum containers, that no longer creates any known concerns. The effectiveness PRF’s has been evaluated in connective tissue and bone repair. The aim of this study is to compare T-PRF to other platelet concentrates and different treatment modalities for periodontal regenerative procedures. Methods A protocol of this systematic review have been registered in prospero (CRD42022293545). The online database searched were PUBMED, COCHRANE for published articles up to November 2022 without language restrictions. Studies in trial registers, handsearching, bibliographic references of relevant articles were also checked. Data collection and analysis was done by individual authors. Independent eligibility assessments were conducted by four review authors. Then, using the standard Cochrane methodology, four review authors extracted the data and evaluated the risk of bias for individual studies. We developed “Summary of findings” tables and used GRADE to evaluate the evidence. Results Three studies were included for meta-analysis. Results of meta-analysis supported that T-PRF is effective for correction of both hard and soft tissue defects. Conclusions The overall qualitative and quantitative analysis suggest that T-PRF has superior structural properties and thicker fibrin network for ensuring predictable success periodontal regenerative procedures.

                This meta-analysis is an investigation into anomalous perception (i.e., conscious identification of information without any conventional sensorial means). The technique used for eliciting an effect is the Ganzfeld condition (a form of sensory homogenization that eliminates distracting peripheral noise). The database consists of studies published between January 1974 and December 2020 inclusive. The overall effect size estimated both with a frequentist and a Bayesian random-effect model, were in close agreement yielding an effect size of approximately .08 (.04 -.12). This result passed four publication bias tests and seems not contaminated by questionable research practices. Trend analysis carried out with a cumulative meta-analysis and a meta-regression model with year of publication as a covariate, did not indicate sign of decline of this effect size. The moderators’ analyses show that the selected participants’ effect size was almost three-times that obtained by non-selected participants and that tasks that simulate telepathic communication show a two-fold effect size for tasks requiring the participants to guess a target.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-536/v1?src=rss">Effect of physical rehabilitation using oromotor stimulation, manual airway clearance technique, positioning, tactile and kinaesthetic stimulation (PROMPT) protocol on respiratory and neuromuscular function in neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (NRDS)</a></h4>

              
                Background Neonatal Respiratory Distress Syndrome (NRDS) remains a significant challenge in neonatal care, often leading to respiratory compromise and neuromuscular dysfunction. While advances in medical management have improved outcomes, adjunctive therapies such as physical rehabilitation offer potential benefits yet require further investigation. This protocol outlines a randomized controlled trial aiming to evaluate the effect of Physical Rehabilitation using Oro Motor Stimulation, Manual Airway Clearance Technique, Positioning, Tactile, and Kinesthetic Stimulation (PROMPT) protocol on respiratory and neuromuscular function in neonates with NRDS. Methods The trial will include 38 neonates diagnosed with NRDS, randomly allocated into two groups: the intervention group receiving the PROMPT protocol alongside standard care, and the control group receiving standard care alone. The PROMPT protocol comprises a comprehensive approach targeting oromotor stimulation, manual airway clearance technique, optimal positioning, and tactile/kinesthetic stimulation. Outcome measures Primary outcomes will focus on respiratory parameters such as oxygenation index, ventilatory support requirements, and neuromuscular function assessed through muscle tone and reflexes. Secondary outcomes will encompass length of hospital stay, incidence of complications, and neurodevelopmental outcomes at follow-up. Results Data analysis will employ appropriate statistical methods to compare outcomes between the intervention and control groups, with adjustments for potential confounders. Ethical approval has been obtained, and informed consent will be obtained from parents or legal guardians before enrolment. Conclusion This trial protocol aims to provide valuable insights into the efficacy and safety of the PROMPT protocol as a rehabilitative intervention for NRDS. The findings may inform future clinical practice and contribute to optimizing care strategies for neonates with NRDS, ultimately improving their short- and long-term outcomes.

                Background Fatty liver, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular disease are just a few of the well-known cardiometabolic complications associated with childhood obesity. Microalbuminuria (MA) is a sign of early kidney impairment, as seen in adults, and recent research supports its presence in children with obesity as well as its potential relationship with cardiometabolic variables. Both adults and children share this well-established pathophysiological theory. Indicated a close connection with the main aspect of fatness, such as IR, through the renal hemodynamic effects of insulin. More scientific consideration must be given to the assessment of primary kidney injury in obese children, given the pathological and prognostic implications of this association in everyday practise (counting an elevated danger of developing long term renal disorder over time). Method case-control study is going to be conducted among the patients of AVBRH hospital. A total of thirty participants with fifteen obese and fifteen non obeses controls were included in this study. Result The expected result of the study can determine the correlation between obesity and microalbuminuria, The value of microalbuminuria is high in obese patients as compared to nonobese patients. Conclusion The risk of problems in obese patients can be predicted using microalbuminuria, which can help lower the overall morbidity and mortality associated with renal function.

                Background Over the past few decades, WHO has made massive efforts to promote the development of a vaccine against Lassa virus (LASV), one of the top ten priority pathogens for research and development under the WHO R&D Blueprint for Emerging Infections. To date, several vaccines are at different stages of development. In this scenario, a validated and standardised assay to measure LSV neutralising antibodies is urgently needed for vaccine development and comparison. Methods The neutralisation assay remains the gold standard for determining antibody efficacy. Here we have proposed a safe and validated pseudotyped neutralisation assay for LASV, taking advantage of the development of the first WHO International Standard and Reference Panel for Anti-Lassa Fever (NIBSC code 21/332). Results and Conclusions The proposed results demonstrate that the pseudotyped luciferase neutralisation assay is a specific serological test for the measurement of LASV neutralising antibodies without cross-reacting with standard sera specific for heterologous viral infections. In addition, the assay is accurate, precise, and linear according to criteria and statistical analyses defined and accepted by international guidelines.

                Background RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is a widely used technique in many scientific studies. Given the plethora of models and software packages that have been developed for processing and analyzing RNA-seq datasets, choosing the most appropriate ones is a time-consuming process that requires an in-depth understanding of the data, as well as of the principles and parameters of each tool. In addition, packages designed for individual tasks are developed in different programming languages and have dependencies of various degrees of complexity, which renders their installation and execution challenging for users with limited computational expertise. Workflow languages and execution engines with support for virtualization and encapsulation options such as containers and Conda environments facilitate these tasks considerably. The resulting computational workflows can then be reliably shared with the scientific community, enhancing reusability and the reproducibility of results as individual analysis steps are becoming more transparent and portable. Methods Here we present ZARP, a general purpose RNA-seq analysis workflow that builds on state-of-the-art software in the field to facilitate the analysis of RNA-seq datasets. ZARP is developed in the Snakemake workflow language and can run locally or in a cluster environment, generating extensive reports not only of the data but also of the options utilized. It is built using modern technologies with the ultimate goal to reduce the hands-on time for bioinformaticians and non-expert users and serve as a template for future workflow development. To this end, we also provide ZARP-cli, a dedicated command-line interface that may make running ZARP on an RNA-seq library of interest as easy as executing a single two-word command. Conclusions ZARP is a powerful RNA-seq analysis workflow that is easy to use even for beginners, built using best software development practices, available under a permissive Open Source license and open to contributions by the scientific community.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The consolidation of memory is thought to ultimately depend on the synthesis of new proteins, since translational inhibitors such as anisomycin and cycloheximide adversely affect the permanence of long-term memory. However, when applied directly in brain, these agents also profoundly suppress neural activity to an extent that is directly correlated to the degree of protein synthesis inhibition caused. Given that neural activity itself is likely to help mediate consolidation, this finding is a serious criticism of the strict de novo protein hypothesis of memory. Here, we test the neurophysiological effects of another translational inhibitor, emetine. Unilateral intra-hippocampal infusion of emetine suppressed ongoing local field and multiunit activity at ipsilateral sites as compared to the contralateral hippocampus in a fashion that was positively correlated to the degree of protein synthesis inhibition as confirmed by autoradiography. This suppression of activity was also specific to the circumscribed brain region in which protein synthesis inhibition took place. These experiments provide further evidence that ongoing protein synthesis is necessary and fundamental for neural function and suggest that the disruption of memory observed in behavioral experiments using translational inhibitors may be due, in large part, to neural suppression.</p>

                Petrous face meningioma presents a significant difficulty in neurosurgery because of its complex anatomical position near cranial nerves, brainstem, and important blood vessels. This case report describes the clinical course and successful surgical treatment of a 50-year-old female patient who had a two-month history of ataxia, along with a one-week episode of severe headache and vomiting. An MRI verified the existence of a petrous face meningioma after a thorough diagnostic assessment. Following that, the patient had a left retro-sigmoid craniotomy, which led to the complete excision of the tumour and relief of symptoms. A thorough one-month follow-up examination showed no recurring symptoms, suggesting a positive result and successful clearance of the meningioma. This case highlights the need of timely diagnosis and surgical treatment in dealing with petrous face meningioma, focusing on attaining complete tumour excision. This case demonstrates the success of complete removal of a tumour and the possibility of full return of neurological function in individuals with similar symptoms. This article enhances the current literature by offering insights into the management of petrous face meningioma and recommending a thorough surgical strategy to improve patient outcomes.

                Background The potential of Islamic crowdfunding to encourage the development of Islamic fintech globally, even in countries with non-Muslim majority populations, needs to be examined in a literature study on this issue. More extensive research is needed regarding the factors that most reliably predict the success of Islamic crowdfunding, such as compliance with Islamic crowdfunding laws, sustainability, and the potential of Islamic finance. This article describes a comprehensive and systematic Literature Review (SLR) regarding papers published in the field of Islamic crowdfunding. This research aims to contribute to a better understanding of Islamic crowdfunding, provide useful information for practitioners, and stimulate further research in the field to increase the success of Islamic crowdfunding. Methods We conducted a review of selected papers to identify gaps and significant issues in Islamic crowdfunding, providing guidance for future researchers. This article review was based on 704 articles retrieved using the keyword “Islamic crowdfunding” from the Scopus database between 2013 and 2022. To minimize bias, we formulated 5 research questions to guide our analysis: RQ1: How do publication and citation rates vary annually? RQ2: How can we determine the most influential studies based on citation counts for each keyword? RQ3: What are the most common subject areas addressed in Islamic crowdfunding literature from 2013 to 2022? RQ4: What are the most frequently used keywords in Scopus documents? RQ5: How are Islamic values discussed in articles related to Islamic crowdfunding? Results The findings of this research demonstrate that Islamic crowdfunding, characterized by interdisciplinary scholarship, has emerged as an increasingly significant alternative for aiding society and the economy. It contributes to poverty alleviation and the development of specific sectors through channels such as crowdfunding for small and medium enterprises and social projects tailored to meet the diverse needs of Muslims. However, the challenge facing the future development of Sharia crowdfunding is that, despite its benefit of increasing community participation in projects aligned with religious values, it also carries the potential risk of investment losses and non-compliance with Sharia principles. Ways to address the current scarcity of Sharia fintech are also needed, ensuring its broader acceptance across all societal levels, and enhancing Muslims’ understanding of compliance with Islamic religious rules, particularly Fiqh law. Conclusion Urgently needed are specific fiqh regulatory guidelines to ensure that Sharia-compliant crowdfunding adheres to Islamic principles. Government support, particularly through legislation in countries where the majority of the population is Muslim, is crucial to enhance public participation and trust in Sharia crowdfunding.

                Background Malnourished pregnant women are at increased risk of micronutrient deficiency. We assessed the vitamin B12 status in both malnourished and normally nourished pregnant women and their neonates. Additionally, we studied the association between maternal B12 levels, cord B12 levels and neonatal anthropometry. Methods This cross-sectional study enrolled 63 malnourished and 63 normally nourished mothers and neonates. Maternal and cord blood samples were collected at the time of delivery for estimation of vitamin B12 levels. Maternal and cord vitamin B12 levels were compared using the Mann–Whitney U test. Neonatal anthropometry was correlated with maternal and cord B12 levels using Spearman’s correlation. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 25. Results Mean maternal age was 26.58 yrs. The median cord B12 levels were lower than the maternal B12 levels. Maternal B12 levels showed a strong positive correlation with cord B12 levels (rho = 0.879; p < 0.001). Maternal (p < 0.001) and cord (p < 0.001) vitamin B12 levels were significantly lower in the malnourished group than in the normally nourished group. In malnourished group, 66.8% mothers and 95.2% neonates were Vitamin B12 deficient, whereas 1.5% mothers and 4.7% neonates were vitamin B12 deficient in normally nourished group. In the malnourished group, maternal B12 levels were positively correlated with birth weight (rho 0.363, p = 0.003) and length (rho 0.330, p =0.008), whereas cord B12 levels were positively correlated with birth weight in the normally nourished group. (rho 0.277 p= 0.028) Conclusion High rates of vitamin B12 deficiency were observed in malnourished mothers and neonates. There was a positive correlation between birth weight, length, and maternal vitamin B12 levels in malnourished mothers. These findings emphasize the need to address maternal malnutrition and vitamin B12 deficiency to improve neonatal health.

                A majority of humans maintain normal function despite exposure to severe stress. Work in rodents reveals that such stress resilience is mediated largely by the induction of molecular, cellular, and circuit adaptations that actively drive resilience. Such discoveries are guiding the development of novel treatments for human stress disorders.

These degradative effects are mediated by the lysosome, and heat shock exposure directs HSP-90 to lysosomes and lysosome-related organelles, in a CUL-6-dependent manner.

                During aging, neuromuscular synaptic connections between muscles and neurons degenerate and motor ability diminishes. Banerjee et al. show in Drosophila that Trio protein, which can regulate synaptic structures, declines during aging. Increasing Trio levels maintains motor synapse integrity and postpones the weakening of motor ability as animals age.

Using computational modeling, they predict that synaptic parameters have similar dynamics.

">Perceptual tri-stability, measured and fitted as emergent from a model for bistable alternations</a></h4>

              
                The human auditory system in attempting to decipher ambiguous sounds appears to resort to perceptual exploration as evidenced by multi-stable perceptual alternations. This phenomenon has been widely investigated via the auditory streaming paradigm, employing ABA_ triplet sequences with much research focused on perceptual bi-stability with the alternate percepts as either a single integrated stream or as two simultaneous distinct streams. We extend this inquiry with experiments and modeling to include tri-stable perception. Here, the segregated percepts may involve a foreground/background distinction. We collected empirical data from participants engaged in a tri-stable auditory task, utilizing this dataset to refine a neural mechanistic model that had successfully reproduced multiple features of auditory bi-stability. Remarkably, the model successfully emulated basic statistical characteristics of tri-stability without substantial modification. This model also allows us to demonstrate a parsimonious approach to account for individual variability by adjusting the parameter of either the noise level or the neural adaptation strength.

	<p>Adults and infants form abstract categories of visual objects, but little is known about the development of global categorization. This study aims to characterize the development of very fast global categorization (living and non-living objects) and to determine whether and how low-level stimulus characteristics contribute to this response. Frequency tagging was used to characterize the development of global-level categorization in N = 69 infants (4, 7, 11 months), N = 22 children (5&amp;amp;ndash;6 years old), and N = 20 young adults. Images were presented in an oddball paradigm, with a category change at every fifth position (AAAABAAAABA&amp;amp;hellip;). Strong and significant high-level categorization was observed in all age groups, with reduced responses for phase-scrambled control sequences (R2 = 0.34&amp;amp;ndash;0.73). No differences between the categorization of living and non-living targets were observed. These data demonstrate high-level visual categorization as living and non-living from four months to adulthood, providing converging evidence that humans are highly sensitive to broad categorical information from infancy onward.</p>

	<p>Childhood apraxia of speech (CAS) represents a significant diagnostic and therapeutic challenge within the field of clinical neuropsychology, characterized by its nuanced presentation and multifactorial nature. The aim of this study was to distil and synthesize the broad spectrum of research into a coherent model for the assessment and diagnosis of CAS. Through a mixed-method design, the quantitative phase analyzed 290 studies, unveiling 10 clusters: developmental apraxia, tabby talk, intellectual disabilities, underlying speech processes, breakpoint localization, speech characteristics, functional characteristics, clinical practice, and treatment outcome. The qualitative phase conducted a thematic analysis on the most cited and recent literature, identifying 10 categories: neurobiological markers, speech motor control, perceptual speech features, auditory processing, prosody and stress patterns, parent- and self-report measures, intervention response, motor learning and generalization, comorbidity analysis, and cultural and linguistic considerations. Integrating these findings, a descriptive and prescriptive model was developed, encapsulating the complexities of CAS and providing a structured approach for clinicians. This model advances the understanding of CAS and supports the development of targeted interventions. This study concludes with a call for evidence-based personalized treatment plans that account for the diverse neurobiological and cultural backgrounds of children with CAS. Its implications for practice include the integration of cutting-edge assessment tools that embrace the heterogeneity of CAS presentations, ensuring that interventions are as unique as the children they aim to support.</p>

	<p>A growing body of literature suggests a link between bowel syndromes (e.g., irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease), gut microbiome alterations, and psychiatric disorders. This narrative review aims to explore the potential role of the gut microbiome in the pathogenesis and clinical presentation of obsessive&amp;amp;ndash;compulsive disorder (OCD) and to explore whether there is sufficient evidence to warrant considering gastrointestinal symptoms and their implication for the gut microbiome during the assessment and treatment of OCD. For this purpose, a PubMed search of studies focusing on OCD, gut microbiota, irritable bowel syndrome, and inflammatory bowel disease was conducted by two independent reviewers. While the current literature on gut microbiome and gastrointestinal issues in OCD remains limited, emerging evidence suggests gut microbiome alterations and high rates of bowel syndromes in this population. These findings emphasize the importance of incorporating comprehensive gastrointestinal assessments into the &amp;amp;ldquo;global assessment of OCD&amp;amp;rdquo;. Such assessment should encompass various factors, including gastrointestinal physical comorbidities and symptoms, nutritional habits, bowel habits, fluid intake, exercise patterns, and potential microbiome dysfunctions and inflammation. Considering the treatment implications, interventions targeting gut health, such as probiotics and dietary modifications, may hold promise in improving symptoms in OCD patients with comorbid gastrointestinal problems. Further research in this area is warranted to better understand the interplay between gut health and OCD and to explore the effectiveness of targeted interventions in improving clinical outcomes.</p>

	<p>In this study, to discuss the influence of concussion risk from the long-term use of American football helmets on collegiate teams, accident cases during the game are replicated based on game videos by simulations using whole-body numerical models and helmeted finite element human head models. The concussion risks caused by collisions were estimated using the mechanical parameters inside the skull obtained from finite element analyses. In the analyses, the different material properties of helmets identified by free-fall experiments using headform impactor-embedded helmets were used to represent brand-new and long-term-use helmets. After analyzing the five cases, it was observed that wearing a new helmet instead of a long-term-use one resulted in a reduction in the risk of concussion by 1 to 44%. More energy is attenuated by the deformation of the liners of the brand-new helmet, so the energy transferred to the head is smaller than that when wearing the long-term-use helmet. Thus, the long-term use of the helmet reduces its ability to protect the head.</p>

	<p>In the present study, we aimed to investigate the neural dynamics of interference control using event-related potentials (ERPs) to reveal time course of interference control from the beginning to the end of young adulthood. Three groups of participants aged 19&amp;amp;ndash;21, 23&amp;amp;ndash;27 and 28&amp;amp;ndash;44 performed a Stroop task. The results revealed age differences in both accuracy and ERP amplitudes during all aspects of interreference control processing that reflect selective attention (P2), conflict monitoring (N2), conflict evaluation (P3) and interference control (N450). Both younger groups made more errors on incongruent trials compared to participants in their early 30s. The presence of higher P2 and N2 amplitudes, diminished P3 and again higher N450 amplitudes in participants in their early 20s points to a shortage of available resources for top-down control at this age. These results are in accordance with structural and functional studies that show that development of the frontoparietal network, which underlies interference control, continues after adolescence. While brain mechanisms are still developing, the use of accompanying cognitive abilities is still not optimal. The findings that change in neural dynamics and related performance continues into early adulthood challenge current models of cognitive development and call for new directions in developmental theorizing.</p>

	<p>Background: People with Down syndrome (DS) are deficient in verbal memory but relatively preserved in visuospatial perception. Verbal memories are related to semantic knowledge. Receptive ability is better than expressive ability in people with DS but still seriously lags behind their age-matched controls. This lag may result in the weak semantic integration of people with DS. Aims: This study aimed to examine the ability of semantic integration of people with DS by using false-memory tasks. Possible differences in the number of false memories induced by nouns and verbs were of focus. Methods and Procedures: Two phases were involved in the false-memory task. In the study phase, ten-word lists with semantically related associates were presented. In the recognition phase, judgments were to be made about whether the words presented had been heard before. Three types of words were tested: previously presented associates, semantically related lures, and semantically unrelated new words. Outcomes and Results: People with DS overall showed the lowest accuracy among groups in response to tested word types. In the processing of lures, people with DS were worse in recognition than MA controls. In processing unrelated words, people with DS responded least accurately to all types of words compared to control groups. In the processing of associates, people with DS showed similar recognition rates as the MA controls but were less accurate than the CA controls. No difference was observed between nouns and verbs in recognizing word types among groups, though faster responses to nouns than to verbs emerged in college students. Further analyses on topic-wised comparisons of errors across syntactic categories revealed differences in specific concepts among groups, suggesting people with DS were atypical in semantic organization. Conclusions and Implications: People with DS showed mixed patterns in semantic integration by false-memory tasks with delay to associates and deviance to lures together with unrelated words. People with DS showed distinct patterns in processing nouns and verbs while conducting topic-wise comparisons, suggesting that they formed false memories differently based on distinct syntactic categories. We concluded that people with DS develop a deviant semantic structure, hence showing problems in language and social cognition. Category-based rehabilitation is suggested to be implemented for people with DS to improve their semantic knowledge through lexical connections.</p>

	<p>Dreaming, a widely researched aspect of sleep, often mirrors waking-life experiences. Despite the prevalence of sensory perception during wakefulness, sensory experiences in dreams remain relatively unexplored. Free recall dream reports, where individuals describe their dreams freely, may not fully capture sensory dream experiences. In this study, we developed a dream diary with direct questions about sensory dream experiences. Participants reported sensory experiences in their dreams upon awakening, over multiple days, in a home-based setting (n = 3476 diaries). Our findings show that vision was the most common sensory dream experience, followed by audition and touch. Olfaction and gustation were reported at equally low rates. Multisensory dreams were far more prevalent than unisensory dreams. Additionally, the prevalence of sensory dream experiences varied across emotionally positive and negative dreams. A positive relationship was found between on the one hand sensory richness and, on the other emotional intensity of dreams and clarity of dream recall, for both positive and negative dreams. These results underscore the variety of dream experiences and suggest a link between sensory richness, emotional content and dream recall clarity. Systematic registration of sensory dream experiences offers valuable insights into dream manifestation, aiding the understanding of sleep-related memory consolidation and other aspects of sleep-related information processing.</p>

	<p>Auditory spatial cues contribute to two distinct functions, of which one leads to explicit localization of sound sources and the other provides a location-linked representation of sound objects. Behavioral and imaging studies demonstrated right-hemispheric dominance for explicit sound localization. An early clinical case study documented the dissociation between the explicit sound localizations, which was heavily impaired, and fully preserved use of spatial cues for sound object segregation. The latter involves location-linked encoding of sound objects. We review here evidence pertaining to brain regions involved in location-linked representation of sound objects. Auditory evoked potential (AEP) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies investigated this aspect by comparing encoding of individual sound objects, which changed their locations or remained stationary. Systematic search identified 1 AEP and 12 fMRI studies. Together with studies of anatomical correlates of impaired of spatial-cue-based sound object segregation after focal brain lesions, the present evidence indicates that the location-linked representation of sound objects involves strongly the left hemisphere and to a lesser degree the right hemisphere. Location-linked encoding of sound objects is present in several early-stage auditory areas and in the specialized temporal voice area. In these regions, emotional valence benefits from location-linked encoding as well.</p>

	<p>The global issue of substance abuse demands ongoing initiatives aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. With drug use remaining prevalent worldwide, interventions are critical to addressing the associated health challenges and societal implications. Exercise and physical activities have emerged as integral components of substance use disorder (SUD) treatment, offering promising avenues for prevention, intervention, and recovery. Recent research underscores the efficacy of exercise in reducing substance cravings, promoting abstinence, and improving overall well-being. However, integrating exercise into SUD recovery programs presents challenges such as dropout rates and cultural considerations. This paper synthesizes existing literature on exercise integration into SUD recovery, highlighting strategies for enhancing treatment outcomes and addressing barriers to exercise adherence. Drawing on cognitive&amp;amp;ndash;behavioral therapy, experiential learning, motivational interviewing, and goal-setting techniques, the holistic approach outlined in this paper aims to empower individuals both mentally and physically, fostering resilience and supporting long-term recovery. In conclusion, new initiatives need to be taken by advocating for inclusive policies, promoting community engagement, and fostering collaborations across sectors. By doing so, stakeholders can optimize the effectiveness of exercise programs and contribute to sustainable rehabilitation efforts for individuals with SUD.</p>

	<p>Accelerated brain aging is a possible mechanism of pathology in schizophrenia. Advances in MRI-based brain development algorithms allow for the calculation of predicted brain age (PBA) for individuals. Here, we assessed PBA in 70 first-episode schizophrenia-spectrum individuals (FESz) and 76 matched healthy neurotypical comparison individuals (HC) to determine if FESz showed advanced aging proximal to psychosis onset and whether PBA was associated with neurocognitive, social functioning, or symptom severity measures. PBA was calculated with BrainAgeR (v2.1) from T1-weighted MR scans. There were no differences in the PBAs between groups. After controlling for actual age, a &amp;amp;ldquo;younger&amp;amp;rdquo; PBA was associated with higher vocabulary scores among all individuals, while an &amp;amp;ldquo;older&amp;amp;rdquo; PBA was associated with more severe negative symptom &amp;amp;ldquo;Inexpressivity&amp;amp;rdquo; component scores among FESz. Female participants in both groups had an elevated PBA relative to male participants. These results suggest that a relatively younger brain age is associated with a better semantic memory performance. There is no evidence for accelerated aging in FESz with a late adolescent/early adult onset. Despite a normative PBA, FESz with a greater residual PBA showed impairments in a cluster of negative symptoms, which may indicate some underlying age-related pathology proximal to psychosis onset. Although a period of accelerated aging cannot be ruled out with disease course, it does not occur at the time of the first episode.</p>

                <p>Glutamatergic mossy cells (MCs) mediate associational and commissural connectivity, exhibiting significant heterogeneity along the septotemporal axis of the mouse dentate gyrus (DG). However, it remains unclear whether the neuronal features of MCs are conserved across mammals. This study compares the neuroanatomy of MCs in the DG of mice and monkeys. The MC marker, calretinin, distinguishes two subpopulations: septal and temporal. Dual-colored fluorescence labeling is utilized to compare the axonal projection patterns of these subpopulations. In both mice and monkeys, septal and temporal MCs project axons across the longitudinal axis of the ipsilateral DG, indicating conserved associational projections. However, unlike in mice, no MC subpopulations in monkeys make commissural projections to the contralateral DG. In monkeys, temporal MCs send associational fibers exclusively to the inner molecular layer, while septal MCs give rise to wide axonal projections spanning multiple molecular layers, akin to equivalent MC subpopulations in mice. Despite conserved septotemporal heterogeneity, interspecies differences are observed in the topological organization of septal MCs, particularly in the relative axonal density in each molecular layer along the septotemporal axis of the DG. In summary, this comparative analysis sheds light on both conserved and divergent features of MCs in the DG of mice and monkeys. These findings have implications for understanding functional differentiation along the septotemporal axis of the DG and contribute to our knowledge of the anatomical evolution of the DG circuit in mammals.</p>

                Background Researchers are focusing their emphasis on quick and real-time healthcare and monitoring systems because of the contemporary modern world’s rapid technological improvements. One of the best options is smart healthcare, which uses a variety of on-body and off-body sensors and gadgets to monitor patients’ health and exchange data with hospitals and healthcare professionals in real time. Utilizing the primary user (PU) spectrum, cognitive radio (CR) can be highly useful for efficient and intelligent healthcare systems to send and receive patient health data. Methods In this work, we propose a method that combines energy detection (ED) and cyclostationary (CS) spectrum sensing (SS) algorithms. This method was used to test spectrum sensing in CR-based smart healthcare systems. The proposed ED-CS in cognitive radio systems improves the precision of the spectrum sensing. Owing to its straightforward implementation, ED is initially used to identify the idle spectrum. If the ED cannot find the idle spectrum, the signals are found using CS-SS, which uses the cyclic statistical properties of the signals to separate the main users from the interference. Results In the simulation analysis, the probability of detection (Pd), probability of a false alarm (Pfa), power spectral density (PSD), and bit error rate (BER) of the proposed ED-CS is compared to those of the traditional Matched Filter (MF), ED, and CS. Conclusions The results indicate that the suggested strategy improves the performance of the framework, making it more appropriate for smart healthcare applications.

                <p>by Giacomo Janson, Michael Feig</p>

Intrinsically disordered proteins have dynamic structures through which they play key biological roles. The elucidation of their conformational ensembles is a challenging problem requiring an integrated use of computational and experimental methods. Molecular simulations are a valuable computational strategy for constructing structural ensembles of disordered proteins but are highly resource-intensive. Recently, machine learning approaches based on deep generative models that learn from simulation data have emerged as an efficient alternative for generating structural ensembles. However, such methods currently suffer from limited transferability when modeling sequences and conformations absent in the training data. Here, we develop a novel generative model that achieves high levels of transferability for intrinsically disordered protein ensembles. The approach, named idpSAM, is a latent diffusion model based on transformer neural networks. It combines an autoencoder to learn a representation of protein geometry and a diffusion model to sample novel conformations in the encoded space. IdpSAM was trained on a large dataset of simulations of disordered protein regions performed with the ABSINTH implicit solvent model. Thanks to the expressiveness of its neural networks and its training stability, idpSAM faithfully captures 3D structural ensembles of test sequences with no similarity in the training set. Our study also demonstrates the potential for generating full conformational ensembles from datasets with limited sampling and underscores the importance of training set size for generalization. We believe that idpSAM represents a significant progress in transferable protein ensemble modeling through machine learning.

                <p>by Tianqi Wei, Qinghai Guo, Barbara Webb</p>

Animals can learn in real-life scenarios where rewards are often only available when a goal is achieved. This ‘distal’ or ‘sparse’ reward problem remains a challenge for conventional reinforcement learning algorithms. Here we investigate an algorithm for learning in such scenarios, inspired by the possibility that axo-axonal gap junction connections, observed in neural circuits with parallel fibres such as the insect mushroom body, could form a resistive network. In such a network, an active node represents the task state, connections between nodes represent state transitions and their connection to actions, and current flow to a target state can guide decision making. Building on evidence that gap junction weights are adaptive, we propose that experience of a task can modulate the connections to form a graph encoding the task structure. We demonstrate that the approach can be used for efficient reinforcement learning under sparse rewards, and discuss whether it is plausible as an account of the insect mushroom body.

                <p>by Santiago A. Cadena, Konstantin F. Willeke, Kelli Restivo, George Denfield, Fabian H. Sinz, Matthias Bethge, Andreas S. Tolias, Alexander S. Ecker</p>

Responses to natural stimuli in area V4—a mid-level area of the visual ventral stream—are well predicted by features from convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on image classification. This result has been taken as evidence for the functional role of V4 in object classification. However, we currently do not know if and to what extent V4 plays a role in solving <i>other</i> computational objectives. Here, we investigated normative accounts of V4 (and V1 for comparison) by predicting macaque single-neuron responses to natural images from the representations extracted by 23 CNNs trained on different computer vision tasks including semantic, geometric, 2D, and 3D types of tasks. We found that V4 was best predicted by semantic classification features and exhibited high task selectivity, while the choice of task was less consequential to V1 performance. Consistent with traditional characterizations of V4 function that show its high-dimensional tuning to various 2D and 3D stimulus directions, we found that diverse non-semantic tasks explained aspects of V4 function that are not captured by individual semantic tasks. Nevertheless, jointly considering the features of a pair of semantic classification tasks was sufficient to yield one of our top V4 models, solidifying V4’s main functional role in semantic processing and suggesting that V4’s selectivity to 2D or 3D stimulus properties found by electrophysiologists can result from semantic functional goals.

                <p>by David Pastor-Alonso, Maxime Berg, Franck Boyer, Natalie Fomin-Thunemann, Michel Quintard, Yohan Davit, Sylvie Lorthois</p>

Recent progresses in intravital imaging have enabled highly-resolved measurements of periarteriolar oxygen gradients (POGs) within the brain parenchyma. POGs are increasingly used as proxies to estimate the local baseline oxygen consumption, which is a hallmark of cell activity. However, the oxygen profile around a given arteriole arises from an interplay between oxygen consumption and delivery, not only by this arteriole but also by distant capillaries. Integrating such interactions across scales while accounting for the complex architecture of the microvascular network remains a challenge from a modelling perspective. This limits our ability to interpret the experimental oxygen maps and constitutes a key bottleneck toward the inverse determination of metabolic rates of oxygen.
We revisit the problem of parenchymal oxygen transport and metabolism and introduce a simple, conservative, accurate and scalable direct numerical method going beyond canonical Krogh-type models and their associated geometrical simplifications. We focus on a two-dimensional formulation, and introduce the concepts needed to combine an operator-splitting and a Green’s function approach. Oxygen concentration is decomposed into a slowly-varying contribution, discretized by Finite Volumes over a coarse cartesian grid, and a rapidly-varying contribution, approximated analytically in grid-cells surrounding each vessel.
Starting with simple test cases, we thoroughly analyze the resulting errors by comparison with highly-resolved simulations of the original transport problem, showing considerable improvement of the computational-cost/accuracy balance compared to previous work. We then demonstrate the model ability to flexibly generate synthetic data reproducing the spatial dynamics of oxygen in the brain parenchyma, with sub-grid resolution. Based on these synthetic data, we show that capillaries distant from the arteriole cannot be overlooked when interpreting POGs, thus reconciling recent measurements of POGs across cortical layers with the fundamental idea that variations of vascular density within the depth of the cortex may reveal underlying differences in neuronal organization and metabolic load.

                <p>by Shin-Han Shiu, Melissa D. Lehti-Shiu</p>

Scientific advances due to conceptual or technological innovations can be revealed by examining how research topics have evolved. But such topical evolution is difficult to uncover and quantify because of the large body of literature and the need for expert knowledge in a wide range of areas in a field. Using plant biology as an example, we used machine learning and language models to classify plant science citations into topics representing interconnected, evolving subfields. The changes in prevalence of topical records over the last 50 years reflect shifts in major research trends and recent radiation of new topics, as well as turnover of model species and vastly different plant science research trajectories among countries. Our approaches readily summarize the topical diversity and evolution of a scientific field with hundreds of thousands of relevant papers, and they can be applied broadly to other fields.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To evaluate: (1) the distribution of gray matter (GM) atrophy in myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-associated disease (MOGAD), aquaporin-4 antibody-positive neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (AQP4+NMOSD), and relapsing–remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS); and (2) the relationship between GM volumes and white matter lesions in various brain regions within each disease.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A retrospective, multicenter analysis of magnetic resonance imaging data included patients with MOGAD/AQP4+NMOSD/RRMS in non-acute disease stage. Voxel-wise analyses and general linear models were used to evaluate the relevance of regional GM atrophy. For significant results (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05), volumes of atrophic areas are reported.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We studied 135 MOGAD patients, 135 AQP4+NMOSD, 175 RRMS, and 144 healthy controls (HC). Compared with HC, MOGAD showed lower GM volumes in the temporal lobes, deep GM, insula, and cingulate cortex (75.79 cm<sup>3</sup>); AQP4+NMOSD in the occipital cortex (32.83 cm<sup>3</sup>); and RRMS diffusely in the GM (260.61 cm<sup>3</sup>). MOGAD showed more pronounced temporal cortex atrophy than RRMS (6.71 cm<sup>3</sup>), whereas AQP4+NMOSD displayed greater occipital cortex atrophy than RRMS (19.82 cm<sup>3</sup>). RRMS demonstrated more pronounced deep GM atrophy in comparison with MOGAD (27.90 cm<sup>3</sup>) and AQP4+NMOSD (47.04 cm<sup>3</sup>). In MOGAD, higher periventricular and cortical/juxtacortical lesions were linked to reduced temporal cortex, deep GM, and insula volumes. In RRMS, the diffuse GM atrophy was associated with lesions in all locations. AQP4+NMOSD showed no lesion/GM volume correlation.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>GM atrophy is more widespread in RRMS compared with the other two conditions. MOGAD primarily affects the temporal cortex, whereas AQP4+NMOSD mainly involves the occipital cortex. In MOGAD and RRMS, lesion-related tract degeneration is associated with atrophy, but this link is absent in AQP4+NMOSD. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Irisin, released by muscles during exercise, was recently identified as a neuroprotective factor in mouse models of Alzheimer disease (AD). In a cohort of AD patients, we studied cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma irisin levels, sex interactions, and correlations with disease biomarkers.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Correlations between CSF and plasma irisin levels and AD biomarkers (amyloid β 1-42, hyperphosphorylated tau, and total tau [t-tau]) and Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes (CDR-SOB) were analyzed in a cohort of patients with Alzheimer dementia (n = 82), mild cognitive impairment (n = 44), and subjective memory complaint (n = 20) biologically characterized according to the recent amyloid/tau/neurodegeneration classification.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>CSF irisin was reduced in Alzheimer dementia patients (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001), with lower levels in female patients. Moreover, CSF irisin correlated positively with Aβ42 in both female (<i>r</i> = 0.379, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and male (<i>r</i> = 0.262, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) patients, and negatively with CDR-SOB (<i>r</i> = −0.234, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) only in female patients. A negative trend was also observed between CSF irisin and t-tau levels in all patients (<i>r</i> = −0.144, <i>p</i> = 0.082) and in the female subgroup (<i>r</i> = −0.189, <i>p</i> = 0.084).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The results highlight the relationship between irisin and biomarkers of AD pathology, especially in females. Our findings also offer perspectives toward the use of irisin as a marker of the AD continuum. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Although the phenomenon of memory formation and recall associated with the use of psychotropic drugs has been extensively studied, mechanisms underlying memories for natural reward have not been clarified. Herein, we test the hypothesis that glutamatergic receptors in the dentate gyrus play a role in memories associated with sucrose. We used pellet self-administration protocol to generate memories in two-port nose-poke discrimination task using male Wistar rats. During non-rewarded probe trial, the conditioned animals readily discriminated the active port versus inactive port and showed massive increase in mRNA expression of AMPA receptor subunit genes (gria2, gria3) as well as c-Fos protein in the DG. Access to sweet pellet further enhanced c-Fos expression in the DG. However, animals pre-treated with AMPA receptor antagonist CNQX (intra-DG), on exposure to operant chamber (no pellet), showed decreased discrimination as well as c-Fos expression. We suggest that AMPA receptors in DG mediate recall and consolidation of memories associated with sucrose consumption. CNQX pre-treated animals, if presented with sweet pellet on nose poke, exhibited high discrimination index coupled with increased c-Fos expression. In these CNQX treated rats, the DI was again decreased following administration of NMDA receptor antagonist AP5. We suggest that, although AMPA receptors are blocked, the access to sweet pellet may induce surge of glutamate in the DG, which in turn may reinstate memories via activation of erstwhile silent synapses in NMDA dependant manner.</p>

">Altered striosome-matrix distribution and activity of striatal cholinergic interneurons in a model of autism-linked repetitive behaviors</a></h4>

              
                Repetitive behaviors are cardinal features of many brain disorders, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We previously associated dysfunction of striatal cholinergic interneurons (SCINs) with repetitive behaviors in a mouse model based on conditional deletion of the ASD-related gene Tshz3 in cholinergic neurons (Chat-cKO). Here, we provide evidence linking SCIN abnormalities to the unique organization of the striatum into striosome and matrix compartments, whose imbalances are implicated in several pathological conditions. Chat-cKO mice exhibit altered relationship between the embryonic birthdate of SCINs and their adult striosome-matrix distribution, leading to an increased proportion of striosomal SCINs. In addition, the ratio of striosomal SCINs with slow-irregular vs. sustained-regular firing is increased, which translates into decreased activity, further stressing the striosome-matrix imbalance. These findings provide novel insights onto the pathogenesis of ASD-related stereotyped behaviors by pointing to abnormal developmental compartmentalization and activity of SCINs as a substrate.

">Decreased cellular excitability of pyramidal tract neurons in primary motor cortex leads to paradoxically increased network activity in simulated parkinsonian motor cortex</a></h4>

              
                Decreased excitability of pyramidal tract neurons in layer 5B (PT5B) of primary motor cortex (M1) has recently been shown in a dopamine-depleted mouse model of parkinsonism. We hypothesized that decreased PT5B neuron excitability would substantially disrupt oscillatory and non-oscillatory firing patterns of neurons in layer 5 (L5) of primary motor cortex (M1). To test this hypothesis, we performed computer simulations using a previously validated computer model of mouse M1. Inclusion of the experimentally identified parkinsonism-associated decrease of PT5B excitability into our computational model produced a paradoxical increase in rest-state PT5B firing rate, as well as an increase in beta-band oscillatory power in local field potential (LFP). In the movement-state, PT5B population firing and LFP showed reduced beta and increased high-beta, low-gamma activity of 20-35 Hz in the parkinsonian, but not in control condition. The appearance of beta-band oscillations in parkinsonism would be expected to disrupt normal M1 motor output and contribute to motor activity deficits seen in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).

">NMDA receptor activation drives early synapse formation in vivo</a></h4>

              
                The rules governing neural circuit formation in mammalian central nervous systems are poorly understood. NMDA receptors are involved in synaptic plasticity mechanisms in mature neurons, but their contribution to circuit formation and dendritic maturation remains controversial. Using pharmacological and genetic interventions to disrupt NMDA receptor signaling in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons in vitro and in vivo, we identify an early critical window for a synapse-specific function in wiring Schaffer collateral connections and dendritic arborization. Through in vivo imaging, we show that NMDA receptors are frequently activated during early development and elicit minute-long calcium transients, which immediately precede the emergence of filopodia. These results demonstrate that NMDA receptors drive synapto- and dendritogenesis during development, challenging the view that these processes are primarily mediated by molecular cues.

">Representation of grasping type and force in the primate motor cortex</a></h4>

              
                The primary motor cortex (M1) is strongly engaged by movement planning and movement execution. However, the role of M1 activity in voluntary grasping is still not completely understood. Here we analyze recordings of M1 neurons during the execution of a delayed reach-to-grasp task, where monkeys had to actively grasp an object with either a side or a precision grip, and then pull it with a low or high amount of force. Single cell and neural populations analyses showed that grip type was robustly and specifically encoded by a large population of neurons, while force level was weakly encoded within mixed-selective neurons that also provided grip type information. Notably, the grip type was stably decoded from motor cortical populations during the preparation and execution epochs of the task. Our results are consistent with the idea that planning and performing specific grasping movements are high-level skills that strongly engage M1 neurons, while the execution of grasping-pulling force might be prominently encoded at lower stages of the motor system.

">Potassium homeostasis during disease progression of Alzheimers Disease</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimers disease (AD) is an age-dependent neurodegenerative disorder characterized by neuronal loss leading to dementia and ultimately death. Whilst the loss of neurons is central to the disease, it is becoming clear that glia, specifically astrocytes, contribute to the onset and progression of neurodegeneration. Astrocytic role in retaining ion homeostasis in the extracellular milieu is fundamental for multiple brain functions, including synaptic plasticity and neuronal excitability, which are compromised during AD and affect neuronal signalling. In this study, we have measured the astrocytic K+ clearance rate in the hippocampus and somatosensory cortex of a mouse model for AD during disease progression. Our results establish that astrocytic [K+]o clearance in the hippocampus is reduced in symptomatic 5xFAD mice, and this decrease is region-specific. The decrease in the [K+]o clearance rate correlated with a significant reduction in the expression and conductivity of Kir4.1 channels and a decline in the number of primary connected astrocytes. Moreover, astrocytes in the hippocampus of symptomatic 5xFAD mice demonstrated increased reactivity which was accompanied by an increased excitability and altered spiking profile of nearby neurons. These findings indicate that the supportive function astrocytes typically provide to nearby neurons is diminished during disease progression, which affects the neuronal circuit signalling in this area and provides a potential explanation for the increased vulnerability of neurons in AD.

">SH3BP2 regulates the organization of the neuromuscular synapses through protein-driven phase separation</a></h4>

              
                The molecular mechanisms underlying the development and maintenance of the neuromuscular junction are poorly understood, even though the malfunction of these specialized synapses is associated with severe genetic and autoimmune disorders. The identity of factors controlling the maintenance mechanisms of postsynaptic acetylcholine receptors (AChR) in high-density has been elusive and is of great interest to the pharma industry, searching for possible new targets for disease interventions. Here, we report the identification of a scaffold protein SH3BP2, which exhibits polyvalent interaction with the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC) and AChR pentamers, promoting AChR clustering through phase separation. Muscle-specific SH3BP2 deletion in mice leads to impaired organization of the neuromuscular synapses, defects in synaptic transmission, and reduced muscle strength. Our studies identified a novel regulator of the postsynaptic machinery involved in clustering AChR and linking it to the DGC.

">Regulation of dopamine release by tonic activity patterns in the striatal brain slice</a></h4>

              
                Voluntary movement, motivation, and reinforcement learning depend on the activity of ventral midbrain neurons that extend axons to release dopamine (DA) in the striatum. These neurons exhibit two patterns of action potential activity: a low-frequency tonic activity that is intrinsically generated, and superimposed high-frequency phasic bursts that are driven by synaptic inputs. Ex vivo acute striatal brain preparations are widely employed to study the regulation of evoked DA release but exhibit very different DA release kinetics than in vivo recordings. To investigate the relationship between phasic and tonic neuronal activity, we stimulated the slice in patterns intended to mimic tonic activity, which were interrupted by a series of burst stimuli. Conditioning the striatal slice with low-frequency activity altered DA release triggered by high-frequency bursts, and produced kinetic parameters that resemble those in vivo. In the absence of applied tonic activity, nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and D2 dopamine receptor antagonists had no significant effect on neurotransmitter release driven by repeated burst activity in the striatal brain slice. In contrast, in tonically stimulated slices, D2 receptor blockade decreased the amount of DA released during a single burst and facilitated DA release in subsequent bursts. This experimental system provides a means to reconcile the difference in the kinetics of DA release ex vivo and in vivo and provides a novel approach to more accurately emulate pre- and post-synaptic mechanisms that control axonal DA release in the acute striatal brain slice.

">A novel mouse home cage lickometer system reveals sex- and housing-based influences on alcohol drinking</a></h4>

              
                Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a significant global health issue. Despite historically higher rates among men, AUD prevalence and negative alcohol-related outcomes in women are rising. Loneliness in humans has been associated with increased alcohol use, and traditional rodent drinking models involve single housing, presenting challenges for studying social enrichment. We developed LIQ PARTI (Lick Instance Quantifier with Poly-Animal RFID Tracking Integration), an open-source tool to examine home cage continuous access two-bottle choice drinking behavior in a group-housed setting, investigating the influence of sex and social isolation on ethanol consumption and bout microstructure in C57Bl/6J mice. LIQ PARTI, based on our previously developed single-housed LIQ HD system, accurately tracks drinking behavior using capacitive-based sensors and RFID technology. Group-housed female mice exhibited higher ethanol preference than males, while males displayed a unique undulating pattern of ethanol preference linked to cage changes, suggesting a potential stress-related response. Chronic ethanol intake distinctly altered bout microstructure between male and female mice, highlighting sex and social environmental influences on drinking behavior. Social isolation with the LIQ HD system amplified fluid intake and ethanol preference in both sexes, accompanied by sex- and fluid-dependent changes in bout microstructure. However, these effects largely reversed upon resocialization, indicating the plasticity of these behaviors in response to social context. Utilizing a novel group-housed home cage lickometer device, our findings illustrate the critical interplay of sex and housing conditions in voluntary alcohol drinking behaviors in C57Bl/6J mice, facilitating nuanced insights into the potential contributions to AUD etiology.

">A new GRAB sensor reveals differences in the dynamics and molecular regulation between neuropeptide and neurotransmitter release</a></h4>

              
                The co-existence and co-transmission of neuropeptides and small molecule neurotransmitters in the same neuron is a fundamental aspect of almost all neurons across various species. However, the differences regarding their in vivo spatiotemporal dynamics and underlying molecular regulation remain poorly understood. Here, we developed a GPCR-activation-based (GRAB) sensor for detecting short neuropeptide F (sNPF) with high sensitivity and spatiotemporal resolution. Furthermore, we explore the differences of in vivo dynamics and molecular regulation between sNPF and acetylcholine (ACh) from the same neurons. Interestingly, the release of sNPF and ACh shows different spatiotemporal dynamics. Notably, we found that distinct synaptotagmins (Syt) are involved in these two processes, as Syt7 and Sytalpha for sNPF release, while Syt1 for ACh release. Thus, this new GRAB sensor provides a powerful tool for studying neuropeptide release and providing new insights into the distinct release dynamics and molecular regulation between neuropeptides and small molecule neurotransmitters.

">Potential Benefits of Ketone Therapy as a Novel Immunometabolic Treatment for Schizophrenia</a></h4>

              
                Rationale: Current treatment options for patients with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders (SSD) remain unsatisfactory, leaving patients with persistent negative and cognitive symptoms and metabolic side effects. Therapeutic ketosis was recently hypothesized to target the bio-energetic pathophysiology of SSD. However, neuro-inflammation plays an important role in the pathobiology of SSD as well. Ideally, novel treatments would target both the bio-energetic, and the inflammatory aspects of SSD. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of ketone bodies on neuro-inflammation in an acute inflammation mouse model. Methods: 8-week-old male C57BL/6 N mice (n=11) were treated with either ketone ester (KE) or vehicle for 3 days. On day 3, a single intraperitoneal injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or phosphate buffered saline (PBS) was administered. Mice were euthanized 24 h after LPS/PBS injection. Whole brain gene expression analysis using RT-PCR was done for Tnf-a, Il-6 and Il-1b. Results: LPS caused a potent transcriptional upregulation of Tnf-a, Il-6 and Il-1b in the vehicle-treated mouse brain compared to PBS-injected controls. KE strongly and significantly attenuated the increased transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Tnf-a, Il-6 and Il-1b) in the brain upon LPS injection compared to vehicle. Conclusions: KE potently dampened neuro-inflammation in this acute inflammation mouse model. Ketone therapy holds great promise as a treatment for SSD patients by simultaneously targeting two main pathophysiological disease pathways. We encourage more research into the immunometabolic potential of therapeutic ketosis in SSD.

">Contribute to balance, wire in accordance: Emergence of backpropagation from a simple, bio-plausible neuroplasticity rule</a></h4>

              
                Over the past several decades, backpropagation (BP) has played a critical role in the advancement of machine learning and remains a core method in numerous computational applications. It is also utilized extensively in comparative studies of biological and artificial neural network representations. Despite its widespread use, the implementation of BP in the brain remains elusive, and its biological plausibility is often questioned due to inherent issues such as the need for symmetry of weights between forward and backward connections, and the requirement of distinct forward and backward phases of computation. Here, we introduce a novel neuroplasticity rule that offers a potential mechanism for implementing BP in the brain. Similar in general form to the classical Hebbian rule, this rule is based on the core principles of maintaining the balance of excitatory and inhibitory inputs as well as on retrograde signaling, and operates over three progressively slower timescales: neural firing, retrograde signaling, and neural plasticity. We hypothesize that each neuron possesses an internal state, termed credit, in addition to its firing rate. After achieving equilibrium in firing rates, neurons receive credits based on their contribution to the E-I balance of postsynaptic neurons through retrograde signaling. As the network's credit distribution stabilizes, connections from those presynaptic neurons are strengthened that significantly contribute to the balance of postsynaptic neurons. We demonstrate mathematically that our learning rule precisely replicates BP in layered neural networks without any approximations. Simulations on artificial neural networks reveal that this rule induces varying community structures in networks, depending on the learning rate. This simple theoretical framework presents a biologically plausible implementation of BP, with testable assumptions and predictions that may be evaluated through biological experiments.

                Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a severe and widespread disease that results in high mortality and morbidity. Despite significant advances made in clinical and preclinical research, the prognosis of ICH remains poor due to an incomplete understanding of the complex pathological responses. To address this challenge, we generated single-cell resolution spatiotemporal transcriptomic maps of mouse brain 1, 3, 7, 14, and 28 days after ICH. Our analysis revealed the cellular constituents and their dynamic responses following ICH. We found changes in gene expression that are indicative of active phagocytosis and lipid processing in the lesion core and identified genes associated with brain repair at the lesion border. Persistent lipid accumulation culminated in the phenotypic transition of macrophages into foam cells. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that ICH could stimulate neural stem cells in the subventricular zone, thereby enhancing neurogenesis in this niche. This study provides a spatiotemporal molecular atlas of mouse ICH that advances the understanding of both local and global responses of brain cells to ICH and offers a valuable resource that can aid the development of novel therapies for this devastating condition.

                Understanding memory formation requires elucidating the intricate dynamics of neuronal networks in the hippocampus, where information is encoded and processed through specific activity patterns and synaptic plasticity. Here, we introduce "EVOX," an advanced network electrophysiology platform equipped with high-density microelectrode arrays to capture critical network-level synaptic dynamics integral to learning and memory. This platform surpasses traditional methods by enabling label-free, high-order mapping of neural interactions, providing unprecedented insights into network Long-Term Potentiation (LTP) and evoked synaptic transmission within the hippocampal network. Utilizing EVOX, we demonstrate that high-frequency stimulation induces network-wide LTP, revealing enhanced synaptic efficacy in previously inactive cell assemblies in hippocampal layers. Our platform enables the real-time observation of network synaptic transmission, capturing the intricate patterns of connectivity and plasticity that underpin memory encoding. Advanced computational techniques further elucidate the mesoscale transmembrane generators and the dynamic processes that govern network-level memory encoding mechanisms. These findings uncover the complex dynamics that underlie learning and memory, showcasing EVOX's potential to explore synaptic and cellular phenomena in aging circuits. EVOX not only advances our understanding of hippocampal memory mechanisms but also serves as a powerful tool to investigate the broader scope of neural plasticity and network interactions in healthy and diseased states.

">Automated inference of disease mechanisms in patient-hiPSC-derived neuronal networks</a></h4>

              
                Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs)-derived neurons offer a valuable platform for studying neurological disorders in a patient-specific manner. These neurons can be rapidly differentiated into excitatory neuronal networks, whose activity is measurable using multi-electrode arrays (MEAs). Neuronal networks derived from patients exhibit distinct characteristics, reflecting underlying pathological molecular mechanisms. However, elucidating these mechanisms traditionally requires extensive and hypothesis-driven additional experiments. Computational models can link observable network activity to underlying molecular mechanisms by identifying biophysical model parameters that simulate the activity, but this identification process is challenging. Here, we address this challenge by using simulation-based inference (SBI), a machine-learning approach, to automatically identify the full range of model parameters able to explain the patient-derived MEA activity. Our study demonstrates that SBI can accurately identify ground-truth parameters in simulated data, and successfully estimate the parameters that replicate the network activity of healthy hiPSC-derived neuronal networks. Furthermore, we show that SBI can pinpoint molecular mechanisms affected by pharmacological agents and identify key disease mechanisms in neuronal networks derived from patients. These findings underscore the potential of SBI to automate and enhance the identification of disease mechanisms from MEA measurements, offering a robust and scalable method for advancing research with hiPSC-derived neuronal networks.

">Functional Activity, Functional Connectivity and Complex Network Biomarkers of Progressive Hyposmia Parkinson's Disease with No Cognitive Impairment: Evidences from Resting-state fMRI Study</a></h4>

              
                Background: Olfactory dysfunction stands as one of the most prevalent non-motor symptoms in the initial stage of Parkinson's disease (PD). Nevertheless, the intricate mechanisms underlying olfactory deficits in Parkinson's disease still remain elusive. Methods: This study collected rs-fMRI data from 30 PD patients (15 with severe hyposmia (PD-SH) and 15 with no/mild hyposmia (PD-N/MH)) and 15 healthy controls (HC). To investigate functional segregation, the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) and regional homogeneity (ReHo) were utilized. Functional connectivity (FC) analysis was performed to explore the functional integration across diverse brain regions. Additionally, the graph theory-based network analysis was employed to assess functional networks in PD patients. Furthermore, Pearson correlation analysis was conducted to delve deeper into the relationship between the severity of olfactory dysfunction and various functional metrics. Results: Firstly, PD patients showed significantly higher ALFF values in the superior temporal gyrus compared to HC, especially in the PD-SH group versus PD-N/MH. Meanwhile, ALFF values in this region negatively correlated with olfactory testing scores. Secondly, PD patients had higher ReHo in middle temporal gyrus and superior frontal gyrus than HC, especially PD-SH. Meanwhile, olfactory scores negatively correlated with these ReHo values. Thirdly, we observed a negative correlation between superior cerebellar-insula connectivity and olfactory scores, suggesting a neural circuit link to olfactory dysfunction. Lastly, the PD patients' brain networks consistently showed small-world attributes, with the PD-N/MH group having significantly higher nodal betweenness in the superior cerebellum than the PD-SH group. There's also a positive link between superior cerebellum's betweenness and olfactory scores. Additionally, there is a notable difference in the node degree of the superior temporal gyrus when comparing the PD-SH group to the PD-N/MH group. Conclusion: Using fMRI, our study analyzed brain function in PD-SH, PD-N/MH, and HC groups, revealing impaired segregation and integration in PD-SH and PD-N/MH. We hypothesize that changes in temporal, frontal, occipital, and cerebellar activities, along with aberrant cerebellum-insula connectivity and node degree and betweenness disparities, may be linked to olfactory dysfunction in PD patients.

">TRIM46 is not required for axon specification or axon initial segment formation in vivo</a></h4>

              
                Vertebrate nervous systems use the axon initial segment (AIS) to initiate action potentials and maintain neuronal polarity. The microtubule-associated protein tripartite motif containing 46 (TRIM46) was reported to regulate axon specification, AIS assembly, and neuronal polarity through the bundling of microtubules in the proximal axon. However, these claims are based on TRIM46 knockdown in cultured neurons. To investigate TRIM46 function in vivo, we examined TRIM46 knockout mice. Contrary to previous reports, we find that TRIM46 is dispensable for AIS formation and maintenance, and axon specification. TRIM46 knockout mice are viable, have normal behavior, and have normal brain structure. Thus, TRIM46 is not required for AIS formation, axon specification, or nervous system function. We also show TRIM46 enrichment in the first ~100 m of axon occurs independently of ankyrinG (AnkG), although AnkG is required to restrict TRIM46 only to the AIS. Our results suggest an unidentified protein may compensate for loss of TRIM46 in vivo and highlight the need for further investigation of the mechanisms by which the AIS and microtubules interact to shape neuronal structure and function.

">The individual determinants of morning dream recall</a></h4>

              
                Evidence suggests that (almost) everyone dreams during their sleep and may actually do so for a large part of the night. Yet, dream recall shows large interindividual variability. Understanding the factors that influence dream recall is crucial for advancing our knowledge regarding dreams' origin, significance, and functions. Here, we tackled this issue by prospectively collecting dream reports along with demographic information and psychometric, cognitive, actigraphic, and electroencephalographic measures in 204 healthy adults (18-70 y, 113 females). We found that attitude towards dreaming, proneness to mind wandering, and sleep patterns are associated with the probability of reporting a dream upon morning awakening. The likelihood of recalling dream content was predicted by age and vulnerability to interference. Moreover, dream recall appeared to be influenced by night-by-night changes in sleep patterns and showed seasonal fluctuations. Our results provide an account for previous observations regarding inter- and intra-individual variability in morning dream recall.

">A dorsal versus ventral network for understanding others in the developing brain</a></h4>

              
                Young children strongly depend on others, and learning to understand their mental states (referred to as Theory of Mind, ToM) is a key challenge of early cognitive development. Traditionally, ToM is thought to emerge around the age of 4 years. Yet, in non-verbal tasks, preverbal infants already seem to consider others' mental states when predicting their actions. These early non-verbal capacities, however, seem fragile and distinct from later-developing verbal ToM. So far, little is known about the nature of these early capacities and the neural networks supporting them. To identify these networks, we investigated the maturation of nerve fiber connections associated with children's correct non-verbal action prediction and compared them with connections supporting verbal ToM reasoning in 3- to 4-year-old children, that is, before and after their breakthrough in verbal ToM. This revealed a ventral network for non-verbal action prediction versus a dorsal network for verbal ToM. Non-verbal capacities were associated with maturational indices in ventral fiber tracts connecting regions of the salience network, involved in bottom-up social attention processes. In contrast, verbal ToM performance correlated with maturational indices of the arcuate fascicle and cingulum, which dorsally connect regions of the default network, involved in higher-order social cognitive processes including ToM in adults. As non-verbal tasks were linked to connections of the salience network, young children may make use of salient perceptual social cues to predict others' actions, questioning theories of mature ToM before 4 years.

">The fingerprints of pupillary dynamics</a></h4>

              
                The size of the pupils reflects directly the balance of different branches of the autonomic nervous system. This measure is inexpensive, non-invasive, and has provided invaluable insights on a wide range of mental processes, from attention to emotion and executive functions. Two outstanding limitations of current pupillometry research are the lack of consensus in the analytical approaches, which vary wildly across research groups, and the fact that, unlike other neuroimaging techniques, pupillometry lacks the dimensionality to shed light on the different sources of the observed effects. In other words, pupillometry provides an integrated readout of several distinct networks (Strauch et al., 2022), but it is unclear whether each has a specific fingerprint, stemming from its function or physiological substrate. Here we show that phasic changes in pupil size are inherently low-dimensional, with modes that are highly consistent across behavioral tasks of very different nature, suggesting that these changes occur along a pupillary manifold that is highly constrained by the underlying physiological structures. These results provide not only a unified approach to analyze pupillary data, for which we offer a toolbox, but also the opportunity to delve deeper into the sources of the reported changes in pupil size.

">Human neural dynamics of real-world and imagined navigation</a></h4>

              
                The ability to form episodic memories and later imagine them is integral to the human experience, influencing our recollection of the past and our ability to envision the future. While research on spatial navigation in rodents suggests the involvement of the medial temporal lobe (MTL), especially the hippocampus, in these cognitive functions, it is uncertain if these insights apply to the human MTL, especially regarding imagination and the reliving of events. Importantly, by involving human participants, imaginations can be explicitly instructed and their mental experiences verbally reported. In this study, we investigated the role of hippocampal theta oscillations in both real-world and imagined navigation, leveraging motion capture and intracranial electroencephalographic recordings from individuals with chronically implanted MTL electrodes who could move freely. Our results revealed intermittent theta dynamics, particularly within the hippocampus, which encoded spatial geometry and partitioned navigational routes into linear segments during real-world navigation. During imagined navigation, theta dynamics exhibited similar, repetitive patterns despite the absence of external environmental cues. Furthermore, a computational model, generalizing from real-world to imagined navigation, successfully reconstructed participants' imagined positions using neural data. These findings offer unique insights into the neural mechanisms underlying human navigation and imagination, with implications for understanding episodic memory formation and retrieval in real-world settings.

">Meta-Control Demands Deactivate Cognitive-Control Regions</a></h4>

              
                Control interventions (e.g., attention, inhibition) are well-known to activate frontoparietal regions and increase pupil size. Here, we characterize a different facet of cognitive-control that deactivates these very same regions and decreases pupil size. Control interventions always occur in the context of extended task episodes (e.g., block of trials). Since these extended episodes are controlled and executed as one entity, the various control interventions made across their duration are brought about via common goal-directed programs. These programs are instantiated at the beginning of the episode and are the means of organizing and controlling the numerous control interventions to be made across the task duration. These programs, therefore, are meta-control in function in that they control and organize the control interventions to be made across the task episode. Difficult episodes begin with the instantiation of more complex programs that will go on to bring about a more complex set of control interventions. Across four experiments, we show that while the instantiation of more complex control interventions during difficult task episodes expectedly activated control-related frontoparietal regions and increased pupil size, instantiation of more complex programs at the beginning of these episodes deactivated these very regions and decreased pupil size. Neural and psychophysiological signatures of the meta-control programs are thus categorically different from those of control interventions made through these programs.

">Multifaceted confidence in exploratory choice</a></h4>

              
                Our choices are typically accompanied by a feeling of confidence - an internal estimate that they are correct. Correctness, however, depends on our goals. For example, exploration-exploitation problems entail a tension between short- and long-term goals: finding out about the value of one option could mean foregoing another option that is apparently more rewarding. Here, we hypothesised that after making an exploratory choice that involves sacrificing an immediate gain, subjects will be confident that they chose a better option for long-term rewards, but not confident that it was a better option for immediate reward. We asked 250 subjects across 2 experiments to perform a varying-horizon two-arm bandits task, in which we asked them to rate their confidence that their choice would lead to more immediate, or more total reward. Confirming previous studies, we found a significant increase in exploration with increasing trial horizon, but, contrary to our predictions, we found no difference between confidence in immediate or total reward. This dissociation is further evidence for a separation in the mechanisms involved in choices and confidence judgements.

">The Effects of Locus Coeruleus Optogenetic Stimulation on Global Spatiotemporal Patterns in Rats</a></h4>

              
                Whole-brain intrinsic activity as detected by resting-state fMRI can be summarized by three primary spatiotemporal patterns. These patterns have been shown to change with different brain states, especially arousal. The noradrenergic locus coeruleus (LC) is a key node in arousal circuits and has extensive projections throughout the brain, giving it neuromodulatory influence over the coordinated activity of structurally separated regions. In this study, we used optogenetic-fMRI in rats to investigate the impact of LC stimulation on the global signal and three primary spatiotemporal patterns. We report small, spatially specific changes in global signal distribution as a result of tonic LC stimulation, as well as regional changes in spatiotemporal patterns of activity at 5 Hz tonic and 15 Hz phasic stimulation. We also found that LC stimulation had little to no effect on the spatiotemporal patterns detected by complex principal component analysis. These results show that the effects of LC activity on the BOLD signal in rats may be small and regionally concentrated, as opposed to widespread and globally acting.

">Selective Functional Connectivity between Ocular Dominance Columns in the Primary Visual Cortex</a></h4>

              
                The primary visual cortex (V1) in humans and many animals is comprised of fine-scale neuronal ensembles that respond preferentially to the stimulation of one eye over the other, also known as the ocular dominance columns (ODCs). Despite its importance in shaping our perception, to date, the nature of the functional interactions between ODCs has remained poorly understood. In this work, we aimed to improve our understanding of the interaction mechanisms between fine-scale neuronal structures distributed within V1. To that end, we applied high-resolution functional MRI to study mechanisms of functional connectivity between ODCs. Using this technique, we quantified the level of functional connectivity between ODCs as a function of the ocular preference of ODCs, showing that alike ODCs are functionally more connected compared to unalike ones. Through these experiments, we aspired to contribute to filling the gap in our knowledge of the functional connectivity of ODCs in humans as compared to animals.

">Cortical tracking of speakers' formant changes predicts selective listening</a></h4>

              
                A social scene is particularly informative when people are distinguishable. To understand somebody amid a 'cocktail party' chatter, we automatically index their voice. This ability is underpinned by parallel processing of vocal spectral contours from speech sounds, but it has not yet been established how this occurs in the brain's cortex. We investigate single-trial neural tracking of slow modulations in speech formants using electroencephalography. Participants briefly listened to unfamiliar single speakers, and in addition, they performed a cocktail party comprehension task. Quantified through stimulus reconstruction methods, robust tracking was found in neural responses to slow (delta-theta range) modulations of the fourth and fifth formant band contours equivalent to the 3.5-5 KHz audible range. Instantaneous inter-formant spacing (Delta-F), which also yields indexical information from the vocal tract, was similarly decodable. Moreover, EEG evidence of listeners' spectral tracking abilities predicted their chances of succeeding at selective listening when faced with two-speaker speech mixtures. In summary, the results indicate that the communicating brain can rely on locking of cortical rhythms to major changes led by upper resonances of the vocal tract. Their corresponding articulatory mechanics hence continuously issue a fundamental credential for listeners to target in real time.

">Sex and the facilitation of cued fear by prior contextual fear conditioning in rats</a></h4>

              
                Previous studies have shown that the formation of new memories can be influenced by prior experience. This includes work using pavlovian fear conditioning in rodents that have shown that an initial fear conditioning experience can become associated with and facilitate the acquisition of new fear memories, especially when they occur close together in time. However, most of the prior studies used only males as subjects resulting in questions about the generalizability of the findings from this work. Here we tested whether prior contextual fear conditioning would facilitate later learning of cued fear conditioning in both male and female rats, and if there were differences based on the interval between the two conditioning episodes. Our results showed that levels of cued fear were not influenced by prior contextual fear conditioning or by the interval between training, however, females showed lower levels of cued fear. Freezing behavior in the initial training context differed by sex, with females showing lower levels of contextual fear, and by the type of initial training, with rats given delayed shock showing higher levels of fear than rats given immediate shock during contextual fear conditioning. These results indicate that contextual fear conditioning does not prime subsequent cued fear conditioning and that female rats express lower levels of cued and contextual fear conditioning than males.

">Continuous and discrete decoding of overt speech with electroencephalography</a></h4>

              
                Neurological disorders affecting speech production adversely impact quality of life for over 7 million individuals in the US. Traditional speech interfaces like eyetracking devices and P300 spellers are slow and unnatural for these patients. An alternative solution, speech Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs), directly decodes speech characteristics, offering a more natural communication mechanism. This research explores the feasibility of decoding speech features using non-invasive EEG. Nine neurologically intact participants were equipped with a 63-channel EEG system with additional sensors to eliminate eye artifacts. Participants read aloud sentences displayed on a screen selected for phonetic similarity to the English language. Deep learning models, including Convolutional Neural Networks and Recurrent Neural Networks with/without attention modules, were optimized with a focus on minimizing trainable parameters and utilizing small input window sizes. These models were employed for discrete and continuous speech decoding tasks, achieving above-chance participant-independent decoding performance for discrete classes and continuous characteristics of the produced audio signal. A frequency sub-band analysis highlighted the significance of certain frequency bands (delta, theta, and gamma) for decoding performance, and a perturbation analysis identified crucial channels. Assessed channel selection methods did not significantly improve performance, but they still outperformed chance levels, suggesting a distributed representation of speech information encoded in the EEG signals. Leave-One-Out training demonstrated the feasibility of utilizing common speech neural correlates, reducing data collection requirements from individual participants.

">Top-down and bottom-up interactions rely on nested brain oscillations.</a></h4>

              
                Adaptive visual processing is enabled through the dynamic interplay between top-down and bottom-up (feedback/feedforward) information exchange, presumably propagated through brain oscillations. Here we causally tested for the oscillatory mechanisms governing this interaction in the visual system. Using concurrent TMS-EEG, we emulated top-down signals by a single TMS-pulse over the Frontal Eye Field (right-FEF), while manipulating the strength of sensory input through the presentation of moving concentric gratings (compared to a control-TMS site). FEF-TMS without sensory input led to a top-down controlled occipital phase-realignment, alongside higher fronto-occipital phase-connectivity, in the alpha/beta-band. Sensory input in the absence of FEF-TMS increased occipital gamma activity. Crucially, testing the interaction between top-down and bottom-up processes (FEF-TMS during sensory input) revealed an increased nesting of the bottom-up gamma activity in the alpha/beta-band cycles. This establishes a causal link between phase-to-power coupling and top-down modulation of feedforward signals, providing novel mechanistic insights into how attention interacts with sensory input at the neural level, shaping rhythmic sampling.

">Quantifying Population-level Neural Tuning Functions Using Ricker Wavelets and the Bayesian Bootstrap</a></h4>

              
                Experience changes the tuning of sensory neurons, including neurons in retinotopic visual cortex, as evident from work in humans and non-human animals. In human observers, visuo-cortical re-tuning has been studied during aversive generalization learning paradigms, in which the similarity of generalization stimuli (GSs) with a conditioned threat cue (CS+) is used to quantify tuning functions. This work utilized pre-defined tuning shapes reflecting prototypical generalization (Gaussian) and sharpening (Difference-of-Gaussians) patterns. This approach may constrain the ways in which re-tuning can be characterized, for example if tuning patterns do not match the prototypical functions or represent a mixture of functions. The present study proposes a flexible and data-driven method for precisely quantifying changes in neural tuning based on the Ricker wavelet function and the Bayesian bootstrap. The method is illustrated using data from a study in which university students (n = 31) performed an aversive generalization learning task. Oriented gray-scale gratings served as CS+ and GSs and a white noise served as the unconditioned stimulus (US). Acquisition and extinction of the aversive contingencies were examined, while steady-state visual event potentials (ssVEP) and alpha-band (8-13 Hz) power were measured from scalp EEG. Results showed that the Ricker wavelet model fitted the ssVEP and alpha-band data well. The pattern of re-tuning in ssVEP amplitude across the stimulus gradient resembled a generalization (Gaussian) shape in acquisition and a sharpening (Difference-of-Gaussian) shape in an extinction phase. As expected, the pattern of re-tuning in alpha-power took the form of a generalization shape in both phases. The Ricker-based approach led to greater Bayes factors and more interpretable results compared to prototypical tuning models. The results highlight the promise of the current method for capturing the precise nature of visuo-cortical tuning functions, unconstrained by the exact implementation of prototypical a-priori models.

	<p>Reproducing instructed movements is crucial for practice in motor learning. In this study, we compared the short-term reproduction of active pelvis movements with visual feedback and passive movement with the therapist&amp;amp;rsquo;s hands in an upright stance. Sixteen healthy males (M age = 34.1; SD = 10.2 years) participated in this study. In one condition, healthy males maintained an upright stance while a physical therapist moved the participant&amp;amp;rsquo;s pelvis (passive movement instruction), and in a second condition, the participant actively moved their pelvis with visual feedback of the target and the online trajectory of the center of pressure (active movement instruction). Reproduction errors (displacement of the center of pressure in the medial&amp;amp;ndash;lateral axis) 10 s after the passive movement instruction were significantly greater than after the active movement instruction (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), but this difference disappeared 30 s after the instruction (p = 0.118). Error of movement reproduction in the anterior&amp;amp;ndash;posterior axis after the passive movement instruction was significantly greater than after the active movement instruction, no matter how long the retention interval was between the instruction and reproduction phases (p = 0.025). Taken together, active pelvis movements with visual feedback, rather than passive movement with the therapist&amp;amp;rsquo;s hand, is better to be used for instructing pelvis movements.</p>

	<p>Background: Conservative therapy is currently the elective treatment for peripheric facial palsy according to scientific literature. The success of conservative therapy is due to physiotherapy and the application of its methods. The aim of this systematic review was to assess mirror therapy, a physiotherapeutic method. Objectives: The aim of the following systematic review is to evaluate the effectiveness of using mirror therapy in patients with peripheral paralysis of the seventh cranial nerve. Methods: This systematic review was conducted according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The screening of literature was carried out on Cochrane, PEDro, PubMed/Medline, Scopus and Web of Science databases up until August 2022. All studies were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 5 articles met the inclusion criteria and were included in this study. The risk of bias was evaluated with PEDro and Jadad scales. Discussion: In the present study, we reviewed 5 RCTs that compared mirror therapy with other physiotherapy treatments or placebo to reduce pain, depression and improve range of motion in patients with peripheric facial nerve palsy. Conclusions: Further studies are needed to determine the effectiveness of this type of treatment, but nevertheless the data obtained are very encouraging.</p>

                <p>From deciding which meal to prepare for our guests to trading off the proenvironmental effects of climate protection measures against their economic costs, we often must consider the consequences of our actions for the well-being of others (welfare). Vexingly, the tastes and views of others can vary widely. To maximize welfare according to the utilitarian philosophical tradition, decision-makers facing conflicting preferences of others should choose the option that maximizes the sum of the subjective value (utility) of the entire group. This notion requires comparing the intensities of preferences across individuals. However, it remains unclear whether such comparisons are possible at all and (if they are possible) how they might be implemented in the brain. Here, we show that female and male participants can both learn the preferences of others by observing their choices and represent these preferences on a common scale to make utilitarian welfare decisions. On the neural level, multivariate support vector regressions revealed that a distributed activity pattern in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC), a brain region previously associated with reward processing, represented the preference strength of others. Strikingly, also the utilitarian welfare of others was represented in the VMPFC and relied on the same neural code as the estimated preferences of others. Together, our findings reveal that humans can behave as if they maximized utilitarian welfare using a specific utility representation and that the brain enables such choices by repurposing neural machinery processing the reward others receive.</p>

                <p>Information seeking, such as standing on tiptoes to look around in humans, is observed across animals and helps survival. Its rodent analog&mdash;unsupported rearing on hind legs&mdash;was a classic model in deciphering neural signals of cognition and is of intense renewed interest in preclinical modeling of neuropsychiatric states. Neural signals and circuits controlling this dedicated decision to seek information remain largely unknown. While studying subsecond timing of spontaneous behavioral acts and activity of melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) neurons (MNs) in behaving male and female mice, we observed large MN activity spikes that aligned to unsupported rears. Complementary causal, loss and gain of function, analyses revealed specific control of rear frequency and duration by MNs and MCHR1 receptors. Activity in a key stress center of the brain&mdash;the locus ceruleus noradrenaline cells&mdash;rapidly inhibited MNs and required functional MCH receptors for its endogenous modulation of rearing. By defining a neural module that both tracks and controls rearing, these findings may facilitate further insights into biology of information seeking.</p>

                <p>Fragile X syndrome (FXS) arises from the loss of fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein (FMRP) needed for normal neuronal excitability and circuit functions. Recent work revealed that FMRP contributes to mossy fiber long-term potentiation by adjusting the Kv4 A-type current availability through interactions with a Cav3-Kv4 ion channel complex, yet the mechanism has not yet been defined. In this study using wild-type and <I>Fmr1</I> knock-out (KO) tsA-201 cells and cerebellar sections from male <I>Fmr1</I> KO mice, we show that FMRP associates with all subunits of the Cav3.1-Kv4.3-KChIP3 complex and is critical to enabling calcium-dependent shifts in Kv4.3 inactivation to modulate the A-type current. Specifically, upon depolarization Cav3 calcium influx activates dual-specific phosphatase 1/6 (DUSP1/6) to deactivate ERK1/2 (ERK) and lower phosphorylation of Kv4.3, a signaling pathway that does not function in <I>Fmr1</I> KO cells. In <I>Fmr1</I> KO mouse tissue slices, cerebellar granule cells exhibit a hyperexcitable response to membrane depolarizations. Either incubating <I>Fmr1</I> KO cells or in vivo administration of a tat-conjugated FMRP N-terminus fragment (FMRP-N-tat) rescued Cav3-Kv4 function and granule cell excitability, with a decrease in the level of DUSP6. Together these data reveal a Cav3-activated DUSP signaling pathway critical to the function of a FMRP-Cav3-Kv4 complex that is misregulated in <I>Fmr1</I> KO conditions. Moreover, FMRP-N-tat restores function of this complex to rescue calcium-dependent control of neuronal excitability as a potential therapeutic approach to alleviating the symptoms of FXS.</p>

                <p>Memories are thought to be stored in neural ensembles known as engrams that are specifically reactivated during memory recall. Recent studies have found that memory engrams of two events that happened close in time tend to overlap in the hippocampus and the amygdala, and these overlaps have been shown to support memory linking. It has been hypothesized that engram overlaps arise from the mechanisms that regulate memory allocation itself, involving neural excitability, but the exact process remains unclear. Indeed, most theoretical studies focus on synaptic plasticity and little is known about the role of intrinsic plasticity, which could be mediated by neural excitability and serve as a complementary mechanism for forming memory engrams. Here, we developed a rate-based recurrent neural network that includes both synaptic plasticity and neural excitability. We obtained structural and functional overlap of memory engrams for contexts that are presented close in time, consistent with experimental and computational studies. We then investigated the role of excitability in memory allocation at the network level and unveiled competitive mechanisms driven by inhibition. This work suggests mechanisms underlying the role of intrinsic excitability in memory allocation and linking, and yields predictions regarding the formation and the overlap of memory engrams.</p>

                <p>Hand movements are associated with modulations of neuronal activity across several interconnected cortical areas, including the primary motor cortex (M1) and the dorsal and ventral premotor cortices (PMd and PMv). Local field potentials (LFPs) provide a link between neuronal discharges and synaptic inputs. Our current understanding of how LFPs vary in M1, PMd, and PMv during contralateral and ipsilateral movements is incomplete. To help reveal unique features in the pattern of modulations, we simultaneously recorded LFPs in these areas in two macaque monkeys performing reach and grasp movements with either the right or left hand. The greatest effector-dependent differences were seen in M1, at low (&le;13&nbsp;Hz) and  frequencies. In premotor areas, differences related to hand use were only present in low frequencies. PMv exhibited the greatest increase in low frequencies during instruction cues and the smallest effector-dependent modulation during movement execution. In PMd,  oscillations were greater during contralateral reach and grasp, and &beta; activity increased during contralateral grasp. In contrast, &beta; oscillations decreased in M1 and PMv. These results suggest that while M1 primarily exhibits effector-specific LFP activity, premotor areas compute more effector-independent aspects of the task requirements, particularly during movement preparation for PMv and production for PMd. The generation of precise hand movements likely relies on the combination of complementary information contained in the unique pattern of neural modulations contained in each cortical area. Accordingly, integrating LFPs from premotor areas and M1 could enhance the performance and robustness of brain-machine interfaces.</p>

                <p>Left-sided spatial neglect is a very common and challenging issue after right-hemispheric stroke, which strongly and negatively affects daily living behavior and recovery of stroke survivors. The mechanisms underlying recovery of spatial neglect remain controversial, particularly regarding the involvement of the intact, contralesional hemisphere, with potential contributions ranging from maladaptive to compensatory. In the present prospective, observational study, we assessed neglect severity in 54 right-hemispheric stroke patients (32 male; 22 female) at admission to and discharge from inpatient neurorehabilitation. We demonstrate that the interaction of initial neglect severity and spared white matter (dis)connectivity resulting from individual lesions (as assessed by diffusion tensor imaging, DTI) explains a significant portion of the variability of poststroke neglect recovery. In mildly impaired patients, spared structural connectivity within the lesioned hemisphere is sufficient to attain good recovery. Conversely, in patients with severe impairment, successful recovery critically depends on structural connectivity within the intact hemisphere and between hemispheres. These distinct patterns, mediated by their respective white matter connections, may help to reconcile the dichotomous perspectives regarding the role of the contralesional hemisphere as exclusively compensatory or not. Instead, they suggest a unified viewpoint wherein the contralesional hemisphere can &ndash; but must not necessarily &ndash; assume a compensatory role. This would depend on initial impairment severity and on the available, spared structural connectivity. In the future, our findings could serve as a prognostic biomarker for neglect recovery and guide patient-tailored therapeutic approaches.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/21/e1337232024?rss=1">Risk-Taking Is Associated with Decreased Subjective Value Signals and Increased Prediction Error Signals in the Hot Columbia Card Task</a></h4>

              
                <p>It remains a pressing concern to understand how neural computations relate to risky decisions. However, most observations of brain&ndash;behavior relationships in the risk-taking domain lack a rigorous computational basis or fail to emulate of the dynamic, sequential nature of real-life risky decision-making. Recent advances emphasize the role of neural prediction error (PE) signals. We modeled, according to prospect theory, the choices of <I>n</I> = 43 human participants (33 females, 10 males) performing an EEG version of the hot Columbia Card Task, featuring rounds of sequential decisions between stopping (safe option) and continuing with increasing odds of a high loss (risky option). Single-trial regression EEG analyses yielded a subjective value signal at centroparietal (300&ndash;700&nbsp;ms) and frontocentral (&gt;800&nbsp;ms) electrodes and in the delta band, as well as PE signals tied to the feedback-related negativity, P3a, and P3b, and in the theta band. Higher risk preference (total number of risky choices) was linked to attenuated subjective value signals but increased PE signals. Higher P3-like activity associated with the most positive PE in each round predicted stopping in the present round but not risk-taking in the subsequent round. Our findings indicate that decreased representation of decision values and increased sensitivity to winning despite low odds (positive PE) facilitate risky choices at the subject level. Strong neural responses when gains are least expected (the most positive PE on each round) adaptively contribute to safer choices at the trial-by-trial level but do not affect risky choice at the round-by-round level.</p>

                <p>The retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) receive different combinations of L, M, and S cone inputs and give rise to one achromatic and two chromatic postreceptoral channels. The goal of the current study was to determine temporal sensitivity across the three postreceptoral channels in subcortical and cortical regions involved in human vision. We measured functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) responses at 7 T from three participants (two males, one female) viewing a high-contrast, flickering, spatially uniform wide field (~140&deg;). Stimulus flicker frequency varied logarithmically between 2 and 64 Hz and targeted the L + M + S, L &ndash; M, and S &ndash; (L + M) cone combinations. These measurements were used to create temporal sensitivity functions of the primary visual cortex (V1) across eccentricity and spatially averaged responses from the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), and the V2/V3, hV4, and V3A/B regions. fMRI responses reflected the known properties of the visual system, including higher peak temporal sensitivity to achromatic versus chromatic stimuli and low-pass filtering between the LGN and V1. Peak temporal sensitivity increased across levels of the cortical visual hierarchy. Unexpectedly, peak temporal sensitivity varied little across eccentricity within area V1. Measures of adaptation and distributed pattern activity revealed a subtle influence of 64 Hz achromatic flicker in area V1, despite this stimulus evoking only a minimal overall response. The comparison of measured cortical responses to a model of the integrated retinal output to our stimuli demonstrates that extensive filtering and amplification are applied to postretinal signals.</p>

                <p>When we perceive a scene, our brain processes various types of visual information simultaneously, ranging from sensory features, such as line orientations and colors, to categorical features, such as objects and their arrangements. Whereas the role of sensory and categorical visual representations in predicting subsequent memory has been studied using isolated objects, their impact on memory for complex scenes remains largely unknown. To address this gap, we conducted an fMRI study in which female and male participants encoded pictures of familiar scenes (e.g., an airport picture) and later recalled them, while rating the vividness of their visual recall. Outside the scanner, participants had to distinguish each seen scene from three similar lures (e.g., three airport pictures). We modeled the sensory and categorical visual features of multiple scenes using both early and late layers of a deep convolutional neural network. Then, we applied representational similarity analysis to determine which brain regions represented stimuli in accordance with the sensory and categorical models. We found that categorical, but not sensory, representations predicted subsequent memory. In line with the previous result, only for the categorical model, the average recognition performance of each scene exhibited a positive correlation with the average visual dissimilarity between the item in question and its respective lures. These results strongly suggest that even in memory tests that ostensibly rely solely on visual cues (such as forced-choice visual recognition with similar distractors), memory decisions for scenes may be primarily influenced by categorical rather than sensory representations.</p>

                <p>The lateral intraparietal area (LIP) plays a crucial role in target selection and attention in primates, but the laminar microcircuitry of this region is largely unknown. To address this, we used ultra-high density laminar electrophysiology with Neuropixels probes to record neural activity in the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) of two adult marmosets while they performed a simple visual target selection task. Our results reveal neural correlates of visual target selection in the marmoset, similar to those observed in macaques and humans, with distinct timing and profiles of activity across cell types and cortical layers. Notably, a greater proportion of neurons exhibited stimulus-related activity in superficial layers whereas a greater proportion of infragranular neurons exhibited significant postsaccadic activity. Stimulus-related activity was first observed in granular layer putative interneurons, whereas target discrimination activity emerged first in supragranular layers putative pyramidal neurons, supporting a canonical laminar circuit underlying visual target selection in marmoset PPC. These findings provide novel insights into the neural basis of visual attention and target selection in primates.</p>

                <p>Methods of cognitive enhancement for humans are most impactful when they generalize across tasks. However, the extent to which such "transfer" is possible via interventions is widely debated. In addition, the contribution of excitatory and inhibitory processes to such transfer is unknown. Here, in a large-scale neuroimaging individual differences study with humans (both sexes), we paired multitasking training and noninvasive brain stimulation (transcranial direct current stimulation, tDCS) over multiple days and assessed performance across a range of paradigms. In addition, we varied tDCS dosage (1.0 and 2.0&nbsp;mA), electrode montage (left or right prefrontal regions), and training task (multitasking vs a control task) and assessed GABA and glutamate concentrations via ultrahigh field 7T magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Generalized benefits were observed in spatial attention, indexed by visual search performance, when multitasking training was combined with 1.0&nbsp;mA stimulation targeting either the left or right prefrontal cortex (PFC). This transfer effect persisted for ~30&nbsp;d post intervention. Critically, the transferred benefits associated with right prefrontal tDCS were predicted by pretraining concentrations of glutamate in the PFC. Thus, the effects of this combined stimulation and training protocol appear to be linked predominantly to excitatory brain processes.</p>

                <p>Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and its analogs are widely used for diabetes treatment. The paraventricular nucleus (PVN) is crucial for regulating cardiovascular activity. This study aims to determine the roles of GLP-1 and its receptors (GLP-1R) in the PVN in regulating sympathetic outflow and blood pressure. Experiments were carried out in male normotensive rats and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were recorded. GLP-1 and GLP-1R expressions were present in the PVN. PVN microinjection of GLP-1R agonist recombinant human GLP-1 (rhGLP-1) or EX-4 increased RSNA and MAP, which were prevented by GLP-1R antagonist exendin 9-39 (EX9-39) or GLP-1R antagonist 1, superoxide scavenger tempol, antioxidant N-acetylcysteine, NADPH oxidase (NOX) inhibitor apocynin, adenylyl cyclase (AC) inhibitor SQ22536 or protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor H89. PVN microinjection of rhGLP-1 increased superoxide production, NADPH oxidase activity, cAMP level, AC, and PKA activity, which were prevented by SQ22536 or H89. GLP-1 and GLP-1R were upregulated in the PVN of SHR. PVN microinjection of GLP-1 agonist increased RSNA and MAP in both WKY and SHR, but GLP-1 antagonists caused greater effects in reducing RSNA and MAP in SHR than in WKY. The increased superoxide production and NADPH oxidase activity in the PVN of SHR were augmented by GLP-1R agonists but attenuated by GLP-1R antagonists. These results indicate that activation of GLP-1R in the PVN increased sympathetic outflow and blood pressure via cAMP-PKA&ndash;mediated NADPH oxidase activation and subsequent superoxide production. GLP-1 and GLP-1R upregulation in the PVN partially contributes to sympathetic overactivity and hypertension.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/21/e2081232024?rss=1">Auditory Competition and Coding of Relative Stimulus Strength across Midbrain Space Maps of Barn Owls</a></h4>

              
                <p>The natural environment challenges the brain to prioritize the processing of salient stimuli. The barn owl, a sound localization specialist, exhibits a circuit called the midbrain stimulus selection network, dedicated to representing locations of the most salient stimulus in circumstances of concurrent stimuli. Previous competition studies using unimodal (visual) and bimodal (visual and auditory) stimuli have shown that relative strength is encoded in spike response rates. However, open questions remain concerning auditory&ndash;auditory competition on coding. To this end, we present diverse auditory competitors (concurrent flat noise and amplitude-modulated noise) and record neural responses of awake barn owls of both sexes in subsequent midbrain space maps, the external nucleus of the inferior colliculus (ICx) and optic tectum (OT). While both ICx and OT exhibit a topographic map of auditory space, OT also integrates visual input and is part of the global-inhibitory midbrain stimulus selection network. Through comparative investigation of these regions, we show that while increasing strength of a competitor sound decreases spike response rates of spatially distant neurons in both regions, relative strength determines spike train synchrony of nearby units only in the OT. Furthermore, changes in synchrony by sound competition in the OT are correlated to gamma range oscillations of local field potentials associated with input from the midbrain stimulus selection network. The results of this investigation suggest that modulations in spiking synchrony between units by gamma oscillations are an emergent coding scheme representing relative strength of concurrent stimuli, which may have relevant implications for downstream readout.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/21/e2215232024?rss=1">TSG-6-Mediated Extracellular Matrix Modifications Regulate Hypoxic-Ischemic Brain Injury</a></h4>

              
                <p>Proteoglycans containing link domains modify the extracellular matrix (ECM) to regulate cellular homeostasis and can also sensitize tissues/organs to injury and stress. Hypoxic&ndash;ischemic (H&ndash;I) injury disrupts cellular homeostasis by activating inflammation and attenuating regeneration and repair pathways. In the brain, the main component of the ECM is the glycosaminoglycan hyaluronic acid (HA), but whether HA modifications of the ECM regulate cellular homeostasis and response to H&ndash;I injury is not known. In this report, employing both male and female mice, we demonstrate that link-domain&ndash;containing proteoglycan, TNF&alpha;-stimulated gene-6 (TSG-6), is active in the brain from birth onward and differentially modifies ECM HA during discrete neurodevelopmental windows. ECM HA modification by TSG-6 enables it to serve as a developmental switch to regulate the activity of the Hippo pathway effector protein, yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1), in the maturing brain and in response to H&ndash;I injury. Mice that lack TSG-6 expression display dysregulated expression of YAP1 targets, excitatory amino acid transporter 1 (EAAT1; glutamate&ndash;aspartate transporter) and 2 (EAAT2; glutamate transporter-1). Dysregulation of YAP1 activation in TSG-6<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice coincides with age- and sex-dependent sensitization of the brain to H&ndash;I injury such that 1-week-old neonates display an anti-inflammatory response in contrast to an enhanced proinflammatory injury reaction in 3-month-old adult males but not females. Our findings thus support that a key regulator of age- and sex-dependent H&ndash;I injury response in the mouse brain is modulation of the Hippo-YAP1 pathway by TSG-6&ndash;dependent ECM modifications.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/11-354/v3?src=rss">An investigation of syrinx morphometry and sound frequency association in lovebirds (Agapornis fischeri) chirps [version 3; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background In the issue of biodiversity, the domestication of birds as pets and trade animals requires special attention as a conservation effort. Lovebirds (Agapornis fischeri) are popular birds worldwide, due to their varied ornamentation and melodic chirping sound. Syrinx structure is suspected to be the main source of sound production during the chirping period. This study aimed to investigate syrinx morphometry and its correlation with sound frequency produced in lovebirds. Methods A total of 24 lovebirds of different ages and gender were investigated. Polymerase chain reaction method was performed to determine lovebird gender, meanwhile bird age was identified based on post-hatch recordings at the breeding farm. Thus, we enrolled male (n=12) and female (n=12) lovebirds aged 2 (n=4), 3 (n=4), and 4 (n=4) months in the investigation group, respectively. Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was performed to evaluate sound frequency during chirping period. Then, syrinx morphometry was identified using a topographic approach and methylene blue staining. Each variable was evaluated with Image J software and vernier caliper. Results Based on a topographical approach, we reported the general cartilage structure of the tracheosyringeal, bronchosyringeal, paired protrusions, tracheolateral muscles, sternotracheal muscles, and syringeal muscles in lovebird syrinx. In particular, the tympaniform membranes lateral lead a crucial role in modulating the frequency of male lovebirds more significantly (p=0,009) compared to female. On the other hand, the tympaniform membranes lateral dexter (p=0,02) and sinister (p=0,05) in females showed wider compared to male. We also reported a negative correlation between sound frequency compared to tympaniform membranes lateral dexter (y = -913,56x + 6770,8) and sinister (y = -706,16x + 5736). Conclusions It can be concluded that the tympaniform membranes lateral produced the lovebirds’ primary sound. The sound frequency of male lovebirds was higher compared to female, however negatively correlated with the area of tympaniform membranes lateral.
