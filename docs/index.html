	<p>The eight-and-a-half syndrome is a rare neuro-ophthalmological condition caused by a structural lesion in the dorsal portion of the pons, involving critical areas of the brainstem, i.e., medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF), abducens nucleus, facial genu, and colliculus. It is characterized by internuclear ophthalmoplegia with horizontal gaze palsy and peripheral facial palsy. Although the syndrome is most frequently caused by vascular or demyelinating diseases, several different underlying causes might occur. Herein, we describe a case of the eight-and-a-half syndrome caused by a lung adenocarcinoma metastasis localized in the lower pontine tegmentum. Then, we review the current literature on the underlying causes of the eight-and-a-half syndrome.</p>

                The nuclear receptor Nr2f1, also known as COUP-TFI, plays a key role during cortical development by acting as a strong transcriptional regulator in embryonic and adult neural cells. In humans, NR2F1 mutations cause the Bosch-Boonstra-Schaaf optic atrophy-intellectual syndrome (BBSOAS), a rare neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by multiple clinical features including optic nerve atrophy, cerebral visual impairment, seizures, intellectual disability, and autistic traits. Moreover, alterations in mitochondrial energy supply have been recently reported in some BBSOAS patients. Although mitochondrial dysfunction is increasingly implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders, whether and how Nr2f1 can regulate mitochondria function in neural cells is still completely unknown. To address these questions, we have combined genome-wide and in silico analyses with mouse genetics, neuroanatomical and imaging approaches. First, we found that key factors for mitochondrial function and dynamics represent potential genomic targets under direct Nr2f1 transcriptional control in neurons. To genetically manipulate Nr2f1 function in a restricted neuronal population, we focused on the adult mouse hippocampal dentate gyrus, a site of persistent neurogenesis in rodents and where Nr2f1 is highly expressed. We showed that both loss- and gain-of-function of Nr2f1 within the hippocampal neurogenic niche led to altered mitochondrial architecture in newborn neurons likely reflecting alteration in mitochondrial dynamics. Lastly, we identified the fusion factor Mfn2 as a putative Nr2f1 target and demonstrated its downregulation following both Nr2f1 adult depletion and embryonic haploinsufficiency in mice. Overall, our study provides the first evidence of a significant role of Nr2f1 in shaping mitochondrial architecture in neurons and opens a promising avenue for the identification of new mechanisms implicated in BBSOAS pathogenesis involving mitochondrial dysfunction.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Fast-synaptic axo-axonal transmission from striatal cholinergic interneurons onto dopamine fibers.</a></h4>

              
                Transmission from striatal cholinergic interneurons (CINs) controls dopamine release through nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) on dopaminergic axons. Anatomical studies suggest that cholinergic terminals signal predominantly through non-synaptic volume transmission. However, the influence of cholinergic transmission on electrical signaling in axons remains unclear. We examined axo-axonal transmission from CINs onto dopaminergic axons using perforated-patch recordings which revealed rapid spontaneous EPSPs with properties characteristic of fast synapses. Pharmacology showed that axonal EPSPs (axEPSPs) were mediated primarily by high-affinity 6-containing receptors. Remarkably, axEPSPs triggered spontaneous action potentials locally in dopaminergic axons, suggesting these axons perform integration to convert synaptic input into spiking, a function associated with somatodendritic compartments. We investigated cross-species validity of cholinergic axo-axonal transmission by recording dopaminergic axons in macaque putamen and found similar axEPSPs. Thus, we reveal that fast synaptic-like neurotransmission underlies cholinergic signaling onto dopaminergic axons, providing insight into how nicotinic receptors shape electrical signaling directly in axon terminals.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Nonlinear EEG signatures of mind wandering during breath focus meditation</a></h4>

              
                In meditation practices that involve focused attention to a specific object, novice practitioners often experience moments of distraction (i.e., mind wandering). Previous studies have investigated the neural correlates of mind wandering during meditation practice through Electroencephalography (EEG) using linear metrics (e.g., oscillatory power). However, their results are not fully consistent. Since the brain is known to be a chaotic/nonlinear system, it is possible that linear metrics cannot fully capture complex dynamics present in the EEG signal. In this study, we assess whether nonlinear EEG signatures can be used to characterize mind wandering during breath focus meditation in novice practitioners. For that purpose, we adopted an experience sampling paradigm in which 25 participants were iteratively interrupted during meditation practice to report whether they were focusing on the breath or thinking about something else. We compared the complexity of EEG signals during mind wandering and breath focus states using three different algorithms: Higuchi fractal dimension (HFD), Lempel-Ziv complexity (LZC), and Sample entropy (SampEn). Our results showed that EEG complexity was generally reduced during mind wandering relative to breath focus states. We conclude that EEG complexity metrics are appropriate to disentangle mind wandering from breath focus states in novice meditation practitioners, and therefore, they could be used in future EEG neurofeedback and/or neurostimulation protocols to facilitate meditation practice.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Deep brain stimulation creates information lesion through membrane depolarization</a></h4>

              
                Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a promising neuromodulation therapy that alters neural activity via intracranial electrical stimulation. However, the neurophysiological mechanisms of DBS remain largely unknown, because of the difficulty of obtaining cellular resolution recordings without electrical interference. Here, we performed high-speed membrane voltage fluorescence imaging of individual hippocampal CA1 neurons during DBS in awake mice. We discovered that DBS, delivered at either 40Hz or 140Hz, reliably depolarizes somatic membrane potentials. Further, DBS enhanced spike rates and paced membrane voltage and spike timing at the stimulation frequency, though more prominent at 40Hz than 140Hz. To determine how DBS induced membrane voltage change impacts neuron's ability to process inputs, we optogenetically evoked membrane depolarization. We found that neurons become unreliable in responding to optogenetic inputs during DBS, particularly during 140Hz DBS. These results demonstrate that DBS produces powerful membrane depolarization that interferes with neuron's ability to process inputs, creating information lesion

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Variation in TAF1 expression in female carrier induced pluripotent stem cells and human brain ontogeny has implications for adult neostriatum vulnerability in X-linked Dystonia Parkinsonism</a></h4>

              
                X-linked Dystonia-Parkinsonism (XDP) is an inherited, X-linked, adult-onset movement disorder characterized by degeneration in the neostriatum. No therapeutics alter disease progression. The mechanisms underlying regional differences in degeneration and age of onset are unknown. Developing therapeutics that target XDP-related mechanisms requires a deeper understanding of how XDP-relevant features vary in health and disease. XDP is due, in part, to either a partial loss of TAF1 function and/or a SVA-driven pathological gain of function. A disease-specific SINE-VNTR-Alu (SVA) retrotransposon insertion occurs within intron 32 of TAF1, a subunit of TFIID involved in transcription initiation. While all XDP males are usually clinically affected, females are heterozygous carriers generally not manifesting the full syndrome. As a resource for disease modeling, we characterized eight iPSC lines from XDP female carrier individuals, and identified isogenic lines where one clonal iPSC line expressed the wild-type X, and the two other clonal iPSC lines expressed the XDP haplotype. Furthermore, we characterized XDP-relevant transcript expression variation in humans, and found that SVA-F expression decreases slightly after 30 years of age in the neurotypical human brain and that TAF1 is modestly decreased in the majority of female samples. Uniquely in the caudate nucleus, TAF1 expression is not sexually dymorphic and decreased after 15 years of age. These findings indicate that regional-, age- and sex-specific mechanisms regulate TAF1, highlighting the importance of disease-relevant models and postmortem tissue analysis. We propose that the decreased TAF1 expression in the adult caudate may synergize with the XDP-specific partial loss of TAF1 function in patients, thereby passing a minimum threshold of TAF1 function, and triggering degeneration in the neostriatum.

                A hallmark of nervous system aging is a decline of white matter volume and function, but the underlying mechanisms leading to white matter pathology are unknown. Here, we found age-related alterations of oligodendrocytes with a reduction of total oligodendrocyte density in the aging murine white matter. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we identify interferon-responsive oligodendrocytes, which localize in proximity of CD8+ T cells in the aging white matter. Absence of functional lymphocytes decreased oligodendrocyte reactivity and rescued oligodendrocyte loss, while T-cell checkpoint inhibition worsened the aging effect. In summary, we provide evidence that T cells induced interferon-responsive oligodendrocytes are important modifiers of white matter aging.

                Huntington's Disease (HD) is caused by an expanded CAG repeat in the huntingtin gene, yielding a Huntingtin protein with an expanded polyglutamine tract. Patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) can help understand disease; however, defining pathological biomarkers is challenging. Here, we used cryogenic electron tomography to visualize neurites in HD patient iPSC-derived neurons with varying CAG repeats, and primary cortical neurons from BACHD, deltaN17-BACHD, and wild-type mice. In HD models, we discovered mitochondria with enlarged granules and distorted cristae, and thin sheet aggregates in double membrane-bound organelles. We used artificial intelligence to quantify mitochondrial granules, and proteomics to show differential protein content in HD mitochondria. Knockdown of Protein Inhibitor of Activated STAT1 ameliorated aberrant phenotypes in iPSC-neurons and reduced phenotypes in BACHD neurons. We show that integrated ultrastructural and proteomic approaches may uncover early HD phenotypes to accelerate diagnostics and the development of targeted therapeutics for HD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Petascale pipeline for precise alignment of images from serial section electron microscopy</a></h4>

              
                The reconstruction of neural circuits from serial section electron microscopy (ssEM) images is being accelerated by automatic image segmentation methods. Segmentation accuracy is often limited by the preceding step of aligning 2D section images to create a 3D image stack. Precise and robust alignment in the presence of image artifacts is challenging, especially as datasets are attaining the petascale. We present a computational pipeline for aligning ssEM images with several key elements. Self-supervised convolutional nets are trained via metric learning to encode and align image pairs, and they are used to initialize iterative fine-tuning of alignment. A procedure called vector voting increases robustness to image artifacts or missing image data. For speedup the series is divided into blocks that are distributed to computational workers for alignment. The blocks are aligned to each other by composing transformations with decay, which achieves a global alignment without resorting to a time-consuming global optimization. We apply our pipeline to a whole fly brain dataset, and show improved accuracy relative to prior state of the art. We also demonstrate that our pipeline scales to a cubic millimeter of mouse visual cortex. Our pipeline is publicly available through two open source Python packages.

                Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease and is the sixth leading cause of death in the US. AD is more prevalent in females than males. While estrogen provides neuroprotection in females, sex mediated differences in the development of AD pathology are not fully elucidated. Therefore, a comparison of the events that develop between sexes in the early-stage of AD pathology may reveal new potential targets for more effective therapeutic intervention. To address sex differences, we analyzed early stage 9-month male and female TgF344-AD (Tg-AD) rats, an AD model carrying the APPswe and Presenilin 1 (PS1{Delta}E9) mutations that develops progressive age-dependent AD pathology similar to humans. Using active place avoidance (aPAT) tests that assess hippocampal-dependent spatial learning and memory, we found significant deficits in Tg-AD females compared to wild type females, but no significant difference between the two male genotypes. Moreover, significant sex differences were observed in that Tg-AD females outperformed Tg-AD males in several measures of the aPAT test. Unexpectedly, Tg-AD females displayed higher levels of hippocampal amyloid plaques and amoeboid microglia than their Tg-AD male littermates. Furthermore, Tg-AD females experienced less hippocampal neuronal loss and had higher GluA2 subunit levels than Tg-AD males. Based on our findings, we propose that estrogen may protect females against cognitive impairment at early stages of AD by regulating GluA2 levels independently of amyloid plaque deposition and gliosis. Elucidating this potential protective mechanism of action of estrogen in AD could lead to new targets for early intervention.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Effects of variability in manually contoured spinal cord masks on fMRI co-registration and interpretation</a></h4>

              
                Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of the human spinal cord (SC) is an emerging but technically challenging method for understanding neurovascular responses to sensory and motor stimuli. Group-analysis of SC fMRI data involves co-registration of subject-level data to a standard image, which currently requires manual masking of the cord. We hypothesize that this manual input may contribute to bias or poor repeatability in group-level SC fMRI results. To test this, we examined variability in SC masks drawn in fMRI data from 21 healthy participants taken from a completed study mapping responses to sensory stimuli of the C7 dermatome. Masks were drawn on the temporal mean functional image by eight raters with varying levels of neuroimaging experience, and the rater from the original study acted as an expert reference. Spatial agreement between rater and expert masks was measured using the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), and the influence of rater experience and individual dataset was examined using ANOVA. Each rater mask was then used for spatial normalization of functional imaging data to the PAM50 template image. Using tissue regions defined in the template image, the gray matter-white matter signal contrast of the aligned functional data was used to evaluate the relative accuracy of the spatial normalization procedure across raters. Subject- and group-level analysis of activation during the left- and right-sided sensory stimuli were performed for each rater's co-registered data. Agreement with the expert's SC mask was associated with both rater experience level (F(7,140) = 32.12, P < 2x10-16, {eta}2 = 0.29) and dataset (F(20,140) = 20.58, P < 2x10-16, {eta}2 = 0.53). Dataset variations may reflect image quality metrics: the ratio between the signal intensity of spinal cord voxels and surrounding cerebrospinal fluid was correlated with DSC results (p<0.001). As predicted, variability in the manually-drawn masks visibly influenced spatial normalization, and the GM:WM contrast in the registered data showed significant effects of rater and dataset (rater: F(8,160) = 23.57, P < 2x10-16, {eta}2 = 0.24; dataset: F(20,160) = 22.00, P < 2x10-16, {eta}2 = 0.56). These registration differences were propagated into activation mapping results, and subject-level activation maps showed rater-dependent agreement with the expert's maps. Although group-level activation maps differed between raters, no systematic bias was identified. While increasing consistency in manual contouring of spinal cord fMRI data could improve data co-registration and ultimately the inter-rater agreement in activation mapping, our results suggest that other improvements in image acquisition and post-processing may be more critical to address.

                High-density multi-electrode array (HD-MEA) has enabled neuronal measurements at high spatial resolution to record local field potentials (LFP), extracellular spikes, and network activity with ease. Whilst we have advanced recording systems with over 4000 electrodes, capable of recording data at over 20 kHz, it still presents computational challenges to handle, process, extract, and view information from these large recordings. It can be challenging for researchers to extract and view even a single channel that has more than a billion data points, let alone process a group of channels. We have created a computational method, and an open-source toolkit built on Python, rendered on a web browser using Plotly Dash for extracting and viewing the data, and creating interactive visualization. In addition to extracting and viewing entire or small chunks of data sampled at lower or higher frequencies, respectively, it provides a framework to collect user inputs, analyze channel groups, generate raster plots, view quick summary measures for LFP activity, detect and isolate noise channels, and generate plots and visualization in both time and frequency domain. Incorporated into our Graphical User Interface (GUI), we also have created a novel seizure detection method, which can be used to detect the onset of seizures in all or a selected group of channels and provide the following measures of seizures: distance, duration, and propagation across the region of interest. We demonstrate the utility of this toolkit, using datasets collected from the 3Brain BioCAM duplex system. For the current analysis, we demonstrate the toolkit and methods with a low sampling frequency dataset (300 Hz) and a group of approximately 400 channels. Using this toolkit, we present novel data demonstrating increased seizure propagation speed from slices of Scn1aHet mice compared to littermate controls. With advances in HD-MEA recording systems with high spatial and temporal resolution, limited tools are available for researchers to view and process these big datasets. We now provide a user-friendly toolkit to analyze LFP activity obtained from large-scale MEA recordings with translatable applications to EEG recordings, and demonstrate the utility of this new graphic user interface with novel biological findings.

                Retinotopy is generally preserved across the visual system, but its precise cellular-level organization remains elusive. Using two-photon axonal imaging, we performed functional mapping of the retinocollicular projection at a single-cell resolution in awake mice. We found a near-perfect match between the tiling patterns of retinal ganglion cell axon terminals in the superior colliculus and their corresponding receptive fields, indicating that retinotopy arises from topographic projection of axons at single-cell precision.

                Despite clear therapeutic potential, the mechanisms that confer differential neuronal sensitivity are not well understood. During Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), sensitive spinal motor neurons (SpMN) die while a subset of rostral cranial motor neurons (CrMN) survive. In this work, we optimized a protocol to differentiate CrMNs and SpMNs from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) by direct programming and positional patterning. Human iCrMNs are more resistant than iSpMNs to proteotoxic stress and rely on the proteasome to maintain proteostasis. iCrMNs better prevent mislocalization of TDP43 from the nucleus, a hallmark of ALS progression. iSpMNs contain more splicing defects than iCrMNs in response to ALS-related stress with genes involved in splicing and proteostasis maintenance. Therefore, iCrMNs resist ALS at two levels, preventing protein accumulation and reducing splicing defects in response to TDP43 nuclear depletion. Thus, ALS-sensitive iSpMNs appear to enter a downward spiral compromising their ability to maintain proteostasis and splicing.

                Background and Hypothesis: Schizophrenia research arose in the last decades, focusing more on its neural basis. Executive functions such as decision making and cognitive flexibility are the main cognitive areas that are impaired and are considered schizophrenia endophenotypes. Recently, cognitive impairment has been connected with the ablation of glutamatergic NMDARs resulting in increased cortical activity. Selective NMDARs antagonists such as dizocilpine have been used to model cognitive inflexibility in schizophrenia. Moreover, a decreased GABAergic inhibitory activity has been shown elsewhere along with the enhanced cortical activity. This NMDARs/GABA unbalanced ratio may reduce the entrainment of prefrontal gamma and hippocampal theta rhythm, resulting in a prefrontal-hippocampal gamma/theta band desynchronization. Study Design: The study addressed the role of acute administrations of dizocilpine to model schizophrenia-like cognitive inflexibility in rats. We used a new version of the attentional set-shifting task, where rats learned switching/reversing the relevant rule. Moreover, we used the new ASST after dizocilpine systemic injections to test cognitive flexibility. Finally, we used in vivo optogenetic stimulations at specific light pulses of parvalbumin-positive interneurons in the prefrontal cortex and ventral hippocampus. Results: The first experiments showed that acute dizocilpine in rats reproduced schizophrenia-like cognitive inflexibility. The second set of experiments demonstrated that appropriate optogenetic light pulses frequencies could rescue the cognitive flexibility previously altered by acute dizocilpine. Conclusions: These findings advance our knowledge on the pivotal role of parvalbumin interneurons in schizophrenia-like cognitive impairment and may serve as a standpoint for further research of this severe psychiatric disorder.

                Callous-Unemotional (CU) traits are often associated with impairments in perspective taking and cognitive control; and adolescents with CU traits demonstrate aberrant brain patterns in areas underlying perspective taking and cognitive control. Together cognitive control and perspective taking are thought to link mechanistically to explain CU traits. Because increased cognitive control demands modulate perspective taking ability among both typically developing samples and individuals with elevated CU traits, understanding the neurophysiological substrates of these constructs could inform both identification and interventional efforts to alleviate the societal costs of antisocial behavior. The present study examines the heterogenous functional brain properties underlying cognitive controls influence on perspective taking among adolescents on a continuum of CU traits. Results reveal that cognitive control had a negative indirect association with CU traits via perspective taking; and that greater network connection density within the social and conflict brain networks indirectly associate with lower CU traits via perspective taking and cognitive control (respectively. Additionally, less negative network connection density between the social and conflict networks directly associated with higher CU traits. Our results support the growing literature on cognitive controls influence on socio-cognitive functioning in CU traits and extends that work by identifying underlying functional brain properties.

                The complex visually mediated behaviors of diurnal lizards are enabled by a retina typically containing five types of opsins with the potential for tetrachromatic color vision. Despite lizards using a wide range of color signals, the limited variation in photoreceptor spectral sensitivities across lizards suggests only weak selection for species-specific, spectral tuning of photoreceptors. Some species, however, have enhanced short wavelength sensitivity, which likely helps with the detection of signals rich in ultraviolet and short wavelengths. In this study, we examined the visual system of Tiliqua rugosa,which has a UV-blue tongue, to determine the spectral sensitivity of the eye and to gain insight into this species' visual ecology. Electroretinograms coupled with spectral stimulation showed peak sensitivity at 560 nm with high similarity to other lizards at wavelengths greater than 530 nm. However, at shorter wavelengths, sensitivity is enhanced leading to a spectral sensitivity curve that is 28 nm broader (full width at half height) than other lizards studied so far. The width of the curve is partially explained by a population of photoreceptors that respond more strongly to low temporal frequencies with possible peaks in sensitivity between 460 and 470 nm suggesting that they are SWS2 photoreceptors. The lack of a peak in sensitivity at 360 nm at low temporal frequencies and under a monochromatic light that suppresses the response of LWS photoreceptors, suggests that the SWS1 photoreceptors are red-shifted. In addition, the yellow and green oil droplets that are common in other diurnal lizards appear to be missing and instead, only transparent and pale-yellow oil droplets are present. LWS photoreceptors are likely paired with pale-yellow oil droplets to produce LWS photoreceptors with wider spectral sensitivity curves than in other lizards. Opsin sequencing reveals SWS1, SWS2, RH1, RH2 and LWS opsin genes that are very similar to the visual opsins detected in the green anole, Anolis carolinensis, suggesting there is little change in the spectral sensitivity of photoreceptors compared to other diurnal lizards. Since we only obtained a partial sequence of the SWS1 opsin, we were unable to determine whether amino acid substitution at tuning sites could have played a role in red-shifting the SWS1 photoreceptor spectral sensitivity. Photoreceptor densities are typically higher in central and ventral retinal regions than in the dorsal retina suggesting that higher spatial sampling is necessary at eye level and above the animal than on the ground. However, the SWS1 photoreceptors do not follow this pattern potentially due to their low abundance making them less relevant to high acuity visual tasks. Our findings demonstrate that there are possibly multiple mechanisms acting synergistically in the visual system of T. rugosa to enhance short wavelength sensitivity between 360 and 530 nm. While it is tempting to suggest that this is an adaptation to facilitate the detection of the blue tongues of conspecifics, additional experiments are necessary to determine its ecological relevance.

                Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common and complex neurodegenerative disorder. Loss of neuromelanin-containing dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) is a hallmark of PD neuropathology, however, the etiology of PD remains unclear. Single-cell (-nucleus) RNA sequencing (sc or snRNAseq) has significantly advanced our understanding of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's, but limited progress has been made in PD. Here we generated by far the largest snRNAseq data of high-quality 315,867 nuclei from the human SN including 9 healthy controls and 23 idiopathic PD cases across different Braak stages. Clustering analysis identified major brain cell types including DA neurons, excitatory neurons, inhibitory neurons, glial cells, endothelial, pericytes, fibroblast and T-cells in the human SN. By combining immunostaining and validating against the datasets from independent cohorts, we identified three molecularly distinct subtypes of DA-related neurons, including a RIT2-enriched population, in human aged SN. All DA neuron subtypes degenerated in PD, whereas the composition of non-neuronal cell clusters including major glial types showed little change. Our study delineated cell-type-specific PD-linked gene expression in the SN and their alterations in PD. Examination of cell-type-based transcriptomic changes suggests the complexity and diversity of molecular mechanisms of PD. Analysis of the remaining DA neurons of the three subtypes from PD demonstrated alterations of common gene sets associated with neuroprotection. Our findings highlight the heterogeneity of DA neurons in the human SN and suggest molecular basis for vulnerability and resilience of human DA neurons in PD. Our cohort thus provides a valuable resource for dissecting detailed mechanisms of DA neuron degeneration and identifying new neuroprotective strategies for PD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Robust Estimation of 1/f Activity Improves Oscillatory Burst Detection</a></h4>

              
                Neural oscillations often occur as transient bursts with variable amplitude and frequency dynamics. Quantifying these effects is important for understanding brain-behaviour relationships, especially in continuous datasets. To robustly measure bursts, rhythmical periods of oscillatory activity must be separated from arrhythmical background 1/f activity, which is ubiquitous in electrophysiological recordings. The Better OSCillation (BOSC) framework achieves this by defining a power threshold above the estimated background 1/f activity, combined with a duration threshold. Here we introduce a modification to this approach called fBOSC which uses a spectral parametrisation tool to accurately model background 1/f activity in neural data. fBOSC (which is openly available as a MATLAB toolbox) is robust to power spectra with oscillatory peaks and can also model non-linear spectra. Through a series of simulations, we show that fBOSC more accurately models the 1/f power spectrum compared with existing methods. fBOSC was especially beneficial where power spectra contained a "knee" below ~0.5-10 Hz, which is typical in neural data. We also found that, unlike other methods, fBOSC was unaffected by oscillatory peaks in the neural power spectrum. Moreover, by robustly modelling background 1/f activity, the sensitivity for detecting oscillatory bursts was standardised across frequencies (e.g. theta- and alpha-bands). Finally, using openly available resting state magnetoencephalography and intracranial electrophysiology datasets, we demonstrate the application of fBOSC for oscillatory burst detection in the theta-band. These simulations and empirical analyses highlight the value of fBOSC in detecting oscillatory bursts, including in datasets that are long and continuous with no distinct experimental trials.

                Opioids like fentanyl are the mainstay treatment for chronic pain. Unfortunately, opioids high addiction liability has led to the current opioid crisis. This is in part related to long-term use side-effects, including analgesic tolerance (gradual decrease in analgesia), and physical dependence (withdrawal symptoms upon opioid interruption), causing dose-escalation and preventing usage interruption. Altered circadian rhythmicity and sleep patterns are common in patients on opioid therapy. Prior research showed intricate bidirectional interactions between circadian rhythmicity, opioid analgesic efficacy, and side-effects. However, underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. Neuronal PAS domain protein 2 (NPAS2) is a circadian transcription factor that is highly expressed in structures of the central nervous system that modulate pain and opioids. In this study, we used male and female mice expressing non-functional NPAS2 (NPAS2 deficient, NPAS2-/-) to investigate the role of NPAS2 in fentanyl analgesia, tolerance, hyperalgesia, and dependence. In NPAS2-/- mice, we found that thermal pain thresholds, acute analgesia, and tolerance to a fixed dose of fentanyl were largely like wild-type mice. However, female NPAS2-/- mice augmented behavioral state of analgesic tolerance and exhibited significantly more behavioral symptoms of physical dependence. Conversely, only male NPAS2-/- mice had increased fentanyl-induced hypersensitivity, when compared to matched-sex littermate controls. Together, our findings suggest sex-specific effects of NPAS2 signaling in the regulation of fentanyl-induced tolerance, hyperalgesia, and dependence.

                The time we spend asleep is adjusted to previous time spent awake, and therefore believed to be under tight homeostatic control. Here, we establish microglia as a new cellular component of the sleep homeostat circuit. By using quantitative phosphoproteomics we demonstrate that microglia-derived TNF controls thousands of phosphorylation sites during the sleep period. Substrates of microglial TNF comprise sleep-promoting kinases and numerous synaptic proteins, including a subset whose phosphorylation status codes sleep need and determines sleep duration. As a result, lack of microglial TNF attenuates the build-up of sleep need, as measured by slow wave activity, and prevents immediate compensation for loss of sleep. Together, we propose that microglia control sleep homeostasis by releasing TNF that acts at the neuronal circuitry through dynamic control of phosphorylation. attenuates the build-up of sleep need, as measured by slow wave activity, and prevents immediate compensation for loss of sleep.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Intact maternal buffering of stress response in infant rats despite altered responsivity towards maternal olfactory cues in the valproic acid model of autism-like behavior</a></h4>

              
                Disrupted processing of social cues and altered social behaviors are among the core symptoms of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), and they emerge as early as the first year of life. These differences in sensory abilities may affect the ability of children with ASDs to securely attach to a caregiver and experience caregiver buffering of stress. Prenatal exposure to valproic acid (VPA) has been used to model some aspects of ASDs in rodents. Here, we asked whether prenatal VPA exposure altered infant rats' behavioral responsivity to maternal olfactory cues in an odor preference test and affected maternal buffering of infants' stress responsivity to shock. In the odor preference test, one-week old rats treated with VPA during pregnancy appeared to have impaired social recognition and/or may be less motivated to approach social odors in early infancy. These effects were particularly prominent in female pups. In two-week old rats, VPA-exposed pups and saline-exposed pups showed similar preferences for home cage bedding. Although VPA-exposed pups may initially have a deficit in this attachment-related behavior they do recover typical responses to home cage bedding in later infancy. Both control and VPA-exposed pups showed robust stress hormone responses to repeated shocks, an effect which was blocked when a calm mother was present during shock exposure. No sex differences in the effect of maternal presence on the stress response to shock and no interactions between sex and prenatal drug exposure were observed. Although VPA-exposed pups may show impaired responsivity to maternal cues in early infancy, maternal presence is still capable of regulating the stress response in VPA-exposed pups. In this study we demonstrate the importance of utilizing multiple batteries of tests in assessing behavior, dissecting the behavior on one test into different components. Our results inform about the underlying behavioral characteristics of some of the ASD phenotypes, including sex differences reported by clinical studies, and could shed light on potential opportunities for intervention.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sex-specific effects of chronic paternal stress on offspring development are partially mediated via mothers.</a></h4>

              
                Paternal stress exposure is known to impact the development of stress-related behaviors in offspring. Previous work has highlighted the importance of sperm mediated factors, such as RNAs, in transmitting the effects of parental stress. However, a key unanswered question is whether mothers' behavior could drive or modulate the transmission of paternal stress effects on offspring development. Here we investigate how chronic variable stress in Balb/C mice influences the sex-specific development of anxiety- and depression-like neural and behavioral development in offspring. Moreover, we examined how stressed fathers influenced mate maternal investment towards their offspring and how this may modulate the transmission of paternal stress effects on offspring. We show that paternal stress leads to sex-specific effects on offspring behavior. Males that are chronically stressed sire female offspring that show increased anxiety and depression-like behaviors. However, male offspring of stressed fathers show reductions in anxiety- and depression-behaviors and are generally more exploratory. Moreover, we show that females mated with stressed males gain less weight during pregnancy and provide less care towards their offspring which additionally influenced offspring development. These data indicate that paternal stress can influence offspring development directly and indirectly via changes in mothers, with implications for divergent development between male and female offspring.

                Temperature information is precisely processed in the nervous system. While progress has been made in identifying molecular thermosensors in the periphery, the neural circuits that process temperature information in the central nervous system remain unknown. Here we have identified an essential node in the neural circuitry for innocuous cool sensations. We found that a population of excitatory interneurons co-expressing Calbindin1 and Lbx1 (Calb1Lbx1) in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord is activated by innocuous cool temperatures. Genetic ablation or silencing of spinal Calb1Lbx1 neurons causes loss of innocuous cool but not noxious cold sensations. Further Brainbow labeling with expansion microscopy and electrophysiology showed that a small cluster of spinal Calb1Lbx1 interneurons in lamina I and the outer layer of lamina II represents the cooling-transmission neurons. These neurons receive monosynaptic connections from TRPM8+ primary sensory neurons and amplify the activity of cool-sensitive spinoparabrachial projection neurons. Our findings reveal a microcircuit in the dorsal spinal cord that specifically transmits innocuous cool sensations.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Synthetic torpor triggers a neuroprotective and regulated mechanism in the rat brain, leading to the reversibility of Tau protein hyperphosphorylation.</a></h4>

              
                Hyperphosphorylated Tau protein (PPTau) is the hallmark of tauopathic neurodegeneration. During "synthetic torpor" (ST), a transient hypothermic state which can be induced in rats by the local pharmacological inhibition of the Raphe Pallidus, a reversible brain Tau hyperphosphorylation occurs. The aim of the present study was to elucidate the - as yet unknown - molecular mechanisms underlying this process, at both a cellular and systemic level. Different phosphorylated forms of Tau and the main cellular factors involved in Tau phospho-regulation were assessed by western blot in the parietal cortex and hippocampus of rats induced in ST, at either the hypothermic nadir or after the recovery of euthermia. Pro- and anti-apoptotic markers, as well as different systemic factors which are involved in natural torpor, were also assessed. Finally, the degree of microglia activation was determined through morphometry. Overall, the results show that ST triggers a regulated biochemical process which can counteract PPTau formation starting, unexpectedly, from the hypothermic nadir. In particular, at the nadir, the glycogen synthase kinase-{beta} was largely inhibited in both regions, the antiapoptotic factor AKT was significantly activated in the hippocampus, and melatonin plasma levels were significantly increased, while a transient neuroinflammation was observed during the recovery period. Together, the present data suggest that ST can trigger a previously undescribed latent and regulated physiological process, that is able to cope with brain PPTau formation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Pharmacological manipulations of physiological arousal and sleep-like slow waves modulate sustained attention</a></h4>

              
                Sustained attention describes our ability to keep a constant focus on a given task. This ability is modulated by our physiological state of arousal. Although lapses of sustained attention have been linked with dysregulations of arousal, the underlying physiological mechanisms remain unclear. An emerging body of work proposes that the intrusion during wakefulness of sleep-like slow waves, a marker of the transition toward sleep, could mechanistically account for attentional lapses. This study aimed to expose, via pharmacological manipulations of the monoamine system, the relationship between the occurrence of sleep-like slow waves and the behavioural consequences of sustained attention failures. In a double-blind, randomised-control trial, 32 healthy participants received methylphenidate, atomoxetine, citalopram or placebo during four separate experimental sessions. During each session, electroencephalography (EEG) was used to measure neural activity whilst participants completed a visual task requiring sustained attention. Methylphenidate, which increases wake-promoting dopamine and noradrenaline across cortical and subcortical areas, improved behavioural performance whereas atomoxetine, which increases dopamine and noradrenaline predominantly over frontal cortices, led to more impulsive responses. Additionally, citalopram, which increases sleep-promoting serotonin, led to more missed trials. Based on EEG recording, citalopram was also associated with an increase in sleep-like slow waves. Importantly, compared to a classical marker of arousal such as alpha power, only slow waves differentially predicted both slower and faster responses in a region-specific fashion. These results suggest that a decrease in arousal can lead to local sleep intrusions during wakefulness which could be mechanistically linked to impulsivity and sluggishness.

                Cognitive complaints of attention/concentration problems are highly frequent in older adults with subjective cognitive decline (SCD). Functional connectivity in the cingulo-opercular network (CON-FC) supports cognitive control, tonic alertness, and visual processing speed. Thus, those complaints in SCD may reflect a decrease in CON-FC. Frontal white-matter tracts such as the forceps minor exhibit age- and SCD-related alterations and, therefore, might influence the CON-FC decrease in SCD. Here, we aimed to determine whether SCD predicts an impairment in CON-FC and whether neurite density in the forceps minor modulates that effect. To do so, we integrated cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses of multimodal data in a latent growth curve modeling approach. Sixty-nine healthy older adults (13 males; mean 68.33 {+/-} 7.95 years old) underwent resting-state functional and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, and the degree of SCD was assessed at baseline with the memory functioning questionnaire (greater score indicating more SCD). Forty-nine of the participants were further enrolled in two follow-ups, each about 18 months apart. Baseline SCD did not predict CON-FC after three years or its rate of change (p-values > 0.092). Notably, however, the forceps minor neurite density did modulate the relation between SCD and CON-FC (intercept; b = 0.20, 95% confidence interval, CI, [0.03, 0.37], p = 0.020), so that SCD predicted a greater CON-FC decrease in older adults with relatively lower neurite density in the forceps minor. The neurite density of the forceps minor, in turn, negatively correlated with age. These results suggest that CON-FC alterations in SCD are dependent upon the forceps minor neurite density. Accordingly, these results imply modifiable age-related factors that could help delay or mitigate both age and SCD-related effects on brain connectivity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The general anesthetic isoflurane inhibits calcium activity in cerebrovascular endothelial cells and disrupts vascular tone</a></h4>

              
                Calcium signaling in cerebrovascular endothelial cells (CVECs) has been identified to play key physiological and pathological roles in blood brain barrier function and neurovascular coupling, which involve dynamic changes in vessel diameter. However, there are no studies that measured correlated changes in vessel diameter and calcium activity in CVECs in vivo. In this study, we used the general anesthetic isoflurane (ISO) to induce a maximally dilated state in cortical blood vessels and measured the effects of the manipulation on CVEC calcium reporter activity in awake Cdh5BAC-GCaMP mice by use of two-photon fluorescence microscopy through thinned skull cranial windows. For the first time, we report dual effects of ISO on calcium activity in cerebral blood vessels of different diameter. During anesthesia induction ISO exposure triggered a short latency synchronous increase in calcium activity, followed by a period of activity suppression in small, medium, and large diameter vessels. Furthermore, during anesthesia maintenance calcium activity was desynchronized, and the relationship between vascular tone and calcium activity was disrupted in all vessel types. Based on these results we propose that there is a feedback mechanism between intracellular calcium fluctuations in CVECs and the maintenance of cerebrovascular tone.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Protein synthesis inhibition and loss of homeostatic functions in astrocytes from an Alzheimer's disease mouse model: a role for ER-mitochondria interaction.</a></h4>

              
                Deregulation of protein synthesis and ER stress/unfolded protein response (ER stress/UPR) have been reported in astrocytes. However, the relationships between protein synthesis deregulation and ER stress/UPR, as well as their role in the altered homeostatic support of Alzheimer's disease (AD) astrocytes remain poorly understood. Previously, we reported that in astrocytic cell lines from 3xTg-AD mice (3Tg-iAstro) protein synthesis was impaired and ER-mitochondria distance was reduced. Here we show that impaired protein synthesis in 3Tg-iAstro is associated with an increase of p-eIF2 and downregulation of GADD34. Although mRNA levels of ER stress/UPR markers were increased two-three-fold, we found neither activation of PERK nor downstream induction of ATF4 protein. Strikingly, the overexpression of a synthetic ER-mitochondrial linker resulted in a reduced protein synthesis and augmented p-eIF2 without any effect on ER stress/UPR marker genes. In vivo, in hippocampi of 3xTg-AD mice, reduced protein synthesis, increased p-eIF2 and downregulated GADD34 protein were found, while no increase of p-PERK or ATF4 proteins was observed, suggesting that in AD astrocytes, both in vitro and in vivo, phosphorylation of eIF2 and impairment of protein synthesis are PERK-independent. Next, we investigated the ability of 3xTg-AD astrocytes to support metabolism and function of other cells of the central nervous system. Astrocyte conditioned medium (ACM) from 3Tg-iAstro cells significantly reduced protein synthesis rate in primary hippocampal neurons. When added as a part of pericyte/endothelial cell (EC)/astrocyte 3D co-culture, 3Tg-iAstro, but not WT-iAstro, severely impaired formation and ramification of tubules. Finally, a chemical chaperone 4-phenylbutyric acid (4-PBA) rescued protein synthesis, p-eIF2 levels in 3Tg-iAstro cells and tubulogenesis in pericyte/EC/3Tg-iAstro co-culture. Collectively, our results suggest that a PERK-independent, p-eIF2-associated impairment of protein synthesis compromises astrocytic homeostatic functions and this may be caused by the altered ER-mitochondria interaction.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A novel maxillofacial technique to deliver drugs to the visual pathway, the optic nerve and the retina using the glymphatic system.</a></h4>

              
                The blood neural barriers are formidable barriers that prevent delivery of drugs into the eye and the brain. Currently, large biologics are used for treating many diseases of the eye and the brain. But the blood retinal barrier and the blood brain barrier prevent entry of these useful drugs into the eye and the brain respectively. Hence, there is a need for a drug delivery technique to bypass these natural barriers. Bevacizumab (Avastin) is a full length humanized monoclonal antibody with a molecular weight of 149kda. It binds to circulating vascular endothelial growth factor A and prevents interaction with vascular endothelial growth receptors. This results in blocking endothelial response and tumor vascularization. Bevacizumab is used to prevent choroidal neovascularization in age related macular degeneration and to prevent retinal neovascularization in diabetic retinopathy. It is also used for treating certain types of brain cancer. But it crosses neither the blood retinal barrier nor the blood brain barrier. This in vivo mouse study assessed the delivery of a commercial formulation of bevacizumab into the retina of mice using different ocular techniques like topical drops, subconjunctival injection, intravitreal injection and a novel maxillofacial technique. The objective was to assess whether the novel maxillofacial drug delivery technique could deliver drugs into the retina and to compare the efficacy of the maxillofacial technique with the mentioned ocular techniques. The distribution of bevacizumab was further compared with retinoschisin which is a small protein with a molecular weight of 24kda. Intravitreal injection and maxillofacial technique were effective in delivering drugs into the retina. In addition, the maxillofacial technique could target the brain including regions involved in the visual pathway and the optic nerve. The glymphatic pathway could also be targeted for drug delivery. Drug was also detected in the contralateral optic nerve and retina. Based on our study findings, we propose a new concept to explain the presence of the drug in the contralateral eye. We propose that after maxillofacial drug delivery, early distribution of the drug can occur in the CSF at the optic chiasma from the brain via the glymphatic system. In the case of the intravitreal injection, the drug from the experimental eye may be cleared through the glymphatic pathway of the ipsilateral optic nerve into the CSF surrounding the nerve. The crossover of the ipsilateral optic nerve fibers at the optic chiasma can result in further distribution of the drug in the CSF at the optic chiasma. From the region of the optic chiasma, the drug can distribute into the CSF surrounding the contralateral optic nerve. The drug can be then distributed into the contralateral optic nerve through the glymphatic pathway and be delivered into the contralateral eye. The drug can be further cleared into the aqueous of the contralateral eye through the anterior clearance pathway.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Suboptimal foraging decisions and involvement of the ventral tegmental area in human opioid addiction</a></h4>

              
                Addiction is marked by a tendency to exploit sources of reward despite diminishing returns. This behavior is aptly captured by animal patch-foraging models that have recently been extended to humans. Dopamine and norepinephrine centrally mediate addictive behavior and activity in both catecholaminergic systems is proposed to reflect the computations necessary for optimal foraging. However, the specific neural bases of excessive foraging and their role in human addiction are largely unknown. To address this gap, we studied the behavior of people with and without opioid use disorder (OUD) on a patch-foraging task in which they made serial decisions to "harvest" a depleting resource ("patch") for reward or incur a varying cost to "travel" to a replenished patch. In a subset of participants, we used high-resolution neuromelanin-sensitive MRI to image neuromelanin concentration, a proxy for long-term catecholaminergic function, in distinct dopaminergic nuclei (ventral tegmental area, substantia nigra subregions) and the noradrenergic locus coeruleus. While all participants were sensitive to the long-run reward rates of different patch-foraging environments, OUD participants stayed in reward patches longer than optimal - markedly overharvesting a source of reward despite its declining value - and this correlated with more chronic drug use. Overharvesting was selectively associated with lower neuromelanin signal in the ventral tegmental area but not other dopaminergic nuclei, nor the locus coeruleus. Our findings suggest that foraging decisions relevant to addiction involve a ventral-tegmental-area circuit that may signal reward rates in dynamic environments and implicate this circuit in maladaptive reward pursuit in human addiction to opioids.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Structural and functional MRI data differentially predict chronological age and behavioral memory performance</a></h4>

              
                Human cognitive abilities decline with increasing chronological age, with decreased explicit memory performance being most strongly affected. However, some older adults show "successful aging", that is, relatively preserved cognitive ability in old age. One explanation for this could be higher brain structural integrity in these individuals. Alternatively, the brain might recruit existing resources more efficiently or employ compensatory cognitive strategies. Here, we approached this question by testing multiple candidate variables from structural and functional neuroimaging for their ability to predict chronological age and memory performance, respectively. Prediction was performed using support vector machine (SVM) classification and regression across and within two samples of young (N = 106) and older (N = 153) adults. The candidate variables were (i) behavioral response frequencies in an episodic memory test, (ii) recently described fMRI scores reflecting preservation of functional memory networks, (iii) whole-brain fMRI contrasts for novelty processing and subsequent memory, (iv) resting-state fMRI maps quantifying voxel-wise signal fluctuation and (v) gray matter volume estimated from structural MR images. While age group could be reliably decoded from all variables, chronological age within young and older subjects was best predicted from gray matter volume. In contrast, memory performance was best predicted from task-based fMRI contrasts and particularly single-value fMRI scores, whereas gray matter volume has no predictive power with respect to memory performance in healthy adults. Our results suggest that superior memory performance in healthy older adults is better explained by efficient recruitment of memory networks rather than by preserved brain structure.

                Cognitive rigidity is a core symptom of anorexia nervosa (AN) and is associated with treatment resistance. Nevertheless, studies on the neural basis of cognitive flexibility (CF) in adolescent AN are rare. The aim of this study was to investigate temporal brain dynamics of CF in adolescents with AN and their tendency to experience anxiety. To address this aim, participants performed a Dimensional Change Card Sorting task during high-density EEG recording. Transient state and stable traits of anxiety were measured with the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Data were collected on 22 girls with AN, and 23 healthy controls (HC) (aged 12-20 years old). Evoked potentials were investigated using microstates analysis. Effects of trait and state anxiety on microstates parameters were investigated performing correlations across groups and in the AN group only. Adolescents with AN did not differ from HC with respect to behavioral switching cost, despite a greater overall accuracy. Adolescents with AN showed altered visual orienting processes (N100 micro-state), and earlier attentional processing to task switching (P300b microstate) when compared to HC. Reduced activation in a network involving the pre-central cortex, the cerebellum, and the posterior cingulate was identified in adolescents with AN. Trait and state anxiety were correlated with atypical AN microstates across groups. The present findings suggest CF manifests with inefficient behavioral and neural strategies in adolescents with AN, at early stages in the illness. Additionally, this study provides evidence that transient and stable tendencies to experience anxiety could represent a vulnerability to developing CF impairments in adolescent AN.

	<p>Cognitive difficulties are well documented in developmental dyslexia but they present a challenge to dyslexia theory. In this paper, the Model of the Control of Action is proposed as a theoretical explanation of how and why deficits in both automaticity and executive abilities are apparent in the cognitive profiles of dyslexia and how these deficits might relate to literacy difficulties. This theoretical perspective is used to consider evidence from different cognitive domains. The neuroanatomical underpinnings of automaticity and executive abilities are then discussed in relation to the understanding of dyslexia. Links between reading, writing, and executive function are considered. The reviewed evidence suggests that dyslexia theory should consider an interaction between procedural learned behaviour (automaticity) and higher-order (executive) abilities. The capacity to handle environmental interference, develop and engage adaptive strategies accordingly, and plan actions all require interactions between the cerebellum and the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Difficulties in these areas might explain both impairments in the cumulative development of literacy skills in childhood and general task management in everyday life in adulthood. It is suggested that improved measures are required to assess this cerebellar&amp;amp;ndash;PFC interaction and to allow early identification of future literacy difficulties, allowing implementation of timely interventions and reasonable adjustments.</p>

	<p>Since the outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, olfactory disorders have been reported as a frequent symptom of COVID-19; however, its pathogenesis is still debated. The aim of this review is to summarize the current understanding of the pathogenesis of smell impairment in the course of COVID-19 and to highlight potential avenues for future research on this issue. Several theories have been proposed to explain the pathogenesis of COVID-19-related anosmia, including nasal obstruction and rhinorrhea, oedema of the olfactory cleft mucosa, olfactory epithelial damage either within the olfactory receptor cells or the supporting non-neural cells (either direct or immune-mediated), damage to the olfactory bulb, and impairment of the central olfactory pathways. Although the pathogenesis of COVID-19-related anosmia is still not fully elucidated, it appears to be mainly due to sensorineural damage, with infection of the olfactory epithelium support cells via the ACE1 receptor and disruption of the OE caused by immense inflammatory reaction, and possibly with direct olfactory sensory neurons infection mediated by the NRP-1 receptor. Involvement of the higher olfactory pathways and a conductive component of olfactory disorders, as well as genetic factors, may also be considered.</p>

	<p>The present study examines the efficacy of tango therapy on motor and non-motor symptomatology in Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease, as detailed in articles published over the previous four decades (1980&amp;amp;ndash;2022). All data was collected using PubMed, Google Scholar, Web of Science, and Science Direct. The present descriptive study outlines the advantages of tango in the rehabilitation of Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease&amp;amp;rsquo;s motor and non-motor symptoms. Numerous studies have been conducted to determine the usefulness of tango for people with PD. Information from various research is critical for determining if tango is a useful supplementary therapy for the variety of symptoms related to Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease. The purpose of this review was to describe the present state of research on this subject. Thus, the objective of this review is to promote awareness of tango therapy&amp;amp;rsquo;s therapeutic benefits for Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease.</p>

	<p>This research measured human neural responses to images of different visual complexity levels using the oddball paradigm to explore the neurocognitive responses of complexity perception in visual processing. In the task, 24 participants (12 females) were required to react to images with high complexity for all stimuli. We hypothesized that high-complexity stimuli would induce early visual and attentional processing effects and may elicit the visual mismatch negativity responses and the emergence of error-related negativity. Our results showed that the amplitude of P1 and N1 were unaffected by complexity in the early visual processing. Under the target stimuli, both N2 and P3b components were reported, suggesting that the N2 component was sensitive to the complexity deviation, and the attentional processing related to complexity may be derived from the occipital zone according to the feature of the P3b component. In addition, compared with the low-complexity stimulus, the high-complexity stimulus aroused a larger amplitude of the visual mismatch negativity. The detected error negativity (Ne) component reflected the error detection of the participants&amp;amp;rsquo; mismatch between visual complexity and psychological expectations.</p>

     alt="Molecular cell identities in the mediodorsal thalamus of infant mice and marmoset"/>
<p>The mediodorsal thalamus (MD) can be divided into three distinctive regions, which project to the different cortical areas. Here we searched for subdivision-specific molecular markers in developing mouse MD thalamus. We made an MD region-specific Cre mouse line based on this search, which clearly shows specific projections to PrL/IL and AID in PFC. Further, we showed molecular organization in developing common marmoset, which showed dynamic expression differences compared to mouse MD, suggesting diverse MD function and connectivity in different species.
</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The mediodorsal thalamus (MD) is a higher-order nucleus located within the central thalamus in many mammalian species. Emerging evidence from MD lesions and tracer injections suggests that the MD is reciprocally connected to the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and plays an essential role in specific cognitive processes and tasks. MD subdivisions (medial, central, and lateral) are poorly segregated at the molecular level in rodents, leading to a lack of MD subdivision-specific <i>Cre</i> driver mice. Moreover, this lack of molecular identifiers hinders MD subdivision- and cell-type-specific circuit formation and function analysis. Therefore, using publicly available databases, we explored molecules separately expressed in MD subdivisions. In addition to MD subdivision markers, we identified several genes expressed in a subdivision-specific combination and classified them. Furthermore, after developing medial MD (MDm) or central MD (MDc) region-specific <i>Cre</i> mouse lines, we identified diverse region- and layer-specific PFC projection patterns. Comparison between classified MD marker genes in mice and common marmosets, a nonhuman primate model, revealed diverging gene expression patterns. These results highlight the species-specific organization of cell types and their projections in the MD thalamus.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Attention promotes the selection of behaviorally relevant sensory signals from the barrage of sensory information available. Visual attention modulates the gain of neuronal activity in all visual brain areas examined, although magnitudes of gain modulations vary across areas. For example, attention gain magnitudes in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and primary visual cortex (V1) vary tremendously across fMRI measurements in humans and electrophysiological recordings in behaving monkeys. We sought to determine whether these discrepancies are due simply to differences in species or measurement, or more nuanced properties unique to each visual brain area. We also explored whether robust and consistent attention effects, comparable to those measured in humans with fMRI, are observable in the LGN or V1 of monkeys. We measured attentional modulation of multiunit activity in the LGN and V1 of macaque monkeys engaged in a contrast change detection task requiring shifts in covert visual spatial attention. Rigorous analyses of LGN and V1 multiunit activity revealed robust and consistent attentional facilitation throughout V1, with magnitudes comparable to those observed with fMRI. Interestingly, attentional modulation in the LGN was consistently negligible. These findings demonstrate that discrepancies in attention effects are not simply due to species or measurement differences. We also examined whether attention effects correlated with the feature selectivity of recorded multiunits. Distinct relationships suggest that attentional modulation of multiunit activity depends upon the unique structure and function of visual brain areas.</p>

     alt="The organization of cholinergic projections in the visual thalamus of the mouse"/>
<p>We used retrograde and anterograde tracing techniques, along with immunocytochemistry, to delineate the sources of cholinergic brainstem projections to the dorsal thalamus of the mouse. Shown are the pattern of cholinergic projections from the parabigeminal nucleus (PBG; red), pedunculopontine tegmentum (PPTg; blue), and laterodorsal tegmentum (LDTg; brown) to contralateral and ipsilateral dorsal thalamic nuclei, including dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN), pulvinar (PUL), ventral lateral geniculate nucleus (vLGN), ventrobasal complex (VB), and posterior nucleus (Po). Brainstem nuclei are depicted as boxes and indicate immunoreactivity to choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT), and brain nitric oxide synthase (BNOS).
</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Cholinergic projections from the brainstem serve as important modulators of activity in visual thalamic nuclei such as the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN). While these projections have been studied in several mammals, a comprehensive examination of their organization in the mouse is lacking. We used the retrograde transport of viruses or cholera toxin subunit B (CTB) injected in the dLGN, immunocytochemical labeling with antibodies against choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), brain nitric oxide synthase (BNOS), and vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT), ChAT-Cre mice crossed with a reporter line (Ai9), as well as brainstem virus injections in ChAT-Cre mice to examine the pattern of thalamic innervation from cholinergic neurons in the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPTg), laterodorsal tegmental nucleus (LDTg), and the parabigeminal nucleus (PBG). Retrograde tracing demonstrated that the dLGN receives input from the PPTg, LDTg, and PBG. Viral tracing in ChAT-Cre mice and retrograde tracing combined with immunocytochemistry revealed that many of these inputs originate from cholinergic neurons in the PBG and PPTg. Most notable was an extensive cholinergic projection from the PBG which innervated most of the contralateral dLGN, with an especially dense concentration in the dorsolateral shell, as well as a small region in the dorsomedial pole of the ipsilateral dLGN. The PPTg was found to provide a sparse somewhat diffuse innervation of the ipsilateral dLGN. Neurons in the PPTg co-expressed ChAT, BNOS, and VAChT, whereas PBG neurons expressed ChAT, but not BNOS or VAChT. These results highlight the presence of distinct cholinergic populations that innervate the mouse dLGN.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10969861/most-recent">Distributions of vesicular glutamate transporters 1 and 2 in the visual thalamus and associated areas of the cat</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Glutamate is packaged in vesicles via two main vesicular transporter (VGLUT) proteins, VGLUT1 and VGLUT2, which regulate its storage and release from synapses of excitatory neurons. Studies in rodents, primates, <i>ferrets</i>, and tree shrews suggest that these transporters may identify distinct subsets of excitatory projections in visual structures, particularly in thalamocortical pathways where they tend to correlate with modulatory and driver projections, respectively. Despite being a well-studied model of thalamocortical connectivity, little is known about their expression pattern in the cat visual system. To expand current knowledge on their distribution and how they correlated with known driver and modulator projecting sites, we examined the protein expression patterns of VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 in the visual thalamus of the cat (lateral geniculate nucleus and the pulvinar complex). We also studied their expression pattern in relevant visual structures projecting to or receiving significant thalamic projections, such <i>as</i> the primary visual cortex and the superior colliculus. Our results indicate that both VGLUTs are consistently present throughout the cat visual system and show laminar or nuclei specificity in their distribution, which suggests, as in other species, that VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 represent distinct populations of glutamatergic projections.</p>

     alt="Cre driver mouse lines for thalamocortical circuit mapping"/>
<p>This study characterizes the temporal and spatial expression pattern of genetically encoded reporters following Cre-mediated recombination from three Cre drivers selective for the nuclei of the dorsal thalamus: <i>Oligodendrocyte transcription factor 3</i> (<i>Olig3)-Cre</i>, <i>histidine decarboxylase (HDC)-Cre</i>, and <i>corticotropin-releasing hormone</i> (<i>CRH)-Cre</i>. Cre-dependent expression of tdTomato reveals that <i>Olig3-Cre</i> expresses broadly within the thalamus, including thalamocortical (TC) neurons and interneurons, while <i>HDC-Cre</i> and <i>CRH-Cre</i> each have unique patterns of expression restricted to TC neurons within and across the sensory relay nuclei of the dorsal thalamus.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Subpopulations of neurons and associated neural circuits can be targeted in mice with genetic tools in a highly selective manner for visualization and manipulation. However, there are not well-defined Cre “driver” lines that target the expression of Cre recombinase to thalamocortical (TC) neurons. Here, we characterize three Cre driver lines for the nuclei of the dorsal thalamus: <i>Oligodendrocyte transcription factor 3</i> (<i>Olig3)-Cre</i>, <i>histidine decarboxylase (HDC)-Cre</i>, and <i>corticotropin-releasing hormone</i> (<i>CRH)-Cre</i>. We examined the postnatal distribution of Cre expression for each of these lines with the Cre-dependent reporter <i>CAG-tdTomato</i> (<i>Ai9)</i>. Cre-dependent expression of tdTomato reveals that <i>Olig3-Cre</i> expresses broadly within the thalamus, including TC neurons and interneurons, while <i>HDC-Cre</i> and <i>CRH-Cre</i> each have unique patterns of expression restricted to TC neurons within and across the sensory relay nuclei of the dorsal thalamus. Cre expression is present by the time of natural birth in all three lines, underscoring their utility for developmental studies. To demonstrate the utility of these Cre drivers for studying sensory TC circuitry, we targeted the expression of channelrhodopsin-2 to thalamus from the <i>CAG-COP4*H134R/EYFP (Ai32)</i> allele with either <i>HDC-Cre</i> or <i>CRH-Cre</i>. Optogenetic activation of TC afferents in primary visual cortex was sufficient to measure frequency-dependent depression. Thus, these Cre drivers provide selective Cre-dependent gene expression in thalamus suitable for both anatomical and functional studies.</p>

<p>Our work highlights the potential of the Syt6-Cre transgenic mouse line to effectively target Corticothalamic neurons in the associative cortices. This detailed study describes and tests the utility of the system, laying the foundation for its implementation as a new tool to study corticothalamic interactions between frontal and medial associative areas, thalamic nuclei, and the contribution of these interactions to higher cognitive functions.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Corticothalamic interactions between associative cortices and higher order thalamic nuclei are involved in high-cognitive functions such as decision-making and working memory. Corticothalamic neurons (CTn) in the prefrontal cortex and other associative areas have been much less studied than their counterparts in the primary sensory areas. The availability of characterized transgenic tools to study CTn in associative areas will facilitate their study and contribute to overcome the scarcity of data about their properties, network dynamics, and contribution to cognitive functions.</p>
<p>Here, we characterized the Syt6-Cre (KI148Gsat/Mmud) transgenic mouse line, by tracking expression of a Cre-mediated reporter. In this line, Cre-reporter is strongly expressed in the prefrontal, motor, cingulate, and retrosplenial cortices, as well as in other brain areas including the cerebellum and the olfactory tubercle. Cortical expression starts embryonically and reaches the adult expression pattern by postnatal day 15. In the cortex, Cre-reporter is expressed by layer 6-CTn and by layer 5-CTn to a lesser extent. We quantified Syt6-Cre<sup>+</sup> CTn axon varicosities to estimate the distribution and density of putative corticothalamic driver and modulator inputs to thalamic nuclei in the medial, midline, intralaminar, anterior, and motor groups. Also, we characterized the effect of optogenetic stimulation of Syt6-Cre<sup>+</sup> neurons in the activity of the prefrontal cortex. CTn stimulation in the prefrontal cortex induces an oscillatory activity in the local field potential that resembles the cortical downstates typically observed during slow-wave sleep or quiet wake.</p>

<p>Morphological and functional development of astrocytes in the visual thalamus: In the present study, we show that by eye-opening, astrocytes not only possess adult-like morphology but also completely enwrap retinogeniculate synapses and efficiently uptake extracellular glutamate.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The rodent visual thalamus has served as a powerful model to elucidate the cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie sensory circuit formation and function. Despite significant advances in our understanding of the role of axon-target interactions and neural activity in orchestrating circuit formation in visual thalamus, the role of non-neuronal cells, such as astrocytes, is less clear. In fact, we know little about the transcriptional identity and development of astrocytes in mouse visual thalamus. To address this gap in knowledge, we studied the expression of canonical astrocyte molecules in visual thalamus using immunostaining, in situ hybridization, and reporter lines. While our data suggests some level of heterogeneity of astrocytes in different nuclei of the visual thalamus, the majority of thalamic astrocytes appeared to be labeled in <i>Aldh1l1-EGFP</i> mice. This led us to use this transgenic line to characterize the neonatal and postnatal development of these cells in visual thalamus. Our data show that not only have the entire cohort of astrocytes migrated into visual thalamus by eye-opening but they also have acquired their adult-like morphology, even while retinogeniculate synapses are still maturing. Furthermore, ultrastructural, immunohistochemical, and functional approaches revealed that by eye-opening, thalamic astrocytes ensheathe retinogeniculate synapses and are capable of efficient uptake of glutamate. Taken together, our results reveal that the morphological, anatomical, and functional development of astrocytes in visual thalamus occurs prior to eye-opening and the emergence of experience-dependent visual activity.</p>

     alt="Secondary thalamic neuroinflammation after focal cortical stroke and traumatic injury mirrors corticothalamic functional connectivity"/>
<p>Focal cortical TBI or stroke in various cortical areas leads to gliosis in the functionally connected thalamocortical nuclei and of the <i>nucleus reticularis thalami</i> (nRT). The dotted line in the prefrontal cortex-injured section indicates that the top and bottom halves of the brain are sourced from different bregma positions in order to display cortical injury and relevant thalamic nuclei together.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>While cortical injuries, such as traumatic brain injury (TBI) and neocortical stroke, acutely disrupt the neocortex, most of their consequent disabilities reflect secondary injuries that develop over time. Thalamic neuroinflammation has been proposed to be a biomarker of cortical injury and of the long-term cognitive and neurological deficits that follow. However, the extent to which thalamic neuroinflammation depends on the type of cortical injury or its location remains unknown. Using two mouse models of focal neocortical injury that do not directly damage subcortical structures—controlled cortical impact and photothrombotic ischemic stroke—we found that chronic neuroinflammation in the thalamic region mirrors the functional connections with the injured cortex, and that sensory corticothalamic regions may be more likely to sustain long-term damage than nonsensory circuits. Currently, heterogeneous clinical outcomes complicate treatment. Understanding how thalamic inflammation depends on the injury site can aid in predicting features of subsequent deficits and lead to more effective, customized therapies.</p>

     alt="Ultrastructure of ipsilateral and contralateral tectopulvinar projections in the mouse"/>
<p>The confocal image of a coronal section through the left mouse pulvinar nucleus (PUL) illustrates the distribution of projections from the left (Ipsi, magenta) and right (Contra, green) superior colliculus (SC). This study examined the ultrastructure of ipsi and contra SC to PUL projections using viruses that induce the expression of peroxidase in synaptic vesicles (example electron micrographs circled, black arrows indicate synapses). Synaptic terminals originating from the ipsi SC were found to be significantly larger than synaptic terminals originating from the contra SC (left graph), and both populations of SC terminals were found to be significantly larger than synaptic terminals in the PUL that do not originate from the SC (right graph).

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Visual pathways of the brain are organized into parallel channels that code different features of the external environment. In the current study, we investigated the anatomical organization of parallel pathways from the superior colliculus (SC) to the pulvinar nucleus in the mouse. Virus injections placed in the ipsilateral and contralateral SC to induce the expression of different fluorescent proteins define two pulvinar zones. The lateral pulvinar (Pl) receives ipsilateral SC input and the caudal medial pulvinar (Pcm) receives bilateral SC input. To examine the ultrastructure of these projections using transmission electron microscopy, we injected the SC with viruses to induce peroxidase expression within synaptic vesicles or mitochondria. We quantitatively compared the sizes of ipsilateral and contralateral tectopulvinar terminals and their postsynaptic dendrites, as well as the sizes of the overall population of synaptic terminals and their postsynaptic dendrites in the Pl and Pcm. Our ultrastructural analysis revealed that ipsilateral tectopulvinar terminals are significantly larger than contralateral tectopulvinar terminals. In particular, the ipsilateral tectopulvinar projection includes a subset of large terminals (≥ 1 μm<sup>2</sup>) that envelop dendritic protrusions of postsynaptic dendrites. We also found that both ipsilateral and contralateral tectopulvinar terminals are significantly larger than the overall population of synaptic terminals in both the Pl and Pcm. Thus, the ipsilateral tectopulvinar projection is structurally distinct from the bilateral tectopulvinar pathway, but both tectopulvinar channels may be considered the primary or “driving” input to the Pl and Pcm.</p>

     alt="Cross-hierarchical plasticity of corticofugal projections to dLGN after neonatal monocular enucleation"/>
<p>In this study, the effect of monocular enucleation (MoE) in the development of the first-order visual thalamic nucleus, dLGN, was examined. We reported by microarray analysis a transcriptionally immature dLGN after early MoE. Additionally, focusing on layer 5 axonal projections, we demonstrated by viral tracing that layer 5 fibers in the enucleated dLGN originate from the primary visual cortex and not from the primary somatosensory cortex. Finally, we showed that layer 5 axons reorganize while innervating the enucleated dLGN and form aberrant synapses that persist until adulthood, indicating the presence of a permanent cross-hierarchical cortico-thalamic plasticity.

</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Perception is the result of interactions between the sensory periphery, thalamus, and cerebral cortex. Inputs from the retina project to the first-order dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN), which projects to the primary visual cortex (V1). In return, the cortex innervates the thalamus. While layer 6 projections innervate all thalamic nuclei, cortical layer 5 neurons selectively project to the higher order lateral posterior nucleus (LP) and not to dLGN. It has been demonstrated that a subpopulation of layer 5 (Rbp4-Cre+) projections rewires to dLGN after monocular or binocular enucleation in young postnatal mice. However, the exact cortical regional origin of these projections was not fully determined, and it remained unclear whether these changes persisted into adulthood. In this study, we report gene expression changes observed in the dLGN after monocular enucleation at birth using microarray, qPCR at P6, and in situ hybridization at P8. We report that genes that are normally enriched in dLGN, but not LP during development are preferentially downregulated in dLGN following monocular enucleation. Comparisons with developmental gene expression patters in dLGN suggest more immature and delayed gene expression in enucleated dLGN. Combined tracing and immuno-histochemical analysis revealed that the induced layer 5 fibers that innervate enucleated dLGN originate from putative primary visual cortex and they retain increased VGluT1+ synapse formation into adulthood. Our results indicate a new form of plasticity when layer 5 driver input takes over the innervation of an originally first-order thalamic nucleus after early sensory deficit.</p>

                Spatial gene expression, achieved classically through in situ hybridization, is a fundamental tool for topographic phenotyping of cell types in the nervous system. Newly developed techniques allow for the visualization of multiple mRNAs at single-cell resolution, greatly expanding the ability to link gene expression to tissue topography. Yet, methods for efficient and accurate quantification and analysis of high dimensional in situ- hybridization are limited. To this end, the Single-Cell Automated Multiplex Pipeline for RNA (SCAMPR) was developed, facilitating rapid and accurate segmentation of neuronal cell bodies using a dual immunohistochemistry-RNAscope protocol and quantification of low and high abundance mRNA signals using open-source image processing and automated segmentation tools. Proof of principle using SCAMPR focused on spatial mapping of gene expression by peripheral (vagal nodose) and central (visual cortex) neurons. The analytical effectiveness of SCAMPR is demonstrated by identifying the impact of early life stress on differential gene expression by vagal neuron subtypes.

                Spatial cognition depends on an accurate representation of orientation within an environment. Head direction cells in distributed brain regions receive a range of sensory inputs, but visual input is particularly important for aligning their responses to environmental landmarks. To investigate how population-level heading responses are aligned to visual input, we recorded from retrosplenial cortex (RSC) of head-fixed mice in a moving environment using two-photon calcium imaging. We show that RSC neurons are tuned to the animal's relative orientation in the environment, even in the absence of head movement. Next, we found that RSC receives functionally distinct projections from visual and thalamic areas, and contains several functional classes of neurons. While some functional classes mirror RSC inputs, a newly discovered class coregisters visual and thalamic signals. Finally, decoding analyses reveal unique contributions to heading from each class. Our results suggest an RSC circuit for anchoring heading representations to environmental visual landmarks.

                Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is characterized by periodic disruption of breathing due to sporadic collapse of upper airway. Mice with targeted deletion of the gene Hmox2, encoding the enzyme heme oxygenase-2 (HO-2), exhibit severe OSA. Upper airway patency is governed by genioglossal nerve activity originating from the hypoglossal motor nucleus. We tested the hypothesis that disrupted HO 2 signaling weakens hypoglossal motoneuron activity using a combination of genetic, biochemical and electrophysiological approaches. Hypoglossal neurons are positive for HO-2. Disrupting HO-2 function caused transmission failure of inspiratory rhythm from preBotzinger complex (preBotC) to the hypoglossal nucleus. Failed transmission coincided with smaller inspiratory drive currents and a reduced intrinsic excitability among hypoglossal neurons. Hypoglossal neurons also expressed cystathionine {Upsilon}-lyase (CSE), a H2S producing enzyme. H2S abundance was higher in hypoglossal neurons of HO-2 null mice than wild-type controls. Disrupting CSE function normalized transmission from preBotC to hypoglossal neurons in HO-2 null mice. A H2S donor mimicked the effects of disrupted HO-2 function in wild type mice. These findings demonstrate a hitherto uncharacterized modulation of XII motoneurons by HO-2 and CSE-derived H2S.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">EPHierStats: a statistical tool to model the hierarchical relationships in electrophysiological data</a></h4>

              
                Electrophysiological datasets are typically analyzed under the assumption that repeated measurements of the same unit of analysis (i.e. neuron or animal) can be treated as statistically independent. Recently, this assumption has been questioned and our data confirms and quantifies this skepticism using ex vivo slice recordings of synaptic currents in D1R+ medium spiny neurons in the nucleus accumbens. We therefore present EPHierStats as a statistical framework to analyze electrophysiological datasets with large numbers of measurements (>100) per unit of analysis. This novel analysis framework enables encoding of the full hierarchical relationships between measurements in a mixed-effects general linear model while also analyzing the distribution of values in assessed variables. Our method can easily be adapted to analyze a wide range of repeated-measures electrophysiological experiments. Implementation of the EPHierStats tool will aid the adaption of modern statistical approaches that prevent pseudoreplication and its associated false discovery rate while enabling statistical assessments of the complex relationships inherent to the field of neuroscience.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Differentiation of airway cholinergic neurons from human pluripotent stem cells for airway neurobiology studies</a></h4>

              
                Airway cholinergic nerves play a key role in airway physiology and disease. In asthma and other diseases of the respiratory tract, airway cholinergic neurons undergo plasticity and contribute to airway hyperresponsiveness and mucus secretion. We currently lack mechanistic understanding of airway cholinergic neuroplasticity due to the absence of human in vitro models. Here, we developed the first human in vitro model for airway cholinergic neurons using human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) technology. hPSCs were differentiated towards mature and functional airway cholinergic neurons via a vagal precursor. Airway cholinergic neurons were characterized by ChAT and VAChT expression, and responded to chemical stimulation with changes in Ca2+ mobilization. Co-culture of hPSC-derived airway cholinergic neurons with airway smooth muscle cells enhanced phenotypic and functional characteristics of these neurons. The differentiation protocol we developed for human airway cholinergic neurons from hPSCs allows for studies into airway neurobiology and airway neuroplasticity in disease.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A new monoclonal antibody enables BAR analysis of subcellular importin β1 interactomes</a></h4>

              
                Importin Importin {beta}1 (KPNB1) is a nucleocytoplasmic transport factor with critical roles in both cytoplasmic and nucleocytoplasmic transport, hence there is keen interest in the characterization of its subcellular interactomes. We found limited efficiency of BioID in detection of importin complex cargos, and therefore generated a highly specific and sensitive anti-KPNB1 monoclonal antibody to enable Biotinylation by Antibody Recognition (BAR) analysis of importin {beta}1 interactomes. The monoclonal antibody recognizes an epitope comprising residues 301-320 of human KPBN1, and strikingly is highly specific for cytoplasmic KPNB1 in diverse applications, with little or no reaction with KPNB1 in the nucleus. BAR with this novel antibody revealed numerous new interactors of importin {beta}1, expanding the KPNB1 interactome to cytoplasmic and signaling complexes that highlight potential new functions for the importins complex beyond nucleocytoplasmic transport. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD032728.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural Correlates of Linguistic Collocations During Continuous Speech Perception</a></h4>

              
                Language is fundamentally predictable, both on a higher schematic level as well as low-level lexical items. Regarding predictability on a lexical level, collocations are frequent co-occurrences of words that are often characterized by high strength of association. So far, psycho- and neurolinguistic studies have mostly employed highly artificial experimental paradigms in the investigation of collocations by focusing on the processing of single words or isolated sentences. In contrast, here we analyze EEG brain responses recorded during stimulation with continuous speech, i.e. audio books. We find that the N400 response to collocations is significantly different from that of non-collocations, whereas the effect varies with respect to cortical region (anterior/ posterior) and laterality (left/right). Our results are in line with studies using continuous speech, and they mostly contradict those using artificial paradigms and stimuli. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first neurolinguistic study on collocations using continuous speech stimulation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Successor-like representation guides the prediction of future events in human visual cortex and hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                Human agents build models of their environment, which enable them to anticipate and plan upcoming events. However, little is known about the properties of such predictive models. Recently, it has been proposed that hippocampal representations take the form of a predictive map-like structure, the so-called successor representation. Here we used human fMRI to probe whether activity in the early visual cortex (V1) and hippocampus adhere to the postulated properties of the successor representation after visual sequence learning. Participants were exposed to an arbitrary spatiotemporal sequence consisting of four items (A-B-C-D). We found that after repeated exposure to the sequence, merely presenting single sequence items (e.g., - B - -) resulted in V1 activation at the successor locations of the full sequence (e.g., C-D), but not at the predecessor locations (e.g., A). This highlights that visual representations are skewed toward future states, in line with the successor representation. Similar results were also found in the hippocampus. Moreover, the hippocampus developed a tuning profile that showed sensitivity to the temporal distance in sequence-space, with fading representations for sequence events in the more distant past and future. V1, in contrast, showed a tuning profile that was only sensitive to spatial distance in stimulus-space. Together, these results provide empirical evidence for the proposition that both visual and hippocampal cortex represent a predictive map of the visual world akin to the successor representation.

                It is widely assumed that our actions shape our brains and that the resulting connections determine who we are. To test this idea in a reductionist setting, in which genes and envi-ronment are controlled, we investigated differences in neuroanatomy and structural co-variance by ex vivo structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in mice whose behav-ioral activity was continuously tracked for 3 months in a large, enriched environment. We confirmed that environmental enrichment increases mouse hippocampal volumes. Strati-fying the enriched group according to individual longitudinal behavioral trajectories, how-ever, revealed striking differences in mouse brain structural covariance in continuously highly active mice compared to those whose trajectories showed signs of habituating activity. Network-based statistics identified distinct sub-networks of murine structural covariance underlying these differences in behavioral activity. Together, these results reveal that differentiated behavioral trajectories of mice in an enriched environment are associated with differences in brain connectivity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural responses to biological motion distinguish autistic and schizotypal traits in the general population</a></h4>

              
                Difficulties in social interactions are common to both autism and schizophrenia, and contribute to correlated autistic and schizotypal traits in the neurotypical population. It remains unresolved whether this represents a shared etiology or a superficial phenotypic overlap. Both conditions are associated with atypical neural activity in response to the perception of social stimuli, and also decreased neural synchronization between individuals that may prohibit establishing shared experiences. This study sought to establish if neural activity and neural synchronization associated with biological motion perception are differentially associated with autistic and schizotypal traits in the neurotypical population. Participants watched an audiovisual montage of naturalistic social interactions whilst hemodynamic brain activity was measured with fMRI. A separate sample of participants provided a continuous measure of the extent of biological motion, which was used to predict hemodynamic activity. General Linear Model analysis revealed that biological motion perception was associated with neural activity across the action-observation network. However, inter-subject phase synchronization analysis revealed that neural activity synchronized between individuals in occipital and parietal areas, but de-synchronized in temporal and frontal regions. Autistic traits were associated with a decrease in neural activity (precuneus, middle cingulate gyrus) and schizotypal traits were associated with a decrease in neural synchronization (middle and inferior frontal gyri). Biological motion perception elicits convergent and divergent patterns of neural activity and neural synchronization, and are differentially associated with shared traits related with autism and schizophrenia in the general population, suggesting that they originate from different neural mechanisms.

	<p>Fundamental frequency (F0) provides the primary acoustic cue for lexical tone perception in tonal languages but remains poorly represented in cochlear implant (CI) systems. Currently, there is still a lack of understanding of sensitivity to F0 change in CI users who speak tonal languages. In the present study, just-noticeable differences (JNDs) of F0 contour and F0 level changes in Mandarin-speaking children with CIs were measured and compared with those in their age-matched normal-hearing (NH) peers. Results showed that children with CIs demonstrated significantly larger JND of F0 contour (JND-C) change and F0 level (JND-L) change compared to NH children. Further within-group comparison revealed that the JND-C change was significantly smaller than the JND-L change among children with CIs, whereas the opposite pattern was observed among NH children. No significant correlations were seen between JND-C change/JND-L change and age at implantation /duration of CI use. The contrast between children with CIs and NH children in sensitivity to F0 contour and F0 level change suggests different mechanisms of F0 processing in these two groups as a result of different hearing experiences.</p>

	<p>Research on support for relatives of patients with Parkinsonism has mainly focused on caregivers, while preventive offers for non-caregiving relatives are lacking. Thus, the aim of this multicenter pilot study is to develop and assess the feasibility of a preventive psychosocial support program for relatives of patients with Parkinsonism. It specifically focuses on family members of patients who are in an early phase of the disease, are not currently caregiving, and have not yet developed distress symptoms. It includes a telemedicine-based, 6-week preventive psychological short intervention (PPSI). The main objective of this feasibility mixed-methods study is to specify the demand for an early, low-threshold, and low-cost short intervention and to collect feedback based on qualitative and quantitative data of N = 20 relatives. Secondary objectives are an evaluation of the effects of the intervention and an analysis of the study design. Future directions are to further develop the PPSI using these data. This study can serve as a basis for future randomized controlled studies on this intervention, which might fill an important gap in clinical supply.</p>

	<p>Background: Maladaptive neuroplasticity-related learned response in substance use disorder (SUD) can be ameliorated using noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS); however, inter-individual variability needs to be addressed for clinical translation. Objective: Our first objective was to develop a hypothesis for NIBS for learned response in SUD based on a competing neurobehavioral decision systems model. The next objective was to develop the theory by conducting a computational simulation of NIBS of the cortico-cerebello-thalamo-cortical (CCTC) loop in cannabis use disorder (CUD)-related dysfunctional &amp;amp;ldquo;cue-reactivity&amp;amp;rdquo;&amp;amp;mdash;a construct closely related to &amp;amp;ldquo;craving&amp;amp;rdquo;&amp;amp;mdash;that is a core symptom. Our third objective was to test the feasibility of a neuroimaging-guided rational NIBS approach in healthy humans. Methods: &amp;amp;ldquo;Cue-reactivity&amp;amp;rdquo; can be measured using behavioral paradigms and portable neuroimaging, including functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and electroencephalogram (EEG) metrics of sensorimotor gating. Therefore, we conducted a computational simulation of NIBS, including transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) of the cerebellar cortex and deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN) of the CCTC loop for its postulated effects on fNIRS and EEG metrics. We also developed a rational neuroimaging-guided NIBS approach for the cerebellar lobule (VII) and prefrontal cortex based on a healthy human study. Results: Simulation of cerebellar tDCS induced gamma oscillations in the cerebral cortex, while transcranial temporal interference stimulation induced a gamma-to-beta frequency shift. A preliminary healthy human study (N = 10) found that 2 mA cerebellar tDCS evoked similar oxyhemoglobin (HbO) response in the range of 5 &amp;amp;times; 10&amp;amp;minus;6 M across the cerebellum and PFC brain regions (&amp;amp;alpha; = 0.01); however, infra-slow (0.01&amp;amp;ndash;0.10 Hz) prefrontal cortex HbO-driven phase&amp;amp;ndash;amplitude-coupled (PAC; 4 Hz, &amp;amp;plusmn;2 mA (max)) cerebellar tACS evoked HbO levels in the range of 10&amp;amp;minus;7 M that were statistically different (&amp;amp;alpha; = 0.01) across these brain regions. Conclusion: Our healthy human study showed the feasibility of fNIRS of cerebellum and PFC and closed-loop fNIRS-driven ctACS at 4 Hz, which may facilitate cerebellar cognitive function via the frontoparietal network. Future work needs to combine fNIRS with EEG for multi-modal imaging for closed-loop NIBS during operant conditioning.</p>

	<p>Introduction/Aim. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of cognitive impairments and their association with sleep patterns in a cohort of patients diagnosed with chronic liver disease (CLD). Material and methods. The present paper is a prospective cohort study, carried out over a period of 12 months, among patients with various stages of CLD. We evaluated the cognitive function through psychometric hepatic encephalopathy score (PHES), while sleep was assessed by actigraphy and two self-reported questionnaires: Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Results. Seventy-four patients with CLD were considered eligible and were enrolled between December 2020&amp;amp;ndash;November 2021. The prevalence of minimal hepatic encephalopathy (MHE) in the entire cohort was 41.9%, and the diagnosis was considered for PHES scores &amp;amp;le; &amp;amp;minus;3. Patients with cirrhosis recorded significantly lower PHES scores compared to patients with other CLDs but without cirrhosis (&amp;amp;minus;3.19 &amp;amp;plusmn; 3.89 vs. 0.19 &amp;amp;plusmn; 2.92, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). Patients who exhibited MHE suffered from poor sleep, daytime somnolence, disturbed nighttime sleep, and low overall sleep efficacy. Patients diagnosed with MHE and undergoing treatment with lactulose and/or rifaximin for prevention of overt hepatic encephalopathy (HE) showed better results in terms of sleep parameters compared to patients diagnosed with MHE but without treatment. Conclusions. This research increases awareness regarding the connection between sleep features and MHE in patients with cirrhosis and other CLDs. A deeper insight into the subclinical stages of HE and associated sleep disturbances is warranted in future studies.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Whole genome sequencing and gene sharing network analysis powered by machine learning identifies antibiotic resistance sharing between animals, humans and environment in livestock farming</a></h4>

Anthropogenic environments such as those created by intensive farming of livestock, have been proposed to provide ideal selection pressure for the emergence of antimicrobial-resistant <i>Escherichia coli</i> bacteria and antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) and spread to humans. Here, we performed a longitudinal study in a large-scale commercial poultry farm in China, collecting <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> isolates from both farm and slaughterhouse; targeting animals, carcasses, workers and their households and environment. By using whole-genome phylogenetic analysis and network analysis based on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), we found highly interrelated non-pathogenic and pathogenic <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> strains with phylogenetic intermixing, and a high prevalence of shared multidrug resistance profiles amongst livestock, human and environment. Through an original data processing pipeline which combines omics, machine learning, gene sharing network and mobile genetic elements analysis, we investigated the resistance to 26 different antimicrobials and identified 361 genes associated to AR phenotypes; 58 of these were known AMR-associated genes and 35 were associated to multidrug resistance. We uncovered an extensive network of genes, correlated to AMR phenotypes, shared among livestock, humans, farm and slaughterhouse environments. We also found several human, livestock and environmental isolates sharing closely related mobile genetic elements carrying AR genes across host species and environments. In a scenario where no consensus exists on how antibiotic use in the livestock may affect antibiotic resistance in the human population, our findings provide novel insights into the broader epidemiology of antimicrobial resistance in livestock farming. Moreover, our original data analysis method has the potential to uncover AR transmission pathways when applied to the study of other pathogens active in other anthropogenic environments characterised by complex interconnections between host species.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Assessing the best time interval between doses in a two-dose vaccination regimen to reduce the number of deaths in an ongoing epidemic of SARS-CoV-2</a></h4>

The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is a major concern all over the world and, as vaccines became available at the end of 2020, optimal vaccination strategies were subjected to intense investigation. Considering their critical role in reducing disease burden, the increasing demand outpacing production, and that most currently approved vaccines follow a two-dose regimen, the cost-effectiveness of delaying the second dose to increment the coverage of the population receiving the first dose is often debated. Finding the best solution is complex due to the trade-off between vaccinating more people with lower level of protection and guaranteeing higher protection to a fewer number of individuals. Here we present a novel extended age-structured SEIR mathematical model that includes a two-dose vaccination schedule with a between-doses delay modelled through delay differential equations and linear optimization of vaccination rates. By maintaining the minimum stock of vaccines under a given production rate, we evaluate the dose interval that minimizes the number of deaths. We found that the best strategy depends on an interplay between the vaccine production rate and the relative efficacy of the first dose. In the scenario of low first-dose efficacy, it is always better to vaccinate the second dose as soon as possible, while for high first-dose efficacy, the best strategy of time window depends on the production rate and also on second-dose efficacy provided by each type of vaccine. We also found that the rate of spread of the infection does not affect significantly the thresholds of the best window, but is an important factor in the absolute number of total deaths. These conclusions point to the need to carefully take into account both vaccine characteristics and roll-out speed to optimize the outcome of vaccination strategies.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Mining folded proteomes in the era of accurate structure prediction</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Charles Bayly-Jones, James C. Whisstock</p>

Protein structure fundamentally underpins the function and processes of numerous biological systems. Fold recognition algorithms offer a sensitive and robust tool to detect structural, and thereby functional, similarities between distantly related homologs. In the era of accurate structure prediction owing to advances in machine learning techniques and a wealth of experimentally determined structures, previously curated sequence databases have become a rich source of biological information. Here, we use bioinformatic fold recognition algorithms to scan the entire AlphaFold structure database to identify novel protein family members, infer function and group predicted protein structures. As an example of the utility of this approach, we identify novel, previously unknown members of various pore-forming protein families, including MACPFs, GSDMs and aerolysin-like proteins.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Minimal cross-trial generalization in learning the representation of an odor-guided choice task</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Mingyu Song, Yuji K. Takahashi, Amanda C. Burton, Matthew R. Roesch, Geoffrey Schoenbaum, Yael Niv, Angela J. Langdon</p>

There is no single way to represent a task. Indeed, despite experiencing the same task events and contingencies, different subjects may form distinct task representations. As experimenters, we often assume that subjects represent the task as we envision it. However, such a representation cannot be taken for granted, especially in animal experiments where we cannot deliver explicit instruction regarding the structure of the task. Here, we tested how rats represent an odor-guided choice task in which two odor cues indicated which of two responses would lead to reward, whereas a third odor indicated free choice among the two responses. A parsimonious task representation would allow animals to learn from the forced trials what is the better option to choose in the free-choice trials. However, animals may not necessarily generalize across odors in this way. We fit reinforcement-learning models that use different task representations to trial-by-trial choice behavior of individual rats performing this task, and quantified the degree to which each animal used the more parsimonious representation, generalizing across trial types. Model comparison revealed that most rats did not acquire this representation despite extensive experience. Our results demonstrate the importance of formally testing possible task representations that can afford the observed behavior, rather than assuming that animals’ task representations abide by the generative task structure that governs the experimental design.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Dynamic proton-dependent motors power type IX secretion and gliding motility in Flavobacterium</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Maxence S. Vincent, Caterina Comas Hervada, Corinne Sebban-Kreuzer, Hugo Le Guenno, Maïalène Chabalier, Artemis Kosta, Françoise Guerlesquin, Tâm Mignot, Mark J. McBride, Eric Cascales, Thierry Doan</p>

Motile bacteria usually rely on external apparatus like flagella for swimming or pili for twitching. By contrast, gliding bacteria do not rely on obvious surface appendages to move on solid surfaces. <i>Flavobacterium johnsoniae</i> and other bacteria in the Bacteroidetes phylum use adhesins whose movement on the cell surface supports motility. In <i>F</i>. <i>johnsoniae</i>, secretion and helicoidal motion of the main adhesin SprB are intimately linked and depend on the type IX secretion system (T9SS). Both processes necessitate the proton motive force (PMF), which is thought to fuel a molecular motor that comprises the GldL and GldM cytoplasmic membrane proteins. Here, we show that <i>F</i>. <i>johnsoniae</i> gliding motility is powered by the pH gradient component of the PMF. We further delineate the interaction network between the GldLM transmembrane helices (TMHs) and show that conserved glutamate residues in GldL TMH are essential for gliding motility, although having distinct roles in SprB secretion and motion. We then demonstrate that the PMF and GldL trigger conformational changes in the GldM periplasmic domain. We finally show that multiple GldLM complexes are distributed in the membrane, suggesting that a network of motors may be present to move SprB along a helical path on the cell surface. Altogether, our results provide evidence that GldL and GldM assemble dynamic membrane channels that use the proton gradient to power both T9SS-dependent secretion of SprB and its motion at the cell surface.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Boosting targeted genome editing using the hei-tag</a></h4>

              
                Precise, targeted genome editing by CRISPR/Cas9 is key for basic research and translational approaches in model and non-model systems. While active in all species tested so far, editing efficiencies still leave room for improvement. The bacterial Cas9 needs to be efficiently shuttled into the nucleus as attempted by fusion with nuclear localization signals (NLSs). Additional peptide tags such as FLAG- or myc-tags are usually added for immediate detection or straight-forward purification. Immediate activity is usually granted by administration of pre-assembled protein/RNA complexes. We present the 'hei-tag (<span class="underline">h</span>igh <span class="underline">e</span>ff<span class="underline">i</span>ciency-tag)' which boosts the activity of CRISPR/Cas genome editing tools already when supplied as mRNA. The addition of the hei-tag, a myc tag coupled to an optimized NLS via a flexible linker, to Cas9 or a C-to-T base editor dramatically enhances the respective targeting efficiency. This results in an increase in bi-allelic editing, yet reduction of allele variance, indicating an immediate activity even at early developmental stages. The hei-tag boost is active in model systems ranging from fish to mammals, including tissue culture applications. The simple addition of the hei-tag allows to instantly upgrade existing and potentially highly adapted systems as well as to establish novel highly efficient tools immediately applicable at the mRNA level.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">AP-2α and AP-2β cooperatively function in the craniofacial surface ectoderm to regulate chromatin and gene expression dynamics during facial development</a></h4>

              
                The facial surface ectoderm is essential for normal development of the underlying cranial neural crest cell populations, providing signals that direct appropriate growth, patterning, and morphogenesis. Despite the importance of the ectoderm as a signaling center, the molecular cues and genetic programs implemented within this tissue are understudied. Here we show that removal of two members of the AP-2 transcription factor family, AP-2α and AP-2ß, within the early embryonic ectoderm of the mouse leads to major alterations in the craniofacial complex. Significantly, there are clefts in both the upper face and mandible, accompanied by fusion of the upper and lower jaws in the hinge region. Comparison of ATAC-seq and RNA-seq analyses between controls and mutants revealed significant changes in chromatin accessibility and gene expression centered on multiple AP-2 binding motifs associated with enhancer elements within these ectodermal lineages. In particular, loss of these AP-2 proteins affects both skin differentiation as well as multiple signaling pathways, most notably the WNT pathway. We also determined that the mutant clefting phenotypes that correlated with reduced WNT signaling could be rescued by <i>Wnt1</i> ligand overexpression in the ectoderm. Collectively, these findings highlight a conserved ancestral function for AP-2 transcription factors in ectodermal development and signaling, and provide a framework from which to understand the gene regulatory network operating within this tissue that directs vertebrate craniofacial development.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Glutathione binding to the plant AtAtm3 transporter and implications for the conformational coupling of ABC transporters</a></h4>

              
                The ATP Binding Cassette (ABC) transporter of mitochondria (Atm) from <i>Arabidopsis thaliana </i>(<i>At</i>Atm3) has been implicated in the maturation of cytosolic iron-sulfur proteins and heavy metal detoxification, plausibly by exporting glutathione derivatives. Using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy, we have determined four structures of <i>At</i>Atm3 in three different conformational states: two inward-facing conformations (with and without bound oxidized glutathione (GSSG)), together with closed and outward-facing states stabilized by MgADP-VO<sub>4</sub>. These structures not only provide a structural framework for defining the alternating access transport cycle, but also reveal the paucity of cysteine residues in the glutathione binding site that could potentially form inhibitory mixed disulfides with GSSG. Despite extensive efforts, we were unable to prepare the ternary complex of <i>At</i>Atm3 containing both GSSG and MgATP. A survey of structurally characterized type IV ABC transporters that includes <i>At</i>Atm3 establishes that while nucleotides are found associated with all conformational states, they are effectively required to stabilize occluded, closed, and outward-facing conformations. In contrast, transport substrates have only been observed associated with inward-facing conformations. The absence of structures with dimerized nucleotide binding domains containing both nucleotide and transport substrate suggests that this form of the ternary complex exists only transiently during the transport cycle.

                Spike timing-dependent plasticity, related to differential Hebb-rules, has become a leading paradigm in neuronal learning, because weights can grow or shrink depending on the timing of pre- and post-synaptic signals. Here we use this paradigm to reduce unwanted (acoustic) noise. Our system relies on heterosynaptic differential Hebbian learning and we show that it can efficiently eliminate noise by up to -140~dB in multi-microphone setups under various conditions. The system quickly learns, most often within a few seconds, and it is robust with respect to different geometrical microphone configurations, too. Hence, this theoretical study demonstrates that it is possible to successfully transfer differential Hebbian learning, derived from the neurosciences, into a technical domain.

                The myelinated white matter tracts of the central nervous system (CNS) are essential for fast transmission of electrical impulses and are commonly affected in neurodegenerative diseases. However, these often uniquely human diseases differentially affect white matter regions, at various ages and between males and females, and we hypothesised that this is secondary to physiological variation in white matter glia with region, age and sex. Using single nucleus RNA sequencing of healthy human post-mortem samples, we find marked glial heterogeneity with tissue region (primary motor cortex, cerebellum, cervical spinal cord), with tissue-specific cell populations of oligodendrocyte precursor cells and astrocytes, and a spinal cord-enriched oligodendrocyte type that appears human-specific. Spinal cord microglia but not astrocytes show a more activated phenotype compared to brain. These regional effects, with additional differentially expressed genes with age and sex in all glial lineages, help explain pathological patterns of disease, essential knowledge for therapeutic strategies.

                Gap junctions and electrical synapses in the central nervous system are associated with rapid temporal processing and coincidence detection. Using histology, immunohistochemistry, and in situ hybridization, we investigated the distribution of Connexin36 (Cx36), a protein that comprises neuronal gap junctions, throughout the cochlear nucleus complex of the echolocating big brown bat, Eptesicus fuscus, a species exhibiting extreme behavioral sensitivity to minute temporal changes in ultrasonic echoes. For comparison, we visualized Cx36 expression in the cochlear nucleus of transgenic Cx36 reporter mice, species that hear ultrasound but do not echolocate. We observed Cx36 expression in the anteroventral and dorsal cochlear nucleus, with more limited expression in the posteroventral cochlear nucleus, of both species. Several different morphological cell types were labeled, including globular and spherical bushy, octopus, stellate, and fusiform cells. Labeled Cx36 puncta were also observed. Cx36 expression in the bat was spread throughout a relatively smaller area of the cochlear nucleus than in the mouse, even though the bat cochlear nucleus is hypertrophied. In the bat, the anteroventral cochlear nucleus showed higher percent area label than the dorsal cochlear nucleus, with a trend towards the opposite result in the mouse. The presence of gap junctions appears to be a conserved feature of the mammalian cochlear nucleus and thus not uniquely tied to the temporal hyperacuity of echolocation.

                The pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with the extracellular amyloid-{beta}(A{beta}) plaques that perturb the mechanical properties of brain tissue. Microglia sense and integrate biochemical cues in their local microenvironment, intimate linking with AD progress. However, neither the microglial mechanosensing pathway nor its impact on AD pathogenesis is well studied. Here, we showed that the mechanosensitive ion channel Piezo1 is increased in microglia upon stiffness stimuli of A{beta} fibrils. The upregulation of Piezo1 in A{beta} plaque-associated microglia was observed in AD mouse models and human patients. Microglia lacking Piezo1 disturbed microglial clustering, phagocytosis, and compaction of A{beta} plaques, resulting in the exacerbation of A{beta} and neurodegenerative pathologies in AD. Conversely, pharmacological activation of Piezo1 ameliorated brain A{beta} burden and cognitive impairment in the 5xFAD mouse. Together, our results reveal Piezo1, as a mechanosensor of A{beta} fibrils stiffness in microglia, could represent a promising therapeutic target for AD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The Rise and Fall of Slow Wave Tides: Vacillations of Slow Wave/Spindle Coupling Shift the Composition of Slow Wave Activity Through Sleep Cycles in Accordance with Depth of Sleep</a></h4>

              
                Slow wave activity (SWA) during sleep is associated with synaptic regulation and memory processing functions. Each cycle of non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep demonstrates a waxing and waning amount of SWA during the transitions between stages N2 and N3 sleep, and the deeper N3 sleep is associated with an increased density of SWA. Further, SWA is an amalgam of different types of slow waves, each identifiable by their temporal coupling to spindle subtypes with distinct physiological features. The objectives of this study were to better understand the neurobiological properties that distinguish different slow wave and spindle subtypes, and to examine the composition of SWA across cycles of NREM sleep. We further sought to explore changes in the composition of NREM cycles that occur among aging adults. To address these goals, we analyzed subsets of data from two well-characterized cohorts of healthy adults: 1) The DREAMS Subjects Database (n=20), and 2) The Cleveland Family Study (n=60). Our analyses indicate that slow wave/spindle coupled events can be characterized as frontal versus central in their relative distribution between electroencephalography (EEG) channels. The frontal predominant slow waves are identifiable by their coupling to late-fast spindles and occur more frequently during stage N3 sleep. Conversely, the central-associated slow waves are identified by coupling to early-fast spindles and favor occurrence during stage N2 sleep. Together, both types of slow wave/spindle coupled events form the composite of SWA, and their relative contribution to the SWA rises and falls across cycles of NREM sleep in accordance with depth of sleep. Exploratory analyses indicated that older adults produce a different composition of SWA, with a shift toward the N3, frontal subtype, which becomes increasingly predominant during cycles of NREM sleep. Overall, these data demonstrate that subtypes of slow wave/spindle events have distinct cortical propagation patterns and differ in their distribution across lighter versus deeper NREM sleep. Future efforts to understand how slow wave sleep and slow wave/spindle coupling impact memory performance and neurological disease may benefit from examining the composition of SWA to avoid potential confounds that may occur when comparing dissimilar neurophysiological events.

                Many social species are embedded on social networks, including our own. The structure of social networks shapes our decisions by constraining what information we learn and from whom. But how does the brain incorporate social network structures into learning and decision-making processes, and how does learning in networked environments differ from learning from isolated partners? Combining a real-time distributed learning task with computational modeling, fMRI, and social network analysis, we investigated the process by which humans learn from observing others' decisions on 7-node networks with varying topological structures. We show that learning on social networks can be realized by means similar to the well-established reinforcement learning algorithm, supported by an action prediction error encoded in the lateral prefrontal cortex. Importantly, learning is flexibly weighted toward well-connected neighbors, according to activity in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, but only insofar as neighbors' actions vary in their informativeness. These data suggest a neurocomputational mechanism of network-dependent filtering on the sources of information, which may give rise to biased learning and the spread of misinformation in an interconnected society.

                Quadripulse stimulation (QPS) is a promising patterned repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation protocol, which allows the modulation of brain activity for over one hour after the stimulation. Recently, Deymed Diagnostic developed a new stimulator specifically designed to deliver QPS (DuoMAG MP-Quad, https://deymed.com/duomag-qps). The properties of the after-effect with this new stimulator were expected to parallel those obtained with another stimulator, the Magstim stimulator, which is currently used in the psychological and clinical research but not commercially available anymore. Nevertheless, experimental validation of DuoMAG MP-Quad was still warranted. We thus studied the QPS after-effect induced by this stimulator. As a result, motor evoked potentials were found to be bidirectionally modulated by the QPS for more than one hour, consistent with previous studies using the Magstim stimulator. Moreover, the degree of the after-effect was comparable to the after-effect induced by the other stimulator. Taken together, we conclude that the newly developed QPS stimulator is as effective as the Magstim stimulator.

                Mixed affective states in bipolar disorder is a common psychiatric condition that occurs when symptoms of the two opposite poles coexist during an episode of mania or depression. There exist many strategies to attempt to model the mood variations of patients with bipolar disorder (BD) as recently reviewed in [14]. A four dimensional model by A. Goldbeter [28, 29] rests upon the notion that manic and depressive symptoms are produced by two competing and auto-inhibited neural networks. Some of the rich dynamics that this model can produce, include complex rhythms formed by both small-amplitude (subthreshold) and large-amplitude (suprathreshold) oscillations and could correspond to mixed bipolar states. These rhythms are commonly referred to as mixed mode oscillations (MMOs) and they have already been studied in different contexts ranging from neurons' electrical activity [7] to oscillatory chemical reactions [51]. In order to accurately explain these dynamics one has to apply a mathematical apparatus that is making full use of the timescale separation between variables. Here we apply this very framework to the model of BD from [28,29] in order to understand the mathematical mechanisms underpinning the observed dynamics of changing mood using multiple-timescale dynamics. We show that the observed complex oscillations can be understood as MMOs due to a so-called folded-node singularity. Moreover we explore the bifurcation structure of the system with respect to two meaningful parameters and we provide possible biological interpretations of our findings. Furthermore, we show the possibility of deterministic chaos in this system and the robustness of the MMOs regime to stochastic noise. Finally, we propose a reduction of the original 4D model to a minimal three-dimensional model which, with the addition of noise, exhibits similar yet purely noise-driven dynamics. The broader significance of this work is to introduce mathematical tools that could be used to analyse and potentially control future, more biologically grounded models of BD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Two mosquito odorant receptors with reciprocal specificity mediated by a single amino acid residue</a></h4>

              
                Insects perceive the environment with a repertoire of promiscuous and narrowly tuned odorant receptors (ORs). The southern house mosquito, Culex quinquefasciatus, utilizes two ORs, CquiOR10 and CquiOR2, which are narrowly tuned and well conserved among mosquito species. They detect the oviposition attractants skatole and indole, respectively, with reciprocal specificity. We envisioned that by reverting specificity with chimeric receptors, we could gain a better insight into the specificity determinants of insect ORs. We swapped the seven transmembrane (TM) domains of CquiOR10 and CquiOR2 and identified TM2 as a specificity determinant. With additional mutations, we showed that CquiOR10A73L behaved like CquiOR2. Conversely, CquiOR2L74A recapitulated CquiOR10 specificity. Next, we generated structural models of CquiOR10 and CquiOR10A73L using RoseTTAFold and AlphaFold and docked skatole and indole using RosettaLigand. These modeling studies suggested space-filling constraints around A73, although this residue in CquiOR10 did not directly form contacts with skatole or indole. Consistent with this hypothesis, CquiOR10 mutants with a bulkier residue (Ile, Val) were insensitive to skatole and indole, whereas CquiOR10A73G retained the specificity to skatole and showed a higher sensitivity than the wild-type receptor CquiOR10. On the other hand, Leu to Gly mutation of the indole receptor CquiOR2 reverted the specificity to skatole. Lastly, CquiOR10 was insensitive to 3-ethylindole, whereas CquiOR10A73G responded to the three ligands with 3-ethylindole eliciting a slightly higher response than indole. We then concluded that the specificity of these receptors is mediated by a single amino acid substitution leading to dilation or contraction of the binding pocket.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Increased fatty acid metabolism and decreased glycolysis are hallmarks of metabolic reprogramming in the brain during recovery from experimental stroke</a></h4>

              
                The goal of this study was to evaluate changes in metabolic homeostasis during the first 12 weeks of recovery in a distal middle cerebral artery occlusion mouse model of stroke. To achieve this goal, we compared the brain metabolomes of ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres from aged male mice up to 12 weeks after stroke to that of age-matched naive and sham operated mice. There were 707 biochemicals detected in each sample by liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy (LC-MS). Mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation, indicated by acyl carnitine levels, was increased in stroked tissue at 1 day and 4 weeks following stroke. Glucose and several glycolytic intermediates were elevated in the ipsilateral hemisphere for 12 weeks compared to the aged naive controls, but pyruvate was decreased. Additionally, itaconate, a glycolysis inhibitor associated with activation of anti-inflammatory mechanisms in myeloid cells, was higher in the same comparisons. These changes correlated with reduced levels of glutamate, dopamine, and adenosine in the ipsilateral hemisphere after stroke. These results indicate that chronic metabolic differences exist between stroked and control tissue, including alterations in fatty acid metabolism and glycolysis for at least 12 weeks after stroke.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Particle-Swarm Based Modelling Reveals Two Distinct Classes of CRHPVN Neurons</a></h4>

              
                Electrophysiological recordings can provide detailed information of single neurons' dynamical features and shed light into their response to stimuli. Unfortunately, rapidly modeling electrophysiological data for inferring network-level behaviours remains challenging. Here, we investigate how modeled single neuron dynamics lead to network-level responses in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN), a critical nucleus for the mammalian stress response. Recordings of corticotropin releasing hormone neurons from the PVN (CRHPVN) were performed using whole-cell current-clamp. These, neurons, which initiate the endocrine response to stress, were rapidly and automatically fit to a modified Adaptive Exponential Integrate and Fire model (AdEx) with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). All CRHPVN neurons were accurately fit by the AdEx model with PSO. Multiple sets of parameters were found that reliably reproduced current clamp traces for any single neuron. Despite multiple solutions, the dynamical features of the models such as the rheobase current levels, fixed points, and bifurcations, were shown to be stable across fits. We found that CRHPVN neurons can be divided into two sub types according to their bifurcation at the onset of firing: saddles (integrators) and sub-critical Hopf (resonators). We constructed networks of these fit CRHPVN model neurons to investigate the network level responses of CRHPVN neurons. We found that CRHPVN-resonators maintain baseline firing in networks even when all inputs are inhibitory. The dynamics of a small subset of CRHPVN neurons may be critical to maintaining a baseline firing tone in the PVN.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural activity in the anterior cingulate cortex is required for effort-based decision making</a></h4>

              
                Adaptive decision making requires the evaluation of cost-benefit tradeoffs to guide action selection. Effort-based decision making involves weighing predicted gains against effort costs and is disrupted in several neuropsychiatric disorders. The ACC is postulated to control effort-base choice via its role in encoding the value of overcoming effort costs in rodent effort-based decision making assays. However, temporally precise methods of manipulating neural activity have rarely been applied to effort-based decision making. We developed and validated a mouse version of the barrier T-maze, and used optogenetics to inhibit ACC excitatory neurons at specific times during this task. Bilateral inhibition of ACC rapidly and reversibly impaired preference to exert greater effort for a larger reward when a less rewarded, low effort alternative was available. Equalizing effort for potential choice options led mice to choose the high reward arm of the maze regardless of whether the ACC was inhibited or not. The mechanics of choice behavior were altered during trials where the ACC was inhibited, but there were no effects on overall mobility or tendency to exert effort in an unrelated assay. These findings establish causality between ACC neural activity during a choice trial and effortful action selection during cost-benefit decision making.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Prenatal methadone exposure leads to long-term memory impairments and disruptions of dentate granule cell function in a sex-dependent manner</a></h4>

              
                Prenatal opioid exposures lead to extensive cognitive and emotion-regulation problems in children, persisting at least through school-age. Methadone, an opioid typically used for the treatment of opioid use disorder, has been approved for use in pregnant women for several decades. Importantly, however, the impacts of prenatal methadone exposure (PME), particularly on offspring as they progress into adulthood, has not been extensively examined. In recent years, children and young animal models have shown cognitive deficits related to PME, including evidence of hippocampal dysfunction. The present work aims to examine the persistent nature of these deficits, as well as determine how they may differ by sex. Pregnant Sprague Dawley rats either received subcutaneous methadone or water injections twice daily from gestational days 3-20 or were left undisturbed. Following postnatal day 70, male and female offspring were behaviorally tested for impairments in recognition memory using the Novel Object Recognition task and working spatial memory through Spontaneous Alternation. Additionally, using whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology, hippocampal dentate granule cell function was examined in adult offspring. Results indicate that methadone-exposed females showed decreased excitability and increased inhibition of these dentate granule cells, while males did not. These findings were accompanied by impairments in female working spatial memory and impaired recognition memory of both sexes. Overall, this work supports the continued investigation of the long-term effects of PME on adult male and female learning and memory, as well as promotes further exploration of adult hippocampal function as a neural mechanism impacted by this exposure.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cellular Mechanisms Underlying Central Sensitization in a Mouse Model of Chronic Muscle Pain</a></h4>

              
                Chronic pain disorders are often associated with psychiatric symptoms. The central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) has emerged as an integrative hub for nociceptive and affective components during the development of central pain. Although the exact cause for this process remains unknown, prior adverse injuries are precipitating factors and thought to transform nociceptors into a primed state for chronic pain. However, the cellular basis underlying the primed state and the subsequent pain chronification remains unknown. Here, we investigated cellular and synaptic alterations of the CeA in a mouse model of chronic muscle pain. In these mice, local infusion of pregabalin, a clinically approved drug for fibromyalgia and other chronic pain disorders, into the CeA or selective inactivation of somatostatin-expressing CeA (CeA-SST) neurons during the priming phase prevented pain chronification. Further, electrophysiological recording revealed that CeA-SST neurons received increased excitatory transmission and showed enhanced excitability in chronic pain states. In line with the possible role of CeA-SST neurons in central sensitization, chemogenetic inactivation of CeA-SST neurons or pharmacological suppression of nociceptive afferents from the brainstem to CeA-SST neurons by pregabalin after the development of chronic muscle pain alleviated pain and negative emotions.

	<p>Hypersexuality is related to functions of personality and emotion and is a salient symptom of bipolar I disorder especially during manic episode. However, it is uncertain whether bipolar I disorder with (BW) and without (BO) hypersexuality exhibits different cerebral activations under external emotion stimuli. In 54 healthy volunteers, 27 BW and 26 BO patients, we administered the visual oddball event-related potentials (ERPs) under external emotions of Disgust, Erotica, Fear, Happiness, Neutral, and Sadness. Participants&amp;amp;rsquo; concurrent states of mania, hypomania, and depression were also evaluated. The N1 latencies under Erotica and Happiness were prolonged, and the P3b amplitudes under Fear and Sadness were decreased in BW; the P3b amplitudes under Fear were increased in BO. The parietal, frontal, and occipital activations were found in BW, and the frontal and temporal activations in BO under different external emotional stimuli, respectively. Some ERP components were correlated with the concurrent affective states in three groups of participants. The primary perception under Erotica and Happiness, and voluntary attention under Fear and Sadness, were impaired in BW, while the voluntary attention under Fear was impaired in BO. Our study indicates different patterns of visual attentional deficits under different external emotions in BW and BO.</p>

	<p>Sleep and Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) have repeatedly been found to be associated with each other. However, the ecological validity of daily life studies to examine the effect of sleep on ADHD symptoms is rarely made use of. In an ambulatory assessment study with measurement burst design, consisting of three bursts (each 6 months apart) of 18 days each, 70 German schoolchildren aged 10&amp;amp;ndash;12 years reported on their sleep quality each morning and on their subjective ADHD symptom levels as well as their sleepiness three times a day. It was hypothesized that nightly sleep quality is negatively associated with ADHD symptoms on the inter- as well as the intraindividual level. Thus, we expected children who sleep better to report higher attention and self-regulation. Additionally, sleepiness during the day was hypothesized to be positively associated with ADHD symptoms on both levels, meaning that when children are sleepier, they experience more ADHD symptoms. No association of sleep quality and ADHD symptoms between or within participants was found in multilevel analyses; also, no connection was found between ADHD symptoms and daytime sleepiness on the interindividual level. Unexpectedly, a negative association was found on the intraindividual level for ADHD symptoms and daytime sleepiness, indicating that in moments when children are sleepier during the day, they experience less ADHD symptoms. Explorative analyses showed differential links of nightly sleep quality and daytime sleepiness, with the core symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity, respectively. Therefore, future analyses should take the factor structure of ADHD symptoms into account.</p>

	<p>More than a decade ago, deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the superolateral medial forebrain bundle (slMFB), as part of the greater MFB system, had been proposed as a putative yet experimental treatment strategy for therapy refractory depression (TRD) and later for obsessive&amp;amp;ndash;compulsive disorders (OCD). Antidepressant and anti-OCD efficacy have been shown in open case series and smaller trials and were independently replicated. The MFB is anato-physiologically confluent with the SEEKING system promoting euphoric drive, reward anticipation and reward; functions realized through the mesocorticolimbic dopaminergic system. Growing clinical experience concerning surgical and stimulation aspects from a larger number of patients shows an MFB functionality beyond SEEKING and now re-informs the scientific rationale concerning the MFB&amp;amp;rsquo;s (patho-) physiology. In this white paper, we combine observations from more than 75 cases of slMFB DBS. We integrate these observations with a selected literature review to provide a new neuroethological view on the MFB. We here formulate a re-interpretation of the MFB as the main structure of an integrated SEEKING/MAINTENANCE circuitry, allowing for individual homeostasis and well-being through emotional arousal, basic and higher affect valence, bodily reactions, motor programing, vigor and flexible behavior, as the basis for the antidepressant and anti-OCD efficacy.</p>

	<p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and schizophrenia (SZ) are neuropsychiatric disorders that overlap in symptoms associated with social-cognitive impairment. Subcortical structures play a significant role in cognitive and social-emotional behaviors and their abnormalities are associated with neuropsychiatric conditions. This exploratory study utilized ABIDE II/COBRE MRI and corresponding phenotypic datasets to compare subcortical volumes of adults with ASD (n = 29), SZ (n = 51) and age and gender matched neurotypicals (NT). We examined the association between subcortical volumes and select behavioral measures to determine whether core symptomatology of disorders could be explained by subcortical association patterns. We observed volume differences in ASD (viz., left pallidum, left thalamus, left accumbens, right amygdala) but not in SZ compared to their respective NT controls, reflecting morphometric changes specific to one of the disorder groups. However, left hippocampus and amygdala volumes were implicated in both disorders. A disorder-specific negative correlation (r = &amp;amp;minus;0.39, p = 0.038) was found between left-amygdala and scores on the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) Social-Cognition in ASD, and a positive association (r = 0.29, p = 0.039) between full scale IQ (FIQ) and right caudate in SZ. Significant correlations between behavior measures and subcortical volumes were observed in NT groups (ASD-NT range; r = &amp;amp;minus;0.53 to &amp;amp;minus;0.52, p = 0.002 to 0.004, SZ-NT range; r = &amp;amp;minus;0.41 to &amp;amp;minus;0.32, p = 0.007 to 0.021) that were non-significant in the disorder groups. The overlap of subcortical volumes implicated in ASD and SZ may reflect common neurological mechanisms. Furthermore, the difference in correlation patterns between disorder and NT groups may suggest dysfunctional connectivity with cascading effects unique to each disorder and a potential role for IQ in mediating behavior and brain circuits.</p>

	<p>Already in newborns, the locus coeruleus (LC) controls multiple brain functions and may have a complex organization as in adults. Our findings in newborn rat brain slices indicate that LC neurons (i) generate at ~1 Hz a ~0.3 s-lasting local field potential (LFP) comprising summated phase-locked single spike discharge, (ii) express intrinsic &amp;amp;lsquo;pacemaker&amp;amp;rsquo; or &amp;amp;lsquo;burster&amp;amp;rsquo; properties and (iii) receive solely excitatory or initially excitatory&amp;amp;ndash;secondary inhibitory inputs. &amp;amp;mu;-opioid or &amp;amp;#593;2 noradrenaline receptor agonists block LFP rhythm at 100&amp;amp;ndash;250 nM whereas slightly lower doses transform its bell-shaped pattern into slower crescendo-shaped multipeak bursts. GABAA and glycine receptors hyperpolarize LC neurons to abolish rhythm which remains though unaffected by blocking them. Rhythm persists also during ionotropic glutamate receptor (iGluR) inhibition whereas &amp;amp;lt;10 mV depolarization during iGluR agonists accelerates spiking to cause subtype-specific fast (spindle-shaped) LFP oscillations. Similar modest neuronal depolarization causing a cytosolic Ca2+ rise occurs (without effect on neighboring astrocytes) during LFP acceleration by CNQX activating a TARP-AMPA-type iGluR complex. In contrast, noradrenaline lowers neuronal Ca2+ baseline via &amp;amp;#593;2 receptors, but evokes an &amp;amp;#593;1 receptor-mediated &amp;amp;lsquo;concentric&amp;amp;rsquo; astrocytic Ca2+ wave. In summary, the neonatal LC has a complex (possibly modular) organization to enable discharge pattern transformations that might facilitate discrete actions on target circuits.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Fast protein structure comparison through effective representation learning with contrastive graph neural networks</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Chunqiu Xia, Shi-Hao Feng, Ying Xia, Xiaoyong Pan, Hong-Bin Shen</p>

Protein structure alignment algorithms are often time-consuming, resulting in challenges for large-scale protein structure similarity-based retrieval. There is an urgent need for more efficient structure comparison approaches as the number of protein structures increases rapidly. In this paper, we propose an effective graph-based protein structure representation learning method, GraSR, for fast and accurate structure comparison. In GraSR, a graph is constructed based on the intra-residue distance derived from the tertiary structure. Then, deep graph neural networks (GNNs) with a short-cut connection learn graph representations of the tertiary structures under a contrastive learning framework. To further improve GraSR, a novel dynamic training data partition strategy and length-scaling cosine distance are introduced. We objectively evaluate our method GraSR on SCOPe v2.07 and a new released independent test set from PDB database with a designed comprehensive performance metric. Compared with other state-of-the-art methods, GraSR achieves about 7%-10% improvement on two benchmark datasets. GraSR is also much faster than alignment-based methods. We dig into the model and observe that the superiority of GraSR is mainly brought by the learned discriminative residue-level and global descriptors. The web-server and source code of GraSR are freely available at www.csbio.sjtu.edu.cn/bioinf/GraSR/ for academic use.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Oscillator decomposition of infant fNIRS data</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Takeru Matsuda, Fumitaka Homae, Hama Watanabe, Gentaro Taga, Fumiyasu Komaki</p>

The functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) can detect hemodynamic responses in the brain and the data consist of bivariate time series of oxygenated hemoglobin (oxy-Hb) and deoxygenated hemoglobin (deoxy-Hb) on each channel. In this study, we investigate oscillatory changes in infant fNIRS signals by using the oscillator decompisition method (OSC-DECOMP), which is a statistical method for extracting oscillators from time series data based on Gaussian linear state space models. OSC-DECOMP provides a natural decomposition of fNIRS data into oscillation components in a data-driven manner and does not require the arbitrary selection of band-pass filters. We analyzed 18-ch fNIRS data (3 minutes) acquired from 21 sleeping 3-month-old infants. Five to seven oscillators were extracted on most channels, and their frequency distribution had three peaks in the vicinity of 0.01-0.1 Hz, 1.6-2.4 Hz and 3.6-4.4 Hz. The first peak was considered to reflect hemodynamic changes in response to the brain activity, and the phase difference between oxy-Hb and deoxy-Hb for the associated oscillators was at approximately 230 degrees. The second peak was attributed to cardiac pulse waves and mirroring noise. Although these oscillators have close frequencies, OSC-DECOMP can separate them through estimating their different projection patterns on oxy-Hb and deoxy-Hb. The third peak was regarded as the harmonic of the second peak. By comparing the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) of two state space models, we determined that the time series of oxy-Hb and deoxy-Hb on each channel originate from common oscillatory activity. We also utilized the result of OSC-DECOMP to investigate the frequency-specific functional connectivity. Whereas the brain oscillator exhibited functional connectivity, the pulse waves and mirroring noise oscillators showed spatially homogeneous and independent changes. OSC-DECOMP is a promising tool for data-driven extraction of oscillation components from biological time series data.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Transcriptome diversity is a systematic source of variation in RNA-sequencing data</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Pablo E. García-Nieto, Ban Wang, Hunter B. Fraser</p>

RNA sequencing has been widely used as an essential tool to probe gene expression. While standard practices have been established to analyze RNA-seq data, it is still challenging to interpret and remove artifactual signals. Several biological and technical factors such as sex, age, batches, and sequencing technology have been found to bias these estimates. Probabilistic estimation of expression residuals (PEER), which infers broad variance components in gene expression measurements, has been used to account for some systematic effects, but it has remained challenging to interpret these PEER factors. Here we show that transcriptome diversity–a simple metric based on Shannon entropy–explains a large portion of variability in gene expression and is the strongest known factor encoded in PEER factors. We then show that transcriptome diversity has significant associations with multiple technical and biological variables across diverse organisms and datasets. In sum, transcriptome diversity provides a simple explanation for a major source of variation in both gene expression estimates and PEER covariates.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Ten simple rules for finding and selecting R packages</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Caroline J. Wendt, G. Brooke Anderson</p>

R is an increasingly preferred software environment for data analytics and statistical computing among scientists and practitioners. Packages markedly extend R’s utility and ameliorate inefficient solutions to data science problems. We outline 10 simple rules for finding relevant packages and determining which package is best for your desired use. We begin in Rule 1 with tips on how to consider your purpose, which will guide your search to follow, where, in Rule 2, you’ll learn best practices for finding and collecting options. Rules 3 and 4 will help you navigate packages’ profiles and explore the extent of their online resources, so that you can be confident in the quality of the package you choose and assured that you’ll be able to access support. In Rules 5 and 6, you’ll become familiar with how the R Community evaluates packages and learn how to assess the popularity and utility of packages for yourself. Rules 7 and 8 will teach you how to investigate and track package development processes, so you can further evaluate their merit. We end in Rules 9 and 10 with more hands-on approaches, which involve digging into package code.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Isotope-assisted metabolic flux analysis as an equality-constrained nonlinear program for improved scalability and robustness</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Daniel J. Lugar, Ganesh Sriram</p>

Stable isotope-assisted metabolic flux analysis (MFA) is a powerful method to estimate carbon flow and partitioning in metabolic networks. At its core, MFA is a parameter estimation problem wherein the fluxes and metabolite pool sizes are model parameters that are estimated, via optimization, to account for measurements of steady-state or isotopically-nonstationary isotope labeling patterns. As MFA problems advance in scale, they require efficient computational methods for fast and robust convergence. The structure of the MFA problem enables it to be cast as an equality-constrained nonlinear program (NLP), where the equality constraints are constructed from the MFA model equations, and the objective function is defined as the sum of squared residuals (SSR) between the model predictions and a set of labeling measurements. This NLP can be solved by using an algebraic modeling language (AML) that offers state-of-the-art optimization solvers for robust parameter estimation and superior scalability to large networks. When implemented in this manner, the optimization is performed with no distinction between state variables and model parameters. During each iteration of such an optimization, the system state is updated instead of being calculated explicitly from scratch, and this occurs concurrently with improvement in the model parameter estimates. This optimization approach starkly contrasts with traditional “shooting” methods where the state variables and model parameters are kept distinct and the system state is computed afresh during each iteration of a stepwise optimization. Our NLP formulation uses the MFA modeling framework of Wiechert et al. [1], which is amenable to incorporation of the model equations into an NLP. The NLP constraints consist of balances on either elementary metabolite units (EMUs) or cumomers. In this formulation, both the steady-state and isotopically-nonstationary MFA (inst-MFA) problems may be solved as an NLP. For the inst-MFA case, the ordinary differential equation (ODE) system describing the labeling dynamics is transcribed into a system of algebraic constraints for the NLP using collocation. This large-scale NLP may be solved efficiently using an NLP solver implemented on an AML. In our implementation, we used the reduced gradient solver CONOPT, implemented in the General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS). The NLP framework is particularly advantageous for inst-MFA, scaling well to large networks with many free parameters, and having more robust convergence properties compared to the shooting methods that compute the system state and sensitivities at each iteration. Additionally, this NLP approach supports the use of tandem-MS data for both steady-state and inst-MFA when the cumomer framework is used. We assembled a software, eiFlux, written in Python and GAMS that uses the NLP approach and supports both steady-state and inst-MFA. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the NLP formulation on several examples, including a genome-scale inst-MFA model, to highlight the scalability and robustness of this approach. In addition to typical inst-MFA applications, we expect that this framework and our associated software, eiFlux, will be particularly useful for applying inst-MFA to complex MFA models, such as those developed for eukaryotes (e.g. algae) and co-cultures with multiple cell types.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Cortical oscillations support sampling-based computations in spiking neural networks</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Agnes Korcsak-Gorzo, Michael G. Müller, Andreas Baumbach, Luziwei Leng, Oliver J. Breitwieser, Sacha J. van Albada, Walter Senn, Karlheinz Meier, Robert Legenstein, Mihai A. Petrovici</p>

Being permanently confronted with an uncertain world, brains have faced evolutionary pressure to represent this uncertainty in order to respond appropriately. Often, this requires visiting multiple interpretations of the available information or multiple solutions to an encountered problem. This gives rise to the so-called mixing problem: since all of these “valid” states represent powerful attractors, but between themselves can be very dissimilar, switching between such states can be difficult. We propose that cortical oscillations can be effectively used to overcome this challenge. By acting as an effective temperature, background spiking activity modulates exploration. Rhythmic changes induced by cortical oscillations can then be interpreted as a form of simulated tempering. We provide a rigorous mathematical discussion of this link and study some of its phenomenological implications in computer simulations. This identifies a new computational role of cortical oscillations and connects them to various phenomena in the brain, such as sampling-based probabilistic inference, memory replay, multisensory cue combination, and place cell flickering.

Actomyosin contractility is a major engine of preimplantation morphogenesis, which starts at the 8-cell stage during mouse embryonic development. Contractility becomes first visible with the appearance of periodic cortical waves of contraction (PeCoWaCo), which travel around blastomeres in an oscillatory fashion. How contractility of the mouse embryo becomes active remains unknown. We have taken advantage of PeCoWaCo to study the awakening of contractility during preimplantation development. We find that PeCoWaCo become detectable in most embryos only after the second cleavage and gradually increase their oscillation frequency with each successive cleavage. To test the influence of cell size reduction during cleavage divisions, we use cell fusion and fragmentation to manipulate cell size across a 20- to 60-μm range. We find that the stepwise reduction in cell size caused by cleavage divisions does not explain the presence of PeCoWaCo or their accelerating rhythm. Instead, we discover that blastomeres gradually decrease their surface tensions until the 8-cell stage and that artificially softening cells enhances PeCoWaCo prematurely. We further identify the programmed down-regulation of the formin Fmnl3 as a required event to soften the cortex and expose PeCoWaCo. Therefore, during cleavage stages, cortical softening, mediated by Fmnl3 down-regulation, awakens zygotic contractility before preimplantation morphogenesis.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Structural dynamics of receptor recognition and pH-induced dissociation of full-length Clostridioides difficile Toxin B</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Mengqiu Jiang, Joonyoung Shin, Rudo Simeon, Jeng-Yih Chang, Ran Meng, Yuhang Wang, Omkar Shinde, Pingwei Li, Zhilei Chen, Junjie Zhang</p>

<i>Clostridioides difficile</i> secretes Toxin B (TcdB) as one of its major virulence factors, which binds to intestinal epithelial and subepithelial receptors, including frizzled proteins and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 4 (CSPG4). Here, we present cryo-EM structures of full-length TcdB in complex with the CSPG4 domain 1 fragment (D1<sub>401-560</sub>) at cytosolic pH and the cysteine-rich domain of frizzled-2 (CRD2) at both cytosolic and acidic pHs. CSPG4 specifically binds to the autoprocessing and delivery domains of TcdB via networks of salt bridges, hydrophobic and aromatic/proline interactions, which are disrupted upon acidification eventually leading to CSPG4 drastically dissociating from TcdB. In contrast, FZD2 moderately dissociates from TcdB under acidic pH, most likely due to its partial unfolding. These results reveal structural dynamics of TcdB during its preentry step upon endosomal acidification, which provide a basis for developing therapeutics against <i>C</i>. <i>difficile</i> infections.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Foundations of circadian medicine</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Achim Kramer, Tanja Lange, Claudia Spies, Anna-Marie Finger, Daniela Berg, Henrik Oster</p>

The circadian clock is an evolutionarily highly conserved endogenous timing program that structures physiology and behavior according to the time of day. Disruption of circadian rhythms is associated with many common pathologies. The emerging field of circadian medicine aims to exploit the mechanisms of circadian physiology and clock–disease interaction for clinical diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. In this Essay, we outline the principle approaches of circadian medicine, highlight the development of the field in selected areas, and point out open questions and challenges. Circadian medicine has unambiguous health benefits over standard care but is rarely utilized. It is time for clock biology to become an integrated part of translational research.

                <p>The introduction of a third-dose vaccination along with new variants of concern raises questions regarding serology and T-cell responses in patients with multiple sclerosis (pwMS) treated with B-cell depletion who develop attenuated humoral response to vaccines. The aim of this study was to longitudinally evaluate humoral and cellular response to SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine in ocrelizumab-treated pwMS before and following a third vaccine dose. Following the third vaccine dose, patients who are low or nonresponders following initial vaccination did not increase antibody titers. In healthy controls and ocrelizumab-treated pwMS, cellular response decreased 6 months after initial vaccination and increased significantly after the third dose. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

     alt="Secretagogin in the brain and pituitary of the catfish, Clarias batrachus: Molecular characterization and regulation by insulin"/>
<p>Expression and significance of secretagogin (scgn) in the brain of catfish, <i>Clarias batrachus</i>. Three scgn transcript variants were found in the brain of <i>C. batrachus</i>. Two of these transcript variants predicted to encode a putative 272 aa protein, comparable to that found in teleosts and fully capable of Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding. Cells expressing scgn showed wide distribution in the brain and pituitary. None of the hypophysiotropic dopamine neurons but a great majority of the isotocin and vasotocin neurons coexpressed scgn. Distinct scgn neurons/fibers were observed in the entopeduncular nucleus (EN, arrow) in the ventral telencephalon. Intracranial insulin enhanced scgn expression in EN neurons.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Secretagogin (scgn), is a novel hexa EF-hand, phylogenetically conserved calcium-binding protein. It serves as Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor and participates in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-signaling and neuroendocrine regulation in mammals. However, its relevance in the brain of non-mammalian vertebrates has largely remained unexplored. To address this issue, we studied the cDNA encoding scgn, <i>scgn</i> mRNA expression, and distribution of scgn-equipped elements in the brain and pituitary of a teleost, <i>Clarias batrachus</i> (<i>cb</i>). The <i>cbscgn</i> cDNA consists of three transcripts (T) variants: T1 (2185 bp), T2 (2151 bp) and T3 (2060 bp). While 816 bp ORF in T1 and T2 encodes highly conserved six EF-hand 272 aa protein fully capable of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding, 726-bp ORF in T3 encodes 242 aa protein. The T1 showed &gt;90% and &gt;70% identity with scgn of catfishes, and other teleosts and mammals, respectively. The T1-mRNA was widely expressed in the brain and pituitary, while the expression of T3 was restricted to the telencephalon. Application of the anti-scgn antiserum revealed a ∼32 kDa scgn-immunoreactive (scgn-i) band (known molecular weight of scgn) in the forebrain tissue, and immunohistochemically labeled neurons in the olfactory epithelium and bulb, telencephalon, preoptic area, hypothalamus, thalamus, and hindbrain. In the pituitary, scgn-i cells were seen in the pars distalis and intermedia. Insulin is reported to regulate <i>scgn</i> mRNA in the mammalian hippocampus, and feeding-related neuropeptides in the telencephalon of teleost. Intracranial injection of insulin significantly increased T1-mRNA expression and scgn-immunoreactivity in the telencephalon. We suggest that scgn may be an important player in the regulation of olfactory, neuroendocrine system, and energy balance functions in <i>C. batrachus</i>.</p>

                Logistic regressions are the primary method to analyze choice behavior in decision neuroscience studies. In this primer, Padoa-Schioppa describes how logistic analysis can quantify a variety of behavioral traits. He also discusses the assumptions and interpretations of different logistic models.

                Knowledge about the impact of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection of the elderly on mRNA vaccination response is needed to appropriately address the demand for additional vaccinations in this vulnerable population. Here we show that octogenarians, a high-risk population, mount a sustained SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific IgG antibody response for 15 months following infection. This response boosts antibody levels 35-fold upon receiving a single dose of BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine 15 months after recovery from COVID-19.

The liquid-like nature of such domains leads to adhesive interactions between the cytoskeleton filaments and organelles.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The enteric nervous system of the C. elegans pharynx is specified by the Sine oculis-like homeobox gene ceh-34</a></h4>

              
                Overarching themes in the terminal differentiation of the enteric nervous system, an autonomously acting unit of animal nervous systems, have so far eluded discovery. We describe here the overall regulatory logic of enteric nervous system differentiation of the nematode <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> that resides within the foregut (pharynx) of the worm. A <i>C. elegans</i> homolog of the <i>Drosophila</i> Sine oculis homeobox gene, <i>ceh-34</i>, is expressed in all 14 classes of interconnected pharyngeal neurons from their birth throughout their life time, but in no other neuron type of the entire animal. Constitutive and temporally controlled <i>ceh-34</i> removal shows that <i>ceh-34</i> is required to initiate and maintain the neuron type-specific terminal differentiation program of all pharyngeal neuron classes, including their circuit assembly. Through additional genetic loss of function analysis, we show that within each pharyngeal neuron class, <i>ceh-34</i> cooperates with different homeodomain transcription factors to individuate distinct pharyngeal neuron classes. Our analysis underscores the critical role of homeobox genes in neuronal identity specification and links them to the control of neuronal circuit assembly of the enteric nervous system. Together with the pharyngeal nervous system simplicity as well as its specification by a Sine oculis homolog, our findings invite speculations about the early evolution of nervous systems.
