                arXiv:2508.21177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study bifurcations in networks of integrate-and-fire neurons with stochastic spike emission, focusing on the effects of the spatial and temporal structure of the synaptic interactions. Using a deterministic mean-field approximation of the population dynamics, we characterize spatial, temporal, and spatiotemporal patterns of macroscopic activity. In the mean-field theory, synaptic delays give rise to uniform oscillations across the population through a subcritical Hopf bifurcation of the stationary uniform equilibrium. With local excitation and long-range inhibition the network undergoes a Turing bifurcation, resulting in a localized area of sustained activity, or stationary bump. When the coupling has both delays, local inhibition, and long range excitation, the network undergoes a Turing-Hopf bifurcation leading to spatiotemporal dynamics, such as standing and traveling waves. When multiple instabilities are excited, we observe other complex spatiotemporal dynamics. We confirm all these predictions of the mean-field theory in simulations of the underlying stochastic model.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21445">Self-regulated emergence of heavy-tailed weight distributions in evolving complex network architectures</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2508.21445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brain networks continually adjust the weights of their connections, resulting in heavy-tailed distributions of their connection weights, a few strong connections among many weaker ones. At the same time, these connections undergo structural plasticity, forming a complex network topology. Although mechanisms producing either heavy-tailed distributions or complex topologies have been proposed, it has remained unclear whether a single mechanism can produce both. We consider homeostasis as the driving principle and propose a Hebbian inspired model that adaptively adjusts weights and rewires directed connections based on homeostatic dynamics. Without adaptive rewiring, weight adjustment alone still generates heavy-tailed weight distributions, as long as activity does not spread beyond locally neighboring units. However, when combined with adaptive rewiring, the homeostatic dynamics create a synergy that produces heavy-tailed weight distributions also for more extended activity flow. Furthermore, the model generates complex network structures that encompass convergent-divergent circuits similar to those that facilitate signal transmission throughout the nervous system. By combining adaptive weight adjustment and rewiring based on the same homeostatic dynamics, our model provides a parsimonious and robust mechanism that simultaneously produces heavy-tailed weight distributions and convergent-divergent units under a wide range of dynamical regimes.

                arXiv:2508.21490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of the Dirac equation from a stochastic master equation suggests a profound link between relativistic quantum mechanics and underlying probabilistic descriptions of brain dynamics. In parallel, recent work has shown that the FitzHugh-Nagumo equations describing excitable neurons can be reformulated to yield a Schr\"{o}dinger-like equation with a novel Planck-like constant, indicating that neural noise may give rise to quantum-like dynamics. This paper brings these insights together to propose two novel neuroscience experiments aimed at detecting emergent coherence in axonal signal propagation and subthreshold oscillations. We suggest that stochastic interference effects in axon branching structures may reveal signatures of Dirac-type stochasticity. We also suggest that by measuring neuronal temperature and fluctuations we can detect quantum effects in brain oscillations. If successful, these experiments will provide experimental support for quantum markers of brain processes.

                arXiv:2508.21530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During fieldwork in Thailand we observed nearly identical frequencies of co-located flashing fireflies and chirping crickets. Motivated by this, we perform a meta-analysis and show an abundance of evolutionarily distinct species that communicate isochronously at ~0.5-4 Hz, suggesting that this might be a frequency "hotspot." We hypothesize that this timescale may have a universal basis in the biophysics of the receiver's neurons. We test this by demonstrating that small receiver circuits constructed from elements representing typical neurons will be most responsive in the observed frequency range.

                arXiv:2508.21555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past decade, techniques enabling bidirectional modulation of neuronal activity with single cell precision have rapidly advanced in the form of two-photon optogenetic stimulation. Unlike conventional electrophysiological approaches or one-photon optogenetics, which inevitably activate many neurons surrounding the target, two-photon optogenetics can drive hundreds of specifically targeted neurons simultaneously, with stimulation patterns that can be flexibly and rapidly reconfigured. In this review, we trace the development of two-photon optogenetic stimulation, focusing on its progression toward implementations in large field of view two-photon microscopes capable of targeted multi neuron control. We highlight three principal strategies: spiral scanning, temporal focusing, and three-dimensional computer-generated holography (3D CGH), along with their combinations, which together provide powerful tools for causal interrogation of neural circuits and behavior. Finally, we discuss the integration of these optical technologies into brain machine interfaces (BMIs), emphasizing both their transformative potential and the technical challenges that must be addressed to realize their broader impact.

Abstract: Anyone who has tried to memorize a one-hundred-digit number can attest that the human brain acquires abstract information slowly. However, following a three-decade increase of results at memory competitions, the best competitors manage to memorize a one-hundred-digit number in under 15 seconds. This documents explores the origins of this trend: how competitions, records and techniques have evolved. In the process several phenomena are discussed: the actual process of memorization is likely even faster, records are governed by a power law, numbers are easier than playing cards and associations are at the core of memory.

Abstract: We constructed a computational model of the driver's brain for steering tasks using the active inference framework, grounded in the free energy principle - a theory from computational neuroscience. This model enables quantitative estimation of how accurately the brain learns vehicle dynamics and performs appropriate steering, using a measure called variational free energy. Through driving simulator experiments, we observed strong correlations between variational free energy and both expert drivers' subjective "as-intended" scores and general participants' objective control performance. These results suggest that variational free energy provides a promising quantitative metric for evaluating whether a vehicle behaves "as-intended."

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21566">NSPDI-SNN: An efficient lightweight SNN based on nonlinear synaptic pruning and dendritic integration</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2508.21566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are artificial neural networks based on simulated biological neurons and have attracted much attention in recent artificial intelligence technology studies. The dendrites in biological neurons have efficient information processing ability and computational power; however, the neurons of SNNs rarely match the complex structure of the dendrites. Inspired by the nonlinear structure and highly sparse properties of neuronal dendrites, in this study, we propose an efficient, lightweight SNN method with nonlinear pruning and dendritic integration (NSPDI-SNN). In this method, we introduce nonlinear dendritic integration (NDI) to improve the representation of the spatiotemporal information of neurons. We implement heterogeneous state transition ratios of dendritic spines and construct a new and flexible nonlinear synaptic pruning (NSP) method to achieve the high sparsity of SNN. We conducted systematic experiments on three benchmark datasets (DVS128 Gesture, CIFAR10-DVS, and CIFAR10) and extended the evaluation to two complex tasks (speech recognition and reinforcement learning-based maze navigation task). Across all tasks, NSPDI-SNN consistently achieved high sparsity with minimal performance degradation. In particular, our method achieved the best experimental results on all three event stream datasets. Further analysis showed that NSPDI significantly improved the efficiency of synaptic information transfer as sparsity increased. In conclusion, our results indicate that the complex structure and nonlinear computation of neuronal dendrites provide a promising approach for developing efficient SNN methods.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21267">Catwalk: Unary Top-K for Efficient Ramp-No-Leak Neuron Design for Temporal Neural Networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2508.21267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Temporal neural networks (TNNs) are neuromorphic neural networks that utilize bit-serial temporal coding. TNNs are composed of columns, which in turn employ neurons as their building blocks. Each neuron processes volleys of input spikes, modulated by associated synaptic weights, on its dendritic inputs. Recently proposed neuron implementation in CMOS employs a Spike Response Model (SRM) with a ramp-no-leak (RNL) response function and assumes all the inputs can carry spikes. However, in actual spike volleys, only a small subset of the dendritic inputs actually carry spikes in each compute cycle. This form of sparsity can be exploited to achieve better hardware efficiency. In this paper, we propose a Catwalk neuron implementation by relocating spikes in a spike volley as a sorted subset cluster via unary top-k. Such relocation can significantly reduce the cost of the subsequent parallel counter (PC) for accumulating the response functions from the spiking inputs. This can lead to improvements on area and power efficiency in RNL neuron implementation. Place-and-route results show Catwalk is 1.39x and 1.86x better in area and power, respectively, as compared to existing SRM0-RNL neurons.

                arXiv:2305.19775v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider optimizing for different production requirements from the viewpoint of a bio-inspired framework for system flexibility that allows us to study the ability of an algorithm to transfer solutions from previous optimization tasks, which also relates to dynamic evolutionary optimization.
  Optimizing manufacturing process parameters is typically a multi-objective problem with often contradictory objectives such as production quality and production time. If production requirements change, process parameters have to be optimized again. Since optimization usually requires costly simulations based on, for example, the Finite Element method, it is of great interest to have means to reduce the number of evaluations needed for optimization. Based on the extended Oxley model for orthogonal metal cutting, we introduce a multi-objective optimization benchmark where different materials define related optimization tasks.
  We use the benchmark to study the flexibility of NSGA-II, which we extend by two variants: 1) varying goals, which optimizes solutions for two tasks simultaneously to obtain in-between source solutions expected to be more adaptable, and 2) active-inactive genotype, which accommodates different possibilities that can be activated or deactivated. Results show that adaption, i.e. transferring a solution from a previous optimization task, with standard NSGA-II greatly reduces the number of evaluations required for optimization to a target goal in comparison to starting from scratch. The proposed variants further improve the adaption costs, although further work is needed towards making the methods advantageous for real applications.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08897">On the Adversarial Robustness of Spiking Neural Networks Trained by Local Learning</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2504.08897v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent research has shown the vulnerability of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) under adversarial examples that are nearly indistinguishable from clean data in the context of frame-based and event-based information. The majority of these studies are constrained in generating adversarial examples using Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT), a gradient-based method which lacks biological plausibility. In contrast, local learning methods, which relax many of BPTT's constraints, remain under-explored in the context of adversarial attacks. To address this problem, we examine adversarial robustness in SNNs through the framework of four types of training algorithms. We provide an in-depth analysis of the ineffectiveness of gradient-based adversarial attacks to generate adversarial instances in this scenario. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a hybrid adversarial attack paradigm that leverages the transferability of adversarial instances. The proposed hybrid approach demonstrates superior performance, outperforming existing adversarial attack methods. Furthermore, the generalizability of the method is assessed under multi-step adversarial attacks, adversarial attacks in black-box FGSM scenarios, and within the non-spiking domain.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19660">Arbitrary Precision Printed Ternary Neural Networks with Holistic Evolutionary Approximation</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2508.19660v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Printed electronics offer a promising alternative for applications beyond silicon-based systems, requiring properties like flexibility, stretchability, conformality, and ultra-low fabrication costs. Despite the large feature sizes in printed electronics, printed neural networks have attracted attention for meeting target application requirements, though realizing complex circuits remains challenging. This work bridges the gap between classification accuracy and area efficiency in printed neural networks, covering the entire processing-near-sensor system design and co-optimization from the analog-to-digital interface-a major area and power bottleneck-to the digital classifier. We propose an automated framework for designing printed Ternary Neural Networks with arbitrary input precision, utilizing multi-objective optimization and holistic approximation. Our circuits outperform existing approximate printed neural networks by 17x in area and 59x in power on average, being the first to enable printed-battery-powered operation with under 5% accuracy loss while accounting for analog-to-digital interfacing costs.

">Beyond the Anterior Temporal Lobe: Domain-Related Degeneration of Cortical Language Network Dynamics in Semantic Dementia</a></h4>

              
                Semantic dementia (SD) is a neurodegenerative disorder marked by a progressive decline in semantic memory, mainly due to focal atrophy in the anterior temporal lobe (ATL). As the disease advances, atrophy spreads to the perisylvian regions, accompanied by non-semantic language impairments. Despite these clinical findings, the network mechanisms behind cross-domain linguistic deficits remain poorly understood. In this study, we used our recently developed meta-networking framework of cortical language network dynamics to systematically examine domain-specific network disruptions in SD. Using resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) and comprehensive neuropsychological tests across several language domains, we analyzed data from SD patients at two timepoints: baseline (n = 42) and a 2-year follow-up (n = 24). Our findings showed that the framework successfully identified domain-specific language network degeneration. Beyond the ATL, progressive atrophy disrupted the dynamic separation of language networks involved in semantic processing, phonological processing, and speech production. These disruptions were characterized by state-specific hypo- and hyper-connectivity patterns that related to distinct language impairments. At follow-up, atrophy extended to posterior temporal and prefrontal regions, worsening network function. Importantly, the patterns of language network disruption predicted individual language deficits, providing a mechanistic link between structural degeneration, functional network changes, and clinical symptoms.

">Developmental vitamin A deficiency induces sex-specific reward processing alterations through a dysregulation of the mesolimbic dopamine transmission in mice</a></h4>

              
                Neurodevelopmental psychiatric diseases such as schizophrenia or affective disorders share common symptomatic dimensions, in particular reward processing dysfunctions, associated with dysregulation of dopamine (DA) transmission. Retinoic acid (RA) homeostasis is altered across psychiatric disorders but whether impaired developmental RA signaling impacts the functionality of DA-related reward processing at adulthood remains poorly explored. Herein, we explored in male and female mice how developmental vitamin A deficiency (VAD), as a model of blunted RA signaling, could impact motivational processes through a modulation of mesolimbic DA transmission. Behavioral performances were evaluated using operant conditioning tasks, parallel with investigations of the integrity of DA transmission through biochemical analyses of markers of DA transmission and measures of DA dynamics using DA biosensor coupled with fiber photometry. Finally, chemogenetic manipulation of the mesolimbic DA pathway was used to normalize DA transmission and assess the effect on motivational performance in VAD offspring. Developmental VAD induced sex-specific alterations of reward-related processes at adulthood. Indeed, while female behavioral performances were spared, VAD males exhibited elevated instrumental performance and impulsivity. These behavioral alterations were coherent with reduced DA transporter (DAT) expression and increased DA dynamic in the mesolimbic pathway. Strikingly, chemogenetic inhibition of the mesolimbic DA pathway normalized motivational performance in VAD males. Our results show that developmental RA hyposignaling induces sex-specific reward processing alterations in adulthood through hyperactivity of the mesolimbic DA pathway. Our data support that developmental impairment in RA signaling might be at the core of reward-related symptoms across psychiatric disorders.

">The Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) coordinates an epigenetic checkpoint in neural progenitor cells</a></h4>

              
                Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by silencing of the FMR1 gene, which encodes the multifunctional RNA-binding protein FMRP. While FMRP is best known for its roles in RNA metabolism, it can also associate with chromatin through recognition of histone H3 lysine 79 di-methylation (H3K79me2), an epigenetic mark linked to transcriptionally active genes. However, the functional relevance of this FMRP-H3K79me2 interaction has remained largely unexplored in the context of FXS pathophysiology. We assessed H3K79me2 levels during the differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells generated from both healthy individuals and FXS patients and discovered a global increase in H3K79me2 levels specifically in FXS neural progenitor cells (NPCs). Altered H3K79me2 landscape drives widespread transcriptional dysregulation, marked by reduced expression of neurogenesis-associated genes and aberrant upregulation of programs promoting proliferation and glial lineage commitment. Functionally, these alterations result in enhanced NPC proliferation and a biased differentiation trajectory. Together, our findings uncover an H3K79me2-dependent epigenetic checkpoint that governs NPC proliferation and lineage commitment. We further establish FMRP as a critical component of this checkpoint, linking its loss to the neurodevelopmental defects characteristic of FXS.

">High-level Speech Processing During Mind-Wandering: Evidence from Neural Alignment with Language Models</a></h4>

              
                Speech processing involves a subjective sense of engagement with content. This experience occurs alongside continuous prediction of upcoming contents, raising questions regarding the potential relationship between these phenomena. Is the activation of predictive mechanisms sufficient for subjective experience, or can it proceed when the mind wanders away? Participants (N = 25) listened to audiobook content (>12,000 words) while providing self-reports of mind-wandering. Such reports were associated with spectral changes in the EEG signal and decreased early response to word onset, in line with current accounts of mind-wandering. In contrast, markers of word-level contextual surprise (indexed by the contextual surprise of Language Models) remained intact during mind-wandering, alongside significant encoding of semantic contents. Last, we measured the neural encoding of predictive context, measured by the correlation between EEG and the vectorial embeddings that Language Models use to predict each word given prior context. This encoding also remained strong during mind-wandering, albeit weaker compared to attentive periods. Our findings show that the brain predicts and monitors relevant inputs even when we disengage from the external environment. It suggests that the shared computational mechanisms between humans and Language Models are insufficient for experiencing the meaning of speech contents, with implications for theoretical accounts of mind-wandering and predictive processing accounts of consciousness.

">Visual Regularities Underlie Hierarchical Object Representations in the Human Brain and Self-supervised DNN</a></h4>

              
                NeuroAI develops the interplay of neuroscience and artificial intelligence, especially on visual processing. Human visual system organizes objects based on a representational hierarchy. However, it remains unclear whether this hierarchy arises from visual or semantic information. One hypothesis posits that the visual system is structured around statistical regularities of visual information. Here, we test this hypothesis using the THINGS datasets and pure-visual deep neural networks (DNN). We constructed a low-dimensional object space based on multiple abstract object properties, reflecting statistical patterns of visual regularities. By applying voxelwise encoding models, we identified clusters in the higher visual cortex based on their property tuning, and they were found to support specific object categories. These clusters serve as the middle level to reveal a property-cluster-object hierarchical organization. Subsequently, we investigated whether this hierarchical structure could be captured by a self-supervised DNN. Through activity similarity analysis, we mapped the brain clusters onto the DNN and independently found that the DNN's clusters exhibited distinct property tuning and influenced the classification accuracy of corresponding object categories, mirroring the effects observed in the human brain. Our results demonstrate similar hierarchical structures in the human brain and self-supervised DNN, suggesting that the visual regularities shape neural architecture of visual system. This study highlights the great potential of neural computational model in neuroscience study.

">Epigenetic inheritance of complex learning abilities in the mammalian brain</a></h4>

              
                For several decades, the question of whether cognitive and learning capacities can be inherited through non-genetic mechanisms has been the subject of ongoing debate. Here, we provide the first evidence of transgenerational inheritance of enhanced ability to learn complex tasks in the mammalian rodent brain. These inherited learning enhancements are not limited to specific stimuli, sensory modalities, or learning paradigms. Using behavioral, cellular biophysical, methylomics, genetics and molecular methods, we find that the inherited epigenetic modifications reflect an enhanced neuronal learning state, driven by increased intrinsic neuronal excitability in most pyramidal neurons in the relevant neuronal networks. This enhancement is mediated by persistent downregulation of the muscarinic M-current and is associated with widespread changes in DNA methylation, notably within coding genes associated with the M-current, the Kv7 pathway, in the hippocampi of trained F0 rats, as well as in non-coding RNAs in their sperm samples. Remarkably, a significant portion of these DNA methylation changes were also observed in the hippocampi of their untrained F1 offspring. These findings suggest that complex learning abilities can be inherited in the mammalian brain, as the offspring of trained rodents are born with the biophysical modifications that enable them to become super-learners, the exact change that occurs in their parents' brains only after the rule learning.

">Key moments in naturalistic events synchronize neural activity patterns and dominate memory reinstatement</a></h4>

              
                Continuous experiences are experienced and remembered in terms of events that unfold over time. There is strong evidence that event boundaries segment experience during comprehension and that event representations are compressed in memory; however, this compression is poorly understood. We developed a novel storyboard paradigm to test the hypothesis that representations of continuous experiences are defined by a subset of key moments that capture the underlying narrative. Participants agreed on when key moments occurred; some key moments corresponded with event boundaries, but many did not. fMRI during encoding revealed that neural activity patterns throughout the default network synchronized across individuals at key moments. Further, comparing fMRI during encoding to fMRI during retrieval revealed that key moments are overrepresented in neural patterns that are reinstated during event recall in the posterior-medial cortex. These results suggest that continuous events are punctuated by a small subset of meaningful moments, which dominate neural representations during perception and memory.

">The Ighmbp2-R604X mouse recapitulates the severe SMARD1 clinical symptoms of aspiration, respiratory and feeding deficits</a></h4>

              
                Spinal muscular atrophy with respiratory distress type 1 (SMARD1) and Charcot Marie Tooth type 2S (CMT2S) are due to mutations in immunoglobulin mu binding protein two (IGHMBP2). We generated the Ighmbp2-R604X mouse (R605X-humans) to understand how alterations in IGHMBP2 function impact disease pathology. The IGHMBP2-R605X mutation is associated with patients with SMARD1 or CMT2S. The impact of this mutation is substantial, Ighmbp2R604X/R604X mice have a decreased lifespan (6 days) and weight, and failure to thrive consistent with SMARD1 symptoms. Significant respiratory changes were present along with disease pathology of the phrenic nerve and diaphragm muscle fibers. Ighmbp2R604X/R604X mice also presented with signs of milk aspiration and lung pathology. Interestingly, Ighmbp2R604X/R604X mice were born with visible milk spots, but demonstrated reduction of the milk spot by P3, indicating deficits in suckling. Alterations in hindlimb electrophysiology were consistent with the sciatic nerve, hindlimb neuromuscular junction and muscle pathology. Injection of the ssAAV9-WT-IGHMBP2 vector extended Ighmbp2R604X/R604X survival a few days, due to reduced expression of the vector before death ensued. Ighmbp2R604X/R604X phenotypes are consistent with the most severe SMARD1 clinical symptoms and for the first time a Ighmbp2 mouse model demonstrates that milk aspiration and loss of the ability to suckle impact survival.

">Lewy pathology accumulates in swollen corticostriatal synapses in α-synucleinopathies</a></h4>

              
                Lewy body diseases (LBD), including Parkinson's disease (PD), Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD), and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), are neurodegenerative disorders characterized by the accumulation of misfolded -synuclein in the form of Lewy pathology. A hallmark of these diseases is degeneration of the nigrostriatal pathway, resulting in loss of dopaminergic input to the striatum and consequent motor dysfunction. Lewy pathology is present in many regions outside the substantia nigra, and cortical Lewy pathology is the best correlate of cognitive decline in individuals that develop dementia. In addition, there is a high burden of neuritic Lewy pathology in the putamen, though the neuronal origin of this pathology is unclear. In the current study, we quantified the burden of Lewy pathology in the putamen across the spectrum of LBDs. Immunohistochemistry was used to quantify the Lewy burden in the putamen, cingulate and frontal cortices of 9 controls and 24 LBD cases. Even in PD cases without dementia, we observed a nearly complete striatal dopaminergic denervation among LBDs. Consistent with this denervation, most -synuclein pathology did not co-localize with dopaminergic terminals, but was instead enriched in excitatory, VGLUT1-positive terminals. This enrichment in glutamatergic terminals was associated with swollen axons, but not with overall loss of VGLUT1 terminals. These findings suggest that Lewy pathology accumulates at excitatory corticostriatal synapses prior to overt synaptic degeneration and could contribute to cognitive decline in LBDs.

">Circadian control of dopaminergic signaling to the mushroom body regulates sleep through rhythmic Pka-C1 transcription in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Despite the progress in understanding the circadian pacemaker, the specific mechanism by which it regulates sleep remains incompletely understood. We have previously demonstrated that a substantial number of genes are rhythmically expressed in the mushroom body (MB) Kenyon cells (KCs), including Pka-C1, which encodes the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A (PKA). PKA-C1 plays a crucial role in promoting daytime wakefulness; however, the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Here, we show that the {gamma}-lobe is the primary site of rhythmic Pka-C1 expression using a newly developed in vivo luciferase reporter. Through a combination of in silico analysis, CRISPR mutagenesis, and chromatin immunoprecipitation, we identify the transcription factor Onecut as a regulator of Pka-C1 transcriptional rhythms in {gamma}-KCs. Furthermore, genetic trans-synaptic connectivity mapping and neuronal activity imaging reveal that the dorsal Lateral clock Neurons (LNds) provide inhibitory input to a subset of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the protocerebral anterior medial (PAM) cluster, PAM-{gamma}5, rhythmically modulating their activity. This, in turn, rhythmically activates MB {gamma}-KCs via excitatory Dop1R signaling. Resulting {gamma}-neuron activity rhythms drive Pka-C1 transcriptional rhythms through Onecut. Furthermore, these PKA-C1 rhythms reinforce neuronal activity rhythms, creating a feedback cycle between transcriptional and neural activity rhythms that promote daytime wakefulness. Our findings highlight the conserved role of DA in promoting wakefulness and offer mechanistic insights into its complex regulation. More generally, this work provides a mechanistic framework for how circadian rhythms are translated into neural activity to orchestrate complex behaviors like sleep.

">Dynamical Diversity in Conductance-Based Neuron Response to kilohertz Electrical Stimulation</a></h4>

              
                Brain neuron networks are notably rich in structure and functioning, consequently rather diverse in their dynamical feedback to stimuli. Thus, accurately characterizing the neural response to external signals is a crucial first step in understanding these networks, which conceivably could enable neuroscience and medical applications. In particular, kilohertz (kHz) neuronal electrical stimulation is a technique capable of inducing behaviors and drives unseen in more conventional lower frequency ranges. This fact could be used in the development of neuromodulation therapies for neurological pathologies, e.g., Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS). Here, we investigate neuronal response and excitability of conductance-based models to kHz frequencies stimulation in a still unexplored parameter space region. We show that the dynamics exhibited by the paradigmatic Hodgkin-Huxley model under kilohertz stimulation is highly diverse, displaying from regular spiking to chaotic behavior, as well as regions of complete activity suppression. By extending the analyses to models of mammalian central nervous system regions we show that, despite presenting similar low-frequency dynamics, such neurons tend to respond rather differently under kilohertz. Further, based on dynamical markers, we propose a method for systematically mapping these behaviors on a stimulation parameter space. These results establish a quantitative framework for ultra-high-frequency neuromodulation protocols, paving the way for future computational neuroscience approaches to stimulation-based procedures.

">Dynamic neural states underpin bradykinesia severity in Parkinsons disease</a></h4>

              
                Background: Bradykinesia in Parkinson's disease (PD) may arise due to transient, network-wide neural dynamics that extend beyond beta-band oscillatory activity within the motor cortical-subthalamic nucleus (STN) circuit. Methods: We address this question by using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) to identify neural states from chronic motor cortical and STN recordings in five PD patients (1,046 hours from 10 hemispheres), with concurrent measurements of bradykinesia using wearable sensors. Findings: We identified four neural states with distinct spectral and temporal features. Two states exhibited spectral signatures--particularly STN low and high gamma, STN delta/alpha, cortical beta, and cortico-STN beta coherence--that predicted worsening bradykinesia. However, STN beta power alone was not consistently predictive, challenging traditional beta-centric views. These states also displayed compensatory features associated with bradykinesia amelioration, including cortical delta/alpha activity, cortical high gamma, and cortico-STN high gamma coherence. Two additional states affected bradykinesia through temporal rather than spectral properties. Prolonged lifetimes of one of these state worsened symptoms, whereas increased occurrences of another, marked by local beta without cortico-STN beta coherence, improved motor function. Interpretation: Our findings highlight the multidimensional nature of bradykinesia and suggest that state-aware, adaptive interventions targeting state features--rather than single frequency bands--may offer new opportunities for improved deep brain stimulation in PD.

">Preliminary First-in-Human Pharmacokinetic Evaluation, Dosimetry and Safety of 7--Fluorotryptophan as PET Imaging Agent to Visualize Serotonin Synthesis in the Brain</a></h4>

              
                Tryptophan (Trp) is the precursor for serotonin synthesis and other biologically relevant metabolites. We evaluated the novel radiotracer 7-[18F]Fluorotryptophan (7-[18F]FTrp) to assess its biodistribution, dosimetry, and potential for imaging brain Trp metabolism in humans. Six healthy volunteers underwent whole-body PET/CT imaging over 5.5 hours following intravenous injection of 7-[18F]FTrp. An additional four subjects underwent dynamic brain PET imaging for 2 hours. Time-activity curves (TACs) were extracted for source organs using VOIs defined on co-registered CT and PET images, and dosimetry was calculated using OLINDA software. The radiotracer showed rapid uptake and distribution, with highest activity observed in the liver, pancreas, salivary glands, in combination with urinary excretion. Brain pharmacokinetic analyses with image-derived input function (IDIF) determined that Patlak analyses were the best fit for brain image analyses. Brain uptake was modest, with highest region-specific accumulation in the pineal gland, which is a known site for serotonin synthesis. The estimated effective dose was within the expected range for 18F-labeled compounds (14.1 {+/-} 0.2 Sv/MBq). Our findings indicate that 7-[18F]FTrp is safe for human use, demonstrates favorable kinetics for studying both brain and peripheral Trp metabolism, and warrants further exploration in patients with serotonin metabolism disorders.

">To jump or not to jump: Comparing effects of phenotypic plasticity on the visual responses and escape behavior of locusts and grasshoppers</a></h4>

              
                Locusts exhibit remarkable phenotypic plasticity changing their appearance and behavior from solitary grasshoppers to gregarious locusts when population density increases. These changes include morphological differences in the size and shape of brain regions, but little is known about plasticity within individual neurons and alterations in behavior not directly related to aggregation or swarming. We examined looming escape behavior and the properties of a well-studied collision-detection neuron in gregarious and solitarious animals of three closely related species, the desert locust (Schistocerca gregaria), the Central American locust (S. piceifrons) and the American bird grasshopper (S. americana). For this neuron, the lobula giant movement detector (LGMD), we examined dendritic morphology, membrane properties, gene expression, and looming responses. Gregarious animals reliably jumped in response to looming stimuli, but surprisingly solitarious desert locusts did not produce escape jumps. These solitarious animals also had smaller LGMD dendrites. This is the first study done on three different species of grasshoppers to observe the effects of phenotypic plasticity on the jump escape behavior, physiology and transcriptomics of these animals. Surprisingly, there were little differences in these properties between the two phases except for behavior. For all the three species, gregarious animals jumped more than solitarious animals, but no significant differences were found between the two phases of animals in the electrophysiological and transcriptomics studies. Our results suggest that phase change impacts mainly the motor system and that the physiological properties of motor neurons need to be characterized to understand fully the variation in jump escape behavior across phases.

">Tirzepatide attenuates dopamine reward signaling and suppresses alcohol drinking and relapse-like behaviors in rodents</a></h4>

              
                Alcohol use disorder (AUD) remains a major public health problem, with few effective medications currently available. However, peptides of the gut-brain axis appear to offer promising therapeutic targets for AUD as they influence the mesolimbic reward circuitry. Here, we examined the effects of tirzepatide, a long-acting dual glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor (GIPR) agonist approved for diabetes and obesity, using behavioral assays, alcohol intake paradigms, and molecular analyses in rodents. First, tirzepatide effectively attenuated the rewarding properties of alcohol, measured through locomotor stimulation, conditioned place preference, and accumbal dopamine release. Subsequently, this GLP-1R/GIPR agonist dose-dependently reduced voluntary alcohol consumption, prevented binge and relapse-like drinking, and maintained efficacy during repeated administration. Finally, tirzepatide induced sustained synaptic depression in the lateral septum and further altered histone regulatory proteins in this region, suggesting a potential neural substrate for its effects. Moreover, the GLP-1R/GIPR agonist affected metabolic parameters including body weight, adipose tissue mass, hepatic triglycerides and circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines. Together, our findings suggest tirzepatide modulates alcohol-related behaviors through reward-related mechanisms while also affecting physiological consequences associated with long-term alcohol use. Given tirzepatide's established clinical use and the consistency of effects observed here, these results support further investigation for treating AUD and associated complications.

">Functional rather than anatomic connectivity predicts seizure propagation in a multi-node model of focal neocortical epilepsy</a></h4>

              
                Seizures propagate through the brain either locally or via widespread networks of anatomically and functionally connected nodes. These sites can be manipulated in the surgical treatment of human patients through ablation or stimulation. However, we still lack a full understanding of how seizures, ablation, and stimulation recruit or alter recruitment of these distant sites. Here, we apply widefield calcium imaging in a non-anesthetized rodent multi-nodal bilateral neocortical network model of focal epilepsy to examine excitatory and inhibitory cell recruitment. When we initiate seizures in somatosensory cortex (S1), they preferentially spread to an ipsilateral node in frontal cortex (M2) rather than across the corpus callosum to contralateral mirror somatosensory cortex. On the other hand, seizures rapidly spread across the corpus callosum in regions that connect M2 with its mirror M2 focus, indicating that this frontal region acts an amplifier for secondary generalization. Accordingly, ablation of M2 radically altered seizure propagation. Electrical stimulation of S1 revealed that S1 preferentially recruits excitatory cells in ipsilateral M2 but inhibitory cells in contralateral S1, which may explain the preferred propagation pathway. We also observed that the stimulation frequency can differentially determine the response of excitatory versus inhibitory neurons. Altogether, our findings suggest that seizures do not propagate homogeneously through anatomically connected nodes but are preferentially pulled to specific locations by excitatory/inhibitory balance. Thus, functional connectivity rather than anatomic connectivity will be more predictive of ictal spread, and more informative for ablative and stimulation-based therapeutics.

">Replating induces mTOR-dependent rescue of protein synthesis in Charcot-Marie-Tooth diseased neurons</a></h4>

              
                Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) is an inherited peripheral neuropathy characterized by sensory dysfunction and muscle weakness, manifesting in the most distal limbs first and progressing more proximal. Over a hundred genes are currently linked to CMT with enrichment for activities in myelination, axon transport, and protein synthesis. Mutations in tRNA synthetases cause dominantly inherited forms of CMT and animal models with CMT-linked mutations in these enzymes display defects in neuronal protein synthesis. Rescuing protein synthesis in CMT mutant neurons could offer exciting therapeutic options beyond symptom management. To address this need, we expressed CMT-linked variants in tyrosyl tRNA synthetase (YARS-CMT) in primary sensory neurons and evaluated impacts on protein synthesis and cell viability. YARS-CMT expression reduced protein synthesis in these neurons prior to the onset of caspase-dependent axon degeneration and cell death. To determine how YARS-CMT expression affects axon outgrowth, we dissociated and replated these neurons to stimulate axon regeneration. To our surprise, axonal regrowth occurred normally in replated YARS-CMT neurons. Moreover, replating YARS-CMT neurons rescued protein synthesis. Inhibiting mTOR suppressed rescue of protein synthesis after replating, consistent with its significant role in protein synthesis during axon regeneration. These discoveries identify new avenues for augmenting protein synthesis in diseased neurons and restoring protein synthesis in CMT or other neurological disorders.

">Toward Robust Neuroanatomical Normative Models: Influence of Sample Size and Covariates Distributions</a></h4>

              
                Normative models are increasingly used to characterize individual-level brain deviations in neuroimaging studies, but their performance depends heavily on the reference sample used for training or adaptation. In this study, we systematically investigated how sample size and covariate composition of the reference cohort influence model fit, deviation estimates, and clinical readouts in Alzheimers disease (AD). Using a discovery dataset (OASIS-3, n = 1032), we trained models on healthy control (HC), subsamples ranging from 5 to 600 individuals, while varying age and sex distributions to simulate biases in reference populations. We further assessed the use of adaptive transfer learning by pre-training models on the UK Biobank (n = 42,747) and adapting them to the clinical dataset applying the same sub-sampling strategies. We evaluated model performance on a fixed HC test set and quantified deviation score errors, outlier detection, and classification accuracy in both the HC test set and the AD cohort. The findings were replicated in an external validation sample (AIBL, n = 463). Across all settings, model performance improved with increasing sample size, but demographic alignment of the covariates, particularly in age, was essential for reliable deviation estimates. Models trained directly within the dataset achieved stable fit with approximately 200 HCs, while adapted models reached comparable performance with as few as 50 individuals when pre-trained on large-scale data. These results show that robust individual-level modeling can be achieved using moderately sized but demographically matched cohorts, supporting broader application of normative modeling in ageing and neurodegeneration research.

                Serial dependence - the bias from recent experience on present response - is often linked to shared memory representations. Yet, it remains unclear whether this bias across tasks when stimulus features are shared but response modes differ. To test this, we interleaved temporal reproduction and bisection tasks using a post-cue design that held duration encoding constant while varying motor output across trials. Using structural equation modeling (SEM), we dissociated perceptual (stimulus-driven) and decisional (response-driven) components of serial dependence. With consecutive same tasks, we replicated repulsive perceptual serial dependence and attractive decisional carryover. Critically, these effects vanished across tasks, despite identical stimulus processing, suggesting that consistent motor responses, not shared memory alone, drive sequential biases. Moreover, SEM uncovered repulsive perceptual influences that standard regression missed, highlighting its power to isolate overlapping effects. Together, these findings reveal that response-specific reactivation underpins serial dependence, pointing to motor-context binding as a key factor in temporal decision-making.

">Connectome-based predictive modelling predicts frailty levels in older adults</a></h4>

              
                Frailty is characterized by a persistent and progressive decline in physiological reserves, leading to increased vulnerability to stressors and a heightened risk of adverse health outcomes, both physically and mentally. Despite the prevalence of frailty in older adults, there is limited research on its neural substrates, especially using task-based brain functional connectivity. In this study, we used connectome-based predictive modelling (CPM) to find a linear relationship between task-based connectomes, taken from tasks that involved similar handgrip manipulations, and a separate measure of frailty: the maximum grip strength in older adults. We observed that the task-based connectomes were able to explain individual differences in grip strength, with the Subcortical and Cerebellum network, particularly the caudate nucleus, functional connectivity being the strongest predictor. These findings demonstrate that task-based functional connectomes can serve as personalized markers that can predict individual behavioral measures, including handgrip strength, and point to involvement of the caudate nucleus in frailty.

">A theory for self-sustained balanced states in absence of strong external currents</a></h4>

              
                Recurrent neural networks with balanced excitation and inhibition exhibit irregular asynchronous dynamics, which is fundamental for cortical computations. Classical balance mechanisms require strong external inputs to sustain finite firing rates, raising concerns about their biological plausibility. Here, we investigate an alternative mechanism based on short-term synaptic depression (STD) acting on excitatory-excitatory synapses, which dynamically balances the network activity without the need of external inputs. By employing accurate numerical simulations and theoretical investigations we characterize the dynamics of a massively coupled network made up of N rate-neuron models. Depending on the synaptic strength J0, the network exhibits two distinct regimes: at sufficiently small J0, it converges to a homogeneous fixed point, while for sufficiently large J0, it exhibits Rate Chaos. For finite networks, we observe several different routes to chaos depending on the network realization. The width of the transition region separating the homogeneous stable solution from Rate Chaos appears to shrink for increasing N and eventually to vanish in the thermodynamic limit (N [-&gt;] {infty}). The characterization of the Rate Chaos regime performed by employing Dynamical Mean Field (DMF) approaches allow us on one side to confirm that this novel balancing mechanism is able to sustain finite irregular activity even in the thermodynamic limit, and on the other side to reveal that the balancing occurs via dynamic cancellation of the input correlations generated by the massive coupling. Our findings show that STD provides an intrinsic self-regulating mechanism for balanced networks, sustaining irregular yet stable activity without the need of biologically unrealistic inputs. This work extends the balanced network paradigm, offering insights into how cortical circuits could maintain robust dynamics via synaptic adaptation.

">A multi-frequency whole-brain neural mass model with homeostatic feedback inhibition</a></h4>

              
                Whole-brain models are valuable tools for understanding brain dynamics in health and disease by enabling the testing of causal mechanisms and identification of therapeutic targets through dynamic simulations. Among these models, biophysically inspired neural mass models have been widely used to simulate electrophysiological recordings, such as MEG and EEG. However, traditional models face limitations, including susceptibility to hyperexcitation, which constrains their ability to capture the full richness of neural dynamics. Here, we developed and characterized a new version of the Jansen-Rit neural mass model aimed at overcoming these limitations. Our model incorporates inhibitory synaptic plasticity (ISP), which adjusts inhibitory feedback onto pyramidal neurons to clamp their firing rates around a target value. Further, the model combined two subpopulations of neural cortical columns oscillating in  and {gamma}, respectively, to generate a richer EEG power spectrum. We analyzed how different model parameters modulate oscillatory frequency and connectivity. We considered a models showcase, simultaneously fitting EEG and fMRI recordings during NREM sleep. Bifurcation analysis showed that ISP increases the parameters range in which the model exhibited sustained oscillations; the target firing rate acts as a bifurcation parameter, moving the system across the bifurcation point, producing different oscillatory regimes, from slower to faster. High frequency activity emerged from low global coupling, high firing rates, and a high proportion of {gamma} versus  subpopulations. Importantly, ISP was necessary in the multi-frequency model to successfully fit EEG functional connectivity across frequency bands. Finally, ISP-controlled reductions in excitability reproduced both the slow-wave activity and the reduced connectivity in NREM sleep. Altogether, our model is compatible with biological evidence of the effects of E/I balance on modulating brain rhythms and connectivity, as observed in sleep, neurodegeneration, and chemical neuromodulation. This biophysical model with ISP provides a springboard for realistic brain simulations in health and disease.

">Male-specific analgesic effects of minocycline in sickle cell disease are mediated by microglia and the microbiome</a></h4>

              
                Over 50% of individuals with sickle cell disease (SCD) experience chronic pain that is phenotypically distinct from their acute, vaso-occlusive crisis pain. Chronic SCD pain is commonly managed with opioid-based drugs that are associated with unwanted side effects, incomplete pain relief, and, in this population, accessibility issues. Thus, new treatments for chronic SCD pain are desperately needed. Here, we examined the analgesic efficacy of acute minocycline treatment in transgenic SCD mice. SCD mice exhibit gut dysbiosis and chronic inflammation. Therefore, we hypothesized that minocycline would provide robust analgesia in this model given the antibiotic and anti-inflammatory properties of the drug. Six days of minocycline treatment reversed chronic mechanical hypersensitivity only in male SCD mice. We identified two potential mechanisms underlying these sex-specific effects. First, we observed increased microgliosis only in the dorsal horn of male SCD mice. Minocycline treatment had opposite effects on microglial number in male and female SCD spinal cords. Second, minocycline treatment altered the gut microbiota in a sex-specific fashion; fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) from minocycline-treated female SCD mice induced widespread pain in recipients whereas FMT from minocycline-treated male SCD mice did not. In summary, these experiments highlight novel sex-specific mechanisms of minocycline analgesia and support future exploration of minocycline use for SCD pain management, but only in male patients.

">Comparative Computational Modeling of Approach-Avoidance Biases in Suicidal Populations via Hierarchical Bayesian Inference</a></h4>

              
                Pavlovian "approach or avoid" impulses are critical behavioral biases that, in excess, are linked to multiple psychiatric conditions. To investigate how such biases contribute to suicidal thoughts and behaviors, we analyzed data from two clinical populations completing an aversive Go/NoGo task. This task disentangles motor action (Go or NoGo) from outcome valence (escape from, or avoidance of, an aversive stimulus), enabling the isolation of Pavlovian biases from instrumental learning processes. We compared multiple computational models that had previously been proposed to explain Pavlovian tendencies, including reinforcement learning, active inference, and drift diffusion-based approaches. We employed a hierarchical Bayesian inference procedure that treats model identity as a random factor at the individual level, allowing an unbiased determination of which mechanisms most accurately captured participants behavior. Across both datasets, models featuring Pavlovian context biases plus a value-decay mechanism best accounted for performance. By contrast, policy-based Pavlovian models and more complex approaches, such as those integrating working memory or active inference, were supported by fewer study participants. These findings suggest that reflexive biases exert a persistent influence on decision-making, and that value decay plays a critical role in shaping behavior over time. Our results demonstrate the importance of systematically comparing and accounting for relevant cognitive processes to explain observed task behaviors. Understanding the factors contributing to task performance may help clarify how Pavlovian tendencies relate to psychopathology, including, in our case, elevated suicide risk. Finally, we illustrate how a complete hierarchical model selection framework can be applied to identify the most plausible mechanisms underlying Pavlovian biases, offering a robust approach for advancing our understanding of task behaviors and establishing clinical utility in future studies.

">Separable neural population representations are constructed from mixed single neuron selectivity in the mouse early visual system</a></h4>

              
                Both sensory and non-sensory brain regions receive mixed inputs from single neurons which require decomposition and integration before proceeding through a processing hierarchy. Whether mixed input signals are used in biological neural networks to derive pure single neuron representations, or distributed as new population representations from mixed single neurons, is not clear. In this study, we measured the distribution of single neuron hue and luminance tuning in the dorsolateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) and primary visual cortex (V1) of mice, as well as the information about and structure of hue and luminance representations in populations of hundred of simultaneously sampled neurons. We compare single neuron and population encoding to null models expected for random integration and extraction of pure categorical single neuron representation. Using both univariate and multivariate regression techniques, we consistently noted that tuning for hue and luminance, rather than clustering into categorical response structures, formed uniform distributions. While the distribution of single neuron selectivity varied across the thalamocortical circuit, we found no evidence of categorical tuning organization emerging in the hierarchy. Nevertheless, populations contained complete information, in either high-dimensional linear representations or low-dimensional non-linear representations. In summary, we find that as early as primary sensory cortex and thalamus single neurons that have mixed selectivity for hue and luminance form a high dimensional representation of those variables, which can be non-linearly embedded in multiple separable representations.

">Aberrant development of glutamatergic inputs to PV and SOM interneurons shape amygdala excitability and oscillatory dynamics after early life stress</a></h4>

              
                Early-life stress (ELS) induces persistent amygdala dysfunction and affects amygdala-related emotional behaviors, yet the developmental and physiological mechanisms driving these effects remain poorly understood. Here, we provide a comprehensive electrophysiological characterization of the effects of ELS on parvalbumin and somatostatin interneurons (INs) as well as principal neurons (PNs) in the mouse lateral amygdala (LA) across development. Additionally, we correlate these findings to activity of the LA circuitry in vivo, using Neuropixels recordings in awake mice. In preweaning juveniles, the effects of ELS were remarkably similar in males and females, involving reduced IN excitability, elevated glutamatergic input to INs and shift in the PN E/I balance. While IN function was largely normalized in adult females, males developed a distinct pathological phenotype characterized by reduced glutamatergic input to INs, impaired recruitment of INs and hyperexcitability of PNs. This male-specific dysfunction correlated with aberrant LA oscillatory dynamics in awake mice and deficits in fear processing. Our data suggest that the impaired glutamatergic wiring of interneurons is a key mechanism underlying the aberrant circuit dynamics in the LA after ELS exposure and contribute to the ELS-induced defects in fear processing. These findings highlight sex-specific developmental trajectories of interneuron connectivity as a potential factor contributing to ELS-induced psychiatric vulnerability.

">Precise temporal localisation of M/EEG effects with Bayesian generalised additive multilevel models</a></h4>

              
                Time-resolved electrophysiological measurements such as those obtained through magneto- and electroencephalography (M/EEG) offer a unique window onto the neural activity underlying cognitive processes. Researchers are often interested in determining whether and when these signals differ across experimental conditions or participant groups. The conventional approach involves mass univariate statistical testing across time and space followed by corrections for multiple comparisons or some form of cluster-based inference. While effective for controlling error rates at the cluster-level, cluster-based inference comes with a significant limitation: by shifting the focus of inference from individual time points to clusters, it prevents drawing conclusions about the precise onset or offset of observed effects. Here, we present a *model-based* alternative for analysing M/EEG timeseries, such as event-related potentials or time-resolved decoding accuracy. Our approach leverages Bayesian generalised additive multilevel models, providing posterior odds that an effect exceeds zero (or chance) at each time point, while naturally accounting for temporal dependencies and between-subject variability. Using both simulated and empirical M/EEG datasets, we show that this approach substantially outperforms conventional methods in estimating the onset and offset of neural effects, yielding more precise and reliable estimates. We provide an open-source R package implementing the method and describe how it can be integrated into M/EEG analysis pipelines using MNE-Python.

">Brain-wide organization of intrinsic timescales at single-neuron resolution</a></h4>

              
                Variations in intrinsic neural timescales across the mammalian forebrain reflect the anatomical structure and functional specialization of brain areas and individual neurons. Yet, the organization of timescales beyond the forebrain remains unexplored. We analyzed intrinsic timescales of single neurons across the entire mouse brain. Median timescales were up to fivefold longer in the midbrain and hindbrain than in the forebrain. Spatial patterns of gene expression predicted timescale variation at a resolution finer than brain-area boundaries. Across neurons, the diversity of timescales revealed a multiscale architecture, in which fast timescales determined regional differences in medians, while slow timescales universally followed a power-law distribution with an exponent near 2, indicating a shared dynamical regime across the brain consistent with the edge of instability or chaos. These organizing principles for the dynamics of single neurons across the brain provide a foundation for linking cellular activity with regional specialization and brain-wide computation.

">Individual differences drive social hierarchies in mouse societies</a></h4>

              
                Social structures in naturalistic animal groups emerge from repeated interactions between individuals. Yet it remains unclear whether social position reflects a single behavioral axis or arises from multiple, dissociable processes, and to what extent social structures are shaped by stable traits of the individuals or by emergent group dynamics. Addressing these questions in mice requires continuous, long-term tracking of multiple behaviors of individuals in unperturbed groups of sufficient size. To this end, we developed the NoSeMaze, a high-throughput, non-invasive sensor-rich habitat enabling scalable study of naturalistic social interactions. Spontaneous dyadic tube competitions revealed stable, transitive social hierarchies, with individual ranks persisting even after group reshuffling. Similarly, proactive chasing showed strong, trait-like stability across different social contexts. However, social status was not monolithic: rank and chasing were only moderately aligned. Their relationship was stronger in groups with less clarified hierarchies, where mice relied more on aggressive signaling to assert their position. Additionally, chasing was disproportionately concentrated among top-ranking individuals, suggesting active status negotiation within the social elite. Despite its stability, chasing thus fulfilled distinct functional roles depending on social context. Our findings support a systems-level view in which social position results from the interplay between stable individual traits and group-level dynamics. The modular NoSeMaze platform thereby reveals the multidimensional nature of social rank organization in mice.

">Asymmetric Social Representations in the Prefrontal Cortex for Cooperative Behavior</a></h4>

              
                Cooperation is a hallmark of social species, enabling individuals to achieve goals that are unattainable alone. Across species, cooperative behaviors are often organized by distinct social roles such as leaders and followers, yet the neural mechanisms supporting such role-based coordination remain elusive. Here we introduce a new paradigm for studying cooperation in mice, where pairs of animals engage in a joint spatial foraging task that naturally gives rise to stable leader-follower roles predictive of learning speed. Disruption of medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) activity, particularly in followers, impairs cooperation and induces reciprocal shifts in how animals weigh self- and partner-related cues for decision-making. Calcium imaging reveals that mPFC encodes both leadership dynamics and an egocentric social value map of the partner's position, each in an asymmetric, role-specific manner. Combining this behavior with a novel multi-agent inverse reinforcement learning framework, we identify latent value functions that guide cooperative decisions and are decodable from mPFC activity. These findings uncover fundamental neural computations that support cooperation, revealing how social roles shape decision-making in real time. Our work opens new avenues for investigating the cellular and circuit basis of social cognition and collective behavior.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The dorsal midline thalamus (DMT) is composed of the paraventricular (PV) and paratenial (PT) nuclei. While the anatomical and functional properties of PV are well-established, PT has remarkably received very little attention—even though the efferent projections of PV and PT are very similar. Using a combination of retrograde tracing and immunohistochemistry, we examined the anatomical inputs to PT and compared them with those to the anterior and posterior PV and to the anterodorsal nucleus of the thalamus. In addition, we examined orexinergic and serotonergic afferents to the PT, comparing them with those to other thalamic nuclei. We found that PT and PV receive input from a common set of structures, including the orbitomedial prefrontal cortex, nuclei of the diagonal band, septum, subiculum of the hippocampus, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, hypothalamus, reticular nucleus of the thalamus, dorsal raphe nucleus, and periaqueductal gray. However, the pattern and density of these various afferents to PT and PV significantly differed. For instance, PT received much stronger inputs from the orbitofrontal cortex, while PV received stronger projections from the subiculum of the hippocampus and more widespread input from the hypothalamus and the brainstem. By comparison, afferents to AD differed from PT (and PV), as AD received substantial input from the retrosplenial and anterior cingulate cortices, and uniquely from the lateral mammillary nucleus. Further, orexinergic (ORX) and serotonergic (5-HT) fibers distributed at best modestly to PT, which contrasted with quite dense ORX and 5-HT innervation of PV. The present findings, essentially representing the first comprehensive examination of afferent projections to PT, show that the inputs to PT mainly arise from limbic forebrain structures—with pronounced projections from the orbitofrontal cortex, nuclei of the diagonal band, and the reticular nucleus of the thalamus. The functional properties of PT partially overlap with those of PV, but as described herein PT also participates in unique affective, cognitive, and motivational behaviors.</p>

<p>The multi-compartmental organization of spleen-projecting neurons—from the celiac ganglia to the spleen—complicates anatomical identification. We provide a dissection guide, characterize their microstructure, and use neuronal tracing to validate the celiac ganglia–spleen connection while demonstrating that these neurons can be transduced by a viral vector.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>In recent years, several studies have demonstrated the crucial role played by the sympathetic spleen innervation in regulating immune cell function involving fighting pathogens or tissue injury. These findings have sparked interest across different research fields with a common goal of understanding and manipulating splenic sympathetic activity to modulate immune function and inflammation. However, the anatomical identification of spleen-projecting neurons in rodents presents a considerable challenge, given the multi-compartmentalized location of their cellular components.</p>
<p>This article addresses this challenge by providing a detailed anatomical dissection guide of the mouse celiac ganglion and splenic nerve, harboring the cell body and projecting axons, respectively. By combining antero- and retrograde neuronal tracing, immunofluorescence, 3D reconstruction, and viral tracing techniques, we validate the connectivity between the celiac ganglion and the spleen and provide insights into their microanatomy. Importantly, we demonstrate the feasibility of viral transduction in these neurons. Additionally, we identified nerve-associated macrophages (NAMs) within the splenic nerve and demonstrated their responsiveness to inflammatory stimuli. Our findings offer a comprehensive anatomical framework for studying spleen-projecting neurons, paving the way for future investigations into their role in immune regulation and inflammation, as well as their manipulation using advanced neurobiological tools.</p>

Bone health is a growing concern in aging populations, and bioactive peptides in dairy products offer a promising approach to preventing bone-related diseases. However, the lack of a public database for osteogenic peptides (OPs) has limited the computational detection efforts. In this work, we introduce OP-AND, a curated public database of osteogenic peptides. We also propose a novel hypothesis that peptides derived from proteins involved in osteoclast formation may serve as non-osteogenic. Considering the limited availability of OP data, we present SimPep, a deep learning framework that achieves 86.87% accuracy and 76.88% area under receiver-operating characteristic curve score using 5-fold cross-validation. SimPep’s performance is further evaluated on external datasets, and a pipeline is introduced to select potential OPs for experimental studies. The camel milk alpha s1-casein peptide ‘MKLLILTCLVAVALARPKYPLRYPEVF’ is highlighted as a top candidate for future exploration. The OP-AND database is available in https://github.com/CBRC-lab/SimPep_and_OP-AND.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1013376">The R-loop grammar predicts R-loop formation under different topological constraints</a></h4>

R-loops are transient three-stranded nucleic acids that form during transcription when the nascent RNA hybridizes with the template DNA, freeing the non-template strand of the DNA. There is growing evidence that R-loops play important roles in physiological processes such as the regulation of gene expression, and that they contribute to chromosomal instability and disease. It is known that R-loop formation is influenced by both the sequence and the topology of the DNA substrate, but many questions remain about how R-loops form and the three-dimensional structures that they adopt. Here we represent an R-loop as a word in a formal grammar, the <i>R-loop grammar</i>. We use the R-loop grammar to predict R-loop formation. We train the R-loop grammar on experimental data obtained by single-molecule R-loop footprinting and sequencing (SMRF-seq). Despite not explicitly encoding topological information, the R-loop grammar accurately predicts R-loop formation on plasmids with varying starting topologies and outperforms previous methods in R-loop prediction.

Data from cell viability assays, which measure cumulative division and death events in a population and reflect substantial cellular heterogeneity, are widely available. However, interpreting such data with mechanistic computational models is hindered because direct model/data comparison is often muddled. We developed an algorithm that tracks simulated division and death events in mechanistically-detailed single-cell lineages to enable such a model/data comparison and suggest causes of cell-cell drug response variability. Using our previously developed model of mammalian single-cell proliferation and death signaling, we simulated drug dose response experiments for four targeted anti-cancer drugs (alpelisib, neratinib, trametinib and palbociclib) and compared them to experimental data. Simulations are consistent with data for strong growth inhibition by trametinib (MEK inhibitor) and overall lack of efficacy for alpelisib (PI-3K inhibitor), but are inconsistent with data for palbociclib (CDK4/6 inhibitor) and neratinib (EGFR inhibitor). Model/data inconsistencies suggest that (i) the importance of CDK4/6 for driving the cell cycle may be overestimated, and (ii) the cellular balance between basal (tonic) and ligand-induced signaling is a critical determinant of receptor inhibitor response. Simulations show subpopulations of rapidly and slowly dividing cells in both control and drug-treated conditions. Variations in mother cells prior to drug treatment impinging on ERK pathway activity are associated with the rapidly dividing phenotype and trametinib resistance. This work lays a foundation for the application of mechanistic modeling to large-scale cell viability datasets and better understanding determinants of cellular heterogeneity in drug response.

                <p>by Francesca Soncin</p>

The placenta is one of the most diverse organs among eutherian mammals, and comparative placentation studies can reveal fundamental processes that support a successful pregnancy. A new study in PLOS Biology uses swine placental organoids and in vivo spatial transcriptomics to uncover key insights into placental cell diversity and evolution.

More work is needed to characterize the evolutionary diversity of placental development in eutherian mammals. This Primer discusses a recent PLOS Biology study that provides a rich spatial transcriptomic characterization of the porcine placenta and develops a new swine trophoblast organoid model

<p>Graphical abstract illustrating the study design, experimental workflow, and key findings from single-cell profiling of peripheral mononuclear cells in multiple sclerosis patients undergoing anti-CD20 therapy, revealing disease- and treatment-associated immune signatures.
</p>
<br/>
<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We aimed to investigate disease-related and anti-CD20 therapy-related changes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from multiple sclerosis (MS) patients compared to healthy controls (HC) using multi-omics single-cell analysis.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Targeted single-cell sequencing of transcriptomes and epitopes was performed on PBMCs isolated from 64 blood samples collected from MS patients at baseline and at 3 time points following anti-CD20 treatment, alongside HC. Multicolor spectral flow cytometry was performed on 15 of the samples.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Cell cluster analysis identified a subpopulation of classical monocytes with significantly high interleukin-1 beta (<i>IL1B</i>) expression and a pro-inflammatory profile compared to other monocyte clusters. This monocyte cluster expressed genes of pro-inflammatory chemokines and cytokines, such as <i>CXCL8</i>, <i>CCL3</i>, <i>CCL4</i>, and <i>TNFα</i> and was a major cell transmitter subset within the intercellular communication network. The IL1B<sup>high</sup> monocyte cluster was prevalent in HC (8.1% of PBMCs), but reduced in untreated MS patients (0.8% of PBMCs). High <i>CXCR4</i> expression and Gene Ontology-term analysis indicated that IL1B<sup>high</sup> monocytes from MS patients had central nervous system (CNS)-infiltrating abilities in contrast to HC, likely regulated by <i>LEF1</i>. After anti-CD20 treatment, IL1B<sup>high</sup> monocytes showed changes in pro-inflammatory gene expression and <i>MYC</i>-associated regulatory networks, and their abundance increased 6-fold in the blood.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our single-cell analysis identified a unique peripheral IL1B<sup>high</sup> monocyte cluster with a suggested CNS-infiltrating cellular phenotype that may explain its lower abundance in the blood of untreated compared to anti-CD20 treated MS patients. Treatment-associated changes in this population may contribute to the non-B cell related effects of anti-CD20 therapy. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is a highly variable, multisystemic genetic disorder caused by a CTG repeat expansion in the 3′ untranslated region of <i>DMPK.</i> Toxicity is exerted by repeat-containing <i>DMPK</i> transcripts that sequester muscleblind-like (MBNL) proteins and lead to deleterious yet predictable changes in alternative splicing. To contend with high phenotypic and molecular variability that complicate application of viral-based therapies, we develop and test a DM1-responsive genetic element to control viral-based therapeutic output.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We used MBNL-dependent cassette exons to generate adeno-associated virus (AAV)-compatible control elements (DMX<sup>on</sup>). Minigenes were tested in vitro using a Dox-inducible MBNL1 cell model and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived DM1 myotubes and in vivo using DM1 model mice following intramuscular and systemic AAV injection. DMX<sup>on</sup> splicing, correction of endogenous splicing or skeletal muscle myotonia, and prevention of cardiac toxicity associated with therapeutic MBNL1 overexpression were assessed.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>DMX<sup>on</sup> cassettes respond to MBNL1 dose or expression of CUG repeat RNA. DMX<sup>on</sup> controlled expression of therapeutic MBNL1 protein can improve skeletal muscle myotonia or prevent cardiac toxicity due to MBNL1 overexpression in mice.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>DMX<sup>on</sup> control elements can increase the therapeutic window of viral-based therapeutics in DM1, and activity is dependent upon delivered cargo and model severity. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>In Parkinson's disease (PD), the power of beta oscillations (± 13–30 hertz [Hz]) from subthalamic nucleus (STN) local field potentials (LFPs) is associated with motor symptoms. Beta power can be used for adaptive deep brain stimulation (aDBS) algorithms based upon symptom fluctuations. The time course of beta power modulations after levodopa intake at home remains to be described.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Ten-minute averages of beta peak power were recorded in 33 patients with PD treated with STN-DBS for a median duration of 134 days during the titration phase. Median beta power after scheduled medication intakes (n = 24,103) and the effects of peak frequency, stun effect, stimulation amplitude, levodopa dose, and preoperative levodopa response were analyzed using cluster-based permutation testing.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Beta power was significantly reduced between 30 and 140 minutes after intake for stimulation amplitudes between 0 and 2.1 mA (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01). This response was seen in low (12.7–20.5 Hz) but not high (21.5–30.3 Hz) beta frequencies. Significant clusters were found regardless of stun effect and preoperative levodopa response, during low stimulation amplitudes (&lt; 1 mA), and for 100 and 150 mg but not 50 mg doses. A linear mixed-effects model for the area under the curve (AUC) levodopa beta response (30–180 min) revealed a dose–response relationship, a stronger negative response in low-beta compared with high-beta frequencies, and no significant effect of stimulation amplitude.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>STN beta power responds to levodopa during low to moderate stimulation amperages, depending on the beta peak frequency and dose, which is informative for aDBS implementation. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                Mechanotransduction is essential for complex cellular behaviors such as muscle contraction and hearing sensation. RNA processing is a molecular mechanism that regulates gene expression. Bais and Giudice review the recently growing body of research showing that mechanotransduction and RNA processing work together to modulate cell adaptations to mechanical forces.

                PI5P4Kα is a critical metabolic gatekeeper in PDAC, promoting glucose and iron acquisition to support tumor survival. Arora et al. demonstrate that PI5P4Kα suppression disrupts the metabolic flexibility of PDAC cells, leading to apoptotic cell death, revealing a highly actionable therapeutic vulnerability.

                Suzuki et al. demonstrate that mosquito salivary gland extracts enhance flavivirus pathogenicity through TLR2-mediated recruitment of immune cells. These findings suggest that TLR2 contributes to early immune modulation at the infection site and represents a potential target for therapeutic intervention.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102681">The long noncoding RNA lnc-FANCI-2 intrinsically restricts RAS signaling in human papillomavirus type 16-infected cervical cancer cells</a></h4>

              
                Increased expression of lnc-FANCI-2, a newly discovered long noncoding RNA, is associated with cervical lesion progression from cervical intraepithelial neoplasia stage 1 (CIN1, low grade), CIN2–3 (high grade), to cervical cancer. Viral oncoprotein E7 of high-risk human papillomaviruses (HR-HPVs) and host transcription factor YY1 are two major factors promoting lnc-FANCI-2 expression. Using CRISPR-Cas9 technology, we knocked out the expression of <i>lnc-FANCI-2</i> in the HPV16-positive cervical cancer cell line, CaSki cells. The selected knockout (KO) single-cell clones displayed altered cell morphology and proliferation with changes of cellular soluble receptors, but normal HPV16 E6 and E7 expression. Relative to the parental cells, lnc-FANCI-2 KO cells exhibited significantly increased RAS signaling and epithelial-mesenchymal transition, but decreased response to IFN signaling, along with increased p-Akt and p-Erk1/2 (two RAS signaling effectors), IGFBP3, MCAM, VIM, and CCND2 (cyclin D2) and decreased expression of RAC3. lnc-FANCI-2 in CaSki interacts with cellular proteins H13, HNRH1, K1H1, MAP4K4, and RNPS1. MAP4K4 knockdown led to enhance the expression of p-Erk1/2 and p-Akt. High lnc-FANCI-2 and low MCAM levels in cervical cancer tissues were found to be associated with patients’ survival. A key function of lnc-FANCI-2 intrinsically regulates RAS signaling to impact cervical lesion progression and cervical cancer prognosis.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105471">Thrifty wide-context models of B cell receptor somatic hypermutation</a></h4>

              
                Somatic hypermutation (SHM) is the diversity-generating process in antibody affinity maturation. Probabilistic models of SHM are needed for analyzing rare mutations, understanding the selective forces guiding affinity maturation, and understanding the underlying biochemical process. High-throughput data offers the potential to develop and fit models of SHM on relevant data sets. In this article, we model SHM using modern frameworks. We are motivated by recent work suggesting the importance of a wider context for SHM; however, assigning an independent rate to each k-mer leads to an exponential proliferation of parameters. Thus, using convolutions on 3-mer embeddings, we develop ‘thrifty’ models of SHM of various sizes; these can have fewer free parameters than a 5-mer model and yet have a significantly wider context. These offer a slight performance improvement over a 5-mer model, and other modern model elaborations worsen performance. We also find that a per-site effect is not necessary to explain SHM patterns given nucleotide context. Also, the two current methods for fitting an SHM model—on out-of-frame sequence data and on synonymous mutations—produce significantly different results, and augmenting out-of-frame data with synonymous mutations does not aid out-of-sample performance.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105978">Cap-independent co-expression of dsRNA-sensing and NF-κB pathway inhibitors enables controllable self-amplifying RNA expression with reduced immunotoxicity</a></h4>

              
                Self-amplifying RNA (saRNA) holds promise for durable therapeutic gene expression, but its broader utility beyond vaccines is limited by potent innate immune responses triggered during replication. These responses shut down translation, induce cytotoxicity, degrade host mRNAs, and drive cytokine production. While exogenous immunosuppressants can blunt these effects, they complicate treatment and risk systemic side effects. To address this, we engineered ‘immune-evasive saRNA’ that intrinsically suppresses the innate immune pathways triggered by its own replication. This strategy leverages cap-independent translation to co-express a suite of inhibitors from a single saRNA transcript, targeting key innate immune pathways, including protein kinase R (PKR), oligoadenylate synthase (OAS)/RNase L, and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB). In primary mouse fibroblast-like synoviocytes, a cell type central to the pathology of joint diseases, immune-evasive saRNA enables sustained transgene expression without external immunosuppressants, substantially reducing cytotoxicity and antiviral cytokine secretion. Crucially, this system offers both concentration-dependent control of expression and on-demand termination via a small-molecule antiviral. Together, these findings establish a framework for developing saRNA therapeutics with an improved tolerability profile that can be switched off once therapeutic outcomes are met, offering a path toward a controllable gene expression platform that fills the therapeutic gap between the transience of mRNA and the permanence of viral vectors.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100257">Identifying in vivo genetic dependencies of melanocyte and melanoma development</a></h4>

              
                The advent of large-scale sequencing in both development and disease has identified large numbers of candidate genes that may be linked to important phenotypes. We have developed a rapid, scalable system for assessing the role of candidate genes using zebrafish. We generated transgenic zebrafish in which Cas9 was knocked in to the endogenous <i>mitfa</i> locus, a master transcription factor of the melanocyte lineage. The main advantage of this system compared to existing techniques is maintenance of endogenous regulatory elements. We used this system to identify both cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous regulators of normal melanocyte development. We then applied this to the melanoma setting to demonstrate that loss of genes required for melanocyte survival can paradoxically promote more aggressive phenotypes, highlighting that in vitro screens can mask in vivo phenotypes. Our genetic approach offers a versatile tool for exploring developmental processes and disease mechanisms that can readily be applied to other cell lineages.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104355">Multi-omics investigation of spontaneous T2DM macaque emphasizes gut microbiota could up-regulate the absorption of excess palmitic acid in the T2DM progression</a></h4>

              
                Although gut microbiota and lipid metabolites have been suggested to be closely associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), the interactions between gut microbiota, lipid metabolites, and the host in T2DM development remains unclear. Rhesus macaques may be the best animal model to investigate these relationships given their spontaneous development of T2DM. We identified eight spontaneous T2DM macaques and conducted a comprehensive study investigating the relationships using multi-omics sequencing technology. Our results from 16 S rRNA, metagenome, metabolome, and transcriptome analyses identified that gut microbiota imbalance, tryptophan metabolism and fatty acid β oxidation disorders, long-chain fatty acid (LCFA) accumulation, and inflammation occurred in T2DM macaques. We verified the accumulation of palmitic acid (PA) and activation of inflammation in T2DM macaques. Importantly, mice transplanted with spontaneous T2DM macaque fecal microbiota and fed a high PA diet developed prediabetes within 120 days. We determined that gut microbiota mediated the absorption of excess PA in the ileum, resulting in the accumulation of PA in the serum, consequently leading to T2DM in mice. In particular, we demonstrated that the specific microbiota composition was probably involved in the process. This study provides new insight into interactions between microbiota and metabolites and confirms causative effect of gut microbiota on T2DM development.

                Mesolimbic dopamine activity occasionally exhibits ramping dynamics, reigniting debate on theories of dopamine signaling. This debate is ongoing partly because the experimental conditions under which dopamine ramps emerge remain poorly understood. Here, we show that during Pavlovian and instrumental conditioning in mice, mesolimbic dopamine ramps are only observed when the inter-trial interval is short relative to the trial period. These results constrain theories of dopamine signaling and identify a critical variable determining the emergence of dopamine ramps.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102232">Temporal dynamics of viral fitness and the adaptive immune response in HCV infection</a></h4>

              
                Numerous studies have shown that viral variants that elude the host immune response may incur a fitness expense, diminishing the survival of the viral strain within the host, and the capacity of the variant to survive future transmission events. This definition can be divided into intrinsic fitness—fitness without immune pressure—and effective fitness, which includes immune influence. Co-occurring mutations outside immune-targeted epitope regions may also affect variant survival (epistasis). Analysis of viral fitness and epistasis over the non-structural protein regions is lacking for hepatitis C virus (HCV). Using a rare cohort of subjects recently infected with HCV, we build on prior work by integrating mathematical modeling and experimental data to examine the interplay between transmitted/founder (T/F) viruses, immune responses, fitness, and co-occurring mutations. We show that viral fitness declines during the first 90 days post-infection (DPI), associated with the magnitude of CD8 +T cell responses and early diversification. Fitness then rebounds in a complex pattern marked by co-occurring mutations. Finally, we demonstrate that an early, strong CD8 +T cell response in the absence of neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) exerts strong selective pressure, allowing escape and chronic infection. These insights support HCV vaccine strategies that elicit broad T and B cell immunity.

HGB reflects local neuronal activity, while SWOs inform on the temporal characteristics of movement, especially during repetitive tasks.

Here, we looked at Phase Amplitude Coupling (PAC) to assess interactions between SWO phase and HGB power. We use a publicly-available electrocorticography (ECoG) dataset recorded during repetitive motor execution (ME) and motor imagery (MI) of hand and tongue movements. We found channels with significant SWO-HGB PAC for all subjects and tasks, distributed across multiple brain regions. In the sensorimotor cortex PAC occurred at specific coupling phases and was primarily observed during ME, while frontal and temporal regions exhibited similar PAC levels across ME and MI but lacked distinct preferred coupling phases. When training decoders for movement detection, PAC underperformed compared to SWOs or HGB; however, it showed a strong correlation with accuracy when single-channel SWOs were used as decoding feature, highlighting its potential for channel selection. Weaker correlations were found when PAC was compared to task-related HGB power increases, suggesting that these represent distinct neural features.</span>

                <p>Cortical tracking of the speech envelope is an emerging, noninvasive measure of neurophysiological processing of speech that is being widely adopted. It demonstrates good ecological validity, as it allows researchers to study human processing of continuous, naturalistic speech containing dynamic spectrotemporal variations and rich linguistic content. While measures of cortical tracking have strong clinical and research applications, there is a lack of research documenting the reliability of these measures, including how they are affected by the stimulus and how the stimulus is represented, as well as electroencephalography (EEG) acquisition and analysis parameters. In this study, we measured the test&ndash;retest reliability of cortical tracking of the speech envelope across different stimuli (an audiobook vs a podcast), stimulus features (broadband envelope and its derivative, multiband envelope and its derivative), reference electrodes (average mastoid vs common average reference), and EEG frequency bands (delta, theta, full) in 26 neurotypical adults (20 female) to assess the potential for cortical tracking to serve as a reliable measure of speech processing. We also examined the amount of data required to achieve stable reliability estimates. We observed moderate to good test&ndash;retest reliability for most parameters with as little as 390&nbsp;s of data, supporting the utility of cortical tracking of the speech envelope as a reliable tool for assessing speech processing. The findings of this study will allow researchers to more effectively design and implement studies on cortical tracking in neurotypical adults and adults with language disorders.</p>

                <p>Sleep is a vital physiological phenomenon observed among almost all organisms. Although its exact purpose remains elusive, sleep has been linked to memory consolidation. In our present study, we investigated the role of sleep quality on sleep-dependent memory consolidation. Previous studies have shown that <I>tequila</I>, a serine protease, affects long-term memory (LTM) consolidation in flies. In the present study, we identified that the hypomorphic mutation in the <I>tequila</I> gene (<I>tequila<sup>f01792</sup></I>) leads to increased daytime sleep fragmentation at a very early age in male flies. Intrigued by this observation, we delved into further understanding the role of <I>tequila</I> in sleep-dependent memory consolidation by manipulating sleep duration using pharmacological methods such as GABA-A agonist. Inducing sleep using GABA-A agonist resulted in improved sleep during the day. This further led to a significant improvement in the LTM of these flies when compared with the vehicle-treated flies. In conclusion, daytime-dependent sleep fragmentation is possibly one of the reasons behind the LTM deficit observed in <I>tequila<sup>f01792</sup></I> flies. Furthermore, we observed that these flies had disturbed sleep only during the daytime, whereas in the night the flies had increased sleep duration. The increased sleep fragmentation during the daytime possibly leads to memory impairment and rescuing sleep fragmentation partially rescues memory consolidation. These outcomes suggest that the <I>tequila</I> gene is involved in sleep-dependent memory consolidation.</p>

Understanding animal movements at different spatial scales presents a significant challenge as their patterns can vary widely from daily foraging behaviours to broader migration or territorial movements. This challenge is of general interest because it impacts the ability to manage wildlife populations effectively. In this study, we conduct diffusion analysis based on European badger (<i>Meles meles</i>) movement data obtained from three different regions in the UK (Gloucestershire, Cornwall, and Northern Ireland) and fit a generalised linear mixed-effects model to examine the relationship between variables. We also feature a novel application of <i>extended dynamic mode decomposition</i> (EDMD) to uncover patterns relating to badger social organisation. By applying our approach to these different populations, we were able to assess its performance across a range of badger densities. A key result was that in some areas, EDMD clusters matched observed group home ranges, whilst in others, discrepancies likely arose because of population management interventions, such as badger culling. The methods presented offer a promising approach for studying territoriality and the impacts of management strategies on animal movement behaviour.

                <p>by Daiki Wakita, Satoshi Yamaji, Daiki Umetsu, Takeshi Kano</p>

Collective cell behavior is fundamental to structure multicellular organisms. There, constituting cells always have heterogeneous properties across cell types (macro-heterogeneity) and within a cell type (micro-heterogeneity). Many studies have described the existence of heterogeneity in various systems at the cellular level, whereas little has investigated its effect on the systems. Unveiling how heterogeneity plays a role in the collective behavior would build a bridge from microscopic to macroscopic biological phenomena. We use the muscle remodeling in <i>Drosophila</i> as a model system, in which drastic reconstruction processes involve the physical interactions of various cells. At the early pupal stages, hundreds of hemocytes vigorously migrate and decompose the larval muscles into fragments called sarcolytes. We used in vivo and in silico approaches to understand how the dynamics of the sarcolyte population are characterized by hemocytes and other cells in the environment. Our in vivo imaging showed that the sarcolyte population gradually reduced the speed while changing the spatial arrangements. We also found that the sarcolyte dynamics involve macro-heterogeneity, namely, the coexistence of fat body cells and hemocytes, as well as micro-heterogeneity within hemocytes. To computationally evaluate the effects of factors determining the speed and arrangement of the sarcolyte population, we built a mathematical model assuming simplified interactions between sarcolytes, hemocytes, and fat body cells. Our simulations showed that, firstly, the efficient spreading and stable pattern formation of sarcolytes were together achieved by a delayed emergence of fat body cells and the micro-heterogeneity in hemocyte motility. Secondly, based on the similarity of observed and simulated network-like arrangements of sarcolytes, spatial confinement was another factor that causes the stabilization of sarcolytes. This study provides a pattern formation mechanism by which macro- and micro-heterogeneous migratory cells generate a ‘dual-purpose’ collective behavior—quickly spreading particles throughout the field while efficiently organizing them into an orderly arrangement.

Apoptosis has been reported to drive regeneration in many species. Executioner caspases, the key effectors in apoptosis, are responsible for production and secretion of various pro-regenerative signals from apoptotic cells to the surrounding cells. However, whether executioner caspase activation (ECA) can promote regeneration without inducing apoptosis is poorly understood. Here, by generating transgenic mice carrying a lineage tracing system for cells that have experienced ECA, we demonstrate that ECA occurs in a few hepatocytes in homeostatic livers. The fraction of hepatocytes with ECA dramatically expands during regeneration after partial hepatectomy (PHx) or carbon tetrachloride (CCl<sub>4</sub>) treatment. Interestingly, rather than undergoing apoptosis, the majority of hepatocytes with ECA survive and proliferate during liver regeneration. Inhibition of ECA in livers results in reduced hepatocyte proliferation and impaired regeneration, whereas increasing ECA to a level sufficient to kill hepatocytes also impedes regeneration, suggesting that ECA needs to be precisely controlled at a sublethal level. Mechanistically, we show that ECA promotes hepatocyte proliferation through enhancing JAK/STAT3 activity. Our work reveals an essential apoptosis-independent role of executioner caspases in liver regeneration.

Ratios between two metabolites are sensitive indicators of metabolic changes. Lipidomic profiling studies have revealed that plasma ether lipids, a class of glycero- and glycerophospho-lipids with reported health benefits, are negatively associated with obesity. Here, we utilized lipid ratios as surrogate markers of lipid metabolism to explore the processes underlying the inverse relationship between ether lipid metabolism and obesity. Plasma lipidomics data from two independent human cohorts (<i>n</i> = 10,339 and <i>n</i> = 4,492) were integrated to assess the associations between 82 lipid ratios and obesity-related markers in males and females. Results were externally validated using mouse transcriptomics data from the Hybrid Mouse Diversity Panel (<i>n</i> = 152−227 across 74 strains). Genome-wide association studies using imputed genotypes from a population cohort (<i>n</i> = 4,492) were performed to examine the genetic architecture of the ratios. Findings showed that waist circumference (WC), body mass index, and waist–hip ratio were inversely associated with total plasmalogens relative to total phospholipids in both sexes. Ratios comprising product–substrate pairs positioned either side of enzymes involved in plasmalogen synthesis and degradation showed positive and negative associations with WC, respectively. Branched-chain fatty acids negatively correlated with WC, while omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids exhibited differing associations depending on their position within the pathway. Mouse transcriptomics corroborated these results. Genomics data showed strong associations between ratios containing choline-plasmalogens and single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the transmembrane protein 229B (<i>TMEM229B</i>) gene region. This work demonstrates the utility of lipid ratios in understanding lipid metabolism. By applying the ratios to multi-omic datasets, we identified alterations in enzymatic activity and genetic variants likely affecting ether lipid synthesis in obesity that could not have been obtained from lipidomics data alone. Additionally, we characterized a potential role for <i>TMEM229B</i>, offering new perspectives on ether lipid metabolism and regulation.

The placenta is a dynamic, embryo-derived organ essential for fetal growth and development. While all eutherian mammals have placentas composed of fetal-derived trophoblasts that mediate maternal–fetal exchange, their anatomical and histological structures vary across species due to evolutionary divergence. Despite the cellular heterogeneity of porcine trophoblasts in vivo, understanding the mechanisms driving porcine placental development has been limited by the lack of in vitro models replicating this heterogeneity. In this study, we derived swine trophoblast organoids (sTOs) from full-term porcine placentas, retaining key transcriptional signatures of in vivo trophoblasts. To identify conserved cell populations, we integrated Visium spatial transcriptomics from mid-gestation porcine placentas with single-cell transcriptomics from sTOs. Spatial transcriptomics revealed novel markers of the porcine uterus and placenta, enabling precise separation of histological structures at the maternal–fetal interface. The integration of tissue and sTO transcriptomics showed that sTOs spontaneously differentiate into distinct trophoblast populations, with conserved gene expression and cell communication programs. These findings demonstrate that sTOs recapitulate porcine placental trophoblast populations, offering a powerful model for advancing placentation research. Our work also provides a spatially resolved whole-transcriptome dataset of the porcine maternal–fetal interface, opening new avenues for discoveries in placental development, evolution, and health across mammals.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Cortical malformations, including microgyria, are often associated with neurodevelopmental comorbidities such as epilepsy and cognitive impairments in humans. To investigate how early cortical disruption leads to persistent behavioral impairments, we employed a neonatal neocortical focal freeze lesion (FFL) model of polymicrogyria in male Wistar rats. Unilateral cortical lesions were induced at postnatal day 0 (P0), and molecular changes in hippocampal gene expression (glutamatergic signaling: <i>Grin1</i>, <i>Grin2a</i>, <i>Grin2b</i>, <i>Gria1</i>, <i>Gria2</i>; neuroinflammation: <i>Nlrp3</i>, <i>Il1b</i>, <i>Il1rn</i>; glial markers: <i>Gfap</i>, <i>Aif1</i>; neurotrophic factors: <i>Bdnf</i>, <i>Fgf2</i>) were analyzed at P21. Behavioral outcomes, including locomotor activity, exploratory behavior, anxiety-like behavior, social interaction, and recognition memory, were assessed in adulthood (P70–P90). Neonatal cortical lesions induced subregion-specific alterations in hippocampal gene expression: <i>Grin2b</i> and <i>Gria1</i> expression decreased in the ipsilateral dorsal hippocampus, while <i>Grin2a</i>, <i>Bdnf</i>, and <i>Fgf2</i> increased in the contralateral ventral hippocampus. These molecular changes were associated with subsequent cognitive deficits (impaired recognition memory) and emotional dysregulation (heightened anxiety-like behavior) in adult rats, alongside reduced exploratory activity. Basic motor functions and sociability remained unaffected, and seizure susceptibility (assessed via maximal electroshock threshold) was unchanged, highlighting the specificity of the observed impairments. Our findings suggest a potential mechanistic link between early-life cortical malformations with microgyrus formation, dysregulation of hippocampal synaptic plasticity and neurotrophic signaling, and persistent neurobehavioral deficits. These results underscore the translational relevance of the freeze lesion model for studying the neurodevelopmental trajectory of cortical malformation-related comorbidities.</p>

<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) applications are finding use in real-world neurological settings. Whereas part 1 of this 3-part review series focused on the birth of AI and its foundational principles, this part 2 review shifts gears to explore more practical aspects of neurological care. The review details how large language models, generative AI, and robotics are supporting diagnostic accuracy, patient interaction, and treatment personalization. Special attention is given to ethical and philosophical facets of AI that nonetheless impact practical aspects of care and patient safety, such as accountability for AI-driven decisions and the “black box” nature of many algorithms. We will discuss whether AI systems can develop sentience, and the implications for human-AI collaboration. By examining human-robot interactions in neurology, this part 2 review highlights the profound impact AI could have on patient care and, as covered in the ensuing part 3, on global health care delivery and data analytics, while maintaining ethical oversight and human control.

<p>Autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxias (ARCAs) represent over 200 clinically heterogeneous genetic conditions involving degeneration of the cerebellum and associated tracts with resultant impairment of balance and coordination. Advancements in genomic testing have enabled rapid identification of the majority of known recessive disorders, shifting research focus to the development of targeted mechanistic treatments addressing underlying physiological pathways. Molecular classification allows recognition of cellular, biochemical, and genetic targets for high-effect precision therapy development. ARCAs represent a significant global health burden, requiring establishment of a robust pathway for novel therapeutic discovery through modification of mechanisms of disease pathogenesis and subsequent clinical trial development.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The Glibenclamide for Large Hemispheric Infarction Analyzing mRS and Mortality (CHARM) trial enrolled participants with large hemispheric infarction, randomized to a placebo or intravenous glyburide. Our objective in this post-hoc study was to evaluate the relationship between baseline stroke volume and the potential efficacy of i.v. glyburide.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Participants enrolled in CHARM and aged ≤70 years were included if a &lt;125 ml ischemic core lesion volume was measured by computed tomography perfusion or diffusion magnetic resonance imaging. The primary endpoint was a shift analysis on the 90-day modified Rankin Scale. Independent variables included age, sex, baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, world region, tissue plasminogen activator, and endovascular thrombectomy.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 147 participants with a baseline large-core stroke volume &lt;125 ml were available for this analysis (mean age 58 years, 37% women, baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale 18, and the time to study drug was 9.1 ± 2.1 h). The median baseline core volume of 92 mL (IQR 81–107 ml) did not differ by treatment arm. The i.v. glyburide-treated participants had a favorable shift in outcome relative to the placebo (adjusted common odds ratio 2.11, 95% CI 1.10–4.01, <i>p</i> = 0.02). In patients who underwent endovascular thrombectomy, i.v. glyburide-treated subjects had a favorable outcome (adjusted common odds ratio 8.19, 95% CI 1.60–42.0, <i>p</i> = 0.01), fewer decompressive craniectomies (0% vs 25%, <i>P</i> = 0.02), less midline shift (4.2 ± 2.5 mm vs 7.6 ± 5.5 mm, <i>p</i> = 0.02), and lower 90-day mortality (5.6% vs 31%, <i>p</i> = 0.05) compared with the placebo, respectively.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This post-hoc analysis of the CHARM trial provides hypothesis-generating evidence that i.v. glyburide may improve outcome in large-core stroke &lt;125 ml, especially among endovascular thrombectomy-treated patients. These results require confirmation in a prospective randomized clinical trial. ANN NEUROL 2025;98:616–624</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Elezanumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds repulsive guidance molecule a (RGMa), an inhibitor of central nervous system regeneration after inflammation or injury. The aim was to assess the safety and efficacy of elezanumab in relapsing and progressive forms of multiple sclerosis (MS).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>RADIUS-R and RADIUS-P were phase 2 trials in relapsing (RADIUS-R) or progressive (RADIUS-P) MS. Participants were randomized to intravenous elezanumab 400mg, 1800mg, or placebo every 4 weeks through week 48. The primary endpoint was the mean Overall Response Score (ORS).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In RADIUS-R, 208 participants received elezanumab 400mg (n = 69), elezanumab 1800mg (n = 69), or placebo (n = 70). In RADIUS-P, 123 participants received elezanumab 400mg (n = 40), elezanumab 1800mg (n = 40), or placebo (n = 43). The primary endpoint of ORS was not met in either study. For RADIUS-R, mean ORS was −0.2 with effect size of −0.2 for elezanumab 400mg and −0.2 with effect size of −0.2 for elezanumab 1800mg. For RADIUS-P, mean ORS was 0.0 with effect size of 0.0 for elezanumab 400mg and 0.1 with effect size of 0.1 for elezanumab 1800mg.</p>
<p>Elezanumab was well tolerated; the rate of serious adverse events was similar across treatment groups in both studies. Adverse events with ≥10% of elezanumab population were falls, urinary tract infections, headaches in RADIUS-R and RADIUS-P, and also fatigue, infusion-related reactions, and muscular weakness in RADIUS-P.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Elezanumab was safe and well tolerated, but did not meet the primary endpoint in either study. ANN NEUROL 2025;98:590–602</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To determine the impact of dopamine deficiency and isolated rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) on cognitive performance in early neuronal α-synuclein disease (NSD) with hyposmia but without motor disability.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Using Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative baseline data, cognitive performance was assessed with a cognitive summary score (CSS) derived from robust healthy control (HC) norms. Performance was examined for participants with hyposmia in early NSD-Integrated Staging System (NSD-ISS), either stage 2A (cerebrospinal fluid α-synuclein seed amplification assay [SAA]+, dopamine transporter scan [DaTscan]−) or 2B (SAA+, DaTscan+).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Participants were stage 2A (n = 101), stage 2B (N = 227), and HCs (n = 158). Although stage 2 had intact Montreal Cognitive Assessment scores (mean [SD] = 27.0 [2.3]), stage 2A had a numerically worse CSS (z-score mean difference = 0.05, <i>p =</i> NS; effect size = 0.09) and stage 2B a statistically worse CSS (z-score mean difference = 0.23, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05; effect size = 0.40) compared with HCs. In stage 2A, hyposmia alone was associated with normal cognition, but those with comorbid iRBD had significantly worse cognition (z-score mean difference = 0.33, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05, effect size =0.50). In stage 2B, hyposmia alone had abnormal cognition (z-score mean difference = 0.18, <i>p</i> = 0.0078, effect size = 0.29), and superimposed iRBD had a statistically significant additive effect.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Using a novel CSS, we demonstrated that hyposmia is associated with cognitive deficits in prodromal NSD without motor disability, particularly when comorbid dopamine system impairment or comorbid iRBD is present. Therefore, it is critical to include and assess cognition at all stages when studying synuclein disease, even in the absence of motor disability. ANN NEUROL 2025;98:482–491</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27266?af=R">Midlife Steroid‐Binding Globulin Levels and In Vivo Neuroimaging Measures of Tau in Older Men and Women</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>In men and women, sex steroid hormones have been associated with increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia. We aimed to investigate the influence of midlife testosterone and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) levels on later-life in vivo markers of β-amyloid (Aβ) and tau deposition in clinically healthy older men.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This time-lagged study includes participants enrolled in the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) Third Generation cohort. One hundred fifty-nine men (mean age<sub>PET-scan</sub> = 58 [±/9] years) underwent blood (hormones) collection in 2002 to 2005, and then a single Aβ <sup>11</sup>C-Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB) PiB-positron emission tomography (PET) and <sup>18</sup>F-Flortaucipir (FTP)-PET scan in 2016 to 2020. Linear regressions examined sex-stratified associations among total testosterone, and SHBG with Aβ-PET, and tau-PET after adjusting for age. Separate models examined the moderating effect of Aβ-PET and <i>APOE</i>ε4.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In men, the elevated SHBG level was associated with lower tau-PET in entorhinal (B<sub>unstandardized</sub> = −0.001 [SE = 0.0005], <i>p</i> = 0.007), inferior temporal (B<sub>unstandardized</sub> = −0.001 [SE = 0.0004], <i>p</i> = 0.04), and rostral middle frontal regions (B<sub>unstandardized</sub> = −0.001 [SE = 0.0004], <i>p</i> = 0.02). These findings were largely driven by <i>APOE</i>ε4 non-carriers. Testosterone levels were not associated with the Aβ-PET or tau-PET signal.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We report a potential protective effect of SHBG levels on tau-PET burden in men. Higher levels of SHBG have been associated with lower risk of vascular-related comorbidities, such as obesity and diabetes, and is regulated by modifiable lifestyle factors. Given mounting evidence of a link between vascular injury and tauopathy in preclinical AD, our findings suggest an intriguing protective cardiovascular pathway for men against higher tau burden later in life.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27267?af=R">Longitudinal Analysis of Neuroradiological Biomarkers for Fragile X‐Associated Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome and Implications for Clinical Trials</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective of this study was to show the capacity of structural brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures to serve as monitoring biomarkers for Fragile X-Associated Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>From 2 longitudinal studies of male <i>FMR1</i> premutation carriers, 2 brain MRI scans were selected from each participant, collected within a period of 2 years (12 healthy controls, 17 carriers without FXTAS, and 51 carriers with FXTAS; all men, ages 40 to 80 years), along with clinical measurements and <i>FMR1</i> cytosine-guanine-guanine (CGG) repeat numbers. Candidate MRI biomarkers included whole brain white matter hyperintensity (WMH) and cerebellar, brainstem, and whole brain volumes.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In the FXTAS group, mixed-effects models demonstrated significant volume loss across an average interval of 1.32 years for the whole brain, cerebellum and brain stem volumes, and significant increases in WMH, with large magnitude effects for whole brain and WMH volumes. All MRI measures showed deterioration with advancing FXTAS stage, with the strongest pattern shown in WMH volume. CGG repeat number showed significant nonlinear associations with all 4 brain MRI metrics, with mid-range CGG repeat carriers evidencing the worst brain atrophy and WMHs.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Structural brain MRI measurements, especially those capturing white matter deterioration, are correlated with <i>FMR1</i> premutation size of CGG repeat length and sensitive to FXTAS disease progression across a relatively short interval of less than 2 years, making them potentially suitable as surrogate end points for clinical trials.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>A growing body of evidence indicates a strong genetic overlap between developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEEs) and movement disorders. De novo loss-of-function variants in <i>NUS1</i> have been recently identified in DEE cases. Herein, we report a large cohort of cases with pathogenic <i>NUS1</i> variants and describe their clinical presentation and the details of the associated epilepsy and movement disorders.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Cases with <i>NUS1</i>-related disorders were identified through a multicentric international collaboration made possible by the GeneMatcher platform. Clinical data were acquired through retrospective case-note review.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We identified 41 subjects carrying 38 different pathogenic or likely pathogenic heterozygous <i>NUS1</i> variants. The majority of cases displayed developmental delays and intellectual disability of variable severity. Epilepsy was present in 68.3% of cases (28/41) with onset typically in early childhood. Strikingly, 87.8% of cases (36/41) presented with movement disorders and for 13 of these cases the movement disorder was not accompanied by epilepsy. The phenomenology of the movement disorders was complex with myoclonus observed in 68.3% of cases (28/41), either in isolation or in combination with dystonia, ataxia, and/or parkinsonism. Seven cases that otherwise did not have prominent movement disorders had mild incoordination and intention tremor, suggestive of cerebellar dysfunction. There was no observed genotype–phenotype correlation, suggesting that other genetic or acquired factors impact the clinical presentation.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Heterozygous <i>NUS1</i> pathogenic variants cause a complex neurological disorder, variably featuring developmental and epileptic encephalopathies and a broad spectrum of movement disorders, which represent the major source of neurological disability for most cases.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We aimed to characterize the phenotypic spectrum and functional consequences associated with variants in <i>HCN2</i>, encoding for the hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide (HCN) gated channel 2.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>GeneMatcher facilitated the recruitment of 21 individuals with <i>HCN2</i> variants from 15 unrelated families, carrying <i>HCN2</i> variants. In vitro functional studies were performed by electrophysiology with <i>Xenopus laevis</i> oocytes and membrane trafficking was investigated in HEK cells by confocal imaging. Structural 3D-analysis of the <i>HCN2</i> variants was performed.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The phenotypic spectrum included developmental delay/intellectual disability (DD/ID, 17/21), epilepsy (10/21), language disorders (16/21), movement disorders (12/21), and axial hypotonia (10/21). Thirteen pathogenic variants (12 new and 1 already described) were identified: 11 missense (8 monoallelic and 3 biallelic), 1 recurrent inframe deletion (monoallelic), and 1 frameshift (biallelic). Functional analysis of p.(Arg324His) variant showed a strong increase of HCN2 conductance, whereas p.(Ala363Val) and p.(Met374Leu) exhibited dominant negative effects. The p.(Leu377His), p.(Pro493Leu), and p.(Gly587Asp) variants rendered HCN2 electrophysiologically silent and impaired membrane trafficking. Structural 3D-analysis revealed that, except for p.(Arg324His), all variants altered HCN2 stability.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings broadened the HCN2 disease clinical spectrum to include DD/ID with or without epilepsy. Functional analysis in cellular models reveal that pathogenic <i>HCN2</i> variants can cause either loss-of-function or gain-of-function, providing critical information for the development of targeted therapies for <i>HCN2</i>-related disorders.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Epilepsy surgery needs predictive features that are easily implemented in clinical practice. Previous studies are limited by small sample sizes, lack of external validation, and complex computational approaches. We aimed to identify and validate visually stereo-electroencephalography (SEEG) features with the highest predictive value for surgical outcome, and assess the reliability of their visual extraction.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We included 177 patients with drug-resistant epilepsy who underwent SEEG-guided surgery at 4 epilepsy centers. We assessed the predictive performance of 10 SEEG features from various SEEG periods for surgical outcome, using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, and considering resected channels and surgical outcome as the gold standard. Findings were validated externally using balanced accuracy. Six experts, blinded to outcome, evaluated the visual reliability of the optimal feature using interrater reliability, percentage agreement (standard deviation ± SD) and Gwet's kappa (κ ± SD).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The derivation cohort comprised 100 consecutive patients, each with at least 1-year of postoperative follow up (40% temporal lobe epilepsy; 42% Engel Ia). Spatial co-occurrence of gamma spikes and preictal spikes emerged as the optimal predictive feature of surgical outcome (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.82). Applying the optimized threshold from the derivation cohort, external validation in 2 datasets showed similar performances (balanced accuracy 69.2% and 73.2%). Expert interrater reliability for gamma spikes (percentage agreement, 96% ± 2%; κ, 0.63 ± 0.16) and preictal spikes (percentage agreement, 92% ± 2%; κ, 0.65 ± 0.18) were substantial.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Spatial co-occurrence of gamma spikes and preictal spikes predicts surgical outcome. These visually identifiable features may reduce the burden of SEEG analysis by reducing analysis time, and improve outcome by guiding surgical resection margins. ANN NEUROL 2025;98:547–560</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Seizures are a highly prevalent comorbidity in Alzheimer's disease (AD), with a 2- to 6-fold increased risk, and are associated with accelerated cognitive decline. Despite growing research on seizure detection and treatment in AD, the cognitive profiles of individuals with both AD and seizures remain poorly characterized using comprehensive neuropsychological methods.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Clinical and cognitive data from individuals age 65+ with AD were analyzed from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) dataset. Cognitive domains assessed included memory, language, attention, processing speed, and executive function. Raw scores were converted into z-scores using a control sample (n = 14,665). Group comparisons were conducted using independent <i>t</i> tests, χ<sup>2</sup> tests, and Kruskal-Wallis tests, and logistic regression was used to examine factors associated with seizures.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Among 9,662 individuals with AD, 1.2% (n = 117) had active seizures (AD-S). The AD-S group was younger, had higher stroke and transient ischemic attack rates, earlier cognitive decline, longer symptom duration, cognitive fluctuations, abrupt cognitive changes, and worse cognitive and functional outcomes. Cognitive deficits in AD-S, particularly in executive function and processing speed, persisted after adjusting for dementia severity. Compared to vascular dementia, AD-S individuals exhibited greater impairments in fluency, naming, and processing speed.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Comorbid AD and seizures are associated with distinct cognitive and clinical profiles, greater vascular disease burden, and more severe dementia.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27286?af=R">Uncovering Image‐Driven Subtypes with Distinct Pathology and Clinical Course in Autopsy‐Confirmed Four Repeat Tauopathies</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>The four-repeat (4R) tauopathies are a group of neurodegenerative diseases, including progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), corticobasal degeneration (CBD), and globular glial tauopathy (GGT). This study aimed to characterize spatiotemporal atrophy progression using structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and to examine its relationship with clinical course and neuropathology in a cohort of autopsy-confirmed 4R tauopathies.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The study included 85 autopsied patients (54 with PSP, 28 with CBD, and 3 with GGT) who underwent multiple 3T MRI scans, as well as neuropsychological, neurological, and speech/language examinations, and standardized postmortem neuropathological evaluations. An unsupervised machine-learning algorithm, Subtype and Stage Inference (SuStaIn), was applied to the cross-sectional brain volumes to estimate spatiotemporal atrophy patterns and data-driven subtypes and stages in each patient. The relationships among estimated subtypes, pathological diagnoses, and longitudinal changes in clinical testing were examined.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The SuStaIn algorithm identified 2 distinct subtypes: (1) the subcortical subtype, in which atrophy progresses from the midbrain to the cortex, and (2) the cortical subtype, in which atrophy progresses from the frontal cortex to the subcortical regions. The subcortical subtype was more associated with typical PSP, whereas the cortical subtype was more associated with atypical PSP with a cortical distribution of pathology and CBD (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). The cortical subtype had a faster rate of change on the PSP Rating Scale than the subcortical subtype (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>SuStaIn analysis revealed 2 MRI-driven subtypes with distinct spatiotemporal atrophy patterns, clinical courses, and neuropathology. Our findings contribute to a comprehensive and improved understanding of disease progression and its relationship to tau pathology in 4R tauopathies. ANN NEUROL 2025;98:492–507</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27280?af=R">Carotid Revascularization Versus Medical Management for Ischemic Stroke with Ipsilateral Carotid Web: A Systematic Review and Meta‐Analysis</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>Carotid artery web is an underrecognized cause of ischemic stroke and is associated with a high risk of recurrent events. It is uncertain whether medical management or carotid revascularization is beneficial for patients with ischemic stroke and ipsilateral carotid web. In the absence of large randomized clinical trials and observational studies, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis comparing medical management and carotid revascularization in this population.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The systematic review was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42024485069). We searched five databases: Embase, Scopus, MEDLINE, Web of Science, and CINAHL. We included observational studies that studied the association between recurrent stroke in patients with ipsilateral carotid web receiving medical management (antiplatelet and anticoagulation) and carotid revascularization. Random effects modeling was performed, and risk ratio with 95% confidence intervals were reported.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We included 17 studies (16 published and 1 institutional study). In the medical management group, 32% (90/281) of patients experienced recurrent ischemic stroke ipsilateral to the carotid web. The meta-analysis revealed a significantly lower risk of recurrent ischemic stroke with carotid revascularization (relative risk 0.11, 95% confidence interval 0.06–0.28, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001, <i>I</i>
<sup>2</sup> = 14.5%). Both carotid endarterectomy and carotid artery stenting were equally effective in reducing recurrent stroke risk (relative risk 0.44, 95% confidence interval 0.11–1.76, <i>p</i> = 0.99).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Carotid revascularization is associated with reduced recurrence rates, with no difference between revascularization subtypes (carotid endarterectomy vs carotid artery stenting). However, given the small, heterogeneous cohorts and the uncertain natural history of carotid artery web under medical management, these findings should be interpreted with caution until prospective, controlled comparative effectiveness studies are performed.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27281?af=R">Effect of Cumulative Exposure to Ocrelizumab on Memory B‐Cell Repopulation Dynamics in Multiple Sclerosis</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Extended interval dosing protocols of B-cell-depleting therapies in multiple sclerosis (MS) are being developed, but intervals between infusions are often arbitrary. We describe total and memory B-cell repopulation dynamics in MS patients on a memory B-cell-guided extended interval dosing ocrelizumab (OCR) protocol.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>OCR was administered on peripheral CD19+ CD27+ memory B-cell repopulation (≥1 cell/μL), monitored using fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Associations with CD19+ B cells and CD19+ CD27+ memory B cells were tested using mixed-effect hurdle models, with rate ratios (RR) predicting cell counts and odds ratios (OR) predicting cell depletion.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We collected 1,369 samples from 101 patients, 61.4% women, aged 42.2 years (IQR 32.3–51.1 years) and follow up 4.1 years (IQR 2.9–5.2 years). The median time between samples and previous OCR infusion was 6.6 months (IQR 4.7–8.8 months). Time since previous OCR infusion was positively associated with CD19+ B cells (RR = 1.11, 95% CI 1.10–1.11, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and CD19+ CD27+ memory B-cell counts (RR = 1.11, 95% CI 1.09–1.13, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). A greater cumulative OCR dose was associated with persistent CD19+ CD27+ memory B-cell depletion (OR 1.90, 1.57–2.31, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). CD19+ B-cell repopulation was inversely associated with age (RR = 0.82, 95% CI 0.71–0.95, <i>p</i> = 0.010). Female patients showed a lower ratio of CD19+ CD27+ memory B cells/total CD19+ B cells (RR = 0.42, 95% CI 0.26–0.69, <i>p</i> = 0.001). Disease activity was low, with most radiological activity observed within the first year of OCR treatment.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Memory B-cell repopulation becomes slower with increasing cumulative OCR dose. Age- and sex-related mechanisms probably influence repopulation dynamics. Given the evidence for a pathogenic role of memory B cells, these observations could be considered when planning extended interval dosing strategies of OCR treatment.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27285?af=R">Timing of Changes in Alzheimer's Disease Plasma Biomarkers as Assessed by Amyloid and Tau PET Clocks</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective of this study was to evaluate the timing of change of Alzheimer's disease (AD) plasma biomarkers (Aβ42/Aβ40, p-tau217, p-tau181, GFAP, and NfL) from six different assay platforms, alongside established AD biomarkers, using amyloid and tau positron emission tomography (PET)-based AD progression timelines.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), including 784 individuals with longitudinal amyloid PET and 359 with longitudinal tau PET, were analyzed to estimate the age at amyloid and tau PET positivity, respectively. Longitudinal plasma biomarker measurements were available from 190 individuals with an estimated amyloid PET positivity age and from 70 individuals with an estimated tau PET positivity age. In a subset of 17 clinical progressors, age at tau PET positivity strongly predicted symptom onset, allowing for estimation of symptom onset age. Biomarker trajectories based on time from amyloid or tau PET positivity or symptom onset were modelled using Generalized Additive Mixed models. Time intervals of significant biomarker change and the earliest timepoints at which biomarkers exceeded predefined abnormality thresholds were identified.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>All plasma biomarkers except NfL became abnormal prior to established thresholds for amyloid and tau PET positivity. Plasma Aβ42/Aβ40 became abnormal very early in both amyloid PET and tau PET timelines, while plasma GFAP became abnormal early in the tau PET timeline. Plasma Aβ42/Aβ40 levels plateaued, whereas plasma p-tau217, p-tau181, GFAP, and NfL levels increased throughout the modeled disease progression. Some variations in the timing of these changes were observed across different biomarker assays.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These findings suggest that the plasma Aβ42/Aβ40 may be useful in identifying individuals with very low levels of amyloid pathology, whereas p-tau, GFAP, and NfL may be useful in staging disease progression. ANN NEUROL 2025;98:508–523</p>

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is a focal epilepsy extensively examined through advanced neuroimaging techniques to elucidate its pathophysiological mechanisms. This study investigates the differences in dynamic brain activity and gene expression in TLE patients. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data were collected from 60 TLE patients and 30 healthy controls (HC). Dynamic amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (dALFF) was employed to identify regions with dALFF variance differences, which were then designated as regions of interest (ROIs). Co-activation patterns (CAP) was constructed to compare brain dynamic changes. Pearson's correlation analysis and pathway enrichment analysis were used to explore the potential molecular mechanisms associated with atypical neural dynamics in TLE. Five CAP states were identified from the rs-fMRI data. Compared to HC, TLE with cognitive normal (TLE-CN) and TLE with cognitive impairment (TLE-CI) patients exhibited atypical state-specific temporal characteristics, including number of states (counts), fraction of time, persistence, resilience, and transition probability (TP) between states. Importantly, dynamic indicators of CAP states were significantly correlated with cognitive performance. Furthermore, 2752 genes were significantly associated with atypical dynamic brain states in TLE, with these genes primarily enriched in synapse-related pathways. This study offers novel insights into atypical neural dynamics from a temporal perspective. The brain network dynamics defined by CAP analysis deepen our understanding of the neurobiological underpinnings of TLE and TLE-CI, revealing a link between atypical neural architecture and gene expression in TLE.</p>

<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>To assess the impact of SK channel agonists on seizure-like events (SLEs) in various seizure models in slices of the temporal cortex obtained from pharmacoresistant patients. SLEs were triggered by applying 4-aminopyridine (100 μM) to slices of the entorhinal cortex taken from both normal and pilocarpine-treated rats. Additionally, SLEs were induced in slices of the temporal cortex obtained from individuals who had undergone epilepsy surgery. In the case of human slices, SLEs were also provoked by increasing potassium levels along with the administration of either 4-AP (100 μM) or bicuculline (50 μM). The activation of SK2/3 channels by the compound CYPPA (<i>n</i> = 8) effectively prevented SLEs in slices from the brains of normal rats, pilocarpine-treated rats (<i>n</i> = 8), and in human cortex slices (<i>n</i> = 9) when SLEs were triggered by 4-AP. In human temporal cortex slices, CYPPA also demonstrated efficacy in preventing SLEs induced by an elevation in potassium concentration combined with bicuculline application (<i>n</i> = 5). SKA-31, exhibited efficacy in slices from normal rats (<i>n</i> = 8), rats treated with pilocarpine (<i>n</i> = 8), and in human slices (<i>n</i> = 7) when SLEs were provoked by 4-AP. However, its effectiveness was limited when applied to human tissue slices exposed to bicuculline and elevated potassium levels. The SK1 channel activator GW-542573X displayed only moderate anticonvulsant effects in the models under investigation. SK2 channels showed the highest effectiveness across the different epilepsy models. Sensitivity to the SK3 channel activator was found to be more pronounced compared to the other two activators studied.</p>
