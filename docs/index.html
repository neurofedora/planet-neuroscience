              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00016">Time-Irreversible Quantum-Classical Dynamics of Molecular Models in the Brain</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2503.00016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This manuscript aims to illustrate a quantum-classical dissipative theory (suited to be converted to effective algorithms for numerical simulations) within the long-term project of studying molecular processes in the brain. Other approaches, briefly sketched in the text, have advocated the need to deal with both quantum and classical dynamic variables when studying the brain. At variance with these other frameworks, the manuscript's formalism allows us to explicitly treat the classical dynamical variables. The theory must be dissipative not because of formal requirements but because brain processes appear to be dissipative at the molecular, physiological, and high functional levels. We discuss theoretically that using Brownian dynamics or the Nos\`e-Hoover-Chain thermostat to perform computer simulations provides an effective way to introduce an arrow of time for open quantum systems in a classical environment. In the future, We plan to study classical models of neurons and astrocytes, as well as their networks, coupled to quantum dynamical variables describing, e.g., nuclear and electron spins, HOMO and LUMO orbitals of phenyl and indole rings, ion channels, and tunneling protons.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00655">Implicit Generative Modeling by Kernel Similarity Matching</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2503.00655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how the brain encodes stimuli has been a fundamental problem in computational neuroscience. Insights into this problem have led to the design and development of artificial neural networks that learn representations by incorporating brain-like learning abilities. Recently, learning representations by capturing similarity between input samples has been studied to tackle this problem. This approach, however, has thus far been used to only learn downstream features from an input and has not been studied in the context of a generative paradigm, where one can map the representations back to the input space, incorporating not only bottom-up interactions (stimuli to latent) but also learning features in a top-down manner (latent to stimuli). We investigate a kernel similarity matching framework for generative modeling. Starting with a modified sparse coding objective for learning representations proposed in prior work, we demonstrate that representation learning in this context is equivalent to maximizing similarity between the input kernel and a latent kernel. We show that an implicit generative model arises from learning the kernel structure in the latent space and show how the framework can be adapted to learn manifold structures, potentially providing insights as to how task representations can be encoded in the brain. To solve the objective, we propose a novel Alternate Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) based algorithm and discuss the interpretation of the optimization process. Finally, we discuss how this representation learning problem can lead towards a biologically plausible architecture to learn the model parameters that ties together representation learning using similarity matching (a bottom-up approach) with predictive coding (a top-down approach).

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01226">Dementia Insights: A Context-Based MultiModal Approach</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2503.01226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dementia, a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, affects memory, reasoning, and daily functioning, creating challenges for individuals and healthcare systems. Early detection is crucial for timely interventions that may slow disease progression. Large pre-trained models (LPMs) for text and audio, such as Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT), Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), and Contrastive Language-Audio Pretraining (CLAP), have shown promise in identifying cognitive impairments. However, existing studies generally rely heavily on expert-annotated datasets and unimodal approaches, limiting robustness and scalability. This study proposes a context-based multimodal method, integrating both text and audio data using the best-performing LPMs in each modality. By incorporating contextual embeddings, our method improves dementia detection performance. Additionally, motivated by the effectiveness of contextual embeddings, we further experimented with a context-based In-Context Learning (ICL) as a complementary technique. Results show that GPT-based embeddings, particularly when fused with CLAP audio features, achieve an F1-score of $83.33\%$, surpassing state-of-the-art dementia detection models. Furthermore, raw text data outperforms expert-annotated datasets, demonstrating that LPMs can extract meaningful linguistic and acoustic patterns without extensive manual labeling. These findings highlight the potential for scalable, non-invasive diagnostic tools that reduce reliance on costly annotations while maintaining high accuracy. By integrating multimodal learning with contextual embeddings, this work lays the foundation for future advancements in personalized dementia detection and cognitive health research.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01761">A comprehensive and reliable protocol for manual segmentation of the human claustrum using high-resolution MRI</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2503.01761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The claustrum is a thin gray matter structure in each brain hemisphere, characterized by exceptionally high connectivity with nearly all brain regions. Despite extensive animal studies on its anatomy and function and growing evidence of claustral deficits in neuropsychiatric disorders, its specific roles in normal and abnormal human brain function remain largely unknown. This is primarily due to its thin and complex morphology, which limits accurate anatomical delineation and neural activity isolation in conventional in vivo neuroimaging. To facilitate future neuroimaging studies, we developed a comprehensive and reliable manual segmentation protocol based on a cellular-resolution brain atlas and high-resolution (0.7^3 mm) MRI data. The protocols involve detailed guidelines to delineate the entire claustrum, including the inferior parts that have not been clearly described in earlier MRI studies. Additionally, we propose a geometric method to parcellate the claustrum into three subregions (the dorsal, ventral, and temporal claustrum) along the superior-to-inferior axis. The mean bilateral claustrum volume in 10 young adults was 3307.5 mm^3, approximately 0.21% of total intracranial volume. Our segmentation protocol demonstrated high inter- and intra-rater reliability (ICC > 0.89, DSC > 0.85), confirming its replicability. This comprehensive and reliable claustrum segmentation protocols will provide a cornerstone for future neuroimaging studies of systematic, large-scale investigations of the anatomy and the functions of the human claustrum in normal and pathological populations.

                arXiv:2503.00073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-scale neuronal activity recordings with fluorescent calcium indicators are increasingly common, yielding high-resolution 2D or 3D videos. Traditional analysis pipelines reduce this data to 1D traces by segmenting regions of interest, leading to inevitable information loss. Inspired by the success of deep learning on minimally processed data in other domains, we investigate the potential of forecasting neuronal activity directly from volumetric videos. To capture long-range dependencies in high-resolution volumetric whole-brain recordings, we design a model with large receptive fields, which allow it to integrate information from distant regions within the brain. We explore the effects of pre-training and perform extensive model selection, analyzing spatio-temporal trade-offs for generating accurate forecasts. Our model outperforms trace-based forecasting approaches on ZAPBench, a recently proposed benchmark on whole-brain activity prediction in zebrafish, demonstrating the advantages of preserving the spatial structure of neuronal activity.

                arXiv:2503.00080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is widely used in neuroscience and clinical research for analyzing brain activity. While deep learning models such as EEGNet have shown success in decoding EEG signals, they often struggle with data complexity, inter-subject variability, and noise robustness. Recent advancements in quantum machine learning (QML) offer new opportunities to enhance EEG analysis by leveraging quantum computing's unique properties. In this study, we extend the previously proposed Quantum-EEGNet (QEEGNet), a hybrid neural network incorporating quantum layers into EEGNet, to investigate its generalization ability across multiple EEG datasets. Our evaluation spans a diverse set of cognitive and motor task datasets, assessing QEEGNet's performance in different learning scenarios. Experimental results reveal that while QEEGNet demonstrates competitive performance and maintains robustness in certain datasets, its improvements over traditional deep learning methods remain inconsistent. These findings suggest that hybrid quantum-classical architectures require further optimization to fully leverage quantum advantages in EEG processing. Despite these limitations, our study provides new insights into the applicability of QML in EEG research and highlights challenges that must be addressed for future advancements.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00612">Statistical Mechanics of Semantic Compression</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2503.00612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The basic problem of semantic compression is to minimize the length of a message while preserving its meaning. This differs from classical notions of compression in that the distortion is not measured directly at the level of bits, but rather in an abstract semantic space. In order to make this precise, we take inspiration from cognitive neuroscience and machine learning and model semantic space as a continuous Euclidean vector space. In such a space, stimuli like speech, images, or even ideas, are mapped to high-dimensional real vectors, and the location of these embeddings determines their meaning relative to other embeddings. This suggests that a natural metric for semantic similarity is just the Euclidean distance, which is what we use in this work. We map the optimization problem of determining the minimal-length, meaning-preserving message to a spin glass Hamiltonian and solve the resulting statistical mechanics problem using replica theory. We map out the replica symmetric phase diagram, identifying distinct phases of semantic compression: a first-order transition occurs between lossy and lossless compression, whereas a continuous crossover is seen from extractive to abstractive compression. We conclude by showing numerical simulations of compressions obtained by simulated annealing and greedy algorithms, and argue that while the problem of finding a meaning-preserving compression is computationally hard in the worst case, there exist efficient algorithms which achieve near optimal performance in the typical case.

                arXiv:2412.04191v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Humans perform exquisite sensorimotor skills, both individually and in teams, from athletes performing rhythmic gymnastics to everyday tasks like carrying a cup of coffee. The "predictive brain" framework suggests that mastering these skills relies on predictive mechanisms, raising the question of how we deploy predictions for real-time control and coordination. This review highlights two research lines, showing that during the control of complex objects people make the interaction with 'tools' predictable; and that during dyadic coordination people make their behavior predictable and legible for their partners. These studies demonstrate that to achieve sophisticated motor skills, we play "prediction tricks": we select subspaces of predictable solutions and make sensorimotor interactions more predictable and legible by and for others. This synthesis underscores the critical role of predictability in optimizing control strategies across contexts. Furthermore, it emphasizes the need for novel studies on the scope and limits of predictive mechanisms in motor control.

                arXiv:2501.11566v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is a cutting-edge neuroimaging technique that measures the intricate brain dynamics underlying cognitive processes with an unparalleled combination of high temporal and spatial precision. MEG data analytics has always relied on advanced signal processing and mathematical and statistical tools for various tasks ranging from data cleaning to probing the signals' rich dynamics and estimating the neural sources underlying the surface-level recordings. Like in most domains, the surge in Artificial Intelligence (AI) has led to the increased use of Machine Learning (ML) methods for MEG data classification. More recently, an emerging trend in this field is using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to address many MEG-related tasks. This review provides a comprehensive overview of how ANNs are being used with MEG data from three vantage points: First, we review work that employs ANNs for MEG signal classification, i.e., for brain decoding. Second, we report on work that has used ANNs as putative models of information processing in the human brain. Finally, we examine studies that use ANNs as techniques to tackle methodological questions in MEG, including artifact correction and source estimation. Furthermore, we assess the current strengths and limitations of using ANNs with MEG and discuss future challenges and opportunities in this field. Finally, by establishing a detailed portrait of the field and providing practical recommendations for the future, this review seeks to provide a helpful reference for both seasoned MEG researchers and newcomers to the field who are interested in using ANNs to enhance the exploration of the complex dynamics of the human brain with MEG.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11249">Disentangling Representations through Multi-task Learning</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2407.11249v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Intelligent perception and interaction with the world hinges on internal representations that capture its underlying structure (''disentangled'' or ''abstract'' representations). Disentangled representations serve as world models, isolating latent factors of variation in the world along approximately orthogonal directions, thus facilitating feature-based generalization. We provide experimental and theoretical results guaranteeing the emergence of disentangled representations in agents that optimally solve multi-task evidence accumulation classification tasks, canonical in the neuroscience literature. The key conceptual finding is that, by producing accurate multi-task classification estimates, a system implicitly represents a set of coordinates specifying a disentangled representation of the underlying latent state of the data it receives. The theory provides conditions for the emergence of these representations in terms of noise, number of tasks, and evidence accumulation time. We experimentally validate these predictions in RNNs trained to multi-task, which learn disentangled representations in the form of continuous attractors, leading to zero-shot out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization in predicting latent factors. We demonstrate the robustness of our framework across autoregressive architectures, decision boundary geometries and in tasks requiring classification confidence estimation. We find that transformers are particularly suited for disentangling representations, which might explain their unique world understanding abilities. Overall, our framework establishes a formal link between competence at multiple tasks and the formation of disentangled, interpretable world models in both biological and artificial systems, and helps explain why ANNs often arrive at human-interpretable concepts, and how they both may acquire exceptional zero-shot generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Representations from large language models are highly effective at predicting BOLD fMRI responses to language stimuli. However, these representations are largely opaque: it is unclear what features of the language stimulus drive the response in each brain area. We present generative causal testing (GCT), a framework for generating concise explanations of language selectivity in the brain from predictive models and then testing those explanations in follow-up experiments using LLM-generated stimuli.This approach is successful at explaining selectivity both in individual voxels and cortical regions of interest (ROIs), including newly identified microROIs in prefrontal cortex. We show that explanatory accuracy is closely related to the predictive power and stability of the underlying predictive models. Finally, we show that GCT can dissect fine-grained differences between brain areas with similar functional selectivity. These results demonstrate that LLMs can be used to bridge the widening gap between data-driven models and formal scientific theories.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02094">Tracking objects that change in appearance with phase synchrony</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.02094v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Objects we encounter often change appearance as we interact with them. Changes in illumination (shadows), object pose, or the movement of non-rigid objects can drastically alter available image features. How do biological visual systems track objects as they change? One plausible mechanism involves attentional mechanisms for reasoning about the locations of objects independently of their appearances -- a capability that prominent neuroscience theories have associated with computing through neural synchrony. Here, we describe a novel deep learning circuit that can learn to precisely control attention to features separately from their location in the world through neural synchrony: the complex-valued recurrent neural network (CV-RNN). Next, we compare object tracking in humans, the CV-RNN, and other deep neural networks (DNNs), using FeatureTracker: a large-scale challenge that asks observers to track objects as their locations and appearances change in precisely controlled ways. While humans effortlessly solved FeatureTracker, state-of-the-art DNNs did not. In contrast, our CV-RNN behaved similarly to humans on the challenge, providing a computational proof-of-concept for the role of phase synchronization as a neural substrate for tracking appearance-morphing objects as they move about.

                arXiv:2412.04571v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Developments in machine learning and computing power suggest that artificial general intelligence is within reach. This raises the question of artificial consciousness: if a computer were to be functionally equivalent to a human, being able to do all we do, would it experience sights, sounds, and thoughts, as we do when we are conscious? Answering this question in a principled manner can only be done on the basis of a theory of consciousness that is grounded in phenomenology and that states the necessary and sufficient conditions for any system, evolved or engineered, to support subjective experience. Here we employ Integrated Information Theory (IIT), which provides principled tools to determine whether a system is conscious, to what degree, and the content of its experience. We consider pairs of systems constituted of simple Boolean units, one of which -- a basic stored-program computer -- simulates the other with full functional equivalence. By applying the principles of IIT, we demonstrate that (i) two systems can be functionally equivalent without being phenomenally equivalent, and (ii) that this conclusion is not dependent on the simulated system's function. We further demonstrate that, according to IIT, it is possible for a digital computer to simulate our behavior, possibly even by simulating the neurons in our brain, without replicating our experience. This contrasts sharply with computational functionalism, the thesis that performing computations of the right kind is necessary and sufficient for consciousness.

                arXiv:2412.07236v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive technique to measure and record brain electrical activity, widely used in various BCI and healthcare applications. Early EEG decoding methods rely on supervised learning, limited by specific tasks and datasets, hindering model performance and generalizability. With the success of large language models, there is a growing body of studies focusing on EEG foundation models. However, these studies still leave challenges: Firstly, most of existing EEG foundation models employ full EEG modeling strategy. It models the spatial and temporal dependencies between all EEG patches together, but ignores that the spatial and temporal dependencies are heterogeneous due to the unique structural characteristics of EEG signals. Secondly, existing EEG foundation models have limited generalizability on a wide range of downstream BCI tasks due to varying formats of EEG data, making it challenging to adapt to. To address these challenges, we propose a novel foundation model called CBraMod. Specifically, we devise a criss-cross transformer as the backbone to thoroughly leverage the structural characteristics of EEG signals, which can model spatial and temporal dependencies separately through two parallel attention mechanisms. And we utilize an asymmetric conditional positional encoding scheme which can encode positional information of EEG patches and be easily adapted to the EEG with diverse formats. CBraMod is pre-trained on a very large corpus of EEG through patch-based masked EEG reconstruction. We evaluate CBraMod on up to 10 downstream BCI tasks (12 public datasets). CBraMod achieves the state-of-the-art performance across the wide range of tasks, proving its strong capability and generalizability. The source code is publicly available at https://github.com/wjq-learning/CBraMod.

                arXiv:2412.16189v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although neuron models have been well studied for their rich dynamics and biological properties, limited research has been done on the complex geometries that emerge from the basins of attraction and basin boundaries of multistable neuron systems. In this paper, we investigate the geometrical properties of the strange attractors, four-dimensional basins, and fractal basin boundaries of an asymmetrically electrically coupled system of two identical nonchaotic Rulkov neurons. We discover a quasimultistability in the system emerging from the existence of a chaotic spiking-bursting pseudo-attractor, and we classify and quantify the system's basins of attraction, which are found to have complex fractal geometries. Using the method of uncertainty exponents, we also find that the system exhibits extreme final state sensitivity, which results in a dynamical uncertainty that could have important applications in neurobiology.

                arXiv:2410.06232v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Why do biological and artificial neurons sometimes modularise, each encoding a single meaningful variable, and sometimes entangle their representation of many variables? In this work, we develop a theory of when biologically inspired networks -- those that are nonnegative and energy efficient -- modularise their representation of source variables (sources). We derive necessary and sufficient conditions on a sample of sources that determine whether the neurons in an optimal biologically-inspired linear autoencoder modularise. Our theory applies to any dataset, extending far beyond the case of statistical independence studied in previous work. Rather we show that sources modularise if their support is ``sufficiently spread''. From this theory, we extract and validate predictions in a variety of empirical studies on how data distribution affects modularisation in nonlinear feedforward and recurrent neural networks trained on supervised and unsupervised tasks. Furthermore, we apply these ideas to neuroscience data, showing that range independence can be used to understand the mixing or modularising of spatial and reward information in entorhinal recordings in seemingly conflicting experiments. Further, we use these results to suggest alternate origins of mixed-selectivity, beyond the predominant theory of flexible nonlinear classification. In sum, our theory prescribes precise conditions on when neural activities modularise, providing tools for inducing and elucidating modular representations in brains and machines.

                arXiv:2408.16916v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is a mystery how the brain decodes color vision purely from the optic nerve signals it receives, with a core inferential challenge being how it disentangles internal perception with the correct color dimensionality from the unknown encoding properties of the eye. In this paper, we introduce a computational framework for modeling this emergence of human color vision by simulating both the eye and the cortex. Existing research often overlooks how the cortex develops color vision or represents color space internally, assuming that the color dimensionality is known a priori; however, we argue that the visual cortex has the capability and the challenge of inferring the color dimensionality purely from fluctuations in the optic nerve signals. To validate our theory, we introduce a simulation engine for biological eyes based on established vision science and generate optic nerve signals resulting from looking at natural images. Further, we propose a bio-plausible model of cortical learning based on self-supervised prediction of optic nerve signal fluctuations under natural eye motions. We show that this model naturally learns to generate color vision by disentangling retinal invariants from the sensory signals. When the retina contains N types of color photoreceptors, our simulation shows that N-dimensional color vision naturally emerges, verified through formal colorimetry. Using this framework, we also present the first simulation work that successfully boosts the color dimensionality, as observed in gene therapy on squirrel monkeys, and demonstrates the possibility of enhancing human color vision from 3D to 4D.

                arXiv:2503.00040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantized Spiking Neural Networks (QSNNs) offer superior energy efficiency and are well-suited for deployment on resource-limited edge devices. However, limited bit-width weight and membrane potential result in a notable performance decline. In this study, we first identify a new underlying cause for this decline: the loss of historical information due to the quantized membrane potential. To tackle this issue, we introduce a memory-free quantization method that captures all historical information without directly storing membrane potentials, resulting in better performance with less memory requirements. To further improve the computational efficiency, we propose a parallel training and asynchronous inference framework that greatly increases training speed and energy efficiency. We combine the proposed memory-free quantization and parallel computation methods to develop a high-performance and efficient QSNN, named MFP-QSNN. Extensive experiments show that our MFP-QSNN achieves state-of-the-art performance on various static and neuromorphic image datasets, requiring less memory and faster training speeds. The efficiency and efficacy of the MFP-QSNN highlight its potential for energy-efficient neuromorphic computing.

Abstract: Body fat percentage is an increasingly popular alternative to Body Mass Index to measure overweight and obesity, offering a more accurate representation of body composition. In this work, we evaluate three evolutionary computation techniques, Grammatical Evolution, Context-Free Grammar Genetic Programming, and Dynamic Structured Grammatical Evolution, to derive an interpretable mathematical expression to estimate the percentage of body fat that are also accurate. Our primary objective is to obtain a model that balances accuracy with explainability, making it useful for clinical and health applications. We compare the performance of the three variants on a public anthropometric dataset and compare the results obtained with the QLattice framework. Experimental results show that grammatical evolution techniques can obtain competitive results in performance and interpretability.

                arXiv:2503.00713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brain-inspired spiking neural networks (SNNs) have garnered significant research attention in algorithm design and perception applications. However, their potential in the decision-making domain, particularly in model-based reinforcement learning, remains underexplored. The difficulty lies in the need for spiking neurons with long-term temporal memory capabilities, as well as network optimization that can integrate and learn information for accurate predictions. The dynamic dendritic information integration mechanism of biological neurons brings us valuable insights for addressing these challenges. In this study, we propose a multi-compartment neuron model capable of nonlinearly integrating information from multiple dendritic sources to dynamically process long sequential inputs. Based on this model, we construct a Spiking World Model (Spiking-WM), to enable model-based deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with SNNs. We evaluated our model using the DeepMind Control Suite, demonstrating that Spiking-WM outperforms existing SNN-based models and achieves performance comparable to artificial neural network (ANN)-based world models employing Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs). Furthermore, we assess the long-term memory capabilities of the proposed model in speech datasets, including SHD, TIMIT, and LibriSpeech 100h, showing that our multi-compartment neuron model surpasses other SNN-based architectures in processing long sequences. Our findings underscore the critical role of dendritic information integration in shaping neuronal function, emphasizing the importance of cooperative dendritic processing in enhancing neural computation.

                arXiv:2503.00721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we aim to introduce distributed collaborative beamforming (DCB) into AAV swarms and handle the eavesdropper collusion by controlling the corresponding signal distributions. Specifically, we consider a two-way DCB-enabled aerial communication between two AAV swarms and construct these swarms as two AAV virtual antenna arrays. Then, we minimize the two-way known secrecy capacity and maximum sidelobe level to avoid information leakage from the known and unknown eavesdroppers, respectively. Simultaneously, we also minimize the energy consumption of AAVs when constructing virtual antenna arrays. Due to the conflicting relationships between secure performance and energy efficiency, we consider these objectives by formulating a multi-objective optimization problem, which is NP-hard and with a large number of decision variables. Accordingly, we design a novel generative swarm intelligence (GenSI) framework to solve the problem with less overhead, which contains a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE)-based generative method and a proposed powerful swarm intelligence algorithm. In this framework, CVAE can collect expert solutions obtained by the swarm intelligence algorithm in other environment states to explore characteristics and patterns, thereby directly generating high-quality initial solutions in new environment factors for the swarm intelligence algorithm to search solution space efficiently. Simulation results show that the proposed swarm intelligence algorithm outperforms other state-of-the-art baseline algorithms, and the GenSI can achieve similar optimization results by using far fewer iterations than the ordinary swarm intelligence algorithm. Experimental tests demonstrate that introducing the CVAE mechanism achieves a 58.7% reduction in execution time, which enables the deployment of GenSI even on AAV platforms with limited computing power.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00844">Impact of Surrogate Model Accuracy on Performance and Model Management Strategy in Surrogate-Assisted Evolutionary Algorithms</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2503.00844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms (SAEAs) have been proposed to solve expensive optimization problems. Although SAEAs use surrogate models that approximate the evaluations of solutions using machine learning techniques, prior research has not adequately investigated the impact of surrogate model accuracy on search performance and model management strategy in SAEAs. This study analyzes how surrogate model accuracy affects search performance and model management strategies. For this purpose, we construct a pseudo-surrogate model with adjustable prediction accuracy to ensure fair comparisons across different model management strategies. We compared three model management strategies: (1) pre-selection (PS), (2) individual-based (IB), and (3) generation-based (GB) on standard benchmark problems with a baseline model that does not use surrogates. The experimental results reveal that a higher surrogate model accuracy improves the search performance. However, the impact varies according to the strategy used. Specifically, PS demonstrates a clear trend of improved performance as the estimation accuracy increases, whereas IB and GB exhibit robust performance when the accuracy surpasses a certain threshold. In model strategy comparisons, GB exhibits superior performance across a broad range of prediction accuracies, IB outperforms it at lower accuracies, and PS outperforms it at higher accuracies. The findings of this study clarify guidelines for selecting appropriate model management strategies based on the surrogate model accuracy.

                arXiv:2503.00898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automotive radar systems face the challenge of managing high sampling rates and large data bandwidth while complying with stringent real-time and energy efficiency requirements. The growing complexity of autonomous vehicles further intensifies these requirements. Neuromorphic computing offers promising solutions because of its inherent energy efficiency and parallel processing capacity. This research presents a novel spiking neuron model for signal processing of frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radars that outperforms the state-of-the-art spectrum analysis algorithms in latency and data bandwidth. These spiking neural resonators are based on the resonate-and-fire neuron model and optimized to dynamically process raw radar data while simultaneously emitting an output in the form of spikes. We designed the first neuromorphic neural network consisting of these spiking neural resonators that estimates range and angle from FMCW radar data. We evaluated the range-angle maps on simulated datasets covering multiple scenarios and compared the results with a state-of-the-art pipeline for radar processing. The proposed neuron model significantly reduces the processing latency compared to traditional frequency analysis algorithms, such as the Fourier transformation (FT), which needs to sample and store entire data frames before processing. The evaluations demonstrate that these spiking neural resonators achieve state-of-the-art detection accuracy while emitting spikes simultaneously to processing and transmitting only 0.02 % of the data compared to a float-32 FT. The results showcase the potential for neuromorphic signal processing for FMCW radar systems and pave the way for designing neuromorphic radar sensors.

                arXiv:2503.00268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The black-box nature of neural networks limits the ability to encode or impose specific structural relationships between inputs and outputs. While various studies have introduced architectures that ensure the network's output adheres to a particular form in relation to certain inputs, the majority of these approaches impose constraints on only a single set of inputs. This paper introduces a novel neural network architecture, termed the Input Specific Neural Network (ISNN), which extends this concept by allowing scalar-valued outputs to be subject to multiple constraints. Specifically, the ISNN can enforce convexity in some inputs, non-decreasing monotonicity combined with convexity with respect to others, and simple non-decreasing monotonicity or arbitrary relationships with additional inputs. The paper presents two distinct ISNN architectures, along with equations for the first and second derivatives of the output with respect to the inputs. These networks are broadly applicable.
  In this work, we restrict their usage to solving problems in computational mechanics. In particular, we show how they can be effectively applied to fitting data-driven constitutive models. We then embed our trained data-driven constitutive laws into a finite element solver where significant time savings can be achieved by using explicit manual differentiation using the derived equations as opposed to automatic differentiation. We also show how ISNNs can be used to learn structural relationships between inputs and outputs via a binary gating mechanism. Particularly, ISNNs are employed to model an anisotropic free energy potential to get the homogenized macroscopic response in a decoupled multiscale setting, where the network learns whether or not the potential should be modeled as polyconvex, and retains only the relevant layers while using the minimum number of inputs.

Abstract: Energy-based learning algorithms are alternatives to backpropagation and are well-suited to distributed implementations in analog electronic devices. However, a rigorous theory of convergence is lacking. We make a first step in this direction by analysing a particular energy-based learning algorithm, Contrastive Learning, applied to a network of linear adjustable resistors. It is shown that, in this setup, Contrastive Learning is equivalent to projected gradient descent on a convex function, for any step size, giving a guarantee of convergence for the algorithm.

                arXiv:2503.00588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There has been an increasing concern to reduce the energy consumption in manufacturing and other industries. Energy consumption in manufacturing industries is directly related to efficient schedules. The contribution of this paper includes: i) a permutation flowshop scheduling problem (PFLSP) mathematical model by considering energy consumed by each machine in the system. ii) an improved non-dominated sorted genetic algorithm with Taguchi method with further incorporating local search (NSGA-II_LS) is proposed for the multi-objective PFLSP model. iii) solved 90 benchmarks problems of Taillard (1993) for the minimisation of flowtime (FT) and energy consumption (EC). The performance of the proposed NSGA_LS algorithm is evaluated on the benchmark problems selected from the published literature Li et. al, (2018). From these results, it is noted that the proposed algorithm performed better on both the objectives i.e., FT and EC minimization in 5 out of 9 cases. On FT objective our algorithm performed better in 8 out of 9 cases and on EC objective 5 out of 9 cases. Overall, the proposed algorithm achieved 47% and 15.44% average improvement in FT and EC minimization respectively on the benchmark problems. From the results of 90 benchmark problems, it is observed that average difference in FT and EC between two solutions is decreasing as the problem size increases from 5 machines to 10 machines with an exception in one case. Further, it is observed that the performance of the proposed algorithm is better as the problem size increases in both jobs and machines. These results can act as standard solutions for further research.

                arXiv:2503.01163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Prompt optimization aims to search for effective prompts that enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs). Although existing prompt optimization methods have discovered effective prompts, they often differ from sophisticated prompts carefully designed by human experts. Prompt design strategies, representing best practices for improving prompt performance, can be key to improving prompt optimization. Recently, a method termed the Autonomous Prompt Engineering Toolbox (APET) has incorporated various prompt design strategies into the prompt optimization process. In APET, the LLM is needed to implicitly select and apply the appropriate strategies because prompt design strategies can have negative effects. This implicit selection may be suboptimal due to the limited optimization capabilities of LLMs. This paper introduces Optimizing Prompts with sTrategy Selection (OPTS), which implements explicit selection mechanisms for prompt design. We propose three mechanisms, including a Thompson sampling-based approach, and integrate them into EvoPrompt, a well-known prompt optimizer. Experiments optimizing prompts for two LLMs, Llama-3-8B-Instruct and GPT-4o mini, were conducted using BIG-Bench Hard. Our results show that the selection of prompt design strategies improves the performance of EvoPrompt, and the Thompson sampling-based mechanism achieves the best overall results. Our experimental code is provided at https://github.com/shiralab/OPTS .

                arXiv:2503.01325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detailed scheduling has traditionally been optimized for the reduction of makespan and manufacturing costs. However, growing awareness of environmental concerns and increasingly stringent regulations are pushing manufacturing towards reducing the carbon footprint of its operations. Scope 2 emissions, which are the indirect emissions related to the production and consumption of grid electricity, are in fact estimated to be responsible for more than one-third of the global GHG emissions. In this context, carbon-aware scheduling can serve as a powerful way to reduce manufacturing's carbon footprint by considering the time-dependent carbon intensity of the grid and the availability of on-site renewable electricity.
  This study introduces a carbon-aware permutation flow-shop scheduling model designed to reduce scope 2 emissions. The model is formulated as a mixed-integer linear problem, taking into account the forecasted grid generation mix and available on-site renewable electricity, along with the set of jobs to be scheduled and their corresponding power requirements. The objective is to find an optimal day-ahead schedule that minimizes scope 2 emissions. The problem is addressed using a dedicated memetic algorithm, combining evolutionary strategy and local search.
  Results from computational experiments confirm that by considering the dynamic carbon intensity of the grid and on-site renewable electricity availability, substantial reductions in carbon emissions can be achieved.

Abstract: We develop a self-learning approach for conjecturing of induction predicates on a dataset of 16197 problems derived from the OEIS. These problems are hard for today's SMT and ATP systems because they require a combination of inductive and arithmetical reasoning.
  Starting from scratch, our approach consists of a feedback loop that iterates between (i) training a neural translator to learn the correspondence between the problems solved so far and the induction predicates useful for them, (ii) using the trained neural system to generate many new induction predicates for the problems, (iii) fast runs of the z3 prover attempting to prove the problems using the generated predicates, (iv) using heuristics such as predicate size and solution speed on the proved problems to choose the best predicates for the next iteration of training.
  The algorithm discovers on its own many interesting induction predicates, ultimately solving 5565 problems, compared to 2265 problems solved by CVC5, Vampire or Z3 in 60 seconds.

                arXiv:2503.01561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brain-inspired algorithms are attractive and emerging alternatives to classical deep learning methods for use in various machine learning applications. Brain-inspired systems can feature local learning rules, both unsupervised/semi-supervised learning and different types of plasticity (structural/synaptic), allowing them to potentially be faster and more energy-efficient than traditional machine learning alternatives. Among the more salient brain-inspired algorithms are Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Networks (BCPNNs). BCPNN is an important tool for both machine learning and computational neuroscience research, and recent work shows that BCPNN can reach state-of-the-art performance in tasks such as learning and memory recall compared to other models. Unfortunately, BCPNN is primarily executed on slow general-purpose processors (CPUs) or power-hungry graphics processing units (GPUs), reducing the applicability of using BCPNN in (among others) Edge systems. In this work, we design a custom stream-based accelerator for BCPNN using Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) using Xilinx Vitis High-Level Synthesis (HLS) flow. Furthermore, we model our accelerator's performance using first principles, and we empirically show that our proposed accelerator is between 1.3x - 5.3x faster than an Nvidia A100 GPU while at the same time consuming between 2.62x - 3.19x less power and 5.8x - 16.5x less energy without any degradation in performance.

                arXiv:2503.01676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel Perceptual Motor Learning (PML) framework integrated with Active Inference (AIF) to enhance lateral control in Highly Automated Vehicles (HAVs). PML, inspired by human motor learning, emphasizes the seamless integration of perception and action, enabling efficient decision-making in dynamic environments. Traditional autonomous driving approaches--including modular pipelines, imitation learning, and reinforcement learning--struggle with adaptability, generalization, and computational efficiency. In contrast, PML with AIF leverages a generative model to minimize prediction error ("surprise") and actively shape vehicle control based on learned perceptual-motor representations. Our approach unifies deep learning with active inference principles, allowing HAVs to perform lane-keeping maneuvers with minimal data and without extensive retraining across different environments. Extensive experiments in the CARLA simulator demonstrate that PML with AIF enhances adaptability without increasing computational overhead while achieving performance comparable to conventional methods. These findings highlight the potential of PML-driven active inference as a robust alternative for real-world autonomous driving applications.

                arXiv:2401.08603v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern data-driven machine learning system designs exploit inductive biases in architectural structure, invariance and equivariance requirements, task-specific loss functions, and computational optimization tools. Previous works have illustrated that human-specified quasi-invariant filters can serve as a powerful inductive bias in the early layers of the encoder, enhancing robustness and transparency in learned classifiers. This paper explores this further within the context of representation learning with bio-inspired Hebbian learning rules. We propose a modular framework trained with a bio-inspired variant of contrastive predictive coding, comprising parallel encoders that leverage different invariant visual descriptors as inductive biases. We evaluate the representation learning capacity of our system in classification scenarios using diverse image datasets (GTSRB, STL10, CODEBRIM) and video datasets (UCF101). Our findings indicate that this form of inductive bias significantly improves the robustness of learned representations and narrows the performance gap between models using local Hebbian plasticity rules and those using backpropagation, while also achieving superior performance compared to non-decomposed encoders.

                arXiv:2406.02923v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are posited as a computationally efficient and biologically plausible alternative to conventional neural architectures, with their core computational framework primarily using the leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neuron model. However, the limited hidden state representation of LIF neurons, characterized by a scalar membrane potential, and sequential spike generation process, poses challenges for effectively developing scalable spiking models to address long-range dependencies in sequence learning tasks. In this study, we develop a scalable probabilistic spiking learning framework for long-range dependency tasks leveraging the fundamentals of state space models. Unlike LIF neurons that rely on the deterministic Heaviside function for a sequential process of spike generation, we introduce a SpikeSampler layer that samples spikes stochastically based on an SSM-based neuronal model while allowing parallel computations. To address non-differentiability of the spiking operation and enable effective training, we also propose a surrogate function tailored for the stochastic nature of the SpikeSampler layer. To enhance inter-neuron communication, we introduce the SpikeMixer block, which integrates spikes from neuron populations in each layer. This is followed by a ClampFuse layer, incorporating a residual connection to capture complex dependencies, enabling scalability of the model. Our models attain state-of-the-art performance among SNN models across diverse long-range dependency tasks, encompassing the Long Range Arena benchmark, permuted sequential MNIST, and the Speech Command dataset and demonstrate sparse spiking pattern highlighting its computational efficiency.

                arXiv:2406.05224v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce NeuroSA, a neuromorphic architecture specifically designed to ensure asymptotic convergence to the ground state of an Ising problem using a Fowler-Nordheim quantum mechanical tunneling based threshold-annealing process. The core component of NeuroSA consists of a pair of asynchronous ON-OFF neurons, which effectively map classical simulated annealing dynamics onto a network of integrate-and-fire neurons. The threshold of each ON-OFF neuron pair is adaptively adjusted by an FN annealer and the resulting spiking dynamics replicates the optimal escape mechanism and convergence of SA, particularly at low-temperatures. To validate the effectiveness of our neuromorphic Ising machine, we systematically solved benchmark combinatorial optimization problems such as MAX-CUT and Max Independent Set. Across multiple runs, NeuroSA consistently generates distribution of solutions that are concentrated around the state-of-the-art results (within 99%) or surpass the current state-of-the-art solutions for Max Independent Set benchmarks. Furthermore, NeuroSA is able to achieve these superior distributions without any graph-specific hyperparameter tuning. For practical illustration, we present results from an implementation of NeuroSA on the SpiNNaker2 platform, highlighting the feasibility of mapping our proposed architecture onto a standard neuromorphic accelerator platform.

Abstract: Implementations of spiking neural networks on neuromorphic hardware promise orders of magnitude less power consumption than their non-spiking counterparts. The standard neuron model for spike-based computation on such systems has long been the leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neuron. A computationally light augmentation of the LIF neuron model with an adaptation mechanism has recently been shown to exhibit superior performance on spatio-temporal processing tasks. The root of the superiority of these so-called adaptive LIF neurons however is not well understood. In this article, we thoroughly analyze the dynamical, computational, and learning properties of adaptive LIF neurons and networks thereof. Our investigation reveals significant challenges related to stability and parameterization when employing the conventional Euler-Forward discretization for this class of models. We report a rigorous theoretical and empirical demonstration that these challenges can be effectively addressed by adopting an alternative discretization approach - the Symplectic Euler method, allowing to improve over state-of-the-art performances on common event-based benchmark datasets. Our further analysis of the computational properties of networks of adaptive LIF neurons shows that they are particularly well suited to exploit the spatio-temporal structure of input sequences without any normalization techniques.

                arXiv:2409.13315v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quality-Diversity (QD) algorithms have exhibited promising results across many domains and applications. However, uncertainty in fitness and behaviour estimations of solutions remains a major challenge when QD is used in complex real-world applications. While several approaches have been proposed to improve the performance in uncertain applications, many fail to address a key challenge: determining how to prioritise solutions that perform consistently under uncertainty, in other words, solutions that are reproducible. Most prior methods improve fitness and reproducibility jointly, ignoring the possibility that they could be contradictory objectives. For example, in robotics, solutions may reliably walk at 90% of the maximum velocity in uncertain environments, while solutions that walk faster are also more prone to falling over. As this is a trade-off, neither one of these two solutions is "better" than the other. Thus, algorithms cannot intrinsically select one solution over the other, but can only enforce given preferences over these two contradictory objectives. In this paper, we formalise this problem as the performance-reproducibility trade-off for uncertain QD. We propose four new a-priori QD algorithms that find optimal solutions for given preferences over the trade-offs. We also propose an a-posteriori QD algorithm for when these preferences cannot be defined in advance. Our results show that our approaches successfully find solutions that satisfy given preferences. Importantly, by simply accounting for this trade-off, our approaches perform better than existing uncertain QD methods. This suggests that considering the performance-reproducibility trade-off unlocks important stepping stones that are usually missed when only performance is optimised.

                arXiv:2409.19764v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spike-based Transformer presents a compelling and energy-efficient alternative to traditional Artificial Neural Network (ANN)-based Transformers, achieving impressive results through sparse binary computations. However, existing spike-based transformers predominantly focus on spatial attention while neglecting crucial temporal dependencies inherent in spike-based processing, leading to suboptimal feature representation and limited performance. To address this limitation, we propose Spiking Transformer with Spatial-Temporal Attention (STAtten), a simple and straightforward architecture that efficiently integrates both spatial and temporal information in the self-attention mechanism. STAtten introduces a block-wise computation strategy that processes information in spatial-temporal chunks, enabling comprehensive feature capture while maintaining the same computational complexity as previous spatial-only approaches. Our method can be seamlessly integrated into existing spike-based transformers without architectural overhaul. Extensive experiments demonstrate that STAtten significantly improves the performance of existing spike-based transformers across both static and neuromorphic datasets, including CIFAR10/100, ImageNet, CIFAR10-DVS, and N-Caltech101. The code is available at https://github.com/Intelligent-Computing-Lab-Yale/STAtten

Abstract: Low-rank decomposition has emerged as a vital tool for enhancing parameter efficiency in neural network architectures, gaining traction across diverse applications in machine learning. These techniques significantly lower the number of parameters, striking a balance between compactness and performance. However, a common challenge has been the compromise between parameter efficiency and the accuracy of the model, where reduced parameters often lead to diminished accuracy compared to their full-rank counterparts. In this work, we propose a novel theoretical framework that integrates a sinusoidal function within the low-rank decomposition process. This approach not only preserves the benefits of the parameter efficiency characteristic of low-rank methods but also increases the decomposition's rank, thereby enhancing model performance. Our method proves to be a plug in enhancement for existing low-rank models, as evidenced by its successful application in Vision Transformers (ViT), Large Language Models (LLMs), Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D shape modelling.

Abstract: Edge vision systems combining sensing and embedded processing promise low-latency, decentralized, and energy-efficient solutions that forgo reliance on the cloud. As opposed to conventional frame-based vision sensors, event-based cameras deliver a microsecond-scale temporal resolution with sparse information encoding, thereby outlining new opportunities for edge vision systems. However, mainstream algorithms for frame-based vision, which mostly rely on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), can hardly exploit the advantages of event-based vision as they are typically optimized for dense matrix-vector multiplications. While event-driven graph neural networks (GNNs) have recently emerged as a promising solution for sparse event-based vision, their irregular structure is a challenge that currently hinders the design of efficient hardware accelerators. In this paper, we propose EvGNN, the first event-driven GNN accelerator for low-footprint, ultra-low-latency, and high-accuracy edge vision with event-based cameras. It relies on three central ideas: (i) directed dynamic graphs exploiting single-hop nodes with edge-free storage, (ii) event queues for the efficient identification of local neighbors within a spatiotemporally decoupled search range, and (iii) a novel layer-parallel processing scheme allowing for a low-latency execution of multi-layer GNNs. We deployed EvGNN on a Xilinx KV260 Ultrascale+ MPSoC platform and benchmarked it on the N-CARS dataset for car recognition, demonstrating a classification accuracy of 87.8% and an average latency per event of 16$\mu$s, thereby enabling real-time, microsecond-resolution event-based vision at the edge.

                arXiv:2407.04752v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) with billions of parameters have improved performance in various applications, but their inference processes demand significant energy and computational resources. In contrast, the human brain, with approximately 86 billion neurons, is much more energy-efficient than LLMs with similar parameters. Inspired by this, we redesign 7$\sim$70 billion parameter LLMs using bio-plausible spiking mechanisms, emulating the efficient behavior of the human brain. We propose the first spiking large language model, SpikeLLM. Coupled with the proposed model, two essential approaches are proposed to improve spike training efficiency: Generalized Integrate-and-Fire (GIF) neurons to compress spike length from $T$ to $\frac{T}{L} \log_2 L$ bits, and an Optimal Brain Spiking framework to divide outlier channels and allocate different $T$ for GIF neurons, which further compresses spike length to approximate $log_2T$ bits. The necessity of spike-driven LLM is proved by comparison with quantized LLMs with similar operations. In the OmniQuant pipeline, SpikeLLM reduces 11.01% WikiText2 perplexity and improves 2.55% accuracy of common scene reasoning on a LLAMA-7B W4A4 model. In the GPTQ pipeline, SpikeLLM achieves direct additive in linear layers, significantly exceeding PB-LLMs.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become important tools for machine learning on graph-structured data. In this paper, we explore the synergistic combination of graph encoding, graph rewiring, and graph attention, by introducing Graph Attention with Stochastic Structures (GRASS), a novel GNN architecture. GRASS utilizes relative random walk probabilities (RRWP) encoding and a novel decomposed variant (D-RRWP) to efficiently capture structural information. It rewires the input graph by superimposing a random regular graph to enhance long-range information propagation. It also employs a novel additive attention mechanism tailored for graph-structured data. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that GRASS achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets, including a 20.3% reduction in mean absolute error on the ZINC dataset.

Abstract: Exoskeletons can boost human strength and provide assistance to individuals with physical disabilities. However, ensuring safety and optimal performance in their design poses substantial challenges. This study presents the design process for an underactuated hand exoskeleton (U-HEx), first including a single objective (maximizing force transmission), then expanding into multi objective (also minimizing torque variance and actuator displacement). The optimization relies on a Genetic Algorithm, the Big Bang-Big Crunch Algorithm, and their versions for multi-objective optimization. Analyses revealed that using Big Bang-Big Crunch provides high and more consistent results in terms of optimality with lower convergence time. In addition, adding more objectives offers a variety of trade-off solutions to the designers, who might later set priorities for the objectives without repeating the process - at the cost of complicating the optimization algorithm and computational burden. These findings underline the importance of performing proper optimization while designing exoskeletons, as well as providing a significant improvement to this specific robotic design.

Abstract: Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification with multiple instance learning (MIL) in digital pathology faces significant computational challenges. Current methods mostly rely on extensive self-supervised learning (SSL) for satisfactory performance, requiring long training periods and considerable computational resources. At the same time, no pre-training affects performance due to domain shifts from natural images to WSIs. We introduce Snuffy architecture, a novel MIL-pooling method based on sparse transformers that mitigates performance loss with limited pre-training and enables continual few-shot pre-training as a competitive option. Our sparsity pattern is tailored for pathology and is theoretically proven to be a universal approximator with the tightest probabilistic sharp bound on the number of layers for sparse transformers, to date. We demonstrate Snuffy's effectiveness on CAMELYON16 and TCGA Lung cancer datasets, achieving superior WSI and patch-level accuracies. The code is available on https://github.com/jafarinia/snuffy.

Abstract: We explore the emergence of intelligent behavior in artificial systems by investigating how the complexity of rule-based systems influences the capabilities of models trained to predict these rules. Our study focuses on elementary cellular automata (ECA), simple yet powerful one-dimensional systems that generate behaviors ranging from trivial to highly complex. By training distinct Large Language Models (LLMs) on different ECAs, we evaluated the relationship between the complexity of the rules' behavior and the intelligence exhibited by the LLMs, as reflected in their performance on downstream tasks. Our findings reveal that rules with higher complexity lead to models exhibiting greater intelligence, as demonstrated by their performance on reasoning and chess move prediction tasks. Both uniform and periodic systems, and often also highly chaotic systems, resulted in poorer downstream performance, highlighting a sweet spot of complexity conducive to intelligence. We conjecture that intelligence arises from the ability to predict complexity and that creating intelligence may require only exposure to complexity.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11502">Offline Model-Based Optimization by Learning to Rank</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.11502v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Offline model-based optimization (MBO) aims to identify a design that maximizes a black-box function using only a fixed, pre-collected dataset of designs and their corresponding scores. A common approach in offline MBO is to train a regression-based surrogate model by minimizing mean squared error (MSE) and then find the best design within this surrogate model by different optimizers (e.g., gradient ascent). However, a critical challenge is the risk of out-of-distribution errors, i.e., the surrogate model may typically overestimate the scores and mislead the optimizers into suboptimal regions. Prior works have attempted to address this issue in various ways, such as using regularization techniques and ensemble learning to enhance the robustness of the model, but it still remains. In this paper, we argue that regression models trained with MSE are not well-aligned with the primary goal of offline MBO, which is to select promising designs rather than to predict their scores precisely. Notably, if a surrogate model can maintain the order of candidate designs based on their relative score relationships, it can produce the best designs even without precise predictions. To validate it, we conduct experiments to compare the relationship between the quality of the final designs and MSE, finding that the correlation is really very weak. In contrast, a metric that measures order-maintaining quality shows a significantly stronger correlation. Based on this observation, we propose learning a ranking-based model that leverages learning to rank techniques to prioritize promising designs based on their relative scores. We show that the generalization error on ranking loss can be well bounded. Empirical results across diverse tasks demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed ranking-based models than twenty existing methods.

                arXiv:2501.01564v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many numerical algorithms in scientific computing -- particularly in areas like numerical linear algebra, PDE simulation, and inverse problems -- produce outputs that can be represented by semialgebraic functions; that is, the graph of the computed function can be described by finitely many polynomial equalities and inequalities. In this work, we introduce Semialgebraic Neural Networks (SANNs), a neural network architecture capable of representing any bounded semialgebraic function, and computing such functions up to the accuracy of a numerical ODE solver chosen by the programmer. Conceptually, we encode the graph of the learned function as the kernel of a piecewise polynomial selected from a class of functions whose roots can be evaluated using a particular homotopy continuation method. We show by construction that the SANN architecture is able to execute this continuation method, thus evaluating the learned semialgebraic function. Furthermore, the architecture can exactly represent even discontinuous semialgebraic functions by executing a continuation method on each connected component of the target function. Lastly, we provide example applications of these networks and show they can be trained with traditional deep-learning techniques.

                <p>While ketamine, an NMDA receptor antagonist, is effective in treating major depression, studies have not addressed the safety of repeated ketamine infusions in depressed patients with comorbid alcohol use disorder (AUD). In this study, we aimed to determine whether a history of chronic social isolation and alcohol exposure alter the reinforcing properties of ketamine in male and female rats. Rats were pair-housed or socially isolated for 12&nbsp;weeks and underwent intermittent access to 20% alcohol. Subsequently, rats underwent intravenous ketamine self-administration under a fixed ratio 1 schedule, followed by extinction training and one session of cue-induced reinstatement. Dendritic spine morphology was examined in the nucleus accumbens, an important area implicated in reward and motivation. Our results show that females self-administered more ketamine than males, a history of alcohol increased ketamine intake in females, and a history of isolation or alcohol independently increased ketamine intake in males. All experimental groups showed similar extinction patterns and reinstatement to ketamine cues. A pattern emerged similar to ketamine self-administration behaviors, where isolation increased the number of immature spines in males, a change that was attenuated in isolated alcohol drinkers, and a history of alcohol increased the number of immature spines in females. Our results suggest that a history of isolation and alcohol modulate the reinforcing properties of ketamine in a sex-dependent manner. This underscores the importance of considering sex differences and a history of alcohol use when employing ketamine to treat various psychopathologies, including major depression.</p>

                <p>In models of visual spatial attention control, it is commonly held that top&ndash;down control signals originate in the dorsal attention network, propagating to the visual cortex to modulate baseline neural activity and bias sensory processing. However, the precise distribution of these top&ndash;down influences across different levels of the visual hierarchy is debated. In addition, it is unclear whether these baseline neural activity changes translate into improved performance. We analyzed attention-related baseline activity during the anticipatory period of a voluntary spatial attention task, using two independent functional magnetic resonance imaging datasets and two analytic approaches. First, as in prior studies, univariate analysis showed that covert attention significantly enhanced baseline neural activity in higher-order visual areas contralateral to the attended visual hemifield, while effects in lower-order visual areas (e.g., V1) were weaker and more variable. Second, in contrast, multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) revealed significant decoding of attention conditions across all visual cortical areas, with lower-order visual areas exhibiting higher decoding accuracies than higher-order areas. Third, decoding accuracy, rather than the magnitude of univariate activation, was a better predictor of a subject's stimulus discrimination performance. Finally, the MVPA results were replicated across two experimental conditions, where the direction of spatial attention was either externally instructed by a cue or based on the participants&rsquo; free choice decision about where to attend. Together, these findings offer new insights into the extent of attentional biases in the visual hierarchy under top&ndash;down control and how these biases influence both sensory processing and behavioral performance.</p>

                Background Prolonged disability resulting from road traffic injuries (RTIs) contributes significantly to morbidity and disease burden. A good understanding of the prevalence and the level of disability of orthopedic injuries in developing countries is crucial for improvement; however, such data are currently lacking in Rwanda. Policy and implications The goal of the policy is to address the growing number of road traffic injuries (RTIs) in Rwanda, with a focus on orthopaedic injuries that result in permanent disabilities. It suggests enhancing data collection and research, bolstering emergency response systems, growing rehabilitation services, offering victims social and financial support, and promoting inclusive policies. These programs may result in better emergency care, better rehabilitation outcomes, more informed interventions, lighter loads for victims and their families, more community support and awareness, and eventually a safer and more welcoming society for all Rwandans impacted by RTIs. Recommendations Rwanda’s road traffic injuries (RTIs) are on the rise, and addressing this requires strengthening emergency response systems, expanding rehabilitation services, improving data collection, providing financial and social support, and advocating for inclusive policies. These measures aim to improve care, rehabilitation access, and foster a safer environment, reducing RTI burdens. Conclusions The conclusion underscores the urgent need for comprehensive action to tackle the high prevalence of road traffic orthopaedic injuries in Rwanda, emphasizing the need for enhanced emergency response, expanded rehabilitation services, and inclusive policies.

                As is already known, the Japanese Civil Code (JCC), enacted in 1896, was formulated with reference to the discipline of many foreign laws, including the French Civil Code (FCC) and the draft of the German Civil Code (BGB) at the time. Among the objects of discipline stipulated in the JCC, the concept of German law was widely adopted for the provisions on set-off. However, in the interpretation of these provisions, the Japanese Supreme Court sometimes adopted views that differed from the provisions of BGB and its interpretation. This case law was clarified when the Law of Obligations of the JCC was revised in 2017. This paper explains the various set-off requirements stipulated by Japanese current law. In Japan, the conditions under which the statutory requirements for set-off are satisfied are described as “eligibility for set-off” (Sousai-Tekijou), and the legal status of the parties in the set-off is called the right to set-off. Even if this eligibility for set-off arises, the parties may not exercise the right to set-off if there are circumstances that restrict the set-off. In addition, the Japanese Bankruptcy Act (JBA) modifies the requirements provided by the JCC to accommodate bankruptcy proceedings. In this paper, we will review in order the affirmative requirements for creating eligibility for set-off, the negative requirements for restricting the exercise of the right to set-off, and the requirements for set-off in bankruptcy proceedings. Please note that under Japanese law, when A intends to extinguish B’s claim β against him by set-off against his claim α, A’s claim α is referred to as an active claim (Jido-Saiken, Aktivforderung), and B’s cross-claim β as a passive claim (Judo-Saiken, Passivforderung). This paper will also be described based on this terminology 1 .

The risk of bias from each study was assessed using the Newcastle Ottawa Scale and Risk of Bias-2 (ROB-2) tool. Results Thirteen studies meeting the inclusion criteria were analysed. Both subcapsular orchiectomy and pharmacological ADT effectively reduced tumour size and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels. Subcapsular orchiectomy was linked to higher surgical complication rates. At the same time, due to its systemic pharmacological mechanisms, pharmacological ADT carries a greater risk of metabolic side effects, such as weight gain and insulin resistance. Conclusions Both subcapsular orchiectomy and pharmacological ADT are viable options for prostate cancer treatment. However, their differing safety and pharmacological profiles highlight the need for personalised treatment strategies based on individual patient factors and preferences.

                Background The 2013-2016 West African Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) outbreak resulted in 28,600 cases and 11,300 deaths officially reported to the World Health Organization. Previous studies investigating factors associated with death had conflicting findings, interventions showing promising outcomes had small sample sizes, studies were often single- or dual-country based and most focused on laboratory-confirmed EVD and not on clinically-suspected EVD. We used the Ebola data platform of the Infectious Disease Data Observatory (IDDO) to review individual patient records to assess factors associated with death, and particularly whether there were differences between laboratory-confirmed and clinically-suspected cases. Methods This was a cohort study involving analysis of secondary data in the IDDO database. The study population included all patients classified as having either clinically-suspected or laboratory-confirmed EVD, admitted to 22 Ebola Treatment Units (ETU) in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone between December 2013 and March 2016. Baseline characteristics and treatments were documented along with ETU exit outcomes. Factors associated with death were investigated by multivariable modified Poisson regression. Results There were 14,163 patients, of whom 6,208 (43.8%) were laboratory-confirmed and 7,955 (56.2%) were clinically-suspected. Outcomes were not recorded in 2,889 (20.4%) patients. Of the 11,274 patients with known outcomes, 4,090 (36.3%) died: 2,956 (43.6%) with laboratory-confirmed EVD and 1,134 (18.8%) with clinically-suspected EVD. The strongest risk factor for death was confirmed disease status. Patients with laboratory-confirmed disease had 2.9 times higher risk of death compared to clinically-suspected patients, after adjusting for other co-variables. Other factors significantly associated with death included a higher risk for patients aged ≥60 years and a lower risk for patients in Sierra Leone. Conclusions Although laboratory-confirmed patients admitted to ETUs fared worse than clinically-suspected patients, the latter still had a substantial risk of death and more attention needs to be paid to this group in future EVD outbreaks.

                <p>by André Victor Ribeiro Amaral, Daniel Wolffram, Paula Moraga, Johannes Bracher</p>

In infectious disease surveillance, incidence data are frequently subject to reporting delays and retrospective corrections, making it hard to assess current trends in real time. A variety of probabilistic nowcasting methods have been suggested to correct for the resulting biases. Building upon a recent comparison of eight of these methods in an application to COVID-19 hospitalization data from Germany, the objective of this paper is twofold. Firstly, we investigate how nowcasts from different models can be improved using statistical post-processing methods as employed, e.g., in weather forecasting. Secondly, we assess the potential of weighted ensemble nowcasts, i.e., weighted combinations of different probabilistic nowcasts. These are a natural extension of unweighted nowcast ensembles, which have previously been found to outperform most individual models. Both in post-processing and ensemble building, specific challenges arise from the fact that data are constantly revised, hindering the use of standard approaches. We find that post-processing can improve the individual performance of almost all considered models both in terms of evaluation scores and forecast interval coverage. Improving upon the performance of unweighted ensemble nowcasts via weighting schemes, on the other hand, poses a substantial challenge. Across an array of approaches, we find modest improvement in scores for some and decreased performance for most, with overall more favorable results for simple methods. In terms of forecast interval coverage, however, our methods lead to rather consistent improvements over the unweighted ensembles.

                <p>by Nachshon Korem, Or Duek, Ruonan Jia, Emily Wertheimer, Sierra Metviner, Michael Grubb, Ifat Levy</p>

Modeling decision-making under uncertainty typically relies on quantitative outcomes. Many decisions, however, are qualitative in nature, posing problems for traditional models. Here, we aimed to model uncertainty attitudes in decisions with qualitative outcomes. Participants made choices between certain outcomes and the chance for more favorable outcomes in quantitative (monetary) and qualitative (medical) modalities. Using computational modeling, we estimated the values participants assigned to qualitative outcomes and compared uncertainty attitudes across domains. Our model provided a good fit for the data, including quantitative estimates for qualitative outcomes. The model outperformed a utility function in quantitative decisions. Additionally, we found an association between ambiguity attitudes across domains. Results were replicated in an independent sample. We demonstrate the ability to extract quantitative measures from qualitative outcomes, leading to better estimation of subjective values. This allows for the characterization of individual behavior traits under a wide range of conditions.

                <p>by Rafael E. Venado, Jennifer Wilker, Vânia C. S. Pankievicz, Valentina Infante, April MacIntyre, Emily S. A. Wolf, Saddie Vela, Fletcher Robbins, Paulo Ivan Fernandes-Júnior, Wilfred Vermerris, Jean-Michel Ané</p>

Sorghum (<i>Sorghum bicolor</i>) is an important food, feed, and fodder crop worldwide and is gaining popularity as an energy crop due to its high potential for biomass production. Some sorghum accessions develop many aerial roots and produce an abundant carbohydrate-rich mucilage after rain. This aerial root mucilage is similar to that observed in landraces of maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) from southern Mexico, which have been previously shown to host diazotrophs. In this study, we characterized the aerial root development of several sorghum accessions and the impact of humidity on this trait. We conducted a microbiome study of the aerial root mucilage of maize and sorghum and isolated numerous diazotrophs from field sorghum mucilage. We observed that the prevailing phyla in the mucilage were Pseudomonadota, Bacteroidota, and Bacillota. However, bacterial abundances varied based on the genotype and the location. Using acetylene reduction, <sup>15</sup>N<sub>2</sub> gas feeding, and <sup>15</sup>N isotope dilution assays, we confirmed that these sorghum accessions can acquire about 40% of their nitrogen from the atmosphere through these associations on aerial roots. Nitrogen fixation in sorghum aerial root mucilage offers a promising avenue to reduce reliance on synthetic fertilizers and promote sustainable agricultural practices for food, feed, fodder, and bioenergy production.

                <p>by Nicholas C. Morano, Davys H. Lopez, Hagar Meltzer, Alina P. Sergeeva, Phinikoula S. Katsamba, Kevin D. Rostam, Himanshu Pawankumar Gupta, Jordan E. Becker, Bavat Bornstein, Filip Cosmanescu, Oren Schuldiner, Barry Honig, Richard S. Mann, Lawrence Shapiro</p>

In <i>Drosophila</i>, two interacting adhesion protein families, Defective proboscis responses (Dprs) and Dpr interacting proteins (DIPs), coordinate the assembly of neural networks. While intercellular DIP::Dpr interactions have been well characterized, DIPs and Dprs are often co-expressed within the same cells, raising the question as to whether they also interact in <i>cis</i>. We show, in cultured cells and in vivo, that DIP-α and DIP-δ can interact in <i>cis</i> with their ligands, Dpr6/10 and Dpr12, respectively. When co-expressed in <i>cis</i> with their cognate partners, these Dprs regulate the extent of <i>trans</i> binding, presumably through competitive <i>cis</i> interactions. We demonstrate the neurodevelopmental effects of <i>cis</i> inhibition in fly motor neurons and in the mushroom body. We further show that a long disordered region of DIP-α at the C-terminus is required for <i>cis</i> but not <i>trans</i> interactions, likely because it alleviates geometric constraints on <i>cis</i> binding. Thus, the balance between <i>cis</i> and <i>trans</i> interactions plays a role in controlling neural development.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-252/v1?src=rss">Optimizing treatment of lepromatous form of leprosy using ofloxacin on top of standard multi-drug therapy in National Referral Hospital, Jakarta, Indonesia [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Standard multi-drug therapy (MDT) with duration of 6-12 months is generally effective for treating leprosy. However, in cases of lepromatous (LL) and borderline lepromatous (BL) patients with high bacterial loads and complicated circumtances, prolonged duration treatment is more often observed. As prolonged duration may affect patient adherence negatively, adding ofloxacin to MDT is a promising approach to prevent prolonged treatment. Method This retrospective cohort study investigated the effects of adding ofloxacin to MDT in 21 patients diagnosed with LL or BL leprosy at Cipto Mangunkusumo National Referral Hospital, Jakarta, Indonesia. Bacterial load and viability were tracked using the Bacteriological Index (BI) and Morphological Index (MI), and were compared using non-parametric Friedman test before and after the patients were given ofloxacin. Findings Adding ofloxacin to MDT led to a significant reductions in both BI and MI. The median MI dropped to zero after six months of combined treatment (p<0.001), with significant differences between baseline and 6, 9, and 12-months. BI also significantly declined (p=0.007), with significant reductions between baseline and 3, 6, 9, and 12-month assessments. The proportion of patients reaching an MI of zero also steadily increased. Interpretation Ofloxacin as an adjunctive therapy to MDT substantially improves treatment of leprosy with high bacterial and morphological index. Faster bacterial clearance prevent prolonged treatment duration, potentially improving adherence, outcomes and reducing relapse risk. Ofloxacin is the only second-line leprosy treatment covered by the national health insurance in Indonesia. Earlier initiation of this adjunctive therapy may offer greater benefits.

                This paper explores the diverse forms of digital democracy in the West and Asia from a human perspective. In particular, it analyzes the differences in the approaches to data governance in the US and the EU, the different strategies for democratization in the Middle East, and the rise of digital authoritarianism in China. Furthermore, it proposes an Asian approach to cyber governance based on Confucian thought, and advocates the creation of a collaborative global digital order with diverse stakeholders that emphasizes a balance between individual rights and the well-being of the community. Next, the paper highlights the rise of digital authoritarianism, particularly in China’s “Great Firewall” system and its export of surveillance technology to developing countries. This trend underscores fears that centralized AI and big-data analytics could enable “digital dictatorships,” manipulating citizens’ information flows and curtailing liberties. Meanwhile, Western democracies themselves grapple with election interference through social media. Drawing on Confucian thought and the Kyoto School, the author proposes that an Asian approach to cyber governance could balance individual rights and communal well-being. Instead of imposing Western models, careful, incremental integration of democratic ideals—such as personal “right of certification”—into digital frameworks might avoid the pitfalls that plagued abrupt Middle East interventions. The paper concludes by urging a pluralistic, multi-stakeholder approach to setting fair cyber norms and privacy standards, aiming to foster a more stable, inclusive global digital order.

<p>Dystonia research focuses on the identification of converging biological pathways, allowing to define molecular drivers that serve as treatment targets. We summarize evidence supporting the concept that aberrations in purine metabolism intersect with dystonia pathogenesis. The recent discovery of <i>IMPDH2</i>-related dystonia introduced a gain-of-function paradigm in purinergic system defects, offering new perspectives to understand purine-pool imbalances in brain diseases. We discuss commonalities between known dystonia-linked mechanisms and mechanisms emerging from studies of purine metabolism disorders including Lesch–Nyhan disease. Together, we hypothesize that a greater appreciation of the relevance of purine perturbances in dystonia can offer fresh avenues for therapeutic intervention. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                <p>Nature Photonics, Published online: 03 March 2025; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41566-025-01637-w">doi:10.1038/s41566-025-01637-w</a></p>The researchers exploit exciton-to-trion conversion in ångström-thick semiconductors for all-optical detection of electrical activity in cardiomyocyte cultures. This approach affords high temporal resolution and paves the way for elusive label-free all-optical voltage-sensing applications of two-dimensional semiconductor materials in the biological domain.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100284">Electrostatics of salt-dependent reentrant phase behaviors highlights diverse roles of ATP in biomolecular condensates</a></h4>

              
                Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) involving intrinsically disordered protein regions (IDRs) is a major physical mechanism for biological membraneless compartmentalization. The multifaceted electrostatic effects in these biomolecular condensates are exemplified here by experimental and theoretical investigations of the different salt- and ATP-dependent LLPSs of an IDR of messenger RNA-regulating protein Caprin1 and its phosphorylated variant pY-Caprin1, exhibiting, for example, reentrant behaviors in some instances but not others. Experimental data are rationalized by physical modeling using analytical theory, molecular dynamics, and polymer field-theoretic simulations, indicating that interchain ion bridges enhance LLPS of polyelectrolytes such as Caprin1 and the high valency of ATP-magnesium is a significant factor for its colocalization with the condensed phases, as similar trends are observed for other IDRs. The electrostatic nature of these features complements ATP’s involvement in π-related interactions and as an amphiphilic hydrotrope, underscoring a general role of biomolecular condensates in modulating ion concentrations and its functional ramifications.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88849">SIV-specific neutralizing antibody induction following selection of a PI3K drive-attenuated nef variant</a></h4>

              
                HIV and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infections are known for impaired neutralizing antibody (NAb) responses. While sequential virus–host B cell interaction appears to be basally required for NAb induction, driver molecular signatures predisposing to NAb induction still remain largely unknown. Here we describe SIV-specific NAb induction following a virus–host interplay decreasing aberrant viral drive of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K). Screening of seventy difficult-to-neutralize SIV<sub>mac239</sub>-infected macaques found nine NAb-inducing animals, with seven selecting for a specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell escape mutation in viral <i>nef</i> before NAb induction. This Nef-G63E mutation reduced excess Nef interaction-mediated drive of B-cell maturation-limiting PI3K/mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2). In vivo imaging cytometry depicted preferential Nef perturbation of cognate Envelope-specific B cells, suggestive of polarized contact-dependent Nef transfer and corroborating cognate B-cell maturation post-mutant selection up to NAb induction. Results collectively exemplify a NAb induction pattern extrinsically reciprocal to human PI3K gain-of-function antibody-dysregulating disease and indicate that harnessing the PI3K/mTORC2 axis may facilitate NAb induction against difficult-to-neutralize viruses including HIV/SIV.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102002">A conformational fingerprint for amyloidogenic light chains</a></h4>

              
                Both immunoglobulin light-chain (LC) amyloidosis (AL) and multiple myeloma (MM) share the overproduction of a clonal LC. However, while LCs in MM remain soluble in circulation, AL LCs misfold into toxic-soluble species and amyloid fibrils that accumulate in organs, leading to distinct clinical manifestations. The significant sequence variability of LCs has hindered the understanding of the mechanisms driving LC aggregation. Nevertheless, emerging biochemical properties, including dimer stability, conformational dynamics, and proteolysis susceptibility, distinguish AL LCs from those in MM under native conditions. This study aimed to identify a<sup>2</sup> conformational fingerprint distinguishing AL from MM LCs. Using small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) under native conditions, we analyzed four AL and two MM LCs. We observed that AL LCs exhibited a slightly larger radius of gyration and greater deviations from X-ray crystallography-determined or predicted structures, reflecting enhanced conformational dynamics. SAXS data, integrated with molecular dynamics simulations, revealed a conformational ensemble where LCs adopt multiple states, with variable and constant domains either bent or straight. AL LCs displayed a distinct, low-populated, straight conformation (termed H state), which maximized solvent accessibility at the interface between constant and variable domains. Hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry experimentally validated this H state. These findings reconcile diverse experimental observations and provide a precise structural target for future drug design efforts.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97234">The Kv2.2 channel mediates the inhibition of prostaglandin E2 on glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in pancreatic β-cells</a></h4>

              
                Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is an endogenous inhibitor of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) and plays an important role in pancreatic β-cell dysfunction in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This study aimed to explore the underlying mechanism by which PGE2 inhibits GSIS. Our results showed that PGE2 inhibited Kv2.2 channels via increasing PKA activity in HEK293T cells overexpressed with Kv2.2 channels. Point mutation analysis demonstrated that S448 residue was responsible for the PKA-dependent modulation of Kv2.2. Furthermore, the inhibitory effect of PGE2 on Kv2.2 was blocked by EP2/4 receptor antagonists, while mimicked by EP2/4 receptor agonists. The immune fluorescence results showed that EP1–4 receptors are expressed in both mouse and human β-cells. In INS-1(832/13) β-cells, PGE2 inhibited voltage-gated potassium currents and electrical activity through EP2/4 receptors and Kv2.2 channels. Knockdown of <i>Kcnb2</i> reduced the action potential firing frequency and alleviated the inhibition of PGE2 on GSIS in INS-1(832/13) β-cells. PGE2 impaired glucose tolerance in wild-type mice but did not alter glucose tolerance in <i>Kcnb2</i> knockout mice. Knockout of <i>Kcnb2</i> reduced electrical activity, GSIS and abrogated the inhibition of PGE2 on GSIS in mouse islets. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that PGE2 inhibits GSIS in pancreatic β-cells through the EP2/4-Kv2.2 signaling pathway. The findings highlight the significant role of Kv2.2 channels in the regulation of β-cell repetitive firing and insulin secretion, and contribute to the understanding of the molecular basis of β-cell dysfunction in diabetes.

                The neural noise hypothesis of dyslexia posits an imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory (E/I) brain activity as an underlying mechanism of reading difficulties. This study provides the first direct test of this hypothesis using both electroencephalography (EEG) power spectrum measures in 120 Polish adolescents and young adults (60 with dyslexia, 60 controls) and glutamate (Glu) and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) concentrations from magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) at 7T MRI scanner in half of the sample. Our results, supported by Bayesian statistics, show no evidence of E/I balance differences between groups, challenging the hypothesis that cortical hyperexcitability underlies dyslexia. These findings suggest that alternative mechanisms must be explored and highlight the need for further research into the E/I balance and its role in neurodevelopmental disorders.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102782">Ethograms predict visual fear conditioning status in rats</a></h4>

              
                Recognizing and responding to threat cues is essential to survival. Freezing is a predominant threat behavior in rats. We have recently shown that a threat cue can organize diverse behaviors beyond freezing, including locomotion (Chu et al., 2024). However, that experimental design was complex, required many sessions, and had rats receive many foot shock presentations. Moreover, the findings were descriptive. Here, we gave female and male Long Evans rats cue light illumination paired or unpaired with foot shock (8 total) in a conditioned suppression setting, using a range of shock intensities (0.15, 0.25, 0.35, or 0.50 mA). We found that conditioned suppression was only observed at higher foot shock intensities (0.35 mA and 0.50 mA). We constructed comprehensive temporal ethograms by scoring 22,272 frames across 12 behavior categories in 200-ms intervals around cue light illumination. The 0.50 mA and 0.35 mA shock-paired visual cues suppressed reward seeking, rearing, and scaling, as well as light-directed rearing and light-directed scaling. The shock-paired visual cue further elicited locomotion and freezing. Linear discriminant analyses showed that ethogram data could accurately classify rats into paired and unpaired groups. Using complete ethogram data produced superior classification compared to behavior subsets, including an Immobility subset featuring freezing. The results demonstrate diverse threat behaviors – in a short and simple procedure – containing sufficient information to distinguish the visual fear conditioning status of individual rats.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99593">Emergence of alternative stable states in microbial communities undergoing horizontal gene transfer</a></h4>

              
                Microbial communities living in the same environment often display alternative stable states, each characterized by a unique composition of species. Understanding the origin and determinants of microbiome multistability has broad implications in environments, human health, and microbiome engineering. However, despite its conceptual importance, how multistability emerges in complex communities remains largely unknown. Here, we focused on the role of horizontal gene transfer (HGT), one important aspect mostly overlooked in previous studies, on the stability landscape of microbial populations. Combining mathematical modeling and numerical simulations, we demonstrate that, when mobile genetic elements (MGEs) only affect bacterial growth rates, increasing HGT rate in general promotes multistability of complex microbiota. We further extend our analysis to scenarios where HGT changes interspecies interactions, microbial communities are subjected to strong environmental selections and microbes live in metacommunities consisting of multiple local habitats. We also discuss the role of different mechanisms, including interspecies interaction strength, the growth rate effects of MGEs, MGE epistasis and microbial death rates in shaping the multistability of microbial communities undergoing HGT. These results reveal how different dynamic processes collectively shape community multistability and diversity. Our results provide key insights for the predictive control and engineering of complex microbiota.

">Parental origin of transgene determines recombination efficiency in GFAP-creERT2 mice</a></h4>

              
                The Cre-loxP system is a powerful tool for spatial and temporal genetic manipulations. However, the system is prone to several limitations and caveats with respect to variable expression and recombination in unintended cell types. Using one of the most widely used astrocyte Cre lines, hGFAP-creERT2 (GFAP-cre/ERT2)505Fmv/J), we found that parental origin of the hGFAP-creERT2 transgene is a determinant of recombination efficiency. Recombination was robust in animals with paternally inherited hGFAP-creERT2. However, animals with maternally inherited Cre exhibited little to no recombination. This result was recapitulated using female hGFAP-creERT2 mice procured directly from Jackson Laboratory. We did not observe transgenerational suppression of Cre recombination in maternally inherited hGFAP-CreERT2. These data highlight the need for careful planning and documentation of breeding schemes when working with Cre mice.

">Increased Callosal Thickness in Early Trained Opera Singers</a></h4>

              
                Extensive research has shown how the corpus callosum adapts to early sensorimotor training in instrumental musicians, yet less is known about these effects in professional singers. This study used high-resolution MRI to investigate variations in callosal thickness in relation to vocal training in 55 participants, including 27 professionally trained opera singers and 28 non-singers. Results indicated trend-level differences with thicker callosal regions in singers, particularly at the anterior-posterior midbody border and the isthmus, though these did not survive corrections for multiple comparisons. However, a significant negative correlation between age at first singing lesson and callosal thickness was found in the anterior third (rostrum, genu, rostral body), the anterior-posterior midbody border, and the isthmus, suggesting that early vocal training facilitates lasting neuroplastic adaptations in these regions. Additionally, a positive trend between years of professional singing and greater thickness in the midbody was observed but did not remain significant after correction for multiple comparisons. Greater callosal thickness likely enhances interhemispheric connectivity to meet the demands of operatic performance, highlighting the adaptability of the corpus callosum to early, sustained sensorimotor training. By extending evidence from instrumental musicians to singers, these results underscore developmental timing as a key factor in how sensorimotor training shapes brain structure.

">Expression of Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 3 (FGFR3) in the Human Peripheral Nervous System: Implications for the Putative Pathogenic Role of FGFR3 Autoantibodies in Neuropathy</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Autoantibodies to the Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 3 (FGFR3-AAbs) have been associated with idiopathic sensory-predominant neuropathy. The pathogenicity of FGFR3-AAbs in this disorder is unknown. Pathogenic mechanisms of autoantibodies in other dysimmune neuropathies commonly involve their direct binding to antigens on either neurons or glia. The expression of FGFR3 in the human peripheral nervous system is unknown. Therefore, as an initial step toward clarifying the pathogenicity of FGFR3-AAbs, we characterized the expression of FGFR3 in nerve (hNerve), dorsal root ganglia (hDRG) and spinal cord (hSC) in human. Methods: FGFR3 mRNA was assayed via in situ hybridization (ISH) on post-mortem sections of hNerve, hDRG and hSC, and by re-analysis of RNA-sequencing data from hDRG. FGFR3 protein was assayed in these tissues using capillary electrophoretic immunoassays (CEIA) with several validated anti-FGFR3 antibodies. Results: FGFR3 mRNA was not detected in hNerve or hDRG but was abundant in hSC by ISH. FGFR3 protein was absent from hNerve and hDRG by CEIA but was moderately expressed in hSC. Discussion: A direct pathogenic mechanism of FGFR3-AAbs in sensory neuropathy would require the expression of FGFR3 in either neurons or non-neuronal cells in nerve or DRG. Using multiple methods, we did not detect FGFR3 expression at the mRNA or protein levels in these tissues. Given the absence of FGFR3 from hNerve and hDRG, it is improbable that FGFR3-AAbs cause direct damage to the neural components involved in neuropathy and thus are unlikely to be pathogenic, although indirect mechanisms via non-neural cells cannot be excluded.

">A correlative workflow streamlines synaptic imaging by cryo-electron tomography</a></h4>

              
                Despite decades of intense research, the molecular organization of the synapse is not well understood. To address this issue, we sought to develop a method for systematic imaging of synapses by cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET), a technology capable of mapping cellular architecture at molecular resolution. Thinning of cellular samples by cryo-focused ion beam milling is a prerequisite for high-quality cryo-ET imaging, but this process needs to be guided to the structures of interest. To allow robust synaptic targeting, we established a correlative cryo-light/electron microscopy approach by which synapses are fluorescently labeled in a minimally invasive manner, using a synthetic binder of the postsynaptic scaffold PSD-95 and antibodies against the presynaptic protein Synaptotagmin-1. Cryo-ET imaging at sites of colocalization consistently revealed excitatory synapses. Our method allows structural studies of synaptic protein complexes in situ, facilitating investigations of the molecular architecture of synapses.

">Distinct forms of amyloid-β moderate sleep duration through NAD+-linked redox metabolism in Alzheimer's disease.</a></h4>

              
                Sleep disruptions precede a clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) by several years. However, how AD pathologies affect sleep remains unclear. Here, we integrate epidemiological data with insights from Drosophila models of AD to investigate how AD progression could be linked to sleep disruption. We found that individuals with a high risk of AD report a shorter sleep duration than do those with a clinical diagnosis of AD. We showed that the expression of different forms of amyloid-{beta} in flies can replicate these variations in sleep duration. Analysis of the metabolome and proteome of these flies revealed distinct changes in NAD+-linked redox metabolism and levels of hyperkinetic (Hk), a redox-sensing sleep homeostat. We showed that the genetic upregulation of Hk is neuroprotective and increased KCNAB2 expression in the brain decreases AD risk in humans. Overall, our data provides a new mechanism linking the disruption of NAD+-linked redox sensing and sleep disruption in AD.

">Parallel gene expression changes in ventral midbrain dopamine and GABA neurons during normal aging</a></h4>

              
                The consequences of aging can vary dramatically between different brain regions and cell types. In the ventral midbrain, dopaminergic neurons develop physiological deficits with normal aging that likely convey susceptibility to neurodegeneration. While nearby GABAergic neurons are thought to be more resilient, decreased GABA signaling in other areas nonetheless correlates with age-related cognitive decline and the development of degenerative diseases. Here, we used two novel cell type-specific Translating Ribosome Affinity Purification models to elucidate the impact of healthy brain aging on the molecular profiles of dopamine and GABA neurons in the ventral midbrain. By analyzing differential gene expression from young (6-10 month) and old (>21 month) mice, we detected commonalities in the aging process in both neuronal types, including increased inflammatory responses and upregulation of pro-survival pathways. Both cell types also showed downregulation of genes involved in synaptic connectivity and plasticity. Genes involved in serotonergic signaling were upregulated with age only in GABA neurons and not dopamine-releasing cells. In contrast, dopaminergic neurons showed alterations in genes connected with mitochondrial function and calcium signaling, which were markedly downregulated in male mice. Sex differences were detected in both neuron types, but in general were more prominent in dopamine neurons. Multiple sex effects correlated with the differential prevalence for neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's seen in humans. In summary, these results provide insight into the connection between non-pathological aging and susceptibility to neurodegenerative diseases involving the ventral midbrain, and identify molecular phenotypes that could underlie homeostatic maintenance during normal aging.

">Metacognitive Reactivity and Temporal Perception: The Influence of Confidence Ratings on the Temporal Binding Window</a></h4>

              
                The influence of confidence in assessing the perceived timing of sensory events on perceptual decision-making remains poorly understood. Metacognition - the ability to reflect on one's thought processes - is often assessed through confidence ratings in perceptual tasks. However, accessing metacognitive information can influence task performance, a phenomenon known as the reactivity effect. This study examines metacognitive reactivity by examining the impact of confidence ratings on the temporal binding window (TBW) in two multisensory time perception tasks that use identical stimuli but require different judgments: Temporal Order Judgment (TOJ) and Simultaneity Judgment (SJ). Thirty-five participants (aged 18-39) completed TOJ and SJ tasks with and without confidence ratings via Prolific, an online participant recruitment platform. Psychometric functions were fitted to response and confidence data to determine TBW and the point of subjective simultaneity (PSS). Both tasks exhibited reactivity effects, with the effect being stronger in the SJ task. TBW significantly differed between TOJ and SJ tasks, regardless of confidence ratings. Additionally, TBWs from TOJ and SJ tasks were strongly correlated, as were the width parameters of confidence curves, suggesting shared underlying mechanisms in both perceptual and metacognitive processes. These findings highlight the utility of confidence ratings in evaluating TOJ and SJ performance, revealing both task differences and commonalities. We also discuss the potential for training interventions to enhance temporal perception, particularly in older adults. Finally, we reflect on the advantages and challenges of online data collection via Prolific, including its diverse participant pool and timing precision limitations.

	<p>Background/Objectives: Aphasia is a neurological condition affecting the ability to understand and/or express language fluently and accurately, and can occur following stroke, traumatic injuries, or other brain pathologies. The aim of the following study was to provide clinicians and researchers information regarding the existing assessment tools to assess aphasia. Methods: For this Systematic Review, PubMed, CINAHL, Web of Science, and Scopus were searched for articles published up to August 2024. Authors independently identified eligible studies based on predefined inclusion criteria and extracted data. The study quality and risk of bias were assessed using the Consensus-based Standards for the Selection of Health Measurement Instruments (COSMIN) checklist. Results: Of the 1278 publications identified and screened, 238 studies fell within the inclusion criteria and were critically reviewed, and 164 assessment tools were found and divided into 8 main domains; the most used tools were the Language Screening Test (LAST), the Stroke and Aphasia Quality of Life Scale-39 (SAQOL-39), the Oxford Cognitive Screen (OCS), and the Token test. Conclusions: This review has emphasized the need for agreement among researchers as to which tool must be studied or adapted to other national contexts to develop universal norms and standards.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation (TEAS), also known as transcutaneous electroacupuncture stimulation, delivers electrical pulses to the skin over acupuncture points (&amp;amp;ldquo;acupoints&amp;amp;rdquo;) via surface electrodes. Electroencephalography (EEG) is an important tool for assessing the changes in the central nervous system (CNS) that may result from applying different TEAS frequencies peripherally&amp;amp;mdash;i.e., acting via the peripheral nervous system (PNS)&amp;amp;mdash;and determining how these influence cerebral activity and neural plasticity. Methods: A total of 48 healthy volunteers were allocated in a semi-randomized crossover study to receive four different TEAS frequencies: 2.5 pulses per second (pps); 10 pps; 80 pps; and sham (160 pps at a low, clinically ineffective amplitude). TEAS was applied for 20 min to each hand at the acupuncture point Hegu (LI4). The EEG was recorded during an initial 5 min baseline recording, then during TEAS application, and after stimulation for a further 15 min, separated into three periods of 5 min (initial, intermediate, and final) in order to assess post-stimulation changes. Source localization analysis was conducted for the traditional five EEG frequency bands: delta (0.1&amp;amp;ndash;3.9 Hz), theta (4&amp;amp;ndash;7.9 Hz), alpha (8&amp;amp;ndash;13 Hz), beta (14&amp;amp;ndash;30 Hz), and gamma (30.1&amp;amp;ndash;45 Hz). Results: Within-group source localization analyses of EEG data showed that during the initial 5 min post-stimulation, theta oscillations in the 2.5 pps TEAS group increased over the parahippocampal gyrus (t = 4.42, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01). The 10 pps TEAS group exhibited decreased alpha rhythms over the inferior parietal gyrus (t = &amp;amp;minus;4.20, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05), whereas the sham (160 pps) TEAS group showed decreased delta rhythms over the postcentral gyrus (t = &amp;amp;minus;3.97, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). During the intermediate 5 min post-stimulation, the increased theta activity over the left parahippocampal gyrus (BA27) remained in the 2.5 pps TEAS group (t = 3.97, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). However, diminished alpha rhythms were observed in the 10 pps TEAS group over the postcentral gyrus (t = &amp;amp;minus;4.20, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01), as well as in the delta rhythms in the sham (160 pps) TEAS group in the same area (t = &amp;amp;minus;4.35, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01). In the final 5 min post-stimulation, reduced alpha rhythms were exhibited over the insula in the 10 pps TEAS group (t = &amp;amp;minus;4.07, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). Interaction effects of condition by group demonstrate decreased alpha rhythms in the 10 pps TEAS group over the supramarginal gyrus during the initial 5 min post-stimulation (t = &amp;amp;minus;4.31, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05), and decreased delta rhythms over the insula in the sham TEAS group during the final 5 min post-stimulation (t = &amp;amp;minus;4.42, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01). Conclusions: This study revealed that low TEAS frequencies of 2.5 pps and 10 pps modulate theta and alpha oscillations over the brain areas related to emotional and attentional processes driven by external stimuli, as well as neural synchronization of delta rhythms in the sham group in brain areas related to stimulus expectation at baseline. It is hoped that these findings will stimulate further research in order to evaluate such TEAS modulation effects in clinical patients.</p>

     alt="Microglial Engulfment of Multisensory Terminals in the Midbrain Inferior Colliculus During an Early Critical Period"/>
<p>We used anterograde tracing and immunocytochemical approaches in living brain preparations to explore microglial involvement in the pruning of multisensory midbrain afferents. Experiments spanning an early postnatal critical period in the lateral cortex of the inferior colliculus (LCIC) demonstrate that the engulfment of auditory terminals from the neighboring central nucleus (CNIC) is developmentally regulated but not dependent upon fractalkine receptor (CX3CR1) signaling. Individual CX3CR1-positive microglia phagocytose both auditory and somatosensory endings that largely colocalize with the lysosomal marker, CD68.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The lateral cortex of the inferior colliculus (LCIC) receives multisensory input arrays that preferentially target its compartmental organization. Inputs of somatosensory origin end within modular zones, while auditory inputs terminate throughout an encompassing matrix. Such discrete mapping emerges during an early postnatal critical period (birth to postnatal day 12, P12) via a process of segregation. Similar to other primitive brain maps, it appears an initial excess of connections may be pruned through a refinement process. Microglial cells (MGCs) are involved in a variety of systems in the selective removal and degradation of unnecessary contacts. Aberrations in map plasticity during early critical periods have been associated with certain neurodevelopmental conditions, including autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Despite evidence linking multisensory integration deficits with cognitive/behavioral disturbances associated with ASD, mechanisms that govern multimodal network modifications remain poorly understood. Thus, the present study combines novel tract-tracing approaches in living brain preparations and immunocytochemistry in CX3CR1-GFP knock-in mice to determine: (1) if fractalkine signaling (CX3CL1–CX3CR1) influences MGC engulfment of auditory afferents, (2) whether individual MGCs phagocytose endings of multisensory origin (auditory and somatosensory), and (3) whether consumed product is degraded via the MGC's lysosomal pathway. We demonstrate active MGC pruning of auditory endings at peak LCIC stages for projection shaping (P4, P8) that significantly decreases coincident with its critical period closure (P12). While developmentally regulated, auditory engulfment appears fractalkine signaling-independent. We also provide evidence that individual LCIC microglia engulf both auditory and somatosensory terminals that co-localize with the lysosomal marker, CD68. These results suggest a prominent role for microglia in the remodeling of early multisensory midbrain maps.</p>

">Modeling Organoid Population Electrophysiology Dynamics</a></h4>

              
                Improving models to investigate neurodegenerative disease, neurodevelopmental disease, neurotoxicology and neuropharmacology is critical to improve our basic understanding of the human nervous system, as well as to accelerate discovery of interventions and drugs. Improved models of the human central nervous system could enable critical discoveries related to functional changes induced by sensory stimulation or toxic exposures. Neural organoids, complex three-dimensional cell cultures derived from adult human stem cells, have been grown with complex connectivity and neuroanatomy. Moreover, these cultures have been interfaced with bi-directional electrical stimulation and recording, as well as chemical stimulation. This effort sought to develop new computational techniques which could be applied to comparative studies using neural organoids. In particular, we adapted CEBRA, a state of the art model from the emph{in vivo} modeling literature, to generate 2D and 3D embeddings (projections into structured low-dimensional spaces) of high dimensional neural organoid electrophysiology data. This can be done in an unsupervised or semi-supervised manner. Results indicate these embeddings can be quickly and reliably generated and serve as a low-dimensional, interpretable embeddings for characterizing changes in neural organoid activity over time, as well as clustering results around known bursting phenomena. Moreover, we demonstrate that mixtures of von Mises-Fisher distributions can be used as a parametric model for these embedding spaces to enable statistics hypothesis testing. This technique may enable new types of comparative studies using neural organoids, and may be critical for creating a representation for quantitative comparison and validation of neural organoid models against human and animal data. Looking ahead, this work could allow the formulation of a new class of experiments investigating the functional impact of toxins, genetic manipulations, or pharmacological interventions on human neurons.

">Citrullination of TDP-43 is a key post-translation modification associated with structural and functional changes and progressive pathology in TDP-43 mouse models and human proteinopathies</a></h4>

              
                TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) pathology is associated with a spectrum of clinical dementias including limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy neuropathological changes (LATE-NC). Post-translational modifications (PTM) are linked to TDP-43 toxic gain-of- function and cytoplasmic aggregation 1-3. Phosphorylation remains the most investigated PTM and a standard criterion for determining pathology progression and clinical subclassification in TDP-43 proteinopathies 4-7. However, full spectrum of PTMs on TDP-43 structure and biology remain unknown. Utilizing mass-spectrometry analysis we identified citrullination as a novel and irreversible bona fide PTM of TDP-43 protein. We recognized peptidyl arginine deiminase 2 and 4 (PAD2 and PAD4) to mediate the conversion of arginine (R) to citrulline (citR) in vitro and demonstrated increased PAD2 and PAD4 expression and TDP-43 citrullination in a human wildtype TDP-43 mouse model (Tg (Thy1-TARDBP4). Transmission electron microscopy imaging analysis revealed citrullination induced vast structural changes while ThT analysis demonstrated altered aggregation kinetics of citrullinated (citR) TDP-43 protein. We further provided mechanistic evidence on reduced electrostatic and pi-pi interactions of citR TDP-43 Low Complexity Domain (LCD) with RNA, favoring liquid-solid phase separation and condensate formation. Generation and validation of several citR TDP-43 specific antibodies against several TDP-43 epitopes revealed epitope and domain-specific effects of citrullination on TDP-43 solubility in vivo. Importantly, we found distinct reactivities of citR TDP-43 antibodies shedding light into the contribution of epitope-specific properties of human citR TDP-43 to novel pathological citR TDP-43 assemblies in human brain tissue from LATE-NC, with or without comorbid Alzheimers disease neuropathologic changes (ADNC). These findings provided a unique look into the temporal citR TDP-43 signatures, and the potential clinical relevance associated with progression of pure LATE-NC and comorbid ADNC + LATE-NC. Collectively, these data reveal the existence of irreversible TDP-43 citrullination at targeted sites via induced PAD2/ PAD4 activities, presenting a critical step in TDP-43 proteinopathy.

">An automated two-choice social operant task for probing moment-to-moment changes in social satiety</a></h4>

              
                In naturalistic conditions, animals must routinely make ongoing self-motivated choices about whether to initiate interactions with same or opposite-sex partners and whether to re-initiate social contact when interactions have ended. However, it remains unclear what governs these choices, and whether they are motivated by drive states that exhibit signatures of moment-to-moment social satiety when these interactions have ended. Here, to explicitly test this at the behavioral level, we designed a novel fully-automated two-choice social operant paradigm where individuals can choose between same and opposite-sex social rewards and rewards are delivered for interaction with systematically varying durations. We trained cohorts of both sexes on this task and quantified the patterns of choices. We used choice latency as a metric to infer moment-to-moment satiety to test whether increased interaction duration leads to increased moment-to-moment satiety. We find that although both males and females have stable choice biases across sessions, with males showing consistent opposite sex biases, only males exhibit behavioral signatures of moment-to-moment social satiety and are sensitive to the duration of interaction. Using a simple normative model to capture patterns of social choice, we observe that behavior is better fit by a model that has a single evolving social drive and choice bias, rather than a model with multiple, independent drives for same and opposite-sex interactions. Together, our data reveal behavioral signatures of social satiety and offer new insights into the underlying homeostatic and motivational drives that govern social choices.

">EasyEyes: Crowded Dynamic Fixation for Online Psychophysics</a></h4>

              
                Online vision testing enables efficient data collection from diverse participants but requires accurate fixation. Fixation accuracy is traditionally ensured by using a camera to track gaze. That works well in the lab, but tracking during online testing with a built-in webcam is not yet sufficiently precise. Kurzawski, Pombo, et al. (2023) introduced a fixation task that improves fixation through hand-eye coordination, requiring participants to track a moving crosshair with a mouse-controlled cursor. This dynamic fixation task greatly reduces peeking at peripheral targets relative to a stationary fixation task, but does not eliminate it. Here, we enhance fixation further by leveraging "crowding," adding clutter around the fixation mark - a method we call crowded dynamic fixation. We assessed fixation accuracy during peripheral threshold measurement. Relative to the RMS gaze error during the stationary fixation task, dynamic fixation error was 61%, while crowded dynamic fixation error was only 47%. With a 1.5-degree tolerance, peeking occurred on 9% of trials with stationary fixation, 4% with dynamic fixation, and 0% with crowded dynamic fixation. This improvement eliminated implausibly low peripheral thresholds, likely by preventing peeking. We conclude that crowded dynamic fixation enables accurate gaze control for online testing.

">Behavioural and neurogenetic evidence for emotion primitives in the fruit fly Drosophila: insights from the Open Field Test</a></h4>

              
                Emotions, defined as transient states preparing organisms for adaptive responses, are thought to be based on evolutionarily conserved building blocks ("emotion primitives") that are present across mammalian and other vertebrate species. Whether and to which extent these building blocks are found in insects is largely undefined. In this study, we employ the open field test in fruit flies and focus on wall-following and total walking activity as behavioural indicators of emotion-like states. Wildtype and transgenic flies were subjected to various conditions, including social isolation, starvation, and exposure to anxiolytic substances prior to behavioural testing in the open field test. The results indicate that wall-following and total walking activity are modulated by these conditions, with generally increased wall-following observed under aversive stimuli and decreased values under positive conditions. Notably, the behaviour was consistent across different times of the day and independent of circadian rhythms. Genetic manipulation of neuromodulatory systems, such as serotonin, dopamine, and neuropeptide F, supports the role of these pathways in modulating emotion-like states in the fruit fly. Activation of reward-related neurons decreased wall-following, while inhibition increased it, aligning with known effects in mammalian models. Additionally, pharmacological treatments with ethanol and diazepam produced predictable changes in wall-following and total walking activity, reinforcing the validity of the open field test as a measure of emotion-like states in the fly. The findings suggest that Drosophila exhibits core emotion-like states, with wall-following and total walking activity serving as reliable indicators of emotional valence and arousal. Our results promote the use of Drosophila as a powerful genetic model to dissect the neuronal and neurochemical substrates of emotion primitives, shedding light on the evolution of basic emotional processing mechanisms.

">Amphetamine in Adolescence Induces a Sex-Specific Mesolimbic Dopamine Phenotype in the Adult Prefrontal Cortex</a></h4>

              
                Drugs of abuse in adolescence impact brain maturation and increase psychiatric risk, with differences in sensitivity between males and females. Amphetamine in adolescent male, but not female mice, causes dopamine axons intended to innervate the nucleus accumbens and to grow ectopically to the prefrontal cortex (PFC). This is mediated by drug-induced downregulation of the Netrin-1 receptor DCC. How off-target dopamine axons function in the adult PFC remains to be determined. Here we report that males and females show place preference for amphetamine in adolescence. However, only in males, amphetamine increases PFC dopamine transporter expression in adulthood: leading to aberrant baseline dopamine transients, faster dopamine release, and exaggerated responses to acute methylphenidate. Upregulation of DCC in adolescence, using CRISPRa, prevents all these changes. Mesolimbic dopamine axons rerouted to the PFC in adolescence retain anatomical and functional phenotypes of their intended target, rendering males enduringly vulnerable to the harmful effects of drugs of abuse.

">Metaplastic priming enables non-ionotropic NMDA receptor-mediated synaptic depotentiation in the hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                The reversal of learning-induced synaptic potentiation through depotentiation is thought to underlie forgetting and can be influenced by prior synaptic activity. Here, we evaluated how such metaplastic alterations manifest at the synaptic level. In hippocampal slices obtained from male and female mice, we artificially induced long-term potentiation (LTP) using either a temporally spaced or compressed stimulation pattern. Using a combination of electrophysiology and protein quantification approaches, we found divergent molecular pathways recruited during depotentiation of spaced and compressed LTP. Depotentiation of both forms of LTP required glutamatergic activation of the NMDA receptor (NMDAR). However, only depotentiation of spaced LTP required ionotropic NMDAR signaling, while ion flux-independent, or non-ionotropic, NMDAR signaling was necessary and sufficient for depotentiation of compressed LTP. Downstream of NMDAR signaling, AMPA receptor phosphorylation was also differentially modified during depotentiation of spaced and compressed LTP. Finally, we found that spaced but not compressed depotentiation required synaptic Arc. Together, our results reveal that the temporal pattern of prior LTP induction exerts a metaplastic influence on the molecular pathways recruited during the induction and expression of depotentiation. Our findings have important implications for the regulation of both physiological and pathological forgetting.

">Dynamically rich states in balanced networks induced by single-neuron dynamics</a></h4>

              
                Network states with rich dynamics and highly variable firing rates of individual neurons are prominent in experimental observations and thought to benefit complex information processing and learning. Such states have been proposed to arise from properties of network coupling, like a strong connectivity or slow synaptic dynamics. Here, we identify an alternative mechanism based on weak synaptic coupling and intrinsic cellular dynamics. We show that a switch in the cellular excitability class of action-potential generation (via a switch in the underlying mathematical bifurcation), further amplified by recurrent interactions, results in super-Poissonian spiking variability in random balanced networks. Information encoding is shifted to higher frequency bands and collective chaos in the network is enhanced when intrinsic cellular dynamics follow a saddle homoclinic orbit (HOM) bifurcation. The robust effect links the biophysics of individual neurons to collective dynamics of large random networks, highlighting the relevance of single-cell dynamics for computation in physiological and artificial networks.

">Temporal Propagation of Neural State Boundaries in Naturalistic Context</a></h4>

              
                Our senses receive a continuous stream of complex information, which we segment into discrete events. Previous research has related such events to neural states: temporally and regionally specific stable patterns of brain activity. The aim of this paper was to investigate whether there was evidence for top-down or bottom-up propagation of neural state boundaries. To do so, we used intracranial measurements with high temporal resolution while subjects were watching a movie. As this is the first study of neural states in intracranial data in the context of event segmentation, we also investigated whether known properties of neural states could be replicated. The neural state boundaries indeed aligned with stimulus features and between brain areas. Importantly, we found evidence for top-down propagation of neural state boundaries at the onsets and offsets of clauses. Interestingly, we did not observe a consistent top-down or bottom-up propagation in general across all timepoints, suggesting that neural state boundaries could propagate in both a top-down and bottom-up manner, with the direction depending on the stimulus input at that moment. Taken together, our findings provide new insights on how neural state boundaries are shared across brain regions and strengthen the foundation of studying neural states in electrophysiology.

">Biologically realistic mean field model of spiking neural networks with fast and slow inhibitory synapses</a></h4>

              
                We present a mean field model for a spiking neural network of excitatory and inhibitory neurons with fast GABAA and nonlinear slow GABAB inhibitory conductance-based synapses. This mean field model can predict the spontaneous and evoked response of the network to external stimulation in asynchronous irregular regimes. The model displays theta oscillations for sufficiently strong GABAB conductance. Optogenetic activation of interneurons and an increase of GABAB conductance caused opposite effects on the emergence of gamma oscillations in the model. In agreement with direct numerical simulations of neural networks and experimental data, the mean field model predicts that an increase of GABAB conductance reduces gamma oscillations. Furthermore, the slow dynamics of GABAB synapses regulates the appearance and duration of transient gamma oscillations, namely gamma bursts, in the mean field model. Finally, we show that nonlinear GABAB synapses play a major role to stabilize the network from the emergence of epileptic seizures.

">Laterality and interhemispheric integration in the larval Drosophila olfactory system</a></h4>

              
                All animals with bilateral symmetry must integrate the sensory input from the left and right sides of their bodies to make coherent perceptual decisions. In Drosophila larvae, connectomic evidence suggests that olfactory signals from the two sides of the head are initially processed independently (as in the mammalian olfactory system) before being combined in the central brain. By pairing volumetric calcium imaging in intact larvae with microfluidic odor delivery and targeted laser ablation at the sensory periphery, we have mapped the propagation of olfactory signals between the two brain hemispheres, across successive layers of the larval olfactory system. This approach implicates the mushroom body (MB) as a key substrate for interhemispheric integration of odor representations. Whereas the two larval MBs appear to process odors largely independently at the level of their intrinsic neurons (Kenyon cells), the modulatory neurons of the MB show strongly symmetrized responses to asymmetric olfactory stimuli. Nevertheless, odor responses in some MB output neurons (MBONs), up to 5 synapses downstream from the sensory periphery, preserve information about stimulus laterality. Moreover, we show that asymmetric activation of these MBONs can modulate the animal's turning behavior in a side-biased manner. These findings suggest that the deeply lateralized architecture of the larval olfactory system balances the need for interhemispheric integration with the advantages of parallel sensory processing.

">Repulsive interactions instruct synaptic partner matching in an olfactory circuit</a></h4>

              
                Neurons exhibit extraordinary precision in selecting synaptic partners. Whereas cell-surface proteins (CSPs) mediating attractive interactions between developing axons and dendrites have been shown to instruct synaptic partner matching, it is less clear the degree to which repulsive interactions play a role. Here, using a genetic screen guided by single cell transcriptomes, we identified three CSP pairs--Toll2-Ptp10D, Fili-Kek1, and Hbs/Sns-Kirre--in mediating repulsive interactions between non-partner olfactory receptor neuron (ORN) axons and projection neuron (PN) dendrites in the developing Drosophila olfactory circuit. Each CSP pair exhibits inverse expression patterns in the select PN-ORN partners. Loss of each CSP in ORNs led to similar synaptic partner matching deficits as the loss of its partner CSP in PNs, and mistargeting phenotypes caused by overexpressing one CSP could be suppressed by loss of its partner CSP. Each CSP pair is also differentially expressed in other brain regions. Together, our data reveal that multiple repulsive CSP pairs work together to ensure precise synaptic partner matching during development by preventing neurons from forming connections with non-cognate partners.

">Shifted balance between ventral striatal prodynorphin and proenkephalin biases development of cocaine place avoidance</a></h4>

              
                Evidence from human self-report and rodent models indicate cocaine can induce a negative affective state marked by panic and anxiety, which may reduce future cocaine use or promote co-use with opiates. Dynorphin-mediated signaling within the striatum is associated with negative affect following cocaine withdrawal and stress-induced cocaine seeking. Here, we used a trace conditioning procedure to first establish the optimum parameters to capture this transient cocaine negative affective state in wild type mice, then we investigated striatal opioid peptides as a substrate mediating cocaine conditioned place avoidance (CPA). Previous reports indicate that trace conditioning, where drug administration occurs after removal from the conditioning chamber, results in CPA to ethanol, nicotine, and amphetamine. We tested different cocaine doses, conditioning session lengths, and apparatus types, to determine which combination yields the best cocaine CPA. Cocaine CPA was moderately larger at the highest cocaine dose (25 mg/kg), but this did not generalize across apparatus types and the effect was transient, thus data were collapsed across all parameters. Cocaine conditioning scores were variable, but also became more polarized across conditioning, with approximately equal proportions developing preference and avoidance. We then correlated cocaine CPA with striatal gene expression levels of the opioid peptides enkephalin (Penk) and dynorphin (Pdyn) using qPCR. Cocaine CPA was correlated with low Pdyn levels and a low Pdyn:Penk ratio in the ventral, but not dorsal, striatum. Consistent with this, mice with higher striatal Pdyn relative to Penk were more resistant to developing cocaine CPA compared to littermate controls. This approach revealed a subset of subjects sensitive to the aversive state immediately following cocaine administration. Our findings suggest striatal dynorphin has opposing roles in mediating the aversion associated with acute cocaine intoxication versus cocaine withdrawal.

">Harnessing the Evolution of Proteostasis Networks to Reverse Cognitive Dysfunction</a></h4>

              
                The integrated stress response (ISR) is a highly conserved network essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and cognitive function. Here, we investigated how persistent ISR activation impacts cognitive performance, primarily focusing on a PPP1R15BR658C genetic variant associated with intellectual disability. By generating a novel mouse model that mimics this human condition, we revealed that this variant destabilizes the PPP1R15B-PP1 phosphatase complex, resulting in chronic ISR activation, impaired protein synthesis, and deficits in long-term memory. Importantly, we found that the cognitive and synaptic deficits in Ppp1r15bR658C mice are directly due to ISR activation. Leveraging insights from evolutionary biology, we characterized DP71L, a viral orthologue of PPP1R15B, through detailed molecular and structural analyses, uncovering its mechanism of action as a potent pan-ISR inhibitor. Remarkably, we found that DP71L not only buffers cognitive decline associated with a wide array of conditions, including Down syndrome, Alzheimer disease and aging, but also enhances long-term synaptic plasticity and memory in healthy mice. These findings highlight the promise of utilizing evolutionary insight to inform innovative therapeutic strategies.

">Rewiring an olfactory circuit by altering the combinatorial code of cell-surface proteins</a></h4>

              
                Proper brain function requires the precise assembly of neural circuits during development. Despite the identification of many cell-surface proteins (CSPs) that help guide axons to their targets, it remains largely unknown how multiple CSPs work together to assemble a functional circuit. Here, we used synaptic partner matching in the Drosophila olfactory circuit to address this question. By systematically altering the combination of differentially expressed CSPs in a single olfactory receptor neuron (ORN) type, which senses a male pheromone that inhibits male-male courtship, we switched its connection from its endogenous postsynaptic projection neuron (PN) type nearly completely to a new PN type that promotes courtship. To achieve this switch, we deduced a combinatorial code including CSPs that mediate both attractive and repulsive interactions between synaptic partners. The anatomical switch changed the odor response of the new PN partner and markedly increased male-male courtship. We generalized three manipulation strategies from this rewiring to successfully rewire a second ORN type to multiple distinct PN types. This work demonstrates that manipulating a small set of CSPs is sufficient to respecify synaptic connections, paving ways to explore how neural systems evolve through changes of circuit connectivity.

">Transcranial ultrasonic stimulation of central thalamus reduces arousal in healthy volunteers</a></h4>

              
                We present the first causal evidence in healthy humans linking central thalamus to vigilance and pulvinar to visuospatial attention using low-intensity transcranial focused ultrasound stimulation (tFUS). In a within-subjects, counterbalanced design, 27 healthy volunteers completed the Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT), a measure of vigilance, and the Egly Driver Task (EDT), which assesses visuospatial attention, before and after central thalamus, pulvinar, and sham sonication with tFUS. Central thalamic sonication significantly impaired performance on both tasks in a manner consistent with decreases in arousal. Pulvinar sonication resulted in more subtle effects consistent with a selective disruption of visuospatial attention. Specifically, participants were less responsive to visual stimuli presented in the visual field contralateral to the targeted pulvinar. These results demonstrate that tFUS can elicit measurable behavioral changes in healthy volunteers and underscores its potential as a high-resolution tool for noninvasive brain mapping, capable of differentiating functional contributions of adjacent thalamic nuclei only millimeters apart.

">Smart Dura: a functional artificial dura for multimodal neural recording and modulation</a></h4>

              
                A multi-modal neural interface capable of long-term recording and stimulation is essential for advancing brain monitoring and developing targeted therapeutics. Among the traditional electrophysiological methods, micro-electrocorticography (ECoG) is appealing for chronic applications because it provides a good compromise between invasiveness and high-resolution neural recording. When combining ECoG with optical technologies, such as calcium imaging and optogenetics, this multi-modal approach enables the simultaneous collection of neural activity from individual neurons and the ability to perform cell-specific manipulation. While previous efforts have focused on multi-modal interfaces for small animal models, scaling these technologies to larger brains, of primates, remains challenging. In this paper, we present a multi-modal neural interface, named Smart Dura, a functional version of the commonly used artificial dura with integrated electrophysiological electrodes for large cortical area coverage for the NHP brain. The Smart Dura is fabricated using a novel thin-film microfabrication process to monolithically integrate a micron-scale electrode array into a soft, flexible, and transparent substrate with high-density electrodes (up to 256 electrodes) while providing matched mechanical compliance with the native tissue and achieving high optical transparency (exceeding 97%). Our in vivo experiments demonstrate electrophysiological recording capabilities combined with neuromodulation, as well as optical transparency via multiphoton imaging. This work paves the way toward a chronic neural interface that can provide large-scale, bidirectional interfacing for multimodal and closed-loop neuromodulation capabilities to study cortical brain activity in non-human primates, with the potential for translation to humans.

">Shapley Fields Reveal Chemotopic Organization in the Mouse Olfactory Bulb Across Diverse Chemical Feature Sets</a></h4>

              
                Representations of chemical features in the neural activity of the olfactory bulb (OB) are not well-understood, unlike the neural code for stimuli of the other sensory modalities. This is because the space of olfactory stimuli lacks a natural coordinate system, and this significantly complicates characterizing neural receptive fields (tuning curves), analogous to those in the other sensory modalities. The degree to which olfactory tuning is spatially organized across the OB, often referred to as chemotopy, is also not well-understood. To advance our understanding of these aspects of olfactory coding, we introduce an interpretable method of Shapley fields, as an olfactory analog of retinotopic receptive fields. Shapley fields are spatial distributions of chemical feature importance for the tuning of OB glomeruli. We used this tool to investigate chemotopy in the OB with diverse sets of chemical features using widefield epifluorescence recordings of the mouse dorsal OB in response to stimuli across a wide range of the chemical space. We found that Shapley fields reveal a weak chemotopic organization of the chemical feature sensitivity of dorsal OB glomeruli. This organization was consistent across animals and mostly agreed across very different chemical feature sets: (i) the expert-curated PubChem database features and (ii) features derived from a Graph Neural Network trained on human olfactory perceptual tasks. Moreover, we found that the principal components of the Shapley fields often corresponded to single commonly accepted chemical classification groups, that therefore could be "recovered" from the neural activity in the mouse OB. Our findings suggest that Shapley fields may serve as a chemical feature-agnostic method for investigating olfactory perception.

">Local cues enable classification of image patches as surfaces, object boundaries, or illumination changes</a></h4>

              
                To correctly parse the visual scene, one must detect edges and determine their underlying cause. Previous work has demonstrated that image-computable neural networks trained to differentiate natural shadow and occlusion edges exhibited sensitivity to boundary sharpness and texture differences. Although these models showed a strong correlation with human performance on an edge classification task, this previous study did not directly investigate whether humans actually make use of boundary sharpness and texture cues when classifying edges as shadows or occlusions. Here we directly investigated this using synthetic image patch stimuli formed by quilting together two different natural textures, allowing us to parametrically manipulate boundary sharpness, texture modulation, and luminance modulation. In a series of initial training experiments, observers were trained to correctly identify the cause of natural image patches taken from one of three categories (occlusion, shadow, uniform texture). In a subsequent series of test experiments, these same observers then classified 5 sets of synthetic boundary images defined by varying boundary sharpness, luminance modulation, and texture modulation cues using a set of novel parametric stimuli. These three visual cues exhibited strong interactions to determine categorization probabilities. For sharp edges, increasing luminance modulation made it less likely the patch would be classified as a texture and more likely it would be classified as an occlusion, whereas for blurred edges, increasing luminance modulation made it more likely the patch would be classified as a shadow. Boundary sharpness had a profound effect, so that in the presence of luminance modulation increasing sharpness decreased the likelihood of classification as a shadow and increased the likelihood of classification as an occlusion. Texture modulation had little effect on categorization, except in the case of a sharp boundary with zero luminance modulation. Results were consistent across all 5 stimulus sets, showing these effects are not due to the idiosyncrasies of the particular texture pairs. Human performance was found to be well explained by a simple linear multinomial logistic regression model defined on luminance, texture and sharpness cues, with slightly improved performance for a more complicated nonlinear model taking multiplicative parameter combinations into account. Our results demonstrate that human observers make use of the same cues as our previous machine learning models when detecting edges and determining their cause, helping us to better understand the neural and perceptual mechanisms of scene parsing.

                Dementia, a global public health challenge, is significantly influenced by lifestyle factors such as obesity. This study examines the impact of obesity and intervention approaches -physical exercise, a low-fat diet, or both- on brain structure in a triple-transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (3xTgAD) and wild-type mice fed a high-fat diet. Volumetric and deformation-based morphometry analyses showed significant neuroanatomical differences related to genotype and a high-fat diet, particularly affecting the hippocampus and cerebellum. Diet and exercise interventions partially mitigate these effects. Volume changes were correlated with behavioural data, producing a unique brain-behaviour signature tied to intervention-driven neuroanatomy improvements. This pattern was correlated with gene expression patterns, identifying modules of genes related to metabolic processes such as glucose homeostasis and fatty acid transportation. Overall, interventions promote changes that seem to counteract some of the effects of a high-fat diet, influencing biological processes that support brain health.

">Reduced harmonic complexity of brain parenchymal cardiovascular pulse waveforms in Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by specific neuropathologies, and is associated with arterial wall {beta}-amyloid accumulations, which lead to radiologically detectable amplitude increases and variable propagation speed of cardiovascular impulses in brain. In this study, we developed a fast frequency domain imaging method know as relative harmonic power of magnetic resonance encephalography (MREGRHP), aiming to investigate the configuration of the cardiovascular impulses independently of the mean magnetic resonance signal intensity and physiological impulse amplitude. In the initial analyses in healthy controls, we found that a wide 0.8 - 5Hz bandpass produced the most physiologically realistic cardiovascular waveforms. Whereas the data recorded in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from flip angle (FA) of 25{degrees} yielded up to 7-fold higher cardiac signal intensity as compared to FA of 5{degrees}, within the brain tissue recordings with FA of 5{degrees} were markedly more sensitive to cardiac waveform. We detected arterial impulses originating from major arteries and extending into the surrounding brain parenchyma, with simultaneous dampening of amplitude as a function of distance from source. Finally, we compared MREGRHP results in 34 AD patients (mean age: 60.7{+/-}4.7 years; 53% female) against 29 controls (mean age: 56.9{+/-}7.9 years; 66% female). We show that the harmonic power of cardiovascular brain pulses is significantly reduced in cortical frontoparietal areas of AD patients, indicating monotonous impulse patterns colocalizing with the previously reported areas of increased impulse propagation speed. In conclusion, the MREGRHP offers a fast Fourier transform (FFT)-based method to non-invasively quantify and locate human arterial blood vessel wall pathology.

">Atypical functional connectome in congenitally blind humans</a></h4>

              
                The cortex is organized along macroscale structural and functional gradients that extend from unimodal to transmodal association areas and from somatosensory to visual regions. It has not been tested whether this organization represents an intrinsic neuro-architecture immune to sensory experience or depends on sensory input. Here, we conducted connectome gradient analyses using resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging in congenitally blind individuals and sighted controls. In both groups, we observed a principal gradient (G1) extending from unimodal to transmodal, a second gradient (G2) spanning from somatosensory to visual, and a third gradient (G3) separating the frontoparietal network from the rest of the brain. Our findings indicate that the macroscale organization of the cortex develops largely independently of sensory experience. However, in blind individuals, the sensorimotor network was more distanced from the visual network (G2), while the visual network was more integrated with transmodal (G1) and frontoparietal (G3) networks. In blind individuals, the hierarchical organization within the early visual cortex was altered, the structure-function coupling in visual and temporal areas was reduced, and functional similarity between V1 center and periphery disappeared. These results suggest a critical role of sensory input in shaping the macroscale functional and structural organization of the brain.

">Human brain cell-type-specific aging clocks based on single-nuclei transcriptomics</a></h4>

              
                Aging is the primary risk factor for most neurodegenerative diseases, yet the cell-type-specific progression of brain aging remains poorly understood. Here, we developed human cell-type-specific transcriptomic aging clocks using high-quality single-nucleus RNA sequencing data from post mortem human prefrontal cortex tissue of 31 donors aged 18-94 years, encompassing 73,941 high-quality nuclei. We observed distinct transcriptomic changes across major cell types, including upregulation of inflammatory response genes in microglia from older samples. Aging clocks trained on each major cell type accurately predicted chronological age and remained robust in independent single-nucleus RNA-sequencing datasets, underscoring their broad applicability. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of cell-type-specific transcriptomic clocks to measure biological aging in the human brain and highlight potential mechanisms of selective vulnerability in neurodegenerative diseases. We anticipate these clocks will serve as a basis for further studies in other brain regions and more diverse populations, ultimately advancing our understanding of age-related neurodegenerative processes at the single-cell level.

Despite its application, the genetic underpinnings of FOCA alterations in Alzheimer’s Disease (AD)-related Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) remain largely unexplored. To elucidate these changes, we analyzed group FOCA differences in 41 MCI patients and 46 controls from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database. Integrating the Allen Human Brain Atlas, we performed transcriptome-neuroimaging spatial association analyses to pinpoint genes correlating with MCI-related FOCA changes. We observed heightened FOCA in the frontal–parietal system and diminished FOCA in the temporal lobe and medium cingulate gyrus among MCI patients. These FOCA alterations were spatially linked to the expression of 384 genes, which were enriched in crucial molecular functions, biological processes, and cellular components of the cerebral cortex, as well as related pathways. These genes were specifically expressed in brain tissue and corticothalamic neurons, particularly during late cortical development. They also connected to various behavioral domains. Furthermore, these genes could form a protein–protein interaction network, supported by 34 hub genes. Our results suggest that local spatiotemporal consistency of spontaneous brain activity in MCI may stem from the complex interplay of a broad spectrum of genes with diverse functional features.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Maple syrup urine disease is a rare metabolic disorder that results in neurodevelopmental injury despite dietary therapy. While structural neuroimaging has shown a characteristic pattern of edema and white matter injury, no functional neuroimaging studies of maple syrup urine disease have been performed. Using widefield optical imaging, we investigated resting-state functional connectivity in two brain-specific mouse models of maple syrup urine disease (an astrocyte-specific knockout and a whole-brain knockout). At 8 weeks, mouse functional neuroimaging was performed using a custom-built widefield optical imaging system. Imaging was performed before and after initiation of a high-protein diet for 1 week to mimic metabolic crisis, which we hypothesized would result in decreased functional connectivity strength. Data were analyzed using seed-based functional connectivity and cluster-based inference. Astrocyte-specific knockout mice developed increased contralateral functional connectivity within the posteromedial somatosensory cortex after diet initiation. Whole-brain knockout mice had a similar pattern present at baseline, which persisted after diet initiation. Thus, contrary to expectations, maple syrup urine disease resulted in increased functional connectivity strength, especially after diet initiation. While the underlying etiology of these changes is unclear, these results demonstrate that inborn errors of metabolism result in changes to functional connectivity networks. Further research may demonstrate functional neuroimaging biomarkers that could be translated to clinical care.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>A substantial body of literature has focused on neural signals evoked by errors emerging during the execution of goal-directed actions. It is still unclear how motor cortex activity during movement execution relates to feedback error processing. To investigate this, we recorded primary motor cortex (M1) single-unit activity in rats during a grasping task. About half of the recorded neurons showed modulation of their firing activity that did not depend on success or failure, which we termed outcome-independent neurons. Other neurons showed a difference in their discharge profile when comparing successful and unsuccessful trials, which we called outcome-dependent neurons. Among both outcome-dependent and -independent neurons, we further distinguished neurons presenting their maximum firing rate in specific epochs as defined by the task. We compared the cortical distribution of outcome-independent and outcome-dependent neurons to cortical maps of complex forelimb movements evoked by intracortical microstimulation in additional animals. The majority of outcome-independent neurons was localized within the limb extension and paw open-closure movement representations. Outcome-dependent neurons were not clearly associated to particular motor representations. Cortical arrangement of neurons, both outcome-independent and outcome-dependent, and their correlation with distinct movement representations, can serve as indicator for anticipating potential outcomes before the conclusion of an action.</span>

Geometric eigenmode decomposition of advanced concentrative absorption meditation and non-meditative control task fMRI data revealed elevated global brain state power and energy patterns of specific advanced concentrative absorption meditation states compared to controls, with mid-frequency spectrum brain state power and energy following a non-random, cubic trajectory through the advanced concentrative absorption meditation sequence.

This study unites precise methodological design, a novel fMRI decomposition framework, and rigorous phenomenology to provide valuable insights into the distributed neural signatures of highly refined conscious states.

	<p>Background: In normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) there is blood&amp;amp;ndash;brain barrier (BBB) disruption, which should increase the CSF formation rate (CSFfr) and, therefore, also increase the intracranial pressure (ICP). However, the ICP is normal in NPH. A lumped parameter study was performed to look at the interrelation between the ICP, cerebral blood flow (CBF), and the degree of BBB disruption in NPH. The model suggested that the CSFfr could be reduced in this condition if the BBB disruption was moderated by a reduction in the capillary transmural pressure (TMP) secondary to arteriolar constriction and a reduced CBF. In early Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD), there is BBB disruption, reduced ICP, and global ischemia. This raises the possibility that the same physiology may occur in AD as occurs in NPH. Methods: A lumped parameter model previously used to describe the hydrodynamics of NPH was modified to investigate the effects of changes in CSF pressure and blood flow in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD. Results: The model indicates that the average capillary TMP is normal in MCI, but decreases as AD progresses. Removing CSF in AD patients during a tap test initially increases the capillary TMP. The brain in AD responds to a tap test by increasing its level of ischemia, and this reduces the capillary TMP. Conclusions: A hypothesis is put forward that the BBB disruption in AD is partially mitigated by the brain making itself ischemic. Modelling gives support to this hypothesis. The model can suggest a cause for the development of ischemic neuronal loss and amyloid accumulation secondary to glymphatic flow disruption as AD progresses.</p>

	<p>The search for biological markers that can be reliably linked to aggression and antisocial behavior has been central to the work of biological criminology. One such marker, uric acid, has long been suspected to play a causative role in promoting anger, irritability, aggression, and violence. Here, in this perspective article, we revisit some of the historical interest in uric acid as a compound relevant to brain and behavior, and reflect these early accounts off emergent scientific research. Advances in brain sciences, including neuropsychiatry and neuromicrobiology, have allowed for a more sophisticated understanding of potential mechanistic pathways linking uric acid with cognition and behavior. The updated science suggests that some of the early ideas surrounding uric acid and criminology had credibility. The available research strongly suggests that uric acid, as a potential biomarker of risk, is worthy of further research and close scrutiny. Informed by emergent gut&amp;amp;ndash;brain&amp;amp;ndash;microbiome research, we argue that certain aspects of early-to-mid-20th-century biological criminology were prematurely abandoned. From a legalome perspective, further advances surrounding uric acid and other gut&amp;amp;ndash;brain biomarkers can aid in shaping more humane, scientifically grounded policies that recognize the interplay between biology and environment.</p>

                <p><i>GBA1</i> variants and decreased glucocerebrosidase activity are implicated in Parkinson's disease (PD). We investigated the hypothesis that increased levels of glucosylceramide (GlcCer), a main substrate of glucocerebrosidase, are involved in PD pathogenesis. Using multiple genetic methods, we show that ATPase phospholipid transporting 10D (<i>ATP10D</i>), not <i>GBA1</i>, is the main regulator of plasma GlcCer levels, yet it is not involved in PD pathogenesis. Plasma GlcCer levels were associated with PD, but not in a causative manner, and are not predictive of disease status. These results argue against targeting GlcCer in <i>GBA1</i>-PD, and underscore the need to explore alternative mechanisms and biomarkers for PD. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                Berry et al. report a RAS-independent role of the NF1 tumor suppressor in regulating the immune checkpoint protein PD-L1. Their results may explain, in part, the higher response rates of patients with NF1 mutant melanoma to anti-PD-1 immunotherapies. Their work supports the examination of anti-PD-1 therapies in other NF1 mutant cancers.

                Using a model for breast cancer, Pereira et al. report that the induction of metastatic dormancy in the lungs requires CD8+ T cells aided by CD4+ T cells, with IFNγ as a key mediator. Awakening depends on inflammatory signals, notably IL-17A, while maintenance of dormancy occurs independently of lymphocyte surveillance.

	<p>Background/Objectives: The aim of this pilot study is to qualitatively describe the use of life history questionnaires in an acute neurorehabilitation setting to define individualised goals of care for patients with clinical cognitive motor dissociation and to determine to what extent the information they contain influences the care and management provided by the team. Methods: Using the patient records of our sample, all individualised goals of care were summarised, which were subsequently used to assess whether life history questionnaires had supplied sufficient information to define various individualised goals of care. We then conducted semi-structured interviews with the involved healthcare professionals to gain insights on how these questionnaires were used. Results: Approximately one-third of all individualised goals of care belonging to the &amp;amp;ldquo;Activities and Participation&amp;amp;rdquo; ICF category were defined through life history questionnaires. The semi-structured interviews highlighted the impact of these questionnaires in three main aspects: creating a therapeutic alliance with the patient, facilitating multidisciplinary cohesion, and nurturing a sense of empathy amongst the healthcare professionals. Conclusions: Life history questionnaires are an important contribution to individualised goals of care and may improve the relationship with the patient and the therapeutic setting for all healthcare professionals involved.</p>

	<p>Objectives: Accurate survival prediction for brain metastasis patients undergoing stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) is crucial for personalized treatment planning and improving patient outcomes. This study aimed to develop a machine learning model to estimate survival times, providing clinicians with a reliable tool for making informed decisions based on individual patient characteristics. The goal was to compare the performance of multiple algorithms and identify the most effective model for clinical use. Methods: We applied a hybrid machine learning approach to predict survival in brain metastasis patients treated with SRT, utilizing real-world data. Four algorithms&amp;amp;mdash;XGBoost, CatBoost, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting&amp;amp;mdash;were compared within a meta-model framework to identify the most accurate for survival prediction. Model performance was evaluated using metrics such as MSE, MAE, MAPE, and C index. Results: XGBoost outperformed all other algorithms, achieving an MSE of 0.14%, MAE of 0.10%, and MAPE of 0.093%, with a high C-index of 100%. CatBoost showed reasonable performance, while Gradient Boosting had higher error rates (MSE of 6.99%, MAE of 21.04%, MAPE of 19.29%). Random Forest performed the weakest, with the highest MSE (14.39%), MAE (30.23%), and MAPE (33.58%). Conclusion: Inputting relevant clinical variables into the model enables clinicians to obtain highly accurate survival predictions for patients with brain metastasis. This enhances clinical decision making by providing a more precise understanding of expected outcomes. The XGBoost-based hybrid model showed exceptional accuracy in predicting survival for brain metastasis patients after SRT, offering valuable support for clinical decision making. Integrating machine learning into clinical practice can improve treatment planning and personalize care for these patients.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Sleep plays a pivotal role in memory consolidation, especially for declarative memory. While extensive research has examined sleep&amp;amp;rsquo;s impact on simple declarative materials, such as word lists, its effect on more complex narrative passages remains less studied. This study aimed to investigate the effect of sleep on prose memory consolidation. Methods: In a within-subjects design, 10 healthy university students (6 F, 4 M; age range = 19&amp;amp;ndash;29; generation ratio = 0.8) learned prose passages and were tested both immediately and after a retention interval spent either asleep or awake. Results: The analyses revealed a positive effect of sleep, with the participants recalling more textual details in the Sleep condition (R2 conditional = 0.269). Correlational analyses further supported this outcome, showing a positive association between specific sleep features (i.e., sleep cycles) and prose memory performance (r2 = 0.56). Conclusions: Our finding suggests that sleep facilitates the consolidation of complex declarative memory traces, counteracting the decay that occurs during wakefulness; correlational analyses further support this outcome. Overall, these findings underscore the importance of sleep for everyday learning and comprehension, particularly when processing complex textual information.</p>

                Abstract Mycotic thoracic aortic aneurysms are rare but life-threatening, and are associated with high morbidity and mortality after operative repair. They frequently present at a late stage with sepsis and rupture; therefore, emergency management is paramount. Repair options, particularly in the thoracic aorta, are complex and include open, endovascular, and hybrid surgical approaches. We present the case of a 72-year-old woman with a ruptured mycotic thoracic aortic aneurysm who underwent successful endovascular repair with thoracic stent graft placement and left subclavian artery embolization. This case highlights the successful use of endovascular repair for the management of a ruptured mycotic thoracic aortic aneurysm in zone 2, emphasizing the importance of early diagnosis, timely intervention, and potential benefits of minimally invasive repair in these rare complex cases.

                In 2024 the Cross-Strait Conflict between Taipei and Beijing turned 75 years old. Using an eclectic conflict analysis framework, this paper lays out the evolution of the conflict, its main actors, and traces the fundamental shift of its core-issue from “who is China” to “what is Taiwan.” Realist concepts of international relations are used to argue that it is important to imagine political scenarios not ending in warfare to escape the escalatory spiral and a self-fulfilling prophecy. The rhetoric of warfare, distorted views on history, and Great Power competition are destabilizing factors that push toward an escalation that will result in warfare if they are not counterbalanced by refocusing the relationship on common ground. A peaceful way forward, the paper argues, does not need to solve the underlying conflict between the PRC and the ROC, it only needs to mitigate their red lines long enough for new reconciliation strategies to emerge that re-channel the core-issue into a constructive conflict, which, over time, can lead to permanent reconciliation.

                Background Predicting the number and distribution of Olympic medals in the future has become a hot topic, but predicting the number of Olympic medals is not easy and requires comprehensive consideration of multiple factors such as historical data, athlete performance, and host country effects. Method This article uses the GA-BP algorithm model, combined with genetic algorithm (GA) and backpropagation neural network (BPNN), to optimize the weights and bias parameters of the BP neural network using the global search capability of genetic algorithm, thereby improving training efficiency and prediction performance. By estimating the number of Olympic gold medals and total medals, verifying the accuracy of the model, and predicting the medal table for the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics. Meanwhile, based on the synthetic control model, Estonia and China were selected as research subjects to construct a virtual control group and two experimental groups for analysis. Result The experimental results showed that Estonia and China won more medals with a head coach than without one. In 1992, Estonia won 1 gold medal and 2 bronze medals under the guidance of excellent coaches, indicating the significant role of head coaches in improving athletes’ performance. Conclusion This study provides valuable insights for the decision-making of the Olympic Committee, revealing key factors in medal distribution, optimizing the allocation of national strategic resources, and predicting the performance of countries at future Olympic Games.

                <p>by Jung M. Park, Li-Huei Tsai</p>

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder affecting millions worldwide. There is no known cure for AD, highlighting an urgent need for new, innovative treatments. Recent studies have shed light on a promising, noninvasive approach using sensory stimulation as a potential therapy for AD. Exposing patients to light and sound pulses at a frequency of 40 hertz induces brain rhythms in the gamma frequency range that are important for healthy brain activity. Using this treatment in animal models, we are now beginning to understand the molecular, cellular, and circuit-level changes that underlie improvements in disease pathology, cognition, and behavior. A mechanistic understanding of the basic biology that underlies the 40-hertz treatment will inform ongoing clinical trials that offer a promising avenue of treatment without the side effects and high costs typically associated with pharmacological interventions. Concurrent advancements in neurotechnology that can also noninvasively stimulate healthy brain rhythms are illuminating new possibilities for alternative therapies. Altogether, these noninvasive approaches could herald a new era in treating AD, making them a beacon of hope for patients, families, and caregivers facing the challenges of this debilitating condition.

Supergenes can evolve when recombination-suppressing mechanisms like inversions promote co-inheritance of alleles at two or more polymorphic loci that affect a complex trait. Theory shows that such genetic architectures can be favoured under balancing selection or local adaptation in the face of gene flow, but they can also bring costs associated with reduced opportunities for recombination. These costs may in turn be offset by rare ‘gene flux’ between inverted and ancestral haplotypes, with a range of possible outcomes. We aimed to shed light on these processes by investigating the BC supergene, a large genomic region comprising multiple rearrangements associated with three distinct wing colour morphs in <i>Danaus chrysippus</i>, a butterfly known as the African monarch, African queen and plain tiger. Using whole-genome resequencing data from 174 individuals, we first confirm the effects of BC on wing colour pattern: background melanism is associated with SNPs in the promoter region of <i>yellow</i>, within an inverted subregion of the supergene, while forewing tip pattern is most likely associated with copy-number variation in a separate subregion of the supergene. We then show that haplotype diversity within the supergene is surprisingly extensive: there are at least six divergent haplotype groups that experience suppressed recombination with respect to each other. Despite high divergence between these haplotype groups, we identify an unexpectedly large number of natural recombinant haplotypes. Several of the inferred crossovers occurred between adjacent inversion ‘modules’, while others occurred within inversions. Furthermore, we show that new haplotype groups have arisen through recombination between two pre-existing ones. Specifically, an allele for dark colouration in the promoter of <i>yellow</i> has recombined into distinct haplotype backgrounds on at least two separate occasions. Overall, our findings paint a picture of dynamic evolution of supergene haplotypes, fuelled by incomplete recombination suppression.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-244/v1?src=rss">Scaling up community participation in watershed management for food security improvement: the case of Qarsa woreda , East Haraghe zone, Ethiopia [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background The watershed management approach has been well-acknowledged as an effective strategy for improving food security. However, the significance of community engagement, which is vital for the success of this strategy, has not been adequately acknowledged. The study examined the level of community involvement and the factors influencing their participation in watershed management. Methods A household survey of 337 household heads, focus group discussions, and key informant interviews were used to collect the data. Descriptive statistics, a people participation index, and a binary regression model were used for data analysis. Result The results of the people participation index indicated a moderate level of farmers’ participation in the planning, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation phases, with no significant differences observed between the three micro watersheds. However, there were variations in the indicator metrics within and across the micro watersheds, with participants from the Sustainable Land Management Program II (SLMPII), micro watershed showing significant differences compared to those from the Productive Safety Net Public work (PSNP_PW) and free mass mobilization at levels of 0.01 and 0.05, respectively. The results of binary logistic regression indicated that the overall level of farmer participation was significantly affected by the frequency of extension contact, livestock ownership, education level, family size, and group membership. Conclusions The study highlights the need to consider variability in indicator measurements for effective watershed management to improve food security. It stresses the importance of building farmers’ capacity and fostering ownership, rather than simply providing them with explícitas instructions to follow.
