In 2006, Ma et al. presented an elegant theory for how populations of neurons might represent uncertainty to perform Bayesian inference. Critically, according to this theory, neural variability is no longer a nuisance, but rather a vital part of how the brain encodes probability distributions and performs computations with them.

Large-scale efforts are underway to map the neuronal connectomes of various animal species. In 1986 White et al. reported the first complete reconstruction of the nervous system connectome of an animal. Largely through manual reconstruction of serial electron micrographs, the authors characterized the morphology of each of the 302 neurons of the adult nematode C. elegans, and mapped the chemical and electrical synapses that connect them. This wiring diagram has profoundly influenced behavioral neurobiology and network science, and it continues to offer a guide for the impact of connectomics on neurobiology.

Increasing evidence indicates that native mu and delta opioid receptors can associate to form heteromers in discrete brain neuronal circuits. However, little is known about their signaling and trafficking. Using double fluorescent knock-in mice, we investigated the impact of neuronal co-expression on the internalization profile of mu and delta opioid receptors in primary hippocampal cultures and in vivo. We established ligand selective mu-delta co-internalization upon activation by exogenous ligands and provide evidence for mu-delta co-internalization by the endogenous opioid peptide met-enkephalin, but not beta-endorphin. Co-internalization was driven by the delta opioid receptor, required an active conformation of both receptors and led to sorting to the lysosomal compartment. This alteration in the mu opioid receptor intracellular fate was accompanied by sustained ERK1/2 phosphorylation. In addition, increased mu-delta neuronal co-localization in the rostral ventromedial medulla in a chronic neuropathic state suggests that mu-delta heteromers are involved in the regulation of nociceptive transmission.

Loss of glutamatergic synapses is thought to be a key cellular pathology associated with neuropsychiatric disorders including schizophrenia (SCZ) and major depressive disorder (MDD). Genetic and cellular studies SCZ and MDD using in vivo and in vitro systems have further supported a key role for dysfunction of excitatory synapses in the pathophysiology of these disorders. Recent clinical studies have demonstrated that the estrogen, 17{beta}-estradiol can ameliorate many of the symptoms experienced by patients. Yet, to date, our understanding of how these beneficial effects are exerted by 17{beta}-estradiol is limited. In this study, we have tested the hypothesis that 17{beta}-estradiol can restore excitatory synapses number in a cellular model that recapitulates the loss of synapses associated with SCZ and MDD. Specifically, we show that in cortical neurons with reduced dendritic spine density, produced by either ectopically expressing wildtype or mutant Disrupted in Schizophrenia (DISC1), that acute treatment with 17{beta}-estradiol increased spine density to control levels. Furthermore, 17{beta}-estradiol causes a redistribution of both exogenous and endogenous DISC1, a mechanism whereby DISC1's inhibitory effects on synapse formation is thought to occur. In addition, we also observe an increased targeting of PSD-95 and kalriin-7, which form a signalsome with DISC1, following 17{beta}-estradiol treatment. Taken together, out data indicates that estrogens can restore lost excitatory synapses caused by altered DISC1 expression, potentially through the bi-directional trafficking of DISC1 and its interacting partners. These data highlight the possibility that estrogens exert their beneficial effects in SCZ and MDD, in part by modulating excitatory synaptic number.

Long-term memory (LTM) formation requires learning-induced protein synthesis in specific neurons and synapses within a neural circuit. Precisely how neuronal activity allocates new proteins to specific synaptic ensembles, however, remains unknown. We developed a deep-tissue super-resolution imaging tool suitable for single-molecule localization in intact adult Drosophila brain, and focused on the axonal protein allocation in mushroom body (MB), a central neuronal structure involved in olfactory memory formation. We found that insufficient training suppresses LTM formation by inducing the synthesis of vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT) proteins within a dorsal paired medial (DPM) neuron, which innervates all axonal lobes of the MB. Surprisingly, using our localization microscopy, we found that these learning-induced proteins are distributed only in a subset of DPM axons in specific sectors along the MB lobes. This neural architecture suggest that sector-specific modulation of neuronal activity from MB neurons gates consolidation of early transient memory into LTM.

The mouse brain contains about 100 million neurons interconnected in a vast array of neural circuits. The identities and functions of individual neuronal components of most circuits are undefined. Here we describe a method, termed "Connect-seq", which combines retrograde viral tracing and single cell transcriptomics to uncover the molecular identities of upstream neurons in a specific circuit and the signaling molecules they use to communicate. Connect-seq can generate a molecular map that can be superimposed on a neuroanatomical map to permit molecular and genetic interrogation of how the neuronal components of a circuit control its function. Application of this method to hypothalamic neurons controlling physiological responses to fear and stress reveal subsets of upstream neurons that express diverse constellations of signaling molecules and can be distinguished by their anatomical locations.

<p>by Ioannis Kalfas, Kasper Vinken, Rufin Vogels</p>

Recent studies suggest that deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models show higher representational similarity, compared to any other existing object recognition models, with macaque inferior temporal (IT) cortical responses, human ventral stream fMRI activations and human object recognition. These studies employed natural images of objects. A long research tradition employed abstract shapes to probe the selectivity of IT neurons. If CNN models provide a realistic model of IT responses, then they should capture the IT selectivity for such shapes. Here, we compare the activations of CNN units to a stimulus set of 2D regular and irregular shapes with the response selectivity of macaque IT neurons and with human similarity judgements. The shape set consisted of regular shapes that differed in nonaccidental properties, and irregular, asymmetrical shapes with curved or straight boundaries. We found that deep CNNs (Alexnet, VGG-16 and VGG-19) that were trained to classify natural images show response modulations to these shapes that were similar to those of IT neurons. Untrained CNNs with the same architecture than trained CNNs, but with random weights, demonstrated a poorer similarity than CNNs trained in classification. The difference between the trained and untrained CNNs emerged at the deep convolutional layers, where the similarity between the shape-related response modulations of IT neurons and the trained CNNs was high. Unlike IT neurons, human similarity judgements of the same shapes correlated best with the last layers of the trained CNNs. In particular, these deepest layers showed an enhanced sensitivity for straight versus curved irregular shapes, similar to that shown in human shape judgments. In conclusion, the representations of abstract shape similarity are highly comparable between macaque IT neurons and deep convolutional layers of CNNs that were trained to classify natural images, while human shape similarity judgments correlate better with the deepest layers.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Y2OMH4zdfKQ" width="1" />

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/eW8COxnrm9o/article">Structural and dynamic basis of substrate permissiveness in hydroxycinnamoyltransferase (HCT)</a></h4>

<p>by Ying-Chih Chiang, Olesya Levsh, Chun Kei Lam, Jing-Ke Weng, Yi Wang</p>

Substrate permissiveness has long been regarded as the raw materials for the evolution of new enzymatic functions. In land plants, hydroxycinnamoyltransferase (HCT) is an essential enzyme of the phenylpropanoid metabolism. Although essential enzymes are normally associated with high substrate specificity, HCT can utilize a variety of non-native substrates. To examine the structural and dynamic basis of substrate permissiveness in this enzyme, we report the crystal structure of HCT from Selaginella moellendorffii and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations performed on five orthologous HCTs from several major lineages of land plants. Through altogether 17-<i>μ</i>s MD simulations, we demonstrate the prevalent swing motion of an arginine handle on a submicrosecond timescale across all five HCTs, which plays a key role in native substrate recognition by these intrinsically promiscuous enzymes. Our simulations further reveal how a non-native substrate of HCT engages a binding site different from that of the native substrate and diffuses to reach the catalytic center and its co-substrate. By numerically solving the Smoluchowski equation, we show that the presence of such an alternative binding site, even when it is distant from the catalytic center, always increases the reaction rate of a given substrate. However, this increase is only significant for enzyme-substrate reactions heavily influenced by diffusion. In these cases, binding non-native substrates ‘off-center’ provides an effective rationale to develop substrate permissiveness while maintaining the native functions of promiscuous enzymes.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/eW8COxnrm9o" width="1" />

<p>Little is known about how 17β-estradiol (E<sub>2</sub>) mediates memory formation in males. In ovariectomized (OVX) mice, bilateral dorsal hippocampal (DH) infusion of E<sub>2</sub> enhances memory consolidation in object recognition (OR) and object placement (OP) tasks in a manner dependent on activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and Akt signaling. Here, bilateral DH E<sub>2</sub> infusion enhanced memory consolidation in both tasks among OVX female, gonadally-intact male, and castrated male mice, suggesting comparable facilitation of memory consolidation in both sexes, independent of testicular hormones in males. Contrary to previous reports in OVX mice, E<sub>2</sub> did not increase DH ERK or Akt phosphorylation in males, nor did the ERK inhibitor U0126 [1,4-diamino-2,3-dicyano-1,4-bis (o-aminophenylmercapto) butadiene] prevent E<sub>2</sub> from enhancing memory consolidation among intact and castrated males. These data suggest that ERK activation is not necessary for E<sub>2</sub> to enhance memory consolidation in males, and compared with previous reports in females, reveal novel sex differences in the cell-signaling pathways through which E<sub>2</sub> facilitates memory consolidation. To explore the mechanisms underlying E<sub>2</sub>-induced memory enhancements in males, phosphorylation of the transcription factor cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) in the DH was assessed. E<sub>2</sub> increased phospho-CREB levels in both sexes, yet U0126 did not block these increases in castrated or intact males, indicating that E<sub>2</sub> regulates CREB phosphorylation in males via an ERK-independent mechanism. Collectively, these findings suggest that the beneficial effects of hippocampal E<sub>2</sub> on memory consolidation in males and females are mediated by different molecular mechanisms, which has important implications for the development of treatments to reduce memory dysfunction in men and women.</p>

Abstract
<p>The perception of gender and age of unfamiliar faces is reported to vary idiosyncratically across retinal locations such that, for example, the same androgynous face may appear to be male at one location but female at another. Here, we test spatial heterogeneity for the recognition of the <i>identity</i> of personally familiar faces in human participants. We found idiosyncratic biases that were stable within participants and that varied more across locations for low as compared to high familiar faces. These data suggest that like face gender and age, face identity is processed, in part, by independent populations of neurons monitoring restricted spatial regions and that the recognition responses vary for the same face across these different locations. Moreover, repeated and varied social interactions appear to lead to adjustments of these independent face recognition neurons so that the same familiar face is eventually more likely to elicit the same recognition response across widely separated visual field locations. We provide a mechanistic account of this reduced retinotopic bias based on computational simulations.</p>

<p>This paper tackles the problem of learning brain-visual representations for
understanding and neural processes behind human visual perception, with a view
towards replicating these processes into machines. The core idea is to learn
plausible representations through the combined use of human neural activity
evoked by natural images as a supervision mechanism for deep learning models.
To accomplish this, we propose a multimodal approach that uses two different
deep encoders, one for images and one for EEGs, trained in a siamese
configuration for learning a joint manifold that maximizes a compatibility
measure between visual features and brain representation. The learned manifold
is then used to perform image classification and saliency detection as well as
to shed light on the possible representations generated by the human brain when
perceiving the visual world. Performance analysis shows that neural signals can
be used to effectively supervise the training of deep learning models, as
demonstrated by the achieved performance in both image classification and
saliency detection. Furthermore, the learned brain-visual manifold is
consistent with cognitive neuroscience literature about visual perception and,
most importantly, highlights new associations between brain areas, image
patches and computational kernels. In particular, we are able to approximate
brain responses to visual stimuli by training an artificial model with image
features correlated to neural activity.

<p>Dementia is a syndrome characterised by the decline of different cognitive
abilities. Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the most common dementia affecting
cognitive domains such as memory and learning, perceptual-motion or executive
function. High rate of deaths and high cost for detection, treatments and
patient's care count amongst its consequences. Early detection of AD is
considered of high importance for improving the quality of life of patients and
their families. The aim of this thesis is to introduce novel non-invasive early
diagnosis methods in order to speed the diagnosis, reduce the associated costs
and make them widely accessible. Novel AD's screening tests based on virtual
environments using new immersive technologies combined with advanced Human
Computer Interaction (HCI) systems are introduced. Four tests demonstrate the
wide range of screening mechanisms based on cognitive domain impairments that
can be designed using virtual environments. The use of emotion recognition to
analyse AD symptoms has been also proposed. A novel multimodal dataset was
specifically created to remark the autobiographical memory deficits of AD
patients. Data from this dataset is used to introduce novel descriptors for
Electroencephalogram (EEG) and facial images data. EEG features are based on
quaternions in order to keep the correlation information between sensors,
whereas, for facial expression recognition, a preprocessing method for motion
magnification and descriptors based on origami crease pattern algorithm are
proposed to enhance facial micro-expressions. These features have been proved
on classifiers such as SVM and Adaboost for the classification of reactions to
autobiographical stimuli such as long and short term memories.

<p>Transcranial magnetic stimulation combined with electroencephalography
(TMS-EEG) is widely used to study the reactivity and connectivity of brain
regions for clinical or research purposes. The electromagnetic pulse of the TMS
device generates at the instant of administration an artifact of large
amplitude and a duration up to tens of milliseconds that overlaps with brain
activity. Methods for TMS artifact correction have been developed to remove the
artifact and recover the underlying, immediate response of the cerebral cortex
to the magnetic stimulus. In this study, three such algorithms are evaluated.
Since there is no ground truth for the masked brain activity, pilot data formed
from the superposition of the isolated TMS artifact on the EEG brain activity
are used to evaluate the performance of the algorithms. Different scenarios of
TMS-EEG experiments are considered for the evaluation: TMS at resting state,
TMS inducing epileptiform discharges and TMS administered during epileptiform
discharges. We show that a proposed gap filling method is able to reproduce
qualitative characteristics and in many cases closely resemble the hidden EEG
signal. Finally, shortcomings of the TMS correction algorithms as well as the
pilot data approach are discussed.

<p>Activation of most primary sensory neurons results in transduction currents
that are carried by cations. One notable exception is the vertebrate olfactory
receptor neuron (ORN), where the transduction current is carried largely by the
anion $Cl^-$. However, it remains unclear why ORNs use an anionic current for
signal amplification. We have sought to provide clarification on this topic by
studying the so far neglected dynamics of $Na^+$, $Ca^{2+}$, $K^+$ and $Cl^-$
in the small space of olfactory cilia during an odorant response. Using
computational modeling and simulations we compared the outcomes of signal
amplification based on either $Cl^-$ or $Na^+$ currents. We found that
amplification produced by $Na^+$ influx instead of a $Cl^-$ efflux is
problematic due to several reasons: First, the $Na^+$ current amplitude varies
greatly depending on mucosal ion concentration changes. Second, a $Na^+$
current leads to a large increase in the ciliary $Na^+$ concentration during an
odorant response. This increase inhibits and even reverses $Ca^{2+}$ clearance
by $Na^+/Ca^{2+}/K^+$ exchange, which is essential for response termination.
Finally, a $Na^+$ current increases the ciliary osmotic pressure, which could
cause swelling to damage the cilia. By contrast, a transduction pathway based
on $Cl^-$ efflux circumvents these problems and renders the odorant response
robust and reliable.

<p>An extensive body of empirical research has revealed remarkable regularities
in the acquisition, organization, deployment, and neural representation of
human semantic knowledge, thereby raising a fundamental conceptual question:
what are the theoretical principles governing the ability of neural networks to
acquire, organize, and deploy abstract knowledge by integrating across many
individual experiences? We address this question by mathematically analyzing
the nonlinear dynamics of learning in deep linear networks. We find exact
solutions to this learning dynamics that yield a conceptual explanation for the
prevalence of many disparate phenomena in semantic cognition, including the
hierarchical differentiation of concepts through rapid developmental
transitions, the ubiquity of semantic illusions between such transitions, the
emergence of item typicality and category coherence as factors controlling the
speed of semantic processing, changing patterns of inductive projection over
development, and the conservation of semantic similarity in neural
representations across species. Thus, surprisingly, our simple neural model
qualitatively recapitulates many diverse regularities underlying semantic
development, while providing analytic insight into how the statistical
structure of an environment can interact with nonlinear deep learning dynamics
to give rise to these regularities.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/37344">Chromatin accessibility dynamics across <i>C. elegans</i> development and ageing</a></h4>

An essential step for understanding the transcriptional circuits that control development and physiology is the global identification and characterization of regulatory elements. Here we present the first map of regulatory elements across the development and ageing of an animal, identifying 42,245 elements accessible in at least one <i>C. elegans</i> stage. Based on nuclear transcription profiles, we define 15,714 protein-coding promoters and 19,231 putative enhancers, and find that both types of element can drive orientation-independent transcription. Additionally, more than 1000 promoters produce transcripts antisense to protein coding genes, suggesting involvement in a widespread regulatory mechanism. We find that the accessibility of most elements changes during development and/or ageing and that patterns of accessibility change are linked to specific developmental or physiological processes. The map and characterization of regulatory elements across <i>C. elegans</i> life provides a platform for understanding how transcription controls development and ageing.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/36493">Reduced auditory cortical adaptation in autism spectrum disorder</a></h4>

Adaptation is a fundamental property of cortical neurons and has been suggested to be altered in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We used fMRI to measure adaptation induced by repeated audio-visual stimulation in early sensory cortical areas in individuals with ASD and neurotypical (NT) controls. The initial transient responses were equivalent between groups in both visual and auditory cortices and when stimulation occurred with fixed-interval and randomized-interval timing. However, in auditory but not visual cortex, the post-transient sustained response was greater in individuals with ASD than NT controls in the fixed-interval timing condition, reflecting reduced adaptation. Further, individual differences in the sustained response in auditory cortex correlated with ASD symptom severity. These findings are consistent with hypotheses that ASD is associated with increased neural responsiveness but that responsiveness differences only manifest after repeated stimulation, are specific to the temporal pattern of stimulation, and are confined to specific cortical regions.

One manifestation of individualization is a progressively differential response of individuals to the non-shared components of the same environment. Individualization has practical implications in the clinical setting, where subtle differences between patients are often decisive for the success of an intervention, yet there has been no suitable animal model to study its underlying biological mechanisms. Here we show that enriched environment (ENR) can serve as a model of brain individualization. We kept 40 isogenic female C57BL/6JRj mice for 3 months in ENR and compared these mice to an equally sized group of standard-housed control animals, looking at the effects on a wide range of phenotypes in terms of both means and variances. Although ENR influenced multiple parameters and restructured correlation patterns between them, it only increased differences among individuals in traits related to brain and behavior (adult hippocampal neurogenesis, motor cortex thickness, open field and object exploration), in agreement with the hypothesis of a specific activity-dependent development of brain individuality.

Ginkgolide B (GB) and picrotoxin (PTX) are antagonists of the major inhibitory receptors of the central nervous system: GABA and glycine receptors (GlyRs). GlyRs contain one or more of the four alpha subunit isoforms of which 1 and 2 have been extensively studied. This report compares GB and PTX block of 3 GlyRs expressed in HEK 293 cells, using whole-cell patch clamp techniques. In CNS, 3 exists as a heteropentamer in conjunction with beta subunits in a 2:3{beta} ratio. Thus, the nature of block was also tested in 3{beta} heteromeric glycine receptors. GB and PTX blocked 3 GlyRs both in the presence (liganded state) and absence of glycine (unliganded state). This property is unique to 3 subunits; 1 and 2 subunits are only blocked in the liganded state. The GB block of 3 GlyRs is voltage-dependent (more effective when the cell is depolarized) and non-competitive, while the PTX block is competitive and not voltage-dependent. The heteromeric and homomeric 3 GlyRs recovered significantly faster from unliganded GB block compared to liganded GB block, but no such distinction was found for PTX block suggesting more than one binding site for GB. This study sheds light on features of the 3 GlyR that distinguish it from the more widely studied 1 and 2 subunits. Understanding these properties can help decipher the physiological functioning of GlyRs in the CNS and may permit development of subunit specific drugs.

Our brain processes information through the coordinated efforts of billions of individual neurons, each of which transforms a small part of the overall information stream. Central to this is how neurons integrate and transform complex patterns of synaptic inputs. The neuronal membrane impedance determines the change in membrane potential in response to input currents, and therefore sets the gain and timing for synaptic integration. Using single and dual dendritic recordings in vivo, pharmacology, and computational modeling, we characterized the role of two active conductances gH and gM, meditated respectively by hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide gated (HCN) channels and by muscarine sensitive M-channels, in shaping the membrane impedance of a collision detection neuron in female Schistocerca americana grasshoppers. The neuron is known by its acronym LGMD, which stands for lobula giant movement detector. In contrast to other neurons where these conductances have been studied, we found that gH and gM promote broadband, synchronous integration over the LGMD's functional range of membrane potentials and input frequencies. Additionally, we found that the branching morphology of the LGMD helped increase both the gain and synchrony associated with the neuron's membrane impedance. The same result held for a wide range of dendritic morphologies, including those of mammalian neocortical pyramidal neurons and cerebellar Purkinje cells. Thus, these findings further our understanding of the integration properties of individual neurons by showing the unexpected role played by two widespread active conductances and by dendritic morphology in shaping synaptic integration.

Background: The skew in distribution of handedness is a uniquely human trait, and has fascinated researchers for centuries. The heritability of handedness is estimated at 25%, but defining genetic variants contributing to this trait has so far proved elusive. Methods: We performed GWAS of self-reported handedness in UK Biobank, a prospective cohort study of ~500,000 individuals. Furthermore, we investigated correlations between our associated SNPs and brain imaging-derived phenotypes (IDPs) from &gt;9,000 individuals in UK Biobank, as well as between self-reported handedness and IDPs. Results: Our association study of 38,322 left-handers vs 356,567 right-handers (excluding ambidextrous participants) revealed three genome-wide significant loci (rs199512, 17q21.31, p=4.1x10-9; rs45608532, 22q11.22, p=1.4x10-8; rs13017199, 2q34, p=3.3x10-8). In the imaging study, we found strong associations between rs199512 and diffusion MRI measures mainly in white matter tracts connecting language-related brain regions (p&lt;2.0x10-6). Direct investigation between handedness and IDPs revealed numerous associations with functional connectivity between the same language-related areas of the brain. A second GWAS of non- right handers (n=44,631) vs right-handers (n=356,567) revealed an additional locus: rs3094128, 6p21.33, p=2.9x10-8. Three of the four associated loci (2q34, 17q21.31, 6p21.33) contain genes that encode microtubule-related proteins that are highly expressed in the brain: MAP2, MAPT and TUBB. These genes are strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of diseases that are known to affect an excess of left-handed people, including schizophrenia. Conclusions: This is the first GWAS to identify genome-wide significant loci for human handedness in the general population, and the genes at these loci have biological plausibility in contributing to neurodevelopmental lateralization of brain organisation, which appears to predispose both to left-handedness and to certain neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases.

Medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) activity is fundamental for working memory (WM), attention, and behavioral inhibition; however, a comprehensive understanding of the neural computations underlying these processes is still forthcoming. Towards this goal, neural recordings were obtained from the mPFC of awake, behaving rats performing an odor span task of WM capacity. Neural populations were observed to encode distinct task epochs and the transitions between epochs were accompanied by abrupt shifts in neural activity patterns. Putative pyramidal neuron activity increased significantly earlier in the delay for sessions where rats achieved higher spans. Furthermore, increased putative interneuron activity was only observed at the termination of the delay thus indicating that local processing in inhibitory networks was a unique feature to initiate foraging. During foraging, changes in neural activity patterns associated with the approach to a novel odor, but not familiar odors, were robust. Collectively, these data suggest that distinct mPFC activity states underlie the delay, foraging, and reward epochs of the odor span task. Transitions between these states enable successful performance in dynamic environments placing strong demands on the substrates of working memory.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/454538v1?rss=1">Causally investigating cortical dynamics and signal processing by targeting natural system attractors with precisely timed stimulation.</a></h4>

Electrical stimulation is a promising tool for interacting with neuronal dynamics to identify neural mechanisms that underlie cognitive function. Since effects of a single short stimulation pulse typically vary greatly and depend on the current network state, many experimental paradigms have rather resorted to continuous or periodic stimulation in order to establish and maintain a desired effect. However, such an approach explicitly leads to forced and 'unnatural' brain activity. Further, continuous stimulation can make it hard to parse the recorded activity and separate neural signal from stimulation artifacts. In this study we propose an alternate strategy: by monitoring a system in realtime, we use the existing preferred states or attractors of the network and to apply short and precise pulses in order to switch between its preferred states. When pushed into one of its attractors, one can use the natural tendency of the system to remain in such a state to prolong the effect of a stimulation pulse, opening a larger window of opportunity to observe the consequences on cognitive processing. To elaborate on this idea, we consider flexible information routing in the visual cortex as a prototypical example. When processing a stimulus, neural populations in the visual cortex have been found to engage in synchronized gamma activity. In this context, selective signal routing is achieved by changing the relative phase between oscillatory activity in sending and receiving populations (communication through coherence, CTC). In order to explore how perturbations interact with CTC, we investigate a biophysically realistic network exhibiting similar synchronization and signal routing phenomena. We develop a closed-loop stimulation paradigm based on the phase-response characteristics of the network and demonstrate its ability to establish desired synchronization states. By measuring information content throughout the model, we evaluate the effect of signal contamination caused by the stimulation in relation to the magnitude of the injected pulses and intrinsic noise in the system. Finally, we demonstrate that, up to a critical noise level, precisely timed perturbations can be used to artificially induce the effect of attention by selectively routing visual signals to higher cortical areas.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/454371v1?rss=1">Neural dynamics at rest associated with patterns of ongoing thought</a></h4>

Conscious experience is dynamic, and its fluidity is particularly marked when attention is not occupied by events in the external world and our minds are free to wander. Our study used measures of neural function, and advanced analyses techniques to examine how unconstrained neural state transitions relate to patterns of ongoing experience. Neural activity was recorded during wakeful rest using functional magnetic resonance imaging and Hidden Markov modelling identified recurrent patterns of brain activity constituting functional dynamic brain states. Individuals making more frequent transitions between states subsequently described experiences highlighting problem solving and lacking unpleasant intrusive features. Frequent switching between states also predicted better health and well-being as assessed by questionnaire. These data provide evidence that the fluidity with which individuals shift through dynamic neural states has an impact on the nature of ongoing thought, and suggest that greater flexibility at rest is an important indicator of a healthy mind.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/454249v1?rss=1">Heritability and genetic variance of dementia with Lewy bodies</a></h4>

Recent large-scale genetic studies have allowed for the first glimpse of the effects of common genetic variability in dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), identifying risk variants with appreciable effect sizes. However, it is currently well established that a substantial portion of the genetic heritable component of complex traits is not captured by genome-wide significant SNPs. To overcome this issue, we have estimated the proportion of phenotypic variance explained by genetic variability (SNP heritability) in DLB using a method that is unbiased by allele frequency or linkage disequilibrium properties of the underlying variants. This shows that the heritability of DLB is nearly twice as high as previous estimates based on common variants only (31% vs 59.9%). We also determine the amount of phenotypic variance in DLB that can be explained by recent polygenic risk scores from either Parkinson's disease (PD) or Alzheimer's disease (AD), and show that, despite being highly significant, they explain a low amount of variance. Additionally, to identify pleiotropic events that might improve our understanding of the disease, we performed genetic correlation analyses of DLB with over 200 diseases and biomedically relevant traits. Our data shows that DLB has a positive correlation with education phenotypes, which is opposite to what occurs in AD. Overall, our data suggests that novel genetic risk factors for DLB should be identified by larger GWAS and these are likely to be independent from known AD and PD risk variants.

The brain operates surprisingly well despite the noisy nature of individual neurons. The central mechanism for noise mitigation in the nervous system is thought to involve averaging over multiple noise-corrupted inputs. Subsequently, there has been considerable interest recently to identify noise structures that can be averaged out to preserve reliable signal encoding. By analyzing realistic synaptic integration in biophysically accurate neuronal models, I report a role for a complementary de-noising approach mediated by focal dendritic spikes. Dendritic spikes might seem unlikely candidates for noise reduction due to their miniscule integration compartments and poor averaging abilities. Nonetheless, the extra thresholding step introduced by dendritic spike generation could increase neuronal tolerance for a broad category of noise structures, some of which cannot be resolved well with averaging. Computations with multiple dendritic spikes compensate for compartment size constraints and expand the repertoire of conditions that can be reliably processed by neuronal populations.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/454173v1?rss=1">Subthalamic nucleus local field potentials recordings reveal subtle effects of promised reward during conflict resolution in Parkinson\'s disease</a></h4>

Cognitive action control depends on cortical-subcortical circuits, involving notably the subthalamic nucleus (STN), as evidenced by local field potentials recordings (LFPs) studies. The STN consistently shows an increase in theta oscillations power during conflict resolution. Some studies have shown that cognitive action control in Parkinson's disease (PD) could be influenced by the occurrence of monetary reward. In this study, we investigated whether incentive motivation could modulate STN activity, and notably STN theta activity, during response conflict resolution. To achieve this objective, we recorded STN LFPs during a motivated Simon task in PD patients who had undergone deep brain stimulation surgery. Behavioral results revealed that promised rewards increased the difficulty in resolving conflict situations, thus replicating previous findings. Signal analyses locked on the imperative stimulus onset revealed the typical pattern of increased theta power in a conflict situation. However, this conflict-related modulation of theta power was not influenced by the size of the reward cued. We nonetheless identified a significant effect of the reward size on local functional organization (indexed by inter-trial phase clustering) of theta oscillations, with higher organization associated with high rewards while resolving conflict. When focusing on the period following the onset of the reward cue, we unveiled a stronger beta power decrease in higher reward conditions. However, these LFPs results were not correlated to behavioral results. Our study suggests that the STN is involved in how reward information can influence computations during conflict resolution. However, considering recent studies as well as the present results, we suspect that these effects are subtle.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/454140v1?rss=1">Probability cueing of singleton-distractor locations in visual search: priority-map- or dimension-based inhibition?</a></h4>

Observers can learn the likely locations of salient distractors in visual search, reducing their potential to capture attention (Ferrante et al., 2018; Sauter et al., 2018a; Wang &amp; Theeuwes, 2018a). While there is agreement that this involves positional suppression of the likely distractor location(s), it is contentious at which stage of search guidance the suppression operates: the supra-dimensional priority map or feature-contrast signals within the distractor dimension. On the latter account, advocated by Sauter et al., target processing should be unaffected by distractor suppression when the target is defined in a different (non-suppressed) dimension to the target. At odds with this, Wang and Theeuwes found strong suppression not only of the (color) distractor, but also of the (shape) target when it appeared at the likely distractor location. Adopting their paradigm, the present study ruled out that increased cross-trial inhibition of the single frequent (frequently inhibited) as compared to any of the rare (rarely inhibited) distractor locations is responsible for this target-location effect. However, a reduced likelihood of the target appearing at the frequent vs. a rare distractor location contributes to this effect: removing this negative bias abolished the cost to target processing with increasing practice, indicative of a transition from priority-map- to dimension-based - and thus a flexible locus of - distractor suppression.

Background: The BRAIN tap test is an online keyboard tapping task that has been previously validated to assess upper limb motor function in Parkinson's disease (PD). Objectives: To develop a new parameter which detects a sequence effect and to reliably distinguish between PD patients on and off medication. Alongside, we sought to validate a mobile version of the test for use on smartphones and tablet devices. Methods: BRAIN test scores in 61 patients with PD and 93 healthy controls were compared. A range of established parameters captured speed and accuracy of alternate taps. The new VS (Velocity Score) recorded the inter-tap speed. Decrement in the VS was used as a marker for the sequence effect. In the validation phase, 19 PD patients and 19 controls were tested using multiple types of hardware platforms including smart devices. Results: Quantified slopes from the VS demonstrated bradykinesia (sequence effect) in PD patients (slope cut-off -0.002) with sensitivity of 58% and specificity of 81% (discovery phase of the study) and sensitivity of 65% and specificity of 88% (validation phase). All BRAIN test parameters differentiated between on medication and off medication states in PD. Most BRAIN tap test parameters had high test-retest reliability values (ICC&gt;0.75). Differentiation between PD patients and controls was possible on all hardware versions of the test. Conclusion: The BRAIN tap test is a simple, user-friendly and free-to-use tool for assessment of upper limb motor dysfunction in PD, which now includes a measure of bradykinesia.

Synchronized states are marked by large-amplitude low-frequency oscillations in the cortex. These states can be seen during quiet waking or slow-wave sleep. Within synchronized states, previous studies have noted a plethora of different types of activity, including delta oscillations (0.5-4 Hz) and slow oscillations (&lt;1 Hz) in the cortex and large- and small- irregular activity in the hippocampus. However, it is not still fully characterized how neural populations contribute to the synchronized state. Here we apply independent component analysis (ICA) to parse which populations are involved in different kinds of cortical activity, and find two populations that alternate throughout synchronized states. One population broadly affects cortical deep layers, and is associated with larger amplitude slower cortical activity. The other population exhibits theta-frequency oscillations that are not easily observed in raw field potential recordings. These theta oscillations apparently come from below the cortex, suggesting hippocampal origin, and are associated with smaller amplitude faster cortical activity. Relative involvement of these two alternating populations may indicate different modes of operation within synchronized states.

Mesoscopic neural activity may play an important role in the cross-scale integration of brain activity and in the emergence of cognitive behavior. Mesoscale activity in the cortex can be defined as the organization of activity of large populations of neurons into collective actions, such as traveling waves in the hippocampus. A comprehensive description of collective activity is still lacking, in part because it cannot be built directly with methods and models developed for the microscale (individual neurons): the laws governing mesoscale dynamics are different from those governing a few neurons. To identify the characteristic features of mesoscopic dynamics, and to lay the foundations for a theoretical description of mesoscopic activity in the hippocampus, we conduct a comprehensive examination of observational data of hippocampal local field potential (LFP) recordings. We use the strong correlation between rat running-speed and the LFP power to parameterize the energy input into the hippocampus, and show that both the power, and the nonlinearity of mesoscopic scales of collective action (e.g., theta and gamma rhythms) increase as with energy input. Our results point to a few fundamental characteristics: collective-action dynamics are stochastic (the precise state of a single neuron is irrelevant), weakly nonlinear, and weakly dissipative. These are the principles of the theory of weak turbulence. Therefore, we propose weak turbulence as an ansatz for the development of a theoretical description of mesoscopic activity. The perspective of weak turbulence provides simple and meaningful explanations for the major features observed in the evolution of LFP spectra and bispectra with energy input, such as spectral slopes and their evolution, the increased nonlinear coupling observed between theta and gamma, as well as specific phase lags associated with their interaction. The weak turbulence ansatz is consistent with the theory of self organized criticality, which provides a simple explanation for the existence of the power-law background spectrum, and could provide a unifying approach to modeling the dynamics of mesoscopic activity.

Motion signals can arise for two reasons in the retina: due to self-motion or due to real motion in the environment. Prior studies on speed tuning always measured joint responses to real and retinal motion, and for some of the more recently identified human motion processing regions, speed tuning has not been examined in at all. We localized motion regions V3A, V6, V5/MT, MST and cingulate sulcus visual area (CSv) in 20 human participants, and then measured their responses to motion velocities from 1-24 degrees per second. Importantly, we used a pursuit paradigm that allowed us to quantify responses to objective and retinal motion separately. In order to provide optimal stimulation, we used stimuli with natural image statistics derived from Fourier scrambles of natural images. The results show that all regions increased responses with higher speeds for both, retinal and objective motion. V3A stood out in that it was the only region whose slope of the speed-response function for objective motion was higher than that for retinal motion. V6, V5/MT, MST and CSv did not differ in objective and retinal speed slopes, even though V5/MT and MST tended to respond more to objective motion at all speeds. These results reveal highly similar speed tuning functions for early and high-level motion regions, and support the view that human V3A encodes primarily objective rather than retinal motion signals.

<p>by Ruohan Zhang, Shun Zhang, Matthew H. Tong, Yuchen Cui, Constantin A. Rothkopf, Dana H. Ballard, Mary M. Hayhoe</p>

Although a standard reinforcement learning model can capture many aspects of reward-seeking behaviors, it may not be practical for modeling human natural behaviors because of the richness of dynamic environments and limitations in cognitive resources. We propose a modular reinforcement learning model that addresses these factors. Based on this model, a modular inverse reinforcement learning algorithm is developed to estimate both the rewards and discount factors from human behavioral data, which allows predictions of human navigation behaviors in virtual reality with high accuracy across different subjects and with different tasks. Complex human navigation trajectories in novel environments can be reproduced by an artificial agent that is based on the modular model. This model provides a strategy for estimating the subjective value of actions and how they influence sensory-motor decisions in natural behavior.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/c92ynP6WQ2o" width="1" />

Abstract<p>Sensory prostheses can restore aspects of natural sensation by delivering electrical current directly into sensory circuits. An effective sensory prosthetic should be capable of generating reliable real-time perceptual signals for hours each day over many years. However, we still know little regarding the stability of percepts produced by electrical microstimulation of cerebral sensory cortex when stimulation is delivered repeatedly over long periods. Developing methods that yield highly sensitive and reliable assessments of a subject’s sensitivity to stimulation is important for developing prosthetic devices that can mimic the constant stream of information inherent in daily experience. Here, we trained rhesus monkeys to report electrical microstimulation of their primary visual cortex (V1) and measured how repeated stimulation affected the minimal electrical current needed to generate a percept (behavioral detection threshold). Using adaptive staircase procedures with a two-alternative forced-choice detection task, we obtained highly reliable detection threshold measures with as few as 100 trials. Using either chronically implanted or acutely inserted microelectrodes, we found that repeated electrical microstimulation elevated detection thresholds, with effects persisting between daily testing sessions. Our results demonstrate task designs that can support rapid and reliable measurements of detection thresholds, and point to the need for validation that detection thresholds in targeted structures will be sufficiently stable in the face of the amount of chronic stimulation that will be required for effective sensory prosthetics.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Delivering electrical current into sensory brain areas could enable those with compromised sensory systems to partially recover lost senses. Whether repeated stimulation of central sites in the brain changes the ability of the stimulated site to support perception remains unresolved. We present methods for rapid, bias-free and repeatable measures of behavioral thresholds for detecting microstimulation and show that repeated electrical stimulation of visual cortex impairs the ability of monkeys to perceive that stimulation. The results have important implications for the development and use of sensory prosthetics.</p>

ABSTRACT<p>The role of orexin during development, and especially in terms of spinal cord function, is not well understood. It is for this reason that we focused on the network actions of orexin during the first week of development. We found that orexinergic fibres were present in the lumbar spinal cord of P0-3 mice. The fibres were expressed mainly in the dorsal horn, but occasional fibres were observed in the ventral horn. Both Orexin A (OXA) and Orexin B (OXB) increased the motoneurons (MNs) tonic neurogram discharge. However, only OXA was found to significantly increase spontaneous bursting activity and the frequency of fictive locomotor bursts. We show that OXA is able to act directly onto MNs. To test the contribution of the recurrent MN collaterals we blocked the nicotinic cholinergic drive and observed that OXA retained its ability to increase fictive locomotor activity. Additionally, we recorded neurograms from ventral lateral funiculi (VLF), where OXA had no effect on population discharge. These effects were also confirmed by recording from descending commissural interneurons via patch recordings. The loci of OXA’s effects were further investigated in a dorsal horn removed preparation where OXA also shows an increase in the discharge from ventral root neurograms but no increase in frequency of spontaneous or fictive locomotion burst activity. In summary, multiple lines of evidence from our work demonstrate the robust effects of orexins on spinal cord networks and MNs at the time of birth.</p><p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Orexinergic cell recordings show that the cell population is highly active during locomotion. In this study, we show that during the first neonatal week, orexin fibres and receptors are present within the spinal cord and that orexins can affect spinal locomotor circuitry. We examine their effects on motoneuron firing and commissural interneurons. Overall, our work establishes that the orexin family contributes to the control of spinal motor function.</p>

<p>Pharmacoresistant epilepsy is a common neurological disorder in which increased neuronal intrinsic excitability and synaptic excitation lead to pathologically synchronous behavior in the brain. In the majority of experimental and theoretical epilepsy models, epilepsy is associated with reduced inhibition in the pathological neural circuits, yet effects of intrinsic excitability are usually not explicitly analyzed. Here we present a novel neural mass model that includes intrinsic excitability in the form of spike-frequency adaptation in the excitatory population. We validated our model using local field potential (LFP) data recorded from human hippocampal/subicular slices. We found that synaptic conductances and slow adaptation in the excitatory population both play essential roles for generating seizures and pre-ictal oscillations. Using bifurcation analysis, we found that transitions towards seizure and back to the resting state take place via Andronov–Hopf bifurcations. These simulations therefore suggest that single neuron adaptation as well as synaptic inhibition are responsible for orchestrating seizure dynamics and transition towards the epileptic state.</p>

Abstract<p>The family of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChR) consists of five members in mammals, encoded by the <i>CHRM1</i>-5 genes. The mAChRs are G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) which can be divided into two subfamilies: M2 and M4 receptors coupling to G<sub>i/o</sub> and M1, M3 and M5 receptors coupling to G<sub>q/11</sub>. However, despite the fundamental roles played by these receptors their evolution in vertebrates has not yet been fully described. We have combined sequence-based phylogenetic analyses with comparisons of exon-intron organization and conserved synteny in order to deduce the evolution of the mAChR receptors. Our analyses verify the existence of two ancestral genes prior to the two vertebrate tetraploidizations (1R and 2R). After these events, one gene had duplicated resulting in <i>CHRM2</i> and <i>CHRM4</i> and the other had triplicated forming the <i>CHRM1, CHRM3</i> and <i>CHRM5</i> subfamily. All five genes are still present in all vertebrate groups investigated except the <i>CHRM1</i> gene which has not been identified in some of the teleosts or in chicken or any other birds. Interestingly, the third tetraploidization (3R) that took place in the teleost predecessor resulted in duplicates of all five mAChR genes of which all ten are present in zebrafish. One of the copies of the <i>CHRM2</i> and <i>CHRM3</i> genes and both <i>CHRM4</i> copies have gained introns in teleosts. Not a single separate (non-tetraploidization) duplicate has been identified in any vertebrate species. These results clarify the evolution of the vertebrate mAChR family and reveal a doubled repertoire in zebrafish, inviting studies of gene neo- and sub-functionalization.</p><p><b>Significance statement</b> Despite their pivotal physiological role, the evolution of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChR) has not yet been resolved. By investigating the genomes of a broad selection of vertebrate species and combining three different types of data, namely sequence based phylogeny, conserved synteny and intron organization, we have deduced the evolution of the mAChR genes in relation to the major vertebrate tetraploidizations (1R, 2R and 3R). Our analyses show that all vertebrate mAChR gene duplications resulted from the tetraploidizations. Interestingly, following 3R, zebrafish doubled its gene number, resulting in the ten mAChR genes present. By knowing how and when the mAChR genes arose, studies of receptor subtype specialization and possible neo- or sub-functionalization can follow.</p>

<p>The occurrence of sleep is widespread over the large majority of animal
species, suggesting a specific evolutionary strategy. The activity displayed in
such a state is known to be beneficial for cognitive functions, stabilizing
memories and improving the performances in several tasks. Despite this, a
theoretical and computational approach to achieve the understanding of such
mechanism is still lacking. In this paper we show the effect of sleep-like
activity on a simplified thalamo-cortical model which is trained to encode and
retrieve images of handwritten digits. We show that, if
spike-timing-dependent-plasticity (STDP) is active during sleep, the
connections among groups of neurons associated to instances of the same class
(digit) are enhanced, and that the internal representation is hierarchical and
orthogonalized. Such effect might be beneficial to the network to obtain better
performances in retrieval and classification tasks and to create hierarchies of
categories in integrated representations. The model leverages on the
coincidence of top-down contextual information with bottom-up sensory flow
during the training phase and on the integration of top-down predictions and
bottom-up pathways during deep-sleep-like slow oscillations.

<p>Graphene-based materials are the focus of intense research efforts to devise
novel theranostic strategies for targeting the central nervous system. In this
work, we have investigated the consequences of long-term exposure of primary
rat astrocytes to pristine graphene (GR) and graphene oxide (GO) flakes. We
demonstrate that GR/GO interfere with a variety of intracellular processes as a
result of their internalization through the endo-lysosomal pathway.
Graphene-exposed astrocytes acquire a more differentiated morphological
phenotype associated with extensive cytoskeletal rearrangements. Profound
functional alterations are induced by GO internalization, including the
upregulation of inward-rectifying K+ channels and of Na+-dependent glutamate
uptake, which are linked to the astrocyte capacity to control the extracellular
homeostasis. Interestingly, GO-pretreated astrocytes promote the functional
maturation of co-cultured primary neurons by inducing an increase in intrinsic
excitability and in the density of GABAergic synapses. The results indicate
that graphene nanomaterials profoundly affect astrocyte physiology in vitro,
with consequences for neuronal network activity. This work supports the view
that GO-based materials could be of great interest to address pathologies of
the central nervous system associated to astrocyte dysfunctions.

<p>The human brain cortical layer has a convoluted morphology that is unique to
each individual. Characterization of the cortical morphology is necessary in
longitudinal studies of structural brain change, as well as in discriminating
individuals in health and disease. A method for encoding the cortical
morphology in the form of a graph is presented. The design of graphs that
encode the global cerebral hemisphere cortices as well as localized cortical
regions is proposed. Spectral features of these graphs are then studied and
proposed as descriptors of cortical morphology. As proof-of-concept of their
applicability in characterizing cortical morphology, the descriptors are
studied in the context of discriminating individuals based on their sex.

<p>Abnormal synchronisation has been associated with epileptic seizures, one of
the most common brain disease. Due to this fact, a better understanding of
neuronal synchronisation mechanisms can help in the epilepsy treatment. We
study neuronal synchronisation by means of a randomly network with excitatory
and inhibitory synapses, where the neuron model is given by the adaptive
exponential integrate-and-fire. In our network, we verify that the decrease in
the influence of inhibition can generate synchronisation from a pattern of
desynchronised spikes. The transition from desynchronous spikes to synchronous
bursts activities, induced by varying the synaptic coupling, emerges in a
hysteretic loop due to a bistable regime where normal (synchronous) or abnormal
(desynchronous) regimes exist. We show that, for parameters within the bistable
region, a square current pulse can trigger the abnormal synchronous regime, a
process we claim to reproduce features of an epileptic seizure. We can also
suppress it, as well. Suppression can be achieved through a current with small
amplitude applying on less than 10\% of neurons. Therefore, our results
demonstrate that electrical stimulation not only can trigger synchronous
behaviours, but also can be an effective treatment for epileptic seizures
induced in a bistable regime.

<p>Often, large, high dimensional datasets collected across multiple modalities
can be organized as a higher order tensor. Low-rank tensor decomposition then
arises as a powerful and widely used tool to discover simple low dimensional
structures underlying such data. However, we currently lack a theoretical
understanding of the algorithmic behavior of low-rank tensor decompositions. We
derive Bayesian approximate message passing (AMP) algorithms for recovering
arbitrarily shaped low-rank tensors buried within noise, and we employ dynamic
mean field theory to precisely characterize their performance. Our theory
reveals the existence of phase transitions between easy, hard and impossible
inference regimes, and displays an excellent match with simulations. Moreover,
it reveals several qualitative surprises compared to the behavior of symmetric,
cubic tensor decomposition. Finally, we compare our AMP algorithm to the most
commonly used algorithm, alternating least squares (ALS), and demonstrate that
AMP significantly outperforms ALS in the presence of noise.

Telomerase RNA (TR) provides the template for DNA repeat synthesis at telomeres and is essential for genome stability in continuously dividing cells. We mapped the RNA interactome of human TR (hTR) and identified a set of non-coding and coding hTR-interacting RNAs, including the histone 1C mRNA (<i>HIST1H1C</i>). Disruption of the hTR-<i>HIST1H1C</i> RNA association resulted in markedly increased telomere elongation without affecting telomerase enzymatic activity. Conversely, over-expression of <i>HIST1H1C</i> led to telomere attrition. By using a combination of mutations to disentangle the effects of histone 1 RNA synthesis, protein expression, and hTR interaction, we show that <i>HIST1H1C</i> RNA negatively regulates telomere length independently of its protein coding potential. Taken together, our data provide important insights into a surprisingly complex hTR-RNA interaction network and define an unexpected non-coding RNA role for <i>HIST1H1C</i> in regulating telomere length homeostasis, thus offering a glimpse into the mostly uncharted, vast space of non-canonical messenger RNA functions.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/38883">Hair follicle epidermal stem cells define a niche for tactile sensation</a></h4>

The heterogeneity and compartmentalization of stem cells is a common principle in many epithelia, and is known to function in epithelial maintenance, but its other physiological roles remain elusive. Here we show transcriptional and anatomical contributions of compartmentalized epidermal stem cells (EpSCs) in tactile sensory unit formation in the mouse hair follicle (HF). EpSCs in the follicle upper-bulge, where mechanosensory lanceolate complexes (LCs) innervate, express a unique set of extracellular matrix (ECM) and neurogenesis-related genes. These EpSCs deposit an ECM protein called EGFL6 into the collar matrix, a novel ECM that tightly ensheathes LCs. EGFL6 is required for the proper patterning, touch responses, and av integrin-enrichment of LCs. By maintaining a quiescent original EpSC niche, the old bulge, EpSCs provide anatomically stable HF–LC interfaces, irrespective of the stage of follicle regeneration cycle. Thus, compartmentalized EpSCs provide a niche linking the HF and the nervous system throughout the hair cycle.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/38588">Inhibition enhances spatially-specific calcium encoding of synaptic input patterns in a biologically constrained model</a></h4>

Synaptic plasticity, which underlies learning and memory, depends on calcium elevation in neurons, but the precise relationship between calcium and spatiotemporal patterns of synaptic inputs is unclear. Here, we develop a biologically realistic computational model of striatal spiny projection neurons with sophisticated calcium dynamics, based on data from rodents of both sexes, to investigate how spatiotemporally clustered and distributed excitatory and inhibitory inputs affect spine calcium. We demonstrate that coordinated excitatory synaptic inputs evoke enhanced calcium elevation specific to stimulated spines, with lower but physiologically relevant calcium elevation in nearby non-stimulated spines. Results further show a novel and important function of inhibition-to enhance the difference in calcium between stimulated and non-stimulated spines. These findings suggest that spine calcium dynamics encode synaptic input patterns and may serve as a signal for both stimulus-specific potentiation and heterosynaptic depression, maintaining balanced activity in a dendritic branch while inducing pattern-specific plasticity.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/38539">INAVA-ARNO complexes bridge mucosal barrier function with inflammatory signaling</a></h4>

Homeostasis at mucosal surfaces requires cross-talk between the environment and barrier epithelial cells. Disruption of barrier function typifies mucosal disease. Here we elucidate a bifunctional role in coordinating this cross-talk for the inflammatory bowel disease risk-gene <i>INAVA</i>. Both activities require INAVA's DUF3338 domain (renamed CUPID). CUPID stably binds the cytohesin ARF-GEF ARNO to effect lateral membrane F-actin assembly underlying cell-cell junctions and barrier function. Unexpectedly, when bound to CUPID, ARNO affects F-actin dynamics in the absence of its canonical activity as a guanine nucleotide-exchange factor. Upon exposure to IL-1β, INAVA relocates to form cytosolic puncta, where CUPID amplifies TRAF6-dependent polyubiquitination and inflammatory signaling. In this case, ARNO binding to CUPID negatively-regulates polyubiquitination and the inflammatory response. INAVA and ARNO act similarly in primary human macrophages responding to IL-1β and NOD2 agonists. Thus, INAVA-CUPID exhibits dual functions, coordinated directly by ARNO, that bridge epithelial barrier function with extracellular signals and inflammation.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/38183">The glycosphingolipid MacCer promotes synaptic bouton formation in Drosophila by interacting with Wnt</a></h4>

Lipids are structural components of cellular membranes and signaling molecules that are widely involved in development and diseases, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood, partly because of the vast variety of lipid species and complexity of synthetic and turnover pathways. From a genetic screen, we identify that mannosyl glucosylceramide (MacCer), a species of glycosphingolipid (GSL), promotes synaptic bouton formation at the <i>Drosophila</i> neuromuscular junction (NMJ). Pharmacological and genetic analysis shows that the NMJ growth-promoting effect of MacCer depends on normal lipid rafts, which are known to be composed of sphingolipids, sterols and select proteins. MacCer positively regulates the synaptic level of Wnt1/Wingless (Wg) and facilitates presynaptic Wg signaling, whose activity is raft-dependent. Furthermore, a functional GSL-binding motif in Wg exhibiting a high affinity for MacCer is required for normal NMJ growth. These findings reveal a novel mechanism whereby the GSL MacCer promotes synaptic bouton formation via Wg signaling.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/37925">Multiple tumor suppressors regulate a HIF-dependent negative feedback loop via ISGF3 in human clear cell renal cancer</a></h4>

Whereas <i>VHL </i>inactivation is a primary event in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), the precise mechanism(s) of how this interacts with the secondary mutations in tumor suppressor genes, including <i>PBRM1</i>, <i>KDM5C</i>/<i>JARID1C</i>, <i>SETD2</i>, and/or<i>BAP1</i>, remains unclear. Gene expression analyses reveal that VHL, PBRM1, or KDM5C share a common regulation of interferon response expression signature. Loss of HIF2a, PBRM1, or KDM5C in <i>VHL-/-</i>cells reduces the expression of interferon stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3), a transcription factor that regulates the interferon signature. Moreover, loss of SETD2 or BAP1 also reduces the ISGF3 level. Finally, ISGF3 is strongly tumor-suppressive in a xenograft model as its loss significantly enhances tumor growth. Conversely, reactivation of ISGF3 retards tumor growth by PBRM1-deficient ccRCC cells. Thus after VHL inactivation, HIF induces ISGF3, which is reversed by the loss of secondary tumor suppressors, suggesting that this is a key negative feedback loop in ccRCC.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/37571">Excitatory and inhibitory synapse reorganization immediately after critical sensory experience in a vocal learner</a></h4>

Excitatory and inhibitory synapses are the brain's most abundant synapse types. However, little is known about their formation during critical periods of motor skill learning, when sensory experience defines a motor target that animals strive to imitate. In songbirds, we find that exposure to tutor song leads to elimination of excitatory synapses in HVC (used here as a proper name), a key song generating brain area. A similar pruning is associated with song maturation, because juvenile birds have fewer excitatory synapses, the better their song imitations. In contrast, tutoring is associated with rapid insertion of inhibitory synapses, but the tutoring-induced structural imbalance between excitation and inhibition is eliminated during subsequent song maturation. Our work suggests that sensory exposure triggers the developmental onset of goal-specific motor circuits by increasing the relative strength of inhibition and it suggests a synapse-elimination model of song memorization.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/37388">Theta-modulation drives the emergence of connectivity patterns underlying replay in a network model of place cells</a></h4>

Place cells of the rodent hippocampus fire action potentials when the animal traverses a particular spatial location in any environment. Therefore for any given trajectory one observes a repeatable sequence of place cell activations. When the animal is quiescent or sleeping, one can observe similar sequences of activation known as replay, which underlie the process of memory consolidation. However, it remains unclear how replay is generated. Here we show how a temporally asymmetric plasticity rule during spatial exploration gives rise to spontaneous replay in a model network by shaping the recurrent connectivity to reflect the topology of the learned environment. Crucially, the rate of this encoding is strongly modulated by ongoing rhythms. Oscillations in the theta range optimize learning by generating repeated pre-post pairings on a time-scale commensurate with the window for plasticity, while lower and higher frequencies generate learning rates which are lower by orders of magnitude.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/35957">Functional trade-offs and environmental variation shaped ancient trajectories in the evolution of dim-light vision</a></h4>

Trade-offs between protein stability and activity can restrict access to evolutionary trajectories, but widespread epistasis may facilitate indirect routes to adaptation. This may be enhanced by natural environmental variation, but in multicellular organisms this process is poorly understood. We investigated a paradoxical trajectory taken during the evolution of tetrapod dim-light vision, where in the rod visual pigment rhodopsin, E122 was fixed 350 million years ago, a residue associated with increased active-state (MII) stability but greatly diminished rod photosensitivity. Here, we demonstrate that high MII stability could have likely evolved <i>without</i> E122, but instead, selection appears to have entrenched E122 in tetrapods <i>via</i> epistatic interactions with nearby coevolving sites. In fishes by contrast, selection may have exploited these epistatic effects to explore alternative trajectories, but <i>via</i> indirect routes with low MII stability. Our results suggest that within tetrapods, E122 and high MII stability cannot be sacrificed—not even for improvements to rod photosensitivity.

Background:Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) has agonist activity at various serotonin (5-HT) and dopamine receptors. Despite the therapeutic and scientific interest in LSD, specific receptor contributions to its neurobiological effects remain unknown. Methods: We therefore conducted a double-blind, randomized, counterbalanced, cross-over study (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02451072) during which 24 healthy human participants received either (i) placebo+placebo, (ii) placebo+LSD (100 µg po), or (iii) Ketanserin, a selective 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor antagonist,+LSD. We quantified resting-state functional connectivity via a data-driven global brain connectivity method and compared it to cortical gene expression maps. Findings: LSD reduced associative, but concurrently increased sensory-somatomotor brain-wide and thalamic connectivity. Ketanserin fully blocked the subjective and neural LSD effects. Whole-brain spatial patterns of LSD effects matched 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor cortical gene expression in humans. Conclusion: Together, these results strongly implicate the 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor in LSD’s neuropharmacology. This study therefore pinpoints the critical role of 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> in LSD’s mechanism, which informs its neurobiology and guides rational development of psychedelic-based therapeutics.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Reward-predictive stimuli can increase an automatic response tendency, which needs to be counteracted by effortful response inhibition when this tendency is inappropriate for the current task. Here we investigated how the human brain implements this dynamic process by adopting a reward-modulated Simon task while acquiring EEG and fMRI data in separate sessions. In the Simon task, a lateral target stimulus triggers an automatic response tendency of the spatially corresponding hand, which needs to be overcome if the activated hand is opposite to what the task requires, thereby delaying the response. We associated high or low reward with different targets, the location of which could be congruent or incongruent with the correct response hand. High-reward targets elicited larger Simon effects than low-reward targets, suggesting an increase in the automatic response tendency induced by the stimulus location. This tendency was accompanied by modulations of the lateralized readiness potential over the motor cortex, and was inhibited soon after if the high-reward targets were incongruent with the correct response hand. Moreover, this process was accompanied by enhanced theta oscillations in medial frontal cortex and enhanced activity in a frontobasal ganglia network. With dynamical causal modeling, we further demonstrated that the connection from presupplementary motor area (pre-SMA) to right inferior frontal cortex (rIFC) played a crucial role in modulating the reward-modulated response inhibition. Our results support a dynamic neural model of reward-induced response activation and inhibition, and shed light on the neural communication between reward and cognitive control in generating adaptive behaviors.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The success of humans in novel environments is partially supported by our ability to implement new task procedures via instructions. This complex skill has been associated with the activity of control-related brain areas. Current models link fronto-parietal and cingulo-opercular networks with transient and sustained modes of cognitive control, based on observations during repetitive task settings or rest. The current study extends this dual model to novel instructed tasks. We employed a mixed design and an instruction-following task to extract phasic and tonic brain signals associated with the encoding and implementation of novel verbal rules. We also performed a representation similarity analysis to capture consistency in task-set encoding within trial epochs. Our findings show that both networks are involved while following novel instructions: transiently, during the implementation of the instruction, and in a sustained fashion, across novel trials blocks. Moreover, the multivariate results showed that task representations in the cingulo-opercular network were more stable than in the fronto-parietal one. Our data extend the dual model of cognitive control to novel demanding situations, highlighting the high flexibility of control-related regions in adopting different temporal profiles.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>We examined the responses of neurons in posterior parietal area 7a to passive rotational and translational self-motion stimuli, while systematically varying the speed of visually simulated (optic flow cues) or actual (vestibular cues) self-motion. Contrary to a general belief that responses in area 7a are predominantly visual, we found evidence for a vestibular dominance in self-motion processing. Only a small fraction of neurons showed multisensory convergence of visual/vestibular and linear/angular self-motion cues. These findings suggest possibly independent neuronal population codes for visual versus vestibular and linear versus angular self-motion. Neural responses scaled with self-motion magnitude (i.e., speed) but temporal dynamics were diverse across the population. Analyses of laminar recordings showed a strong distance-dependent decrease for correlations in stimulus-induced (signal correlation) and stimulus-independent (noise correlation) components of spike-count variability, supporting the notion that neurons are spatially clustered with respect to their sensory representation of motion. Single-unit and multiunit response patterns were also correlated, but no other systematic dependencies on cortical layers or columns were observed. These findings describe a likely independent multimodal neural code for linear and angular self-motion in a posterior parietal area of the macaque brain that is connected to the hippocampal formation.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Recent evidence suggests a systematic cultural difference in the volume/thickness of prefrontal regions of the brain. However, origins of this difference remain unclear. Here, we addressed this gap by adopting a unique genetic approach. People who carry the 7- or 2-repeat (7/2-R) allele of the dopamine D4 receptor gene (<span style="font-style: italic;">DRD4</span>) are more sensitive to environmental influences, including cultural influences. Therefore, if the difference in brain structure is due to cultural influences, it should be moderated by <span style="font-style: italic;">DRD4</span>. We recruited 132 young adults (both European Americans and Asian-born East Asians). Voxel-based morphometry showed that gray matter (GM) volume of the medial prefrontal cortex and the orbitofrontal cortex was significantly greater among European Americans than among East Asians. Moreover, the difference in GM volume was significantly more pronounced among carriers of the 7/2-R allele of <span style="font-style: italic;">DRD4</span> than among non-carriers. This pattern was robust in an alternative measure assessing cortical thickness. A further exploratory analysis showed that among East Asian carriers, the number of years spent in the U.S. predicted increased GM volume in the orbitofrontal cortex. The present evidence is consistent with a view that culture shapes the brain by mobilizing epigenetic pathways that are gradually established through socialization and enculturation.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS) is a promising treatment for psychiatric and neurologic conditions, but outcomes are variable across treated individuals. In principle, precise targeting of individual-specific features of functional brain networks could improve the efficacy of NIBS interventions. Network theory predicts that the role of a node in a network can be inferred from its connections; as such, we hypothesized that targeting individual-specific “hub” brain areas with NIBS should impact cognition more than nonhub brain areas. Here, we first demonstrate that the spatial positioning of hubs is variable across individuals but reproducible within individuals upon repeated imaging. We then tested our hypothesis in healthy individuals using a prospective, within-subject, double-blind design. Inhibition of a hub with continuous theta burst stimulation disrupted information processing during working-memory more than inhibition of a nonhub area, despite targets being separated by only a few centimeters on the right middle frontal gyrus of each subject. Based upon these findings, we conclude that individual-specific brain network features are functionally relevant and could leveraged as stimulation sites in future NIBS interventions.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Training and immobilization are powerful drivers of use-dependent plasticity in human primary motor hand area (M1<sub>HAND</sub>). In young right-handed volunteers, corticomotor representations of the left first dorsal interosseus and abductor digiti minimi muscles were mapped with neuronavigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to elucidate how finger-specific training and immobilization interact within M1<sub>HAND</sub>. A first group of volunteers trained to track a moving target on a smartphone with the left index or little finger for one week. Linear sulcus shape-informed TMS mapping revealed that the tracking skill acquired with the trained finger was transferred to the nontrained finger of the same hand. The cortical representations of the trained and nontrained finger muscle converged in proportion with skill transfer. In a second group, the index or little finger were immobilized for one week. Immobilization alone attenuated the corticomotor representation and pre-existing tracking skill of the immobilized finger. In a third group, the detrimental effects of finger immobilization were blocked by concurrent training of the nonimmobilized finger. Conversely, immobilization of the nontrained fingers accelerated learning in the adjacent trained finger during the first 2 days of training. Together, the results provide novel insight into use-dependent cortical plasticity, revealing synergistic rather than competitive interaction patterns within M1<sub>HAND</sub>.</span>

Trust pervades nearly every social aspect of our daily lives, and its disruption is a significant factor in mental illness. Research in the field of neuroeconomics has gained a deeper understanding of the neuropsychoeconomic (NPE) underpinnings of trust by combining complementary methodologies from neuroscience, psychology, and economics. However, a coherent model of trust that integrates separate findings under a conceptual framework is still lacking. Here, we sketch out an integrative NPE model that explains how the interactions of psychoeconomic components engage domain-general large-scale brain networks in shaping trust behavior over time.

Cerebellar functional networks are topographically individual-specific. Cerebellar intrinsic fMRI signals lag those in cortex by 100–400 ms. The frontoparietal control network is greatly overrepresented (&gt;2-fold), suggesting that the cerebellum is important for the adaptive control of the brain’s cognitive processes.

One of the many challenges with battling alcohol and substance use disorders is the risk of relapse. This study aims to understand the molecular basis of cravings associated with relapse by demonstrating how alcohol hijacks the Notch signaling pathway. The authors found that alcohol activates Notch in a memory circuit in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, and that this is associated with misregulation of gene isoforms associated with memory formation. These findings provide insight into how alcohol induces such long-lasting cravings.

During spatial navigation, animals use self-motion to estimate positions through path integration. However, estimation errors accumulate over time and it is unclear how they are corrected. Here we report a new cell class, cue cell, in mouse medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) that encoded visual cue information that could be used to correct errors in path integration. Cue cells accounted for a large fraction of unidentified MEC cells. They exhibited firing fields only near visual cues during virtual navigation and spatially stable activity during navigation in a real arena. Cue cells' responses occurred in sequences repeated at each cue and were likely driven by visual inputs. In layers 2/3 of the MEC, cue cells formed clusters. Anatomically adjacent cue cells responded similarly to cues. These cue cell properties demonstrate that the MEC circuits contain a code representing spatial landmarks that could play a significant role in error correction during path integration.

<p>by Frank S. Heldt, Reece Lunstone, John J. Tyson, Béla Novák</p>

The size of a cell sets the scale for all biochemical processes within it, thereby affecting cellular fitness and survival. Hence, cell size needs to be kept within certain limits and relatively constant over multiple generations. However, how cells measure their size and use this information to regulate growth and division remains controversial. Here, we present two mechanistic mathematical models of the budding yeast (<i>S</i>. <i>cerevisiae</i>) cell cycle to investigate competing hypotheses on size control: inhibitor dilution and titration of nuclear sites. Our results suggest that an inhibitor-dilution mechanism, in which cell growth dilutes the transcriptional inhibitor Whi5 against the constant activator Cln3, can facilitate size homeostasis. This is achieved by utilising a positive feedback loop to establish a fixed size threshold for the Start transition, which efficiently couples cell growth to cell cycle progression. Yet, we show that inhibitor dilution cannot reproduce the size of mutants that alter the cell’s overall ploidy and <i>WHI5</i> gene copy number. By contrast, size control through titration of Cln3 against a constant number of genomic binding sites for the transcription factor SBF recapitulates both size homeostasis and the size of these mutant strains. Moreover, this model produces an imperfect ‘sizer’ behaviour in G1 and a ‘timer’ in S/G2/M, which combine to yield an ‘adder’ over the whole cell cycle; an observation recently made in experiments. Hence, our model connects these phenomenological data with the molecular details of the cell cycle, providing a systems-level perspective of budding yeast size control.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/96FIxHm1CYc" width="1" />

Thermodynamics dictates the structure and function of metabolism. Redox reactions drive cellular energy and material flow. Hence, accurately quantifying the thermodynamics of redox reactions should reveal design principles that shape cellular metabolism. However, only few redox potentials have been measured, and mostly with inconsistent experimental setups. Here, we develop a quantum chemistry approach to calculate redox potentials of biochemical reactions and demonstrate our method predicts experimentally measured potentials with unparalleled accuracy. We then calculate the potentials of all redox pairs that can be generated from biochemically relevant compounds and highlight fundamental trends in redox biochemistry. We further address the question of why NAD/NADP are used as primary electron carriers, demonstrating how their physiological potential range fits the reactions of central metabolism and minimizes the concentration of reactive carbonyls. The use of quantum chemistry can revolutionize our understanding of biochemical phenomena by enabling fast and accurate calculation of thermodynamic values.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/fxBdh4lAOFc" width="1" />

Multicellular tumour spheroids capture many characteristics of human tumour microenvironments, including hypoxia, and represent an experimentally tractable <i>in vitro</i> model for studying interactions between radiotherapy and anticancer drugs. However, interpreting spheroid data is challenging because of limited ability to observe cell fate within spheroids dynamically. To overcome this limitation, we have developed a hybrid continuum/agent-based model (ABM) for HCT116 tumour spheroids, parameterised using experimental models (monolayers and multilayers) in which reaction and diffusion can be measured directly. In the ABM, cell fate is simulated as a function of local oxygen, glucose and drug concentrations, determined by solving diffusion equations and intracellular reactions. The model is lattice-based, with cells occupying discrete locations on a 3D grid embedded within a coarser grid that encompasses the culture medium; separate solvers are employed for each grid. The generated concentration fields account for depletion in the medium and specify concentration-time profiles within the spheroid. Cell growth and survival are determined by intracellular oxygen and glucose concentrations, the latter based on direct measurement of glucose diffusion/reaction (in multilayers) for the first time. The ABM reproduces known features of spheroids including overall growth rate, its oxygen and glucose dependence, peripheral cell proliferation, central hypoxia and necrosis. We extended the ABM to describe in detail the hypoxia-dependent interaction between ionising radiation and a hypoxia-activated prodrug (SN30000), again using experimentally determined parameters; the model accurately simulated clonogenic cell killing in spheroids, while inclusion of reversible cell cycle delay was required to account for the marked spheroid growth delay after combined radiation and SN30000. This ABM of spheroid growth and response exemplifies the utility of integrating computational and experimental tools for investigating radiation/drug interactions, and highlights the critical importance of understanding oxygen, glucose and drug concentration gradients in interpreting activity of therapeutic agents in spheroid models.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/nj5iKPxgTiA" width="1" />

<p>A brain clock, constituted of ~20,000 peptidergically heterogeneous neurons, is located in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). While many peptidergic cell types have been identified, little is known about the connections among these neurons in mice. We first sought to identify contacts among major peptidergic cell types in the SCN using triple-label fluorescent immunocytochemistry (ICC). To this end, contacts among vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP), and calretinin (CALR) cells of the core, and arginine vasopressin (AVP) and met-enkephalin (ENK) cells of the shell were analyzed. Some core-to-shell and shell-to-core communications are specialized. We found that in wild-type (WT) mice, AVP fibers make extremely sparse contacts onto VIP neurons but contacts in the reverse direction are numerous. In contrast, AVP fibers make more contacts onto GRP neurons than conversely. For the other cell types tested, largely reciprocal connections are made. These results point to peptidergic cell type-specific communications between core and shell SCN neurons. To further understand the impact of VIP-to-AVP communication, we next explored the SCN in VIP-deficient mice (VIP-KO). In these animals, AVP expression is markedly reduced in the SCN, but it is not altered in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and supraoptic nucleus (SON). Surprisingly, in VIP-KO mice, the number of AVP appositions onto other peptidergic cell types is not different from controls. Colchicine administration, which blocks AVP transport, restored the numbers of AVP neurons in VIP-KO to that of WT littermates. The results indicate that VIP has an important role in modulating AVP expression levels in the SCN in this mouse.</p>

Abstract
<p>Our aim was to study the mechanisms that contribute to the development of discrete thalamic nuclei during mouse embryogenesis (both sexes included). We characterized the expression of the transcription factor coding gene <i>Zic4</i> and the distribution of cells that expressed <i>Zic4</i> in their lineage. We used genetic fate mapping to show that <i>Zic4</i>-lineage cells mainly contribute to a subset of thalamic nuclei, in particular the lateral geniculate nuclei (LGNs), which are crucial components of the visual pathway. We observed that almost all <i>Zic4</i>-lineage diencephalic progenitors express the transcription factor Pax6 at variable location-dependent levels. We used conditional mutagenesis to delete either one or both copies of <i>Pax6</i> from <i>Zic4</i>-lineage cells. We found that <i>Zic4</i>-lineage cells carrying either homozygous or heterozygous loss of <i>Pax6</i> contributed in abnormally high numbers to one or both of the main lateral geniculate nuclei (LGNs). This could not be attributed to a change in cell production and was likely due to altered sorting of thalamic cells. Our results indicate that positional information encoded by the levels of Pax6 in diencephalic progenitors is an important determinant of the eventual locations of their daughter cells.</p>

Abstract
<p>The quick and reliable detection and identification of a tastant in the mouth regulate nutrient uptake and toxin expulsion. Consistent with the pivotal role of the gustatory system, taste category information (e.g., sweet, salty) is represented during the earliest phase of the taste-evoked cortical response (Crouzet et al., 2015), and different tastes are perceived and responded to within only a few hundred milliseconds, in rodents (Perez et al., 2013) and humans (Bujas, 1935). Currently, it is unknown whether taste detection and discrimination are sequential or parallel processes, i.e., whether you know what it is as soon as you taste it. To investigate the sequence of processing steps involved in taste perceptual decisions, participants tasted sour, salty, bitter, and sweet solutions and performed a taste-detection and a taste-discrimination task. We measured response times (RTs) and 64-channel scalp electrophysiological recordings and tested the link between the timing of behavioral decisions and the timing of neural taste representations determined with multivariate pattern analyses. Irrespective of taste and task, neural decoding onset and behavioral RTs were strongly related, demonstrating that differences between taste judgments are reflected early during chemosensory encoding. Neural and behavioral detection times were faster for the iso-hedonic salty and sour tastes than their discrimination time. No such latency difference was observed for sweet and bitter, which differ hedonically. Together, these results indicate that the human gustatory system detects a taste faster than it discriminates between tastes, yet hedonic computations may run in parallel (Perez et al., 2013) and facilitate taste identification.</p>

Abstract
<p>In central respiratory circuitry, synaptic excitation is responsible for synchronizing neuronal activity in the different respiratory rhythm phases, whereas chloride-mediated inhibition is important for shaping the respiratory pattern itself. The potassium chloride cotransporter KCC2, which serves to maintain low intraneuronal Cl<sup>–</sup> concentration and thus render chloride-mediated synaptic signaling inhibitory, exists in two isoforms, KCC2a and KCC2b. KCC2 is essential for functional breathing motor control at birth, but the specific contribution of the KCC2a isoform remains unknown. Here, to address this issue, we investigated the respiratory phenotype of mice deficient for KCC2a. <i>In vivo</i> plethysmographic recordings revealed that KCC2a-deficient pups at P0 transiently express an abnormally low breathing rate and a high occurrence of apneas. Immunostainings confirmed that KCC2a is normally expressed in the brainstem neuronal groups involved in breathing (pre-Bötzinger complex, parafacial respiratory group, hypoglossus nucleus) and is absent in these regions in the KCC2a<sup>–/–</sup> mutant. However, in variously reduced <i>in vitro</i> medullary preparations, spontaneous rhythmic respiratory activity is similar to that expressed in wild-type preparations, as is hypoglossal motor output, and no respiratory pauses are detected, suggesting that the rhythm-generating networks are not intrinsically affected in mutants at P0. In contrast, inhibitory neuromodulatory influences exerted by the pons on respiratory rhythmogenesis are stronger in the mutant, thereby explaining the breathing anomalies observed <i>in vivo</i>. Thus, our results indicate that the KCC2a isoform is important for establishing proper breathing behavior at the time of birth, but by acting at sites that are extrinsic to the central respiratory networks themselves.</p>

<p>Accumulation of α-Synuclein (α-Syn) causes Parkinson's disease (PD) as well as other synucleopathies. α-Syn is the major component of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites, the proteinaceous aggregates that are a hallmark of sporadic PD. In familial forms of PD, mutations or copy number variations in <i>SNCA</i> (the α-Syn gene) result in a net increase of its protein levels. Furthermore, common risk variants tied to PD are associated with small increases of <i>wild-type</i> α-Syn levels. These findings are further bolstered by animal studies which show that overexpression of α-Syn is sufficient to cause PD-like features. Thus, increased α-Syn levels are intrinsically tied to PD pathogenesis and underscore the importance of identifying the factors that regulate its levels. In this study, we establish a pooled RNAi screening approach and validation pipeline to probe the druggable genome for modifiers of α-Syn levels and identify 60 promising targets. Using a cross-species, tiered validation approach, we validate six strong candidates that modulate α-Syn levels and toxicity in cell lines, <i>Drosophila</i>, human neurons, and mouse brain of both sexes. More broadly, this genetic strategy and validation pipeline can be applied for the identification of therapeutic targets for disorders driven by dosage-sensitive proteins.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We present a research strategy for the systematic identification and validation of genes modulating the levels of α-Synuclein, a protein involved in Parkinson's disease. A cell-based screen of the druggable genome (&gt;7,500 genes that are potential therapeutic targets) yielded many modulators of α-Synuclein that were subsequently confirmed and validated in <i>Drosophila</i>, human neurons, and mouse brain. This approach has broad applicability to the multitude of neurological diseases that are caused by mutations in genes whose dosage is critical for brain function.</p>

<p>Sleep-specific oscillations of spindles and slow waves are generated through thalamocortical and corticocortical loops, respectively, and provide a unique opportunity to measure the integrity of these neuronal systems. Understanding the relative contribution of genetic factors to sleep oscillations is important for determining whether they constitute useful endophenotypes that mark vulnerability to psychiatric illness. Using high-density sleep EEG recordings in human adolescent twin pairs (<i>n</i> = 60; 28 females), we find that over posterior regions 80–90% of the variance in slow oscillations, slow wave, and spindle activity is due to genes. Surprisingly, slow (10–12 Hz) and fast (12–16 Hz) anterior spindle amplitude and  power are largely driven by environmental factors shared among the twins. To our knowledge this is the first example of a neural phenotype that exhibits a strong influence of nature in one brain region, and nurture in another. Overall, our findings highlight the utility of the sleep EEG as a reliable and easy to measure endophenotype during adolescence. This measure may be used to measure disease risk in development before the onset of a psychiatric disorder; the location within the brain of deficits in sleep neurophysiology may suggest whether the ultimate cause is genetic or environmental.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Two cardinal oscillations of sleep, slow waves and sleep spindles, play an important role in the core functions of sleep including memory consolidation, synaptic plasticity, and the recuperative function of sleep. In this study, we use a behavioral genetics approach to examine the heritability of sleep neurophysiology using high-density EEG in a sample of early adolescent twins. Our findings reveal a strong influence of both environmental and genetic factors in shaping these oscillations, dependent on brain region. Thus, during a developmental period when brain structure and function is in flux, we find that the sleep EEG is among the most heritable of human traits over circumscribed brain regions.</p>

<p>Humans with amygdalar lesions show proportional reductions of the emotional response to facial expressions in the fusiform face area as well as deficits in emotion recognition from facial expressions. While processing of bodily expressions shares many similarities with facial expressions, there is no substantial evidence that lesions of the amygdala result in similar behavioral and neural sequelae. We combined behavioral assessment with functional neuroimaging in a group of male and female humans with unilateral anterior temporal lobe (ATL) resections, including the amygdala (right: <i>n</i> = 10; left: <i>n</i> = 10) and 12 matched controls. The objective was to assess whether the amygdala is crucial for the recognition of body expressions and for modulatory effects on distant areas during perception of body expressions. The behavioral results revealed normal performance in both patient groups on emotion categorization of body expressions. The neuroimaging results showed that ATL patients displayed no enhanced activations in right fusiform body area and left extrastriate body area and that left ATL patients additionally displayed no enhanced activations in right posterior superior temporal sulcus and right extrastriate body area, respectively. Multivoxel pattern analysis revealed altered categorization capacity between emotional and neutral stimuli in right posterior superior temporal sulcus in right ATL patients. In addition, we also found emotional enhancement in frontal, parietal, occipital, and cingulate regions in controls. Together, our data show that the amygdala and ATLs are not necessary for recognition of dynamic body expressions, but suggest that amygdala lesions affect body emotion processing in distant brain areas.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> For humans, information from emotional expressions of others is crucial to support social interactions. The majority of emotion studies has focused on facial expressions; however, in daily life, we also use information from body postures and body movement. Visual processing of body expressions relies on a brain network, including body-specific visual areas and visuomotor areas. Even though the importance of the amygdala and its modulatory effects on distant brain regions have been documented, it remains unclear whether the amygdala plays a crucial role in emotional body processing. By combining behavioral and neuroimaging data in patients with amygdalar lesions, we provide further evidence for its modulatory effect on distant areas during the perception of body expressions.</p>

<p>Hebbian synaptic plasticity at hippocampal Schaffer collateral synapses is tightly regulated by postsynaptic small conductance (SK) channels that restrict NMDA receptor activity. SK channels are themselves modulated by G-protein-coupled signaling pathways, but it is not clear under what conditions these are activated to enable synaptic plasticity. Here, we show that muscarinic M1 receptor (M1R) and type 1 metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR1) signaling pathways, which are known to inhibit SK channels and thereby disinhibit NMDA receptors, converge to facilitate spine calcium transients during the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) at hippocampal Schaffer collateral synapses onto CA1 pyramidal neurons of male rats. Furthermore, mGluR1 activation is required for LTP induced by reactivated place-cell firing patterns that occur in sharp-wave ripple events during rest or sleep. In contrast, M1R activation is required for LTP induced by place-cell firing patterns during exploration. Thus, we describe a common mechanism that enables synaptic plasticity during both encoding and consolidation of memories within hippocampal circuits.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Memory ensembles in the hippocampus are formed during active exploration and consolidated during rest or sleep. These two distinct phases each require strengthening of synaptic connections by long-term potentiation (LTP). The neuronal activity patterns in each phase are very different, which makes it hard to map generalized rules for LTP induction onto both formation and consolidation phases. In this study, we show that inhibition of postsynaptic SK channels is a common necessary feature of LTP induction and that SK channel inhibition is achieved by separate but convergent metabotropic signaling pathways. Thus, we reveal a common mechanism for enabling LTP under distinct behavioral conditions.</p>

<p>Odorants are coded in the primary olfactory processing centers by spatially and temporally distributed patterns of glomerular activity. Whereas the spatial distribution of odorant-induced responses is known to be conserved across individuals, the universality of its temporal structure is still debated. Via fast two-photon calcium imaging, we analyzed the early phase of neuronal responses in the form of the activity onset latencies in the antennal lobe projection neurons of honeybee foragers. We show that each odorant evokes a stimulus-specific response latency pattern across the glomerular coding space. Moreover, we investigate these early response features for the first time across animals, revealing that the order of glomerular firing onsets is conserved across individuals and allows them to reliably predict odorant identity, but not concentration. These results suggest that the neuronal response latencies provide the first available code for fast odor identification.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Here, we studied early temporal coding in the primary olfactory processing centers of the honeybee brain by fast imaging of glomerular responses to different odorants across glomeruli and across individuals. Regarding the elusive role of rapid response dynamics in olfactory coding, we were able to clarify the following aspects: (1) the rank of glomerular activation is conserved across individuals, (2) its stimulus prediction accuracy is equal to that of the response amplitude code, and (3) it contains complementary information. Our findings suggest a substantial role of response latencies in odor identification, anticipating the static response amplitude code.</p>

<p>New myelin sheaths can be restored to demyelinated axons in a spontaneous regenerative process called remyelination. In general, new myelin sheaths are made by oligodendrocytes newly generated from a widespread population of adult CNS progenitors called oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs). New myelin in CNS remyelination in both experimental models and clinical diseases can also be generated by Schwann cells (SCs), the myelin-forming cells of the PNS. Fate-mapping studies have shown that SCs contributing to remyelination in the CNS are often derived from OPCs and appear not to be derived from myelinating SCs from the PNS. In this study, we address whether CNS remyelinating SCs can also be generated from PNS-derived cells other than myelinating SCs. Using a genetic fate-mapping approach, we have found that a subpopulation of nonmyelinating SCs identified by the expression of the transcription factor Foxj1 also contribute to CNS SC remyelination, as well as to remyelination in the PNS. We also find that the ependymal cells lining the central canal of the spinal cord, which also express Foxj1, do not generate cells that contribute to CNS remyelination. These findings therefore identify a previously unrecognized population of PNS glia that can participate in the regeneration of new myelin sheaths following CNS demyelination.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Remyelination failure in chronic demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis drives the current quest for developing means by which remyelination in CNS can be enhanced therapeutically. Critical to this endeavor is the need to understand the mechanisms of remyelination, including the nature and identity of the cells capable of generating new myelin sheath-forming cells. Here, we report a previously unrecognized subpopulation of nonmyelinating Schwann cells (SCs) in the PNS, identified by the expression of the transcription factor Foxj1, which can give rise to SCs that are capable of remyelinating both PNS and CNS axons. These cells therefore represent a new cellular target for myelin regenerative strategies for the treatment of CNS disorders characterized by persistent demyelination.</p>

<p>Stac protein (named for its SH3- and cysteine-rich domains) was first identified in brain 20 years ago and is currently known to have three isoforms. Stac2, Stac1, and Stac3 transcripts are found at high, modest, and very low levels, respectively, in the cerebellum and forebrain, but their neuronal functions have been little investigated. Here, we tested the effects of Stac proteins on neuronal, high-voltage-activated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels. Overexpression of the three Stac isoforms eliminated Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent inactivation (CDI) of l-type current in rat neonatal hippocampal neurons (sex unknown), but not CDI of non-l-type current. Using heterologous expression in tsA201 cells (together with β and α<sub>2</sub>-<sub>1</sub> auxiliary subunits), we found that CDI for Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 (the predominant, neuronal l-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels) was suppressed by all three Stac isoforms, whereas CDI for the P/Q channel, Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1, was not. For Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2, the inhibition of CDI by the Stac proteins appeared to involve their direct interaction with the channel's C terminus. Within the Stac proteins, a weakly conserved segment containing ~100 residues and linking the structurally conserved PKC C1 and SH3_1 domains was sufficient to fully suppress CDI. The presence of CDI for l-type current in control neonatal neurons raised the possibility that endogenous Stac levels are low in these neurons and Western blotting indicated that the expression of Stac2 was substantially increased in adult forebrain and cerebellum compared with neonate. Together, our results indicate that one likely function of neuronal Stac proteins is to tune Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry via neuronal l-type channels.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Stac protein, first identified 20 years ago in brain, has recently been found to be essential for proper trafficking and function of the skeletal muscle l-type Ca2+ channel and is the site of mutations causing a severe, inherited human myopathy. In neurons, however, functions for Stac protein have remained unexplored. Here, we report that one likely function of neuronal Stac proteins is tuning Ca2+ entry via l-type, but not that via non-l-type, Ca2+ channels. Moreover, there is a large postnatal increase in protein levels of the major neuronal isoform (Stac2) in forebrain and cerebellum, which could provide developmental regulation of l-type channel Ca2+ signaling in these brain regions.</p>

<p>It was proposed that the <i>Drosophila amnesiac</i> gene (<i>amn</i>) is required for consolidation of aversive memory in the dorsal paired medial (DPM) neurons, a pair of large neurons that broadly innervate the mushroom bodies (MB), the fly center for olfactory learning and memory (Waddell et al., 2000). Yet, a conditional analysis showed that it was not possible to rescue the memory deficit of <i>amn<sup>X8</sup></i> null mutant flies when <i>amn</i> expression was restored only in the adult (DeZazzo et al., 1999), which led the authors to suggest that <i>amn</i> might be involved in the development of brain structures that normally promote adult olfactory memory. To further investigate temporal and spatial requirements of Amnesiac (AMN) peptide in memory, we used RNA interference in combination with conditional drivers. Experiments were conducted either in both sexes, or in either sexes. Our data show that acute modulation of <i>amn</i> expression in adult DPM neurons does not impact memory. We further show that <i>amn</i> expression is required for normal development of DPM neurons. Detailed enhancer trap analyses suggest that <i>amn</i> transcription unit contains two distinct enhancers, one specific of DPM neurons, and the other specific of α/β MB neurons. This prompted us to investigate extensively the role of AMN in the adult MB. Together, our results demonstrate that <i>amn</i> is acutely required in adult α/β MB neurons for middle-term and long-term memory. The data thus establish that <i>amn</i> plays two distinct roles. Its expression is required in DPM neurons for their development, and in adult MB for olfactory memory.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The <i>Drosophila amnesiac</i> gene encodes a neuropeptide whose expression was proposed to be required for consolidation of aversive memory in the dorsal paired medial (DPM) neurons, a pair of large neurons that broadly innervate the mushroom bodies (MB), the olfactory memory center. Here, we investigated <i>amnesiac</i> temporal and spatial requirement using conditional tools that allowed us to manipulate its expression in selected neurons. This work leads to a complete reassessment of the role of <i>amnesiac</i> in brain development and memory. We show that <i>amnesiac</i> is required for two distinct processes: for normal development of DPM neurons, and in adult MB for memory.</p>

<p>The putative cache (Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel and chemotaxis receptor) domain containing 1 (CACHD1) protein has predicted structural similarities to members of the α2 voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel auxiliary subunit family. CACHD1 mRNA and protein were highly expressed in the male mammalian CNS, in particular in the thalamus, hippocampus, and cerebellum, with a broadly similar tissue distribution to Ca<sub>V</sub>3 subunits, in particular Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1. In expression studies, CACHD1 increased cell-surface localization of Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1, and these proteins were in close proximity at the cell surface, consistent with the formation of CACHD1-Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1 complexes. In functional electrophysiological studies, coexpression of human CACHD1 with Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1, Ca<sub>V</sub>3.2, and Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3 caused a significant increase in peak current density and corresponding increases in maximal conductance. By contrast, α2-1 had no effect on peak current density or maximal conductance in Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1, Ca<sub>V</sub>3.2, or Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3. A comparison of CACHD1-mediated increases in Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1 current density and gating currents revealed an increase in channel open probability. In hippocampal neurons from male and female embryonic day 19 rats, CACHD1 overexpression increased Ca<sub>V</sub>3-mediated action potential firing frequency and neuronal excitability. These data suggest that CACHD1 is structurally an α2-like protein that functionally modulates Ca<sub>V</sub>3 voltage-gated calcium channel activity.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> This is the first study to characterize the Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel and chemotaxis receptor domain containing 1 (CACHD1) protein. CACHD1 is widely expressed in the CNS, in particular in the thalamus, hippocampus, and cerebellum. CACHD1 distribution is similar to that of low voltage-activated (Ca<sub>V</sub>3, T-type) calcium channels, in particular to Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1, a protein that regulates neuronal excitability and is a potential therapeutic target in conditions such as epilepsy and pain. CACHD1 is structurally an α2-like protein that functionally increases Ca<sub>V</sub>3 calcium current. CACHD1 increases the presence of Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1 at the cell surface, forms complexes with Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1 at the cell surface, and causes an increase in channel open probability. In hippocampal neurons, CACHD1 causes increases in neuronal firing. Thus, CACHD1 represents a novel protein that modulates Ca<sub>V</sub>3 activity.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/43/9175?rss=1">Dreaming in NREM Sleep: A High-Density EEG Study of Slow Waves and Spindles</a></h4>

<p>Dreaming can occur in both rapid eye movement (REM) and non-REM (NREM) sleep. We recently showed that in both REM and NREM sleep, dreaming is associated with local decreases in slow wave activity (SWA) in posterior brain regions. To expand these findings, here we asked how specific features of slow waves and spindles, the hallmarks of NREM sleep, relate to dream experiences. Fourteen healthy human subjects (10 females) underwent nocturnal high-density EEG recordings combined with a serial awakening paradigm. Reports of dreaming, compared with reports of no experience, were preceded by fewer, smaller, and shallower slow waves, and faster spindles, especially in central and posterior cortical areas. We also identified a minority of very steep and large slow waves in frontal regions, which occurred on a background of reduced SWA and were associated with high-frequency power increases (local "microarousals") heralding the successful recall of dream content. These results suggest that the capacity of the brain to generate experiences during sleep is reduced in the presence of neuronal off-states in posterior and central brain regions, and that dream recall may be facilitated by the intermittent activation of arousal systems during NREM sleep.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> By combining high-density EEG recordings with a serial awakening paradigm in healthy subjects, we show that dreaming in non-rapid eye movement sleep occurs when slow waves in central and posterior regions are sparse, small, and shallow. We also identified a small subset of very large and steep frontal slow waves that are associated with high-frequency activity increases (local "microarousals") heralding successful recall of dream content. These results provide noninvasive measures that could represent a useful tool to infer the state of consciousness during sleep.</p>

<p>To date, histone H2B monoubiquitination (H2Bub), a mark associated with transcriptional elongation and ongoing transcription, has not been linked to the development or maintenance of neuropathic pain states. Here, using male Sprague Dawley rats, we demonstrated spinal nerve ligation (SNL) induced behavioral allodynia and provoked ring finger protein 20 (RNF20)-dependent H2Bub in dorsal horn. Moreover, SNL provoked RNF20-mediated H2Bub phosphorylated RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) in the promoter fragments of <i>mGluR5</i>, thereby enhancing <i>mGluR5</i> transcription/expression in the dorsal horn. Conversely, focal knockdown of spinal RNF20 expression reversed not only SNL-induced allodynia but also RNF20/H2Bub/RNAPII phosphorylation-associated spinal <i>mGluR5</i> transcription/expression. Notably, TNF-α injection into naive rats and specific neutralizing antibody injection into SNL-induced allodynia rats revealed that TNF-α-associated allodynia involves the RNF20/H2Bub/RNAPII transcriptional axis to upregulate mGluR5 expression in the dorsal horn. Collectively, our findings indicated TNF-α induces RNF20-drived H2B monoubiquitination, which facilitates phosphorylated RNAPII-dependent <i>mGluR5</i> transcription in the dorsal horn for the development of neuropathic allodynia.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Histone H2B monoubiquitination (H2Bub), an epigenetic post-translational modification, positively correlated with gene expression. Here, TNF-α participated in neuropathic pain development by enhancing RNF20-mediated H2Bub, which facilitates phosphorylated RNAPII-dependent <i>mGluR5</i> transcription in dorsal horn. Our finding potentially identified neuropathic allodynia pathophysiological processes underpinning abnormal nociception processing and opens a new avenue for the development of novel analgesics.</p>

<p>The divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) is a multimetal transporter with a primary role in iron transport. Although DMT1 has been described previously in the CNS, nothing was known about the role of this metal transporter in oligodendrocyte maturation and myelination. To determine whether DMT1 is required for oligodendrocyte progenitor cell (OPC) maturation, we used siRNAs and the <i>Cre-lox</i> system to knock down/knock out DMT1 expression <i>in vitro</i> as well as <i>in vivo</i>. Blocking DMT1 synthesis in primary cultures of OPCs reduced oligodendrocyte iron uptake and significantly delayed OPC development. <i>In vivo</i>, a significant hypomyelination was found in DMT1 conditional knock-out mice in which DMT1 was postnatally deleted in NG2- or Sox10-positive OPCs. The brain of DMT1 knock-out animals presented a decrease in the expression levels of myelin proteins and a substantial reduction in the percentage of myelinated axons. This reduced postnatal myelination was accompanied by a decrease in the number of myelinating oligodendrocytes and a rise in proliferating OPCs. Furthermore, using the cuprizone model of demyelination, we established that DMT1 deletion in NG2-positive OPCs lead to less efficient remyelination of the adult brain. These results indicate that DMT1 is vital for OPC maturation and for the normal myelination of the mouse brain.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> To determine whether divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1), a multimetal transporter with a primary role in iron transport, is essential for oligodendrocyte development, we created two conditional knock-out mice in which DMT1 was postnatally deleted in NG2- or Sox10-positive oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs). We have established that DMT1 is necessary for normal OPC maturation and is required for an efficient remyelination of the adult brain. Since iron accumulation by OPCs is indispensable for myelination, understanding the iron incorporation mechanism as well as the molecules involved is critical to design new therapeutic approaches to intervene in diseases in which the myelin sheath is damaged or lost.</p>

<p>A monosynaptic projection from the cortex to the subthalamic nucleus is thought to have an important role in basal ganglia function and in the mechanism of therapeutic subthalamic deep-brain stimulation, but in humans the evidence for its existence is limited. We sought physiological confirmation of the cortico-subthalamic hyperdirect pathway using invasive recording techniques in patients with Parkinson's disease (9 men, 1 woman). We measured sensorimotor cortical evoked potentials using a temporary subdural strip electrode in response to low-frequency deep-brain stimulation in patients undergoing awake subthalamic or pallidal lead implantations. Evoked potentials were grouped into very short latency (&lt;2 ms), short latency (2–10 ms), and long latency (10–100 ms) from the onset of the stimulus pulse. Subthalamic and pallidal stimulation resulted in very short-latency evoked potentials at 1.5 ms in the primary motor cortex accompanied by EMG-evoked potentials consistent with corticospinal tract activation. Subthalamic, but not pallidal stimulation, resulted in three short-latency evoked potentials at 2.8, 5.8, and 7.7 ms in a widespread cortical distribution, consistent with antidromic activation of the hyperdirect pathway. Long-latency potentials were evoked by both targets, with subthalamic responses lagging pallidal responses by 10–20 ms, consistent with orthodromic activation of the thalamocortical pathway. The amplitude of the first short-latency evoked potential was predictive of the chronic therapeutic stimulation contact.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> This is the first physiological demonstration of the corticosubthalamic hyperdirect pathway and its topography at high spatial resolution in humans. We studied cortical potentials evoked by deep-brain stimulation in patients with Parkinson's disease undergoing awake lead implantation surgery. Subthalamic stimulation resulted in multiple short-latency responses consistent with activation of hyperdirect pathway, whereas no such response was present during pallidal stimulation. We contrast these findings with very short latency, direct corticospinal tract activations, and long-latency responses evoked through polysynaptic orthodromic projections. These findings underscore the importance of incorporating the hyperdirect pathway into models of human basal ganglia function.</p>

<p>Principles of network theoretical topology have been widely studied in the
human connectome. Of particular interest is the modular nature of the human
brain, where the connectome is divided into subnetworks and subsequently
studied to investigate changes with development, aging or disease. Here, we
present a new, weighted network measure called the Network Dependency Index
(NDI), which can be used to identify an individual region's importance to the
global functioning of the network. Importantly, we utilize NDI to differentiate
four different subnetworks (Tiers) in the human connectome following Gaussian
Mixture Model fitting. After identification of these subnetworks, we analyze
their individual topological aspects with respect to age and compare it to the
rich-club topology, which we use to define three subnetworks (rich-club, feeder
and seeder). Our results first demonstrate the efficacy of NDI to identify more
consistent, central nodes of the connectome across age-groups, when compared to
the rich-club framework. Stratifying the connectome accordingly by NDI led to
consistent subnetworks across the life-span revealing distinct patterns
associated with age where, e.g., the key relay nuclei and cortical regions are
contained in a subnetwork with highest NDI. The divisions of the human
connectome derived from our data-driven NDI framework have the potential to
reveal topological alterations due to disease and/or development, which are not
detectable by utilizing the connectome as a whole.

<p>We propose a statistical framework for clustering multiple time series that
exhibit nonlinear dynamics into an a-priori-unknown number of sub-groups that
each comprise time series with similar dynamics. Our motivation comes from
neuroscience where an important problem is to identify, within a large assembly
of neurons, sub-groups that respond similarly to a stimulus or contingency. In
the neural setting, conditioned on cluster membership and the parameters
governing the dynamics, time series within a cluster are assumed independent
and generated according to a nonlinear binomial state-space model. We derive a
Metropolis-within-Gibbs algorithm for full Bayesian inference that alternates
between sampling of cluster membership and sampling of parameters of interest.
The Metropolis step is a PMMH iteration that requires an unbiased, low variance
estimate of the likelihood function of a nonlinear state-space model. We
leverage recent results on controlled sequential Monte Carlo to estimate
likelihood functions more efficiently compared to the bootstrap particle
filter. We apply the framework to time series acquired from the prefrontal
cortex of mice in an experiment designed to characterize the neural
underpinnings of fear.

<p>During interaction with others, we perceive and produce social actions in
close temporal distance or even simultaneously. It has been argued that the
motor system is involved in perception and action, playing a fundamental role
in the handling of actions produced by oneself and by others. But how does it
distinguish in this processing between self and other, thus contributing to
self-other distinction? In this paper we propose a hierarchical model of
sensorimotor coordination based on principles of perception-action coupling and
predictive processing in which self-other distinction arises during action and
perception. For this we draw on mechanisms assumed for the integration of cues
for a sense of agency, i.e., the sense that an action is self-generated. We
report results from simulations of different scenarios, showing that the model
is not only able to minimize free energy during perception and action, but also
showing that the model can correctly attribute sense of agency to own actions.

<p>The present paper provides a mathematical description of high-order moments
of spiking activity in a recurrently-connected network of Hawkes processes. It
extends previous studies that have explored the case of a (linear) Hawkes
network driven by deterministic rate functions to the case of a stimulation by
external inputs (rate functions or spike trains) with arbitrary correlation
structure. Our approach describes the spatio-temporal filtering induced by the
afferent and recurrent connectivities using operators of the input moments.
This algebraic viewpoint provides intuition about how the network ingredients
shape the input-output mapping for moments, as well as cumulants.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/40486">Structures of translationally inactive mammalian ribosomes</a></h4>

The cellular levels and activities of ribosomes directly regulate gene expression during numerous physiological processes. The mechanisms that globally repress translation are incompletely understood. Here, we use electron cryomicroscopy to analyze inactive ribosomes isolated from mammalian reticulocytes, the penultimate stage of red blood cell differentiation. We identify two types of ribosomes that are translationally repressed by protein interactions. The first comprises ribosomes sequestered with elongation factor 2 (eEF2) by SERPINE mRNA binding protein 1 (SERBP1) occupying the ribosomal mRNA entrance channel. The second type are translationally repressed by a novel ribosome-binding protein, interferon-related developmental regulator 2 (IFRD2), which spans the P and E sites and inserts a C-terminal helix into the mRNA exit channel to preclude translation. IFRD2 binds ribosomes with a tRNA occupying a noncanonical binding site, the 'Z site', on the ribosome. These structures provide functional insights into how ribosomal interactions may suppress translation to regulate gene expression.

During land plant evolution, determinate spore-bearing axes (retained in extant bryophytes such as mosses) were progressively transformed into indeterminate branching shoots with specialized reproductive axes that form flowers. The LEAFY transcription factor, which is required for the first zygotic cell division in mosses and primarily for floral meristem identity in flowering plants, may have facilitated developmental innovations during these transitions. Mapping the LEAFY evolutionary trajectory has been challenging, however, because there is no functional overlap between mosses and flowering plants, and no functional data from intervening lineages. Here, we report a transgenic analysis in the fern <i>Ceratopteris richardii</i> that reveals a role for LEAFY in maintaining cell divisions in the apical stem cells of both haploid and diploid phases of the lifecycle. These results support an evolutionary trajectory in which an ancestral LEAFY module that promotes cell proliferation was progressively co-opted, adapted and specialized as novel shoot developmental contexts emerged.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/32595">Geometry of antiparallel microtubule bundles regulates relative sliding and stalling by PRC1 and Kif4A</a></h4>

Motor and non-motor crosslinking proteins play critical roles in determining the size and stability of microtubule-based architectures. Currently, we have a limited understanding of how geometrical properties of microtubule arrays, in turn, regulate the output of crosslinking proteins. Here we investigate this problem in the context of microtubule sliding by two interacting proteins: the non-motor crosslinker PRC1 and the kinesin Kif4A. The collective activity of PRC1 and Kif4A also results in their accumulation at microtubule plus-ends (‘end-tag’). Sliding stalls when the end-tags on antiparallel microtubules collide, forming a stable overlap. Interestingly, we find that structural properties of the initial array regulate microtubule organization by PRC1-Kif4A. First, sliding velocity scales with initial microtubule-overlap length. Second, the width of the final overlap scales with microtubule lengths. Our analyses reveal how micron-scale geometrical features of antiparallel microtubules can regulate the activity of nanometer-sized proteins to define the structure and mechanics of microtubule-based architectures.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Primate cortical evolution has been characterized by massive and disproportionate expansion of a set of specific regions in the neocortex. The associated increase in neocortical neurons comes with a high metabolic cost, thus the functions served by these regions must have conferred significant evolutionary advantage. In the present series of analyses, we show that evolutionary high-expanding cortex – as estimated from patterns of surface growth from several primate species – shares functional connections with different brain networks in a context-dependent manner. Specifically, we demonstrate that high-expanding cortex is characterized by high internetwork functional connectivity; is recruited flexibly over many different cognitive tasks; and changes its functional coupling pattern between rest and a multimodal task-state. The capacity of high-expanding cortex to connect flexibly with various specialized brain networks depending on particular cognitive requirements suggests that its selective growth and sustainment in evolution may have been linked to an involvement in supramodal cognition. In accordance with an evolutionary-developmental view, we find that this observed ability of high-expanding regions – to flexibly modulate functional connections as a function of cognitive state – emerges gradually through childhood, with a prolonged developmental trajectory plateauing in young adulthood.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>It is commonly assumed that the human auditory cortex is organized similarly to that of macaque monkeys, where the primary region, or “core,” is elongated parallel to the tonotopic axis (main direction of tonotopic gradients), and subdivided across this axis into up to 3 distinct areas (A1, R, and RT), with separate, mirror-symmetric tonotopic gradients. This assumption, however, has not been tested until now. Here, we used high-resolution ultra-high-field (7 T) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to delineate the human core and map tonotopy in 24 individual hemispheres. In each hemisphere, we assessed tonotopic gradients using principled, quantitative analysis methods, and delineated the core using 2 independent (functional and structural) MRI criteria. Our results indicate that, contrary to macaques, the human core is elongated perpendicular rather than parallel to the main tonotopic axis, and that this axis contains no more than 2 mirror-reversed gradients within the core region. Previously suggested homologies between these gradients and areas A1 and R in macaques were not supported. Our findings suggest fundamental differences in auditory cortex organization between humans and macaques.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The human cerebral cortex is highly regionalized, and this feature emerges from morphometric gradients in the cerebral vesicles during embryonic development. We tested if this principle of regionalization could be traced from the embryonic development to the human life span. Data-driven fuzzy clustering was used to identify regions of coordinated longitudinal development of cortical surface area (SA) and thickness (CT) (<span style="font-style: italic;">n</span> = 301, 4–12 years). The principal divide for the developmental SA clusters extended from the inferior–posterior to the superior–anterior cortex, corresponding to the major embryonic morphometric anterior–posterior (AP) gradient. Embryonic factors showing a clear AP gradient were identified, and we found significant differences in gene expression of these factors between the anterior and posterior clusters. Further, each identified developmental SA and CT clusters showed distinguishable life span trajectories in a larger longitudinal dataset (4–88 years, 1633 observations), and the SA and CT clusters showed differential relationships to cognitive functions. This means that regions that developed together in childhood also changed together throughout life, demonstrating continuity in regionalization of cortical changes. The AP divide in SA development also characterized genetic patterning obtained in an adult twin sample. In conclusion, the development of cortical regionalization is a continuous process from the embryonic stage throughout life.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Dopaminergic projections are hypothesized to stabilize neural signaling and neural representations, but how they shape regional information processing and large-scale network interactions remains unclear. Here we investigated effects of lowered dopamine levels on within-region temporal signal variability (measured by sample entropy) and between-region functional connectivity (measured by pairwise temporal correlations) in the healthy brain at rest. The acute phenylalanine and tyrosine depletion (APTD) method was used to decrease dopamine synthesis in 51 healthy participants who underwent resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) scanning. Functional connectivity and regional signal variability were estimated for each participant. Multivariate partial least squares (PLS) analysis was used to statistically assess changes in signal variability following APTD as compared with the balanced control treatment. The analysis captured a pattern of increased regional signal variability following dopamine depletion. Changes in hemodynamic signal variability were concomitant with changes in functional connectivity, such that nodes with greatest increase in signal variability following dopamine depletion also experienced greatest decrease in functional connectivity. Our results suggest that dopamine may act to stabilize neural signaling, particularly in networks related to motor function and orienting attention towards behaviorally-relevant stimuli. Moreover, dopamine-dependent signal variability is critically associated with functional embedding of individual areas in large-scale networks.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Using stereological analysis of NeuN-stained sections, we investigated neuronal density and number of neurons per column throughout the marmoset cortex. Estimates of mean neuronal density encompassed a greater than 3-fold range, from &gt;150 000 neurons/mm<sup>3</sup> in the primary visual cortex to ~50 000 neurons/mm<sup>3</sup> in the piriform complex. There was a trend for density to decrease from posterior to anterior cortex, but also local gradients, which resulted in a complex pattern; for example, in frontal, auditory, and somatosensory cortex neuronal density tended to increase towards anterior areas. Anterior cingulate, motor, premotor, insular, and ventral temporal areas were characterized by relatively low neuronal densities. Analysis across the depth of the cortex revealed greater laminar variation of neuronal density in occipital, parietal, and inferior temporal areas, in comparison with other regions. Moreover, differences between areas were more pronounced in the supragranular layers than in infragranular layers. Calculations of the number of neurons per unit column revealed a pattern that was distinct from that of neuronal density, including local peaks in the posterior parietal, superior temporal, precuneate, frontopolar, and temporopolar regions. These results suggest that neuronal distribution in adult cortex result from a complex interaction of developmental/ evolutionary determinants and functional requirements.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Parcellation of distinct areas in the cerebral cortex has a long history in neuroscience and is of great value for the study of brain function, specialization, and alterations in neuropsychiatric disorders. Analysis of cytoarchitectonical features has revealed their close association with molecular profiles based on protein density. This provides a rationale for the use of <span style="font-style: italic;">in vivo</span> molecular imaging data for parcellation of the cortex with the advantage of whole-brain coverage. In the current work, parcellation was based on expression of key players of the serotonin neurotransmitter system. Positron emission tomography was carried out for the quantification of serotonin 1A (5-HT<sub>1A</sub>, <span style="font-style: italic;">n</span> = 30) and 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors (<span style="font-style: italic;">n</span> = 22), the serotonin-degrading enzyme monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A, <span style="font-style: italic;">n</span> = 32) and the serotonin transporter (5-HTT, <span style="font-style: italic;">n</span> = 24) in healthy participants. Cortical protein distribution maps were obtained using surface-based quantification. Based on k-means clustering, silhouette criterion and bootstrapping, five distinct clusters were identified as the optimal solution. The defined clusters proved of high explanatory value for the effects of psychotropic drugs acting on the serotonin system, such as antidepressants and psychedelics. Therefore, the proposed method constitutes a sensible approach towards integration of multimodal imaging data for research and development in neuropharmacology and psychiatry.</span>

The trade-off between reward and effort is at the heart of most behavioral theories, from ecology to economics. Compared to reward, however, effort remains poorly understood, both at the behavioral and neurophysiological levels. This is important because unwillingness to overcome effort to gain reward is a common feature of many neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders. A recent surge in interest in the neurobiological basis of effort has led to seemingly conflicting results regarding the role of dopamine.

Behrens et al. review an emerging field building formalisms for understanding the neural basis of flexible behavior. The authors extend these ideas toward representations useful for generalization and structural abstraction, allowing rapid inferences and flexible behavior with little direct experience.

Abstract<p>Glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible vision loss due to retinal ganglion cell (RGC) degeneration that develops slowly with age. Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) is a significant risk factor, though many patients develop glaucoma with IOP in the normal range. Mutations in microfibril-associated genes cause glaucoma in animal models, suggesting the hypothesis that microfibril defects contribute to glaucoma. To test this hypothesis, we investigated IOP and functional/structural correlates of RGC degeneration in mice of either sex with abnormal microfibrils due to heterozygous <i>Tsk</i> mutation of the fibrilin-1 gene (<i>Fbn1<sup>Tsk</sup></i> <sup>/+</sup>). Although IOP was not affected, <i>Fbn1<sup>Tsk</sup></i> <sup>/+</sup> mice developed functional deficits at advanced age consistent with glaucoma, including reduced RGC responses in electroretinogram (ERG) experiments. While RGC density in the retina was not affected, the density of RGC axons in the optic nerve was significantly reduced in <i>Fbn1<sup>Tsk</sup></i> <sup>/+</sup> mice. However, reduced axon density correlated with expanded optic nerves, resulting in similar numbers of axons in <i>Fbn1<sup>Tsk</sup></i> <sup>/+</sup> and control nerves. Axons in the optic nerves of <i>Fbn1<sup>Tsk</sup></i> <sup>/+</sup> mice were significantly enlarged and axon diameter was strongly correlated with optic nerve area, as has been reported in early pathogenesis of the DBA/2J mouse model of glaucoma. Our results suggest that microfibril abnormalities can lead to phenotypes found in early-stage glaucomatous neurodegeneration. Thinning of the elastic fiber-rich pia mater was found in <i>Fbn1<sup>Tsk</sup></i> <sup>/+</sup> mice, suggesting mechanisms allowing for optic nerve expansion and a possible biomechanical contribution to determination of axon caliber.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Glaucoma is a neurodegenerative disease of the optic nerve that causes vision loss and blindness in tens of millions of people worldwide. Similar to other neurodegenerations, glaucoma onset typically occurs with advanced age. Recent genetic evidence has implicated genes associated with microfibril structure and function as causative for glaucoma. Microfibrils are structures in the extracellular matrix that contribute to tissue biomechanics and regulate signal transduction <i>via</i> transforming growth factor beta. This study tested the hypothesis that microfibril deficiencies contribute to glaucoma by investigating glaucoma phenotypes in mice known to have defective microfibrils. The results suggest that abnormal microfibrils can cause accelerated expansion of optic nerve axons, potentially resulting in increased susceptibility to pressure-induced damage.</p>

Abstract<p>Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons form the final common central output pathway controlling fertility and are regulated by steroid feedback. In females, estradiol feedback action varies between negative and positive; negative feedback typically regulates episodic GnRH release whereas positive feedback initiates a surge of GnRH, and subsequently LH, release ultimately triggering ovulation. During the estrous cycle, changes between estradiol negative and positive feedback occur with cycle stage and time of day, with positive feedback in the late afternoon of proestrus in nocturnal species. To test the hypotheses that synaptic and intrinsic properties of GnRH neurons are regulated by cycle stage and time of day, we performed whole-cell patch-clamp studies of GnRH neurons in brain slices from mice at two times considered negative feedback (diestrous PM and proestrous AM) and during positive feedback (proestrous PM). GABAergic transmission can excite GnRH neurons and was higher in cells from proestrous PM mice than cells from proestrous AM mice and approached traditional significance levels relative to cells from diestrous PM mice. Action potential response to current injection was also greater in cells from proestrous PM mice than the other two groups. Interestingly, the hormonal milieu of proestrous AM provided stronger negative feedback on both GnRH neuron excitability and GABAergic postsynaptic current amplitude than diestrous PM. These observations demonstrate elements of both synaptic and intrinsic properties of GnRH neurons are regulated in a cycle-dependent manner and provide insight into the neurobiological mechanisms underlying cyclic changes in neuroendocrine function among states of estradiol negative and positive feedback.</p><p><b>Significance statement</b> Infertility affects 15-20% of couples; failure to ovulate is a common cause. Understanding how the brain controls ovulation is critical for new developments in both infertility treatment and contraception. GnRH neurons are the final output pathway for central control of fertility and produce a signal that ultimately initiates ovulation in response to estradiol positive feedback. We studied how the reproductive cycle regulates both synaptic transmission to GnRH neurons and excitability of these cells. Both GABAergic transmission to GnRH neurons and GnRH neuron excitability are decreased during stages the estrous cycle characterized by negative feedback by gonadal steroids, compared to the late afternoon of proestrus, when positive feedback and ovulation occur.</p>

<p>Human learning is a complex process in which future behavior is altered via
the modulation of neural activity. Yet, the degree to which brain activity and
functional connectivity during learning is constrained across subjects, for
example by conserved anatomy and physiology or by the nature of the task,
remains unknown. Here, we measured brain activity and functional connectivity
in a longitudinal experiment in which healthy adult human participants learned
the values of novel objects over the course of four days. We assessed the
presence of constraints on activity and functional connectivity using an
inter-subject correlation approach. Constraints on activity and connectivity
were greater in magnitude than expected in a non-parametric permutation-based
null model, particularly in primary sensory and motor systems, as well as in
regions associated with the learning of value. Notably, inter-subject
connectivity in activity and connectivity displayed marked temporal variations,
with inter-subject correlations in activity exceeding those in connectivity
during early learning and \emph{visa versa} in later learning. Finally,
individual differences in performance accuracy tracked the degree to which a
subject's connectivity, but not activity, tracked subject-general patterns.
Taken together, our results support the notion that brain activity and
connectivity are constrained across subjects in early learning, with
constraints on activity, but not connectivity, decreasing in later learning.

<p>We developed a model of cortical computation that implements key features of
cortical circuitry and is capable of describing propagation of neural signals
between cortical locations in response to spatially distributed stimuli. The
model is based on the canonical neural circuit that consists of excitatory and
inhibitory cells interacting through reciprocal connections, with recurrent
feedback. The canonical circuit is used as a node in a distributed network with
nearest neighbor coupling between the nodes. We find that this system is
characterized by intrinsic preference for spatial frequency. The value of
preferred frequency depends on the relative weights of excitatory and
inhibitory connections between cells. This balance of excitation and inhibition
changes as stimulus contrast increases, which is why intrinsic spatial
frequency is predicted to change with contrast in a manner determined by
stimulus temporal frequency. The dynamics of network preference is consistent
with properties of the cortical area MT in alert macaque monkeys.

The development of novel therapeutics is urgently required for diseases where existing treatments are failing due to the emergence of resistance. This is particularly pertinent for parasitic infections of the tropics and sub-tropics, referred to collectively as neglected tropical diseases, where the commercial incentives to develop new drugs are weak. One such disease is schistosomiasis, a highly prevalent acute and chronic condition caused by a parasitic helminth infection, with three species of the genus <i>Schistosoma</i> infecting humans. Currently, a single 40-year old drug, praziquantel, is available to treat all infective species, but its use in mass drug administration is leading to signs of drug-resistance emerging. To meet the challenge of developing new therapeutics against this disease, we developed an innovative computational drug repurposing pipeline supported by phenotypic screening. The approach highlighted several protein kinases as interesting new biological targets for schistosomiasis as they play an essential role in many parasite’s biological processes. Focusing on this target class, we also report the first elucidation of the kinome of <i>Schistosoma japonicum</i>, as well as updated kinomes of <i>S</i>. <i>mansoni</i> and <i>S</i>. <i>haematobium</i>. In comparison with the human kinome, we explored these kinomes to identify potential targets of existing inhibitors which are unique to <i>Schistosoma</i> species, allowing us to identify novel targets and suggest approved drugs that might inhibit them. These include previously suggested schistosomicidal agents such as bosutinib, dasatinib, and imatinib as well as new inhibitors such as vandetanib, saracatinib, tideglusib, alvocidib, dinaciclib, and 22 newly identified targets such as CHK1, CDC2, WEE, PAKA, MEK1. Additionally, the primary and secondary targets in <i>Schistosoma</i> of those approved drugs are also suggested, allowing for the development of novel therapeutics against this important yet neglected disease.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/-gKKJ-Zutu0" width="1" />

<p>by Braden A. W. Brinkman, Fred Rieke, Eric Shea-Brown, Michael A. Buice</p>

A major obstacle to understanding neural coding and computation is the fact that experimental recordings typically sample only a small fraction of the neurons in a circuit. Measured neural properties are skewed by interactions between recorded neurons and the “hidden” portion of the network. To properly interpret neural data and determine how biological structure gives rise to neural circuit function, we thus need a better understanding of the relationships between measured effective neural properties and the true underlying physiological properties. Here, we focus on how the effective spatiotemporal dynamics of the synaptic interactions between neurons are reshaped by coupling to unobserved neurons. We find that the effective interactions from a pre-synaptic neuron <i>r</i>′ to a post-synaptic neuron <i>r</i> can be decomposed into a sum of the true interaction from <i>r</i>′ to <i>r</i> plus corrections from every directed path from <i>r</i>′ to <i>r</i> through unobserved neurons. Importantly, the resulting formula reveals when the hidden units have—or do not have—major effects on reshaping the interactions among observed neurons. As a particular example of interest, we derive a formula for the impact of hidden units in random networks with “strong” coupling—connection weights that scale with 1 / N, where <i>N</i> is the network size, precisely the scaling observed in recent experiments. With this quantitative relationship between measured and true interactions, we can study how network properties shape effective interactions, which properties are relevant for neural computations, and how to manipulate effective interactions.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/iD53yQ24wOw" width="1" />

We have developed an easy-to-use and memory-efficient method called PhenotypeSeeker that (a) identifies phenotype-specific k-mers, (b) generates a <i>k</i>-mer-based statistical model for predicting a given phenotype and (c) predicts the phenotype from the sequencing data of a given bacterial isolate. The method was validated on 167 <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> isolates (virulence), 200 <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> isolates (ciprofloxacin resistance) and 459 <i>Clostridium difficile</i> isolates (azithromycin resistance). The phenotype prediction models trained from these datasets obtained the F1-measure of 0.88 on the <i>K</i>. <i>pneumoniae</i> test set, 0.88 on the <i>P</i>. <i>aeruginosa</i> test set and 0.97 on the <i>C</i>. <i>difficile</i> test set. The F1-measures were the same for assembled sequences and raw sequencing data; however, building the model from assembled genomes is significantly faster. On these datasets, the model building on a mid-range Linux server takes approximately 3 to 5 hours per phenotype if assembled genomes are used and 10 hours per phenotype if raw sequencing data are used. The phenotype prediction from assembled genomes takes less than one second per isolate. Thus, PhenotypeSeeker should be well-suited for predicting phenotypes from large sequencing datasets. PhenotypeSeeker is implemented in Python programming language, is open-source software and is available at GitHub (https://github.com/bioinfo-ut/PhenotypeSeeker/).<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/lD-D2JbSrjM" width="1" />

Abstract<p>Nogo receptor-1 signaling is involved in the limitation of axonal regeneration following spinal cord injury (SCI) through collapsing the growth cone and inhibiting neurite outgrowth. Lateral olfactory tract usher substance (LOTUS), a Nogo receptor antagonist, suppresses these pathological conditions. A previous report demonstrated the positive effects of LOTUS expression on motor function through raphespinal tract regeneration using pan-neuronally LOTUS-overexpressing transgenic mice. However, this report used a hemi-section model, which does not represent the majority of clinical SCI cases, and lacked a detailed histological analysis of other descending tracts. To determine the true therapeutic effects of LOTUS, we used a more clinically relevant contusive SCI model in female transgenic mice. Definitive tracing analyses revealed that LOTUS promoted the extensive regeneration of the reticulospinal tract across the lesion site and suppressed axonal dieback of corticospinal tract (CST). A significant increase in raphespinal tract fibers was seen from the subacute to the chronic phase after the injury, strongly suggesting that LOTUS promoted translesional elongation of this tract. Furthermore, histological analyses revealed that LOTUS had a neuroprotective effect on the injured spinal cord through suppressing cellular apoptosis during the acute phase. These neuroprotective and regenerative effects contributed to significant motor functional recovery and restoration of the motor evoked potential. Therefore, LOTUS application could prove beneficial in the treatment of SCI by promoting axonal regeneration of some descending fibers, reducing axonal dieback of CST fibers and encouraging motor function recovery.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Axonal regeneration following spinal cord injury (SCI) is extremely limited due to Nogo receptor (NgR) signaling, which inhibits neurite outgrowth and collapses growth cones. Lateral olfactory tract usher substance (LOTUS), a NgR antagonist, suppresses this inhibition by NgR. Here, we evaluated the therapeutic effects of LOTUS using a clinically relevant contusive SCI model. Our data revealed that LOTUS promoted extensive translesional regeneration of the reticulospinal and raphespinal tracts and rostral regeneration of the corticospinal tract. Furthermore, LOTUS suppressed cellular apoptosis during the acute phase, and these neuroprotective and regenerative effects contributed to significant recovery of motor function and nerve conduction. Therefore, this study suggested that LOTUS could aid the treatment of SCI by promoting axonal regeneration and motor function recovery.</p>

ABSTRACT<p>Cerebral palsy (CP) is a common pediatric neurodevelopmental disorder, frequently resulting in motor and developmental deficits and often accompanied by cognitive impairments. A regular pathobiological hallmark of CP is oligodendrocyte maturation impairment resulting in white matter (WM) injury and reduced axonal myelination. Regeneration therapies based on cell replacement are currently limited, but neural precursor cells (NPCs), as cellular support for myelination, represent a promising regeneration strategy to treat CP, although the transplantation parameters (e.g. timing, dosage, mechanisms) remain to be determined.</p><p>We optimised a hemiplegic mouse model of neonatal hypoxia-ischemia that mirrors the pathobiological hallmarks of CP and transplanted NPCs into the corpus callosum (CC), a major white matter structure impacted in CP patients. The NPCs survived, engrafted and differentiated morphologically in male and female mice. Histology and MRI showed repair of lesioned structures. Furthermore, electrophysiology revealed functional myelination of the CC (e.g. restoration of conduction velocity), while Cylinder and CatWalk tests demonstrated motor recovery of the affected forelimb. Endogenous oligodendrocytes, recruited in the CC following transplantation of exogenous NPCs, are the principal actors in this recovery process.</p><p>The lack of differentiation of the transplanted NPCs is consistent with enhanced recovery due to an indirect mechanism, such as a trophic and/or a "bio-bridge" support mediated by endogenous oligodendrocytes. Our work establishes that transplantation of NPCs represents a viable therapeutic strategy for CP treatment, and that the enhanced recovery is mediated by endogenous oligodendrocytes. This will further our understanding and contribute to the improvement of cellular therapeutic strategies.</p><p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Cerebral palsy (CP) is one of the most common pediatric neurodevelopmental disorders, affecting more than 17 million people worldwide. Current treatment options for CP are largely restricted to rehabilitative approaches that alleviate and mitigate symptoms.</p>

Abstract<p>Reading literature (e.g., an entire book) is an enriching experience that qualitatively differs from reading a single sentence; however, the brain dynamics of such context-dependent memory remains unclear. This study aimed to elucidate mnemonic neural dynamics during natural reading of literature by performing electroencephalogram (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Brain activities of human participants recruited on campus were correlated with their subsequent memory, which was quantified by semantic correlation between the read text and reports subsequently written by them based on state of the art natural language processing procedures. The results of the EEG data analysis showed a significant positive relationship between subsequent memory and fixation-related EEG. Sentence-length and paragraph-length mnemonic processes were associated with N1-P2 and P3 fixation-related potential (FRP) components and fixation-related theta-band (4-8 Hz) EEG power, respectively. In contrast, the results of fMRI analysis showed a significant negative relationship between subsequent memory and blood-oxygenation-level dependent (BOLD) activation. Sentence-length and paragraph-length mnemonic processes were associated with networks of regions forming part of the salience network and the default mode network (DMN), respectively. Taken together with the EEG results, these memory-related deactivations in the salience network and the DMN were thought to reflect the reading of sentences characterized by low mnemonic load and the suppression of task-irreverent thoughts, respectively. It was suggested that the context-dependent mnemonic process during literature reading requires large-scale network deactivation, which might reflect coordination of a range of voluntary processes during reading.</p><p><b>Significance statement</b> Context-dependent memory encoding during natural reading of literature was evaluated using electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) based on a subsequent memory paradigm. Subsequent memory was quantified by semantic correlation between the read text and reports subsequently written by the participants, based on a recent natural language processing procedure. Our results demonstrated a positive correlation between subsequent memory and fixation-related EEG and a negative correlation with fMRI activity. Sentence-length and paragraph-length processes were associated with regions belonging to the salience network and the default mode network, respectively. This is the first demonstration that memory encoding during literature reading is associated with large-scale network deactivations, which might reflect the coordination of a range of voluntary processes during reading.</p>

<p>At this moment, databanks worldwide contain brain images of previously
unimaginable numbers. Combined with developments in data science, these massive
data provide the potential to better understand the genetic underpinnings of
brain diseases. However, different datasets, which are stored at different
institutions, cannot always be shared directly due to privacy and legal
concerns, thus limiting the full exploitation of big data in the study of brain
disorders. Here we propose a federated learning framework for securely
accessing and meta-analyzing any biomedical data without sharing individual
information. We illustrate our framework by investigating brain structural
relationships across diseases and clinical cohorts. The framework is first
tested on synthetic data and then applied to multi-centric, multi-database
studies including ADNI, PPMI, MIRIAD and UK Biobank, showing the potential of
the approach for further applications in distributed analysis of multi-centric
cohorts

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.08488">Beta-rhythm oscillations and synchronization transition in network models of Izhikevich neurons: effect of topology and synaptic type. (arXiv:1810.08488v1 [nlin.AO])</a></h4>

<p>Despite their significant functional roles, beta-band oscillations are least
understood. Synchronization in neuronal networks have attracted much attention
in recent years with the main focus on transition type. Whether one obtains
explosive transition or a continuous transition is an important feature of the
neuronal network which can depend on network structure as well as synaptic
types. In this study we consider the effect of synaptic interaction (electrical
and chemical) as well as structural connectivity on synchronization transition
in network models of Izhikevich neurons which spike regularly with beta
rhythms. We find a wide range of behavior including continuous transition,
explosive transition, as well as lack of global order. The stronger electrical
synapses are more conducive to synchronization and can even lead to explosive
synchronization. The key network element which determines the order of
transition is found to be the clustering coefficient and not the small world
effect, or the existence of hubs in a network. These results are in contrast to
previous results which use phase oscillator models such as the Kuramoto model.
Furthermore, we show that the patterns of synchronization changes when one goes
to the gamma band. We attribute such a change to the change in the refractory
period of Izhikevich neurons which changes significantly with frequency.

<p>Artificial neural networks that learn to perform Principal Component Analysis
(PCA) and related tasks using strictly local learning rules have been
previously derived based on the principle of similarity matching: similar pairs
of inputs should map to similar pairs of outputs. However, the operation of
these networks (and of similar networks) requires a fixed-point iteration to
determine the output corresponding to a given input, which means that dynamics
must operate on a faster time scale than the variation of the input. Further,
during these fast dynamics such networks typically "disable" learning, updating
synaptic weights only once the fixed-point iteration has been resolved. Here,
we derive a network for PCA-based dimensionality reduction that avoids this
fast fixed-point iteration. The key novelty of our approach is a modification
of the similarity matching objective to encourage near-diagonality of a
synaptic weight matrix. We then approximately invert this matrix using a Taylor
series approximation, replacing the previous fast iterations. In the offline
setting, our algorithm corresponds to a dynamical system, the stability of
which we rigorously analyze. In the online setting (i.e., with stochastic
gradients), we map our algorithm to a familiar neural network architecture and
give numerical results showing that our method converges at a competitive rate.
The computational complexity per iteration of our online algorithm is linear in
the total degrees of freedom, which is in some sense optimal.

<p>Numerous types of inhibitory neurons sculpt the performance of human neocortical circuits, with each type exhibiting a constellation of subcellular phenotypic features in support of its specialized functions. Axonal myelination has been absent among the characteristics used to distinguish inhibitory neuron types; in fact, very little is known about myelinated inhibitory axons in human neocortex. Here, using array tomography to analyze samples of neurosurgically excised human neocortex, we show that inhibitory myelinated axons originate predominantly from parvalbumin-containing interneurons. Compared to myelinated excitatory axons, they have higher neurofilament and lower microtubule content, shorter nodes of Ranvier, and more myelin basic protein (MBP) in their myelin sheath. Furthermore, these inhibitory axons have more mitochondria, likely to sustain the high energy demands of parvalbumin interneurons, as well as more 2’,3’-cyclic nucleotide 3’-phosphodiesterase (CNP), a protein enriched in the myelin cytoplasmic channels that are thought to facilitate the delivery of nutrients from ensheathing oligodendrocytes. Our results demonstrate that myelinated axons of parvalbumin inhibitory interneurons exhibit distinctive features that may support the specialized functions of this neuron type in human neocortical circuits.</p>

Abstract
<p>Rodents actively whisk their vibrissae, which, when they come in contact with surrounding objects, enables rodents to gather spatial information about the environment. Cortical motor command of whisking is crucial for the control of vibrissa movement. Using awake and head-fixed rats, we investigated the correlations between axonal projection patterns and firing properties in identified layer 5 neurons in the motor cortex, which are associated with vibrissa movement. We found that cortical neurons that sent axons to the brainstem fired preferentially during large-amplitude vibrissa movements and that corticocallosal neurons exhibited a high firing rate during small vibrissa movements or during a quiet state. The differences between these two corticofugal circuits may be related to the mechanisms of motor-associated information processing.</p>

Abstract<p>Memory formation is a protracted process that initially involves the hippocampus and becomes increasingly dependent on the cortex over time, but the mechanisms of this transfer are unclear. We recently showed that hippocampal depletion of the histone variant H2A.Z enhances both recent and remote memories, but the use of virally-mediated depletion reduced H2A.Z levels throughout testing, making its temporally-specific function unclear. Given the lack of drugs that target histone variants, we tested existing drugs for efficacy against H2A.Z, based on their targeting of known H2A.Z regulators. The Tip60 (part of H2A.Z deposition complex) inhibitor Nu9056 reduced H2A.Z binding, whereas the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor TSA increased H2A.Z acetylation without influencing total H2A.Z in cultured hippocampal neurons. Tip60 (but not HDAC) inhibition 23h after learning enhanced remote (tested at 7 days) and not recent (tested at 24 hours) contextual fear memory in mice. In contrast, Tip60 inhibition 30 days after learning impaired recall of remote memory after 1h, but protected the memory from further declining 24h later. These data provide the first evidence of a delayed post-learning role for histone variants in supporting memory transfer during systems consolidation.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Understanding the molecular basis of memory is fundamental for developing novel therapies for memory decline, but progress is impeded by the presence of multiple stages of memory formation that may involve unique molecular events. Our data identify a new time point, 24h after learning, at which H2A.Z manipulation selectively impacts remote memory without influencing recent memory. This finding advances our understanding of memory for several reasons: 1) It demonstrates that ongoing epigenetic changes exert stage-specific outcomes on memory formation, and 2) It provides the first pharmacological tool for manipulating H2A.Z binding. Moreover, we show that Tip60 influences memory through effects that involve H2A.Z, which suggests that recent studies of Tip60-mediated plasticity may include actions on this histone.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0332-18.2018v2?rss=1">p11 in cholinergic interneurons of the nucleus accumbens is essential for dopamine responses to rewarding stimuli</a></h4>

Abstract<p>A recent study showed that p11 expressed in cholinergic interneurons (CINs) of the nucleus accumbens (NAc) is a key regulator of depression-like behaviors. Dopaminergic neurons projecting to the NAc are responsible for reward-related behaviors, and their function is impaired in depression. The present study investigated the role of p11 in NAc CINs in dopamine responses to rewarding stimuli. The extracellular dopamine and acetylcholine (ACh) levels in the NAc were determined in freely moving male mice using <i>in vivo</i> microdialysis. Rewarding stimuli (cocaine, palatable food and female mouse encounter) induced an increase in dopamine efflux in the NAc of wild-type mice. The dopamine responses were attenuated (cocaine) or abolished (food and female mouse encounter) in constitutive p11 KO mice. The dopamine response to cocaine was accompanied by an increase in ACh NAc efflux, whereas the attenuated dopamine response to cocaine in p11 KO mice was restored by activation of nicotinic or muscarinic ACh receptors in the NAc. Dopamine responses to rewarding stimuli and ACh release in the NAc were attenuated in mice with deletion of p11 from cholinergic neurons (ChAT-p11 cKO mice), whereas gene delivery of p11 to CINs restored the dopamine responses. Furthermore, chemogenetic studies revealed that p11 is required for activation of CINs in response to rewarding stimuli. Thus, p11 in NAc CINs plays a critical role in activating these neurons to mediate dopamine responses to rewarding stimuli. The dysregulation of mesolimbic dopamine system by dysfunction of p11 in NAc CINs may be involved in pathogenesis of depressive states.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> p11 is a critical regulator of CIN activity as measured by the dopamine response of the mesolimbic dopamine pathway to rewarding stimuli. p11 is required for reward-mediated NAc CIN activation and induction in ACh release, resulting in the enhancement of dopamine release. The reduction of p11 expression in NAc CINs is tightly associated with anhedonia as well as other depression-like symptoms of behavioral despair. To improve therapeutic efficacy of antidepressants for anhedonia, a new type of antidepressant directly or indirectly acting on the mesolimbic dopamine pathway needs to be developed. For this purpose, therapeutic strategies that increase the function of p11 and its signaling pathway in NAc CINs may have an impact on antidepressant efficacy.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.08056">Wave to pulse generation. From oscillatory synapse to train of action potentials. (arXiv:1810.08056v1 [physics.bio-ph])</a></h4>

<p>Neurons have the capability of transforming information from a digital signal
at the dendrites of the presynaptic termi- nal to an analogous wave at the
synaptic cleft and back to a digital pulse when they achieve the required
voltage for the generation of an action potential at the postsynaptic neuron.
The main question of this research is what processes are generating the
oscillatory wave signal at the synaptic cleft and what is the best model for
this phenomenon. Here, it is proposed a model of the synapse as an oscillatory
system capable of synchronization taking into account conservation of
information and consequently of frequency at the interior of the synaptic
cleft. Trains of action potentials certainly encode and transmit information
along the nervous system but most of the time neurons are not transmitting
action potentials, 99 percent of their time neurons are in the sub threshold
regime were only small signals without the energy to emanate an action
potential are carrying the majority of information. The proposed model for a
synapse, smooths the train of action potential and keeps its frequency.
Synapses are presented here as a system composed of an input wave that is
transformed through interferometry. The collective synaptic interference
pattern of waves will reflect the points of maximum amplitude for the density
wave synaptic function were the location of the "particle" in our case action
potential, has its highest probability.

RAVEN is a commonly used MATLAB toolbox for genome-scale metabolic model (GEM) reconstruction, curation and constraint-based modelling and simulation. Here we present RAVEN Toolbox 2.0 with major enhancements, including: (i) <i>de novo</i> reconstruction of GEMs based on the MetaCyc pathway database; (ii) a redesigned KEGG-based reconstruction pipeline; (iii) convergence of reconstructions from various sources; (iv) improved performance, usability, and compatibility with the COBRA Toolbox. Capabilities of RAVEN 2.0 are here illustrated through <i>de novo</i> reconstruction of GEMs for the antibiotic-producing bacterium <i>Streptomyces coelicolor</i>. Comparison of the automated <i>de novo</i> reconstructions with the iMK1208 model, a previously published high-quality <i>S</i>. <i>coelicolor</i> GEM, exemplifies that RAVEN 2.0 can capture most of the manually curated model. The generated <i>de novo</i> reconstruction is subsequently used to curate iMK1208 resulting in Sco4, the most comprehensive GEM of <i>S</i>. <i>coelicolor</i>, with increased coverage of both primary and secondary metabolism. This increased coverage allows the use of Sco4 to predict novel genome editing targets for optimized secondary metabolites production. As such, we demonstrate that RAVEN 2.0 can be used not only for <i>de novo</i> GEM reconstruction, but also for curating existing models based on up-to-date databases. Both RAVEN 2.0 and Sco4 are distributed through GitHub to facilitate usage and further development by the community (https://github.com/SysBioChalmers/RAVEN and https://github.com/SysBioChalmers/Streptomyces_coelicolor-GEM).<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/kidUMXJNwMA" width="1" />

<p>by Song Xu, Sanggu Kim, Irvin S. Y. Chen, Tom Chou</p>

In a recent clone-tracking experiment, millions of uniquely tagged hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) were autologously transplanted into rhesus macaques and peripheral blood containing thousands of tags were sampled and sequenced over 14 years to quantify the abundance of hundreds to thousands of tags or “clones.” Two major puzzles of the data have been observed: consistent differences and massive temporal fluctuations of clone populations. The large sample-to-sample variability can lead clones to occasionally go “extinct” but “resurrect” themselves in subsequent samples. Although heterogeneity in HSC differentiation rates, potentially due to tagging, and random sampling of the animals’ blood and cellular demographic stochasticity might be invoked to explain these features, we show that random sampling cannot explain the magnitude of the temporal fluctuations. Moreover, we show through simpler <i>neutral</i> mechanistic and statistical models of hematopoiesis of tagged cells that a broad distribution in clone sizes can arise from stochastic HSC self-renewal instead of tag-induced heterogeneity. The very large clone population fluctuations that often lead to extinctions and resurrections can be naturally explained by a generation-limited proliferation constraint on the progenitor cells. This constraint leads to bursty cell population dynamics underlying the large temporal fluctuations. We analyzed experimental clone abundance data using a new statistic that counts clonal disappearances and provided least-squares estimates of two key model parameters in our model, the total HSC differentiation rate and the maximum number of progenitor-cell divisions.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/hrgk_-GnzwY" width="1" />

<p>by Dominik Wodarz, Pamela J. Skinner, David N. Levy, Elizabeth Connick</p>

Data from SIV-infected macaques indicate that virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) are mostly present in the extrafollicular (EF) compartment of the lymphoid tissue, with reduced homing to the follicular (F) site. This contributes to the majority of the virus being present in the follicle and represents a barrier to virus control. Using mathematical models, we investigate these dynamics. Two models are analyzed. The first assumes that CTL can only become stimulated and expand in the extrafollicular compartment, with migration accounting for the presence of CTL in the follicle. In the second model, follicular CTL can also undergo antigen-induced expansion. Consistent with experimental data, both models predict increased virus compartmentalization in the presence of stronger CTL responses and lower virus loads, and a more pronounced rise of extrafollicular compared to follicular virus during CD8 cell depletion experiments. The models, however, differ in other aspects. The follicular expansion model results in dynamics that promote the clearance of productive infection in the extrafollicular site, with any productively infected cells found being the result of immigration from the follicle. This is not observed in the model without follicular CTL expansion. The models further predict different consequences of introducing engineered, follicular-homing CTL, which has been proposed as a therapeutic means to improve virus control. Without follicular CTL expansion, this is predicted to result in a reduction of virus load in both compartments. The follicular CTL expansion model, however, makes the counter-intuitive prediction that addition of F-homing CTL not only results in a reduction of follicular virus load, but also in an increase in extrafollicular virus replication. These predictions remain to be experimentally tested, which will be relevant for distinguishing between models and for understanding how therapeutic introduction of F-homing CTL might impact the overall dynamics of the infection.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/xkNLNCfLeo0" width="1" />

<p>by Maximilian Schmidt, Rembrandt Bakker, Kelly Shen, Gleb Bezgin, Markus Diesmann, Sacha Jennifer van Albada</p>

Cortical activity has distinct features across scales, from the spiking statistics of individual cells to global resting-state networks. We here describe the first full-density multi-area spiking network model of cortex, using macaque visual cortex as a test system. The model represents each area by a microcircuit with area-specific architecture and features layer- and population-resolved connectivity between areas. Simulations reveal a structured asynchronous irregular ground state. In a metastable regime, the network reproduces spiking statistics from electrophysiological recordings and cortico-cortical interaction patterns in fMRI functional connectivity under resting-state conditions. Stable inter-area propagation is supported by cortico-cortical synapses that are moderately strong onto excitatory neurons and stronger onto inhibitory neurons. Causal interactions depend on both cortical structure and the dynamical state of populations. Activity propagates mainly in the feedback direction, similar to experimental results associated with visual imagery and sleep. The model unifies local and large-scale accounts of cortex, and clarifies how the detailed connectivity of cortex shapes its dynamics on multiple scales. Based on our simulations, we hypothesize that in the spontaneous condition the brain operates in a metastable regime where cortico-cortical projections target excitatory and inhibitory populations in a balanced manner that produces substantial inter-area interactions while maintaining global stability.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0swIe6iJ5Ls" width="1" />

Aging-related cognitive decline represents a critical risk factor for the development of dementia and is associated with global neurophysiological changes. It is imperative to act early, while the neural reserve is still sufficient, to prevent or postpone cognitive decline. Given that no significant modifying pharmacological intervention is available, a focus on pharmacological agents alone seems insufficient. We argue that combinations of different approaches are most effective in stimulating long-lasting molecular changes that restore, promote, and preserve cognition through the modulation of cognitively relevant neurotransmitter systems that ultimately converge in driving neurotrophic signaling.

We hypothesize that Parkinson’s disease (PD) pathogenesis can be divided into three temporal phases. During the first phase, ‘triggers’, such as viral infections or environmental toxins, spark the disease process in the brain and/or peripheral tissues. Triggers alone, however, may be insufficient, requiring ‘facilitators’ like peripheral inflammation for PD pathology to develop. Once the disease manifests, ‘aggravators’ spur further neurodegeneration and exacerbate symptoms. Aggravators are proposed to include impaired autophagy and cell-to-cell propagation of α-synuclein pathology.

<p>by Kanika Bansal, John D. Medaglia, Danielle S. Bassett, Jean M. Vettel, Sarah F. Muldoon</p>

The relationship between brain structure and function has been probed using a variety of approaches, but how the underlying structural connectivity of the human brain drives behavior is far from understood. To investigate the effect of anatomical brain organization on human task performance, we use a data-driven computational modeling approach and explore the functional effects of naturally occurring structural differences in brain networks. We construct personalized brain network models by combining anatomical connectivity estimated from diffusion spectrum imaging of individual subjects with a nonlinear model of brain dynamics. By performing computational experiments in which we measure the excitability of the global brain network and spread of synchronization following a targeted computational stimulation, we quantify how individual variation in the underlying connectivity impacts both local and global brain dynamics. We further relate the computational results to individual variability in the subjects’ performance of three language-demanding tasks both before and after transcranial magnetic stimulation to the left-inferior frontal gyrus. Our results show that task performance correlates with either local or global measures of functional activity, depending on the complexity of the task. By emphasizing differences in the underlying structural connectivity, our model serves as a powerful tool to assess individual differences in task performances, to dissociate the effect of targeted stimulation in tasks that differ in cognitive demand, and to pave the way for the development of personalized therapeutics.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Zw5QfjF3eog" width="1" />

<p>by Michael A. Skinnider, R. Greg Stacey, Leonard J. Foster</p>

Elucidating the complete network of protein-protein interactions, or interactome, is a fundamental goal of the post-genomic era, yet existing interactome maps are far from complete. To increase the throughput and resolution of interactome mapping, methods for protein-protein interaction discovery by co-migration have been introduced. However, accurate identification of interacting protein pairs within the resulting large-scale proteomic datasets is challenging. Consequently, most computational pipelines for co-migration data analysis incorporate external genomic datasets to distinguish interacting from non-interacting protein pairs. The effect of this procedure on interactome mapping is poorly understood. Here, we conduct a rigorous analysis of genomic data integration for interactome recovery across a large number of co-migration datasets, spanning diverse experimental and computational methods. We find that genomic data integration leads to an increase in the functional coherence of the resulting interactome maps, but this comes at the expense of a decrease in power to discover novel interactions. Importantly, putative novel interactions predicted by genomic data integration are no more likely to later be experimentally discovered than those predicted from co-migration data alone. Our results reveal a widespread and unappreciated limitation in a methodology that has been widely used to map the interactome of humans and model organisms.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/FgE0UzOuvEs" width="1" />

<p>by Amrit Dhar, Kristian Davidsen, Frederick A. Matsen IV, Vladimir N. Minin</p>

B cells develop high affinity receptors during the course of affinity maturation, a cyclic process of mutation and selection. At the end of affinity maturation, a number of cells sharing the same ancestor (i.e. in the same “clonal family”) are released from the germinal center; their amino acid frequency profile reflects the allowed and disallowed substitutions at each position. These clonal-family-specific frequency profiles, called “substitution profiles”, are useful for studying the course of affinity maturation as well as for antibody engineering purposes. However, most often only a single sequence is recovered from each clonal family in a sequencing experiment, making it impossible to construct a clonal-family-specific substitution profile. Given the public release of many high-quality large B cell receptor datasets, one may ask whether it is possible to use such data in a prediction model for clonal-family-specific substitution profiles. In this paper, we present the method “Substitution Profiles Using Related Families” (SPURF), a penalized tensor regression framework that integrates information from a rich assemblage of datasets to predict the clonal-family-specific substitution profile for any single input sequence. Using this framework, we show that substitution profiles from similar clonal families can be leveraged together with simulated substitution profiles and germline gene sequence information to improve prediction. We fit this model on a large public dataset and validate the robustness of our approach on two external datasets. Furthermore, we provide a command-line tool in an open-source software package (https://github.com/krdav/SPURF) implementing these ideas and providing easy prediction using our pre-fit models.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/JsZ93r65PGI" width="1" />

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/42/9105?rss=1">DMRT5, DMRT3, and EMX2 Cooperatively Repress Gsx2 at the Pallium-Subpallium Boundary to Maintain Cortical Identity in Dorsal Telencephalic Progenitors</a></h4>

<p>Specification of dorsoventral regional identity in progenitors of the developing telencephalon is a first pivotal step in the development of the cerebral cortex and basal ganglia. Previously, we demonstrated that the two zinc finger <i>doublesex</i> and <i>mab-3 related</i> (<i>Dmrt</i>) genes, <i>Dmrt5</i> (<i>Dmrta2</i>) and <i>Dmrt3</i>, which are coexpressed in high caudomedial to low rostrolateral gradients in the cerebral cortical primordium, are separately needed for normal formation of the cortical hem, hippocampus, and caudomedial neocortex. We have now addressed the role of <i>Dmrt3</i> and <i>Dmrt5</i> in controlling dorsoventral division of the telencephalon in mice of either sex by comparing the phenotypes of single knock-out (KO) with double KO embryos and by misexpressing <i>Dmrt5</i> in the ventral telencephalon. We find that DMRT3 and DMRT5 act as critical regulators of progenitor cell dorsoventral identity by repressing ventralizing regulators. Early ventral fate transcriptional regulators expressed in the dorsal lateral ganglionic eminence, such as <i>Gsx2</i>, are upregulated in the dorsal telencephalon of <i>Dmrt3;Dmrt5</i> double KO embryos and downregulated when ventral telencephalic progenitors express ectopic <i>Dmrt5</i>. Conditional overexpression of <i>Dmrt5</i> throughout the telencephalon produces gene expression and structural defects that are highly consistent with reduced GSX2 activity. Further, <i>Emx2;Dmrt5</i> double KO embryos show a phenotype similar to <i>Dmrt3;Dmrt5</i> double KO embryos, and both DMRT3, DMRT5 and the homeobox transcription factor EMX2 bind to a ventral telencephalon-specific enhancer in the <i>Gsx2</i> locus. Together, our findings uncover cooperative functions of DMRT3, DMRT5, and EMX2 in dividing dorsal from ventral in the telencephalon.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We identified the DMRT3 and DMRT5 zinc finger transcription factors as novel regulators of dorsoventral patterning in the telencephalon. Our data indicate that they have overlapping functions and compensate for one another. The double, but not the single, knock-out produces a dorsal telencephalon that is ventralized, and olfactory bulb tissue takes over most remaining cortex. Conversely, overexpressing <i>Dmrt5</i> throughout the telencephalon causes expanded expression of dorsal gene determinants and smaller olfactory bulbs. Furthermore, we show that the homeobox transcription factor EMX2 that is coexpressed with DMRT3 and DMRT5 in cortical progenitors cooperates with them to maintain dorsoventral patterning in the telencephalon. Our study suggests that DMRT3/5 function with EMX2 in positioning the pallial-subpallial boundary by antagonizing the ventral homeobox transcription factor GSX2.</p>

We propose a framework for the memory function of spindle oscillations during sleep. In this framework, memories are reinstated by spindle events, and further reprocessed during subsequent spindle refractory periods. We posit that spindle refractoriness is crucial for protecting memory reprocessing from interference. We further argue that temporally-coordinated spindle refractory periods across local networks facilitate the consolidation of rich, multimodal representations, and that localized spindle refractoriness optimizes oscillatory interactions that support systems consolidation in the sleeping brain.

<p>by Ivan Tomić, Paul M. Bays</p>

The precision with which visual information can be recalled from working memory declines as the number of items in memory increases. This finding has been explained in terms of the distribution of a limited representational resource between items. Here we investigated how the sensory strength of memoranda affects resource allocation. We manipulated signal strength of an orientation stimulus in two ways: we varied the internal (sensory) noise by adjusting stimulus contrast, and varied the external (stimulus) noise by altering the within-stimulus variability. Both manipulations had similar effects on the precision with which the orientation could be recalled, but differed in their impact on memory for other stimuli. These results indicate that increasing internal noise released resources that could be used to store other stimuli more precisely; increasing external noise had no such effect. We show that these observations can be captured by a simple neural model of working memory encoding, in which spiking activity takes on the role of the limited resource.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/532tuGBOm9M" width="1" />

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The primary visual cortex of carnivores and primates is dominated by the OFF visual pathway and responds more strongly to dark than light stimuli. Here, we demonstrate that this cortical OFF dominance is modulated by the size and spatial frequency of the stimulus in awake primates and we uncover a main neuronal mechanism underlying this modulation. We show that large grating patterns with low spatial frequencies drive five times more OFF-dominated than ON-dominated neurons, but this pronounced cortical OFF dominance is strongly reduced when the grating size decreases and the spatial frequency increases, as when the stimulus moves away from the observer. We demonstrate that the reduction in cortical OFF dominance is not caused by a selective reduction of visual responses in OFF-dominated neurons but by a change in the ON/OFF response balance of neurons with diverse receptive field properties that can be ON or OFF dominated, simple, or complex. We conclude that cortical OFF dominance is continuously adjusted by a neuronal mechanism that modulates ON/OFF response balance in multiple cortical neurons when the spatial properties of the visual stimulus change with viewing distance and/or optical blur.</span>

After injury, activation and recruitment of inflammatory and immune cells has been thought to occur throughout the whole body. A recent study shows that after brain injury in mice, immune cells are primarily recruited from nearby skull bone marrow and invade the brain through microscopic vascular channels. Manipulation of this process may provide new therapeutic options.

Converging evidence across species highlights the contribution of environmental stress to anhedonia (loss of pleasure and/or motivation). However, despite a clear link between stress and the emergence of anhedonic-like behavior in both human and animal models, the underlying biological pathways remain elusive. Here, we synthesize recent findings across multiple levels, from molecular signaling pathways through whole-brain networks, to discuss mechanisms through which stress may influence anhedonia.

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/I5VLXmddQbU/article">State dependence of stimulus-induced variability tuning in macaque MT</a></h4>

<p>by Joseph A. Lombardo, Matthew V. Macellaio, Bing Liu, Stephanie E. Palmer, Leslie C. Osborne</p>

Behavioral states marked by varying levels of arousal and attention modulate some properties of cortical responses (e.g. average firing rates or pairwise correlations), yet it is not fully understood what drives these response changes and how they might affect downstream stimulus decoding. Here we show that changes in state modulate the tuning of response variance-to-mean ratios (Fano factors) in a fashion that is neither predicted by a Poisson spiking model nor changes in the mean firing rate, with a substantial effect on stimulus discriminability. We recorded motion-sensitive neurons in middle temporal cortex (MT) in two states: alert fixation and light, opioid anesthesia. Anesthesia tended to lower average spike counts, without decreasing trial-to-trial variability compared to the alert state. Under anesthesia, within-trial fluctuations in excitability were correlated over longer time scales compared to the alert state, creating supra-Poisson Fano factors. In contrast, alert-state MT neurons have higher mean firing rates and largely sub-Poisson variability that is stimulus-dependent and cannot be explained by firing rate differences alone. The absence of such stimulus-induced variability tuning in the anesthetized state suggests different sources of variability between states. A simple model explains state-dependent shifts in the distribution of observed Fano factors via a suppression in the variance of gain fluctuations in the alert state. A population model with stimulus-induced variability tuning and behaviorally constrained information-limiting correlations explores the potential enhancement in stimulus discriminability by the cortical population in the alert state.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/I5VLXmddQbU" width="1" />

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Cajal-Retzius (CR) cells are one of the earliest populations of neurons in the cerebral cortex of rodents and primates, and they play a critical role in corticogenesis and cortical lamination during neocortical development. However, a comprehensive morphological and physiological profile of CR cells in the mouse neocortex has not yet been established. Here, we systematically investigated the dynamic development of CR cells in Tg(Ebf2-EGFP)58Gsat/Mmcd mice. The morphological complexity, membrane activities and presynaptic inputs of CR cells coordinately increase and reach a plateau at P5–P9 before regressing. Using 3D reconstruction, we delineated a parallel-stratification pattern of the axonal extension of CR cells. Furthermore, we found that the morphological structure and presynaptic inputs of CR cells were disturbed in Reelin-deficient mice. These findings confirm that CR cells undergo a transient maturation process in layer 1 before disappearing. Importantly, Reelin deficiency impairs the formation of synaptic connections onto CR cells. In conclusion, our results provide insights into the rapid maturation and axonal stratification of CR cells in layer 1. These findings suggest that both the electrophysiological activities and the morphology of CR cells provide vital guidance for the modulation of early circuits, in a Reelin-dependent manner.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Individual differences in humans are driven by unique brain structural and functional profiles, presumably mediated in part through differential cortical gene expression. However, the relationships between cortical gene expression profiles and individual differences in large-scale neural network organization remain poorly understood. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether the magnitude of sequence alterations in regional cortical genes mapped onto brain areas with high degree of functional connectivity variability across individuals. First, human genetic expression data from the Allen Brain Atlas was used to identify protein-coding genes associated with cortical areas, which delineated the regional genetic signature of specific cortical areas based on sequence alteration profiles. Thereafter, we identified brain regions that manifested high degrees of individual variability by using test-retest functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging and graph-theory analyses in healthy subjects. We found that rates of genetic <span style="font-style: italic;">sequence alterations</span> shared a distinct spatial topography with cortical regions exhibiting individualized (highly-variable) connectivity profiles. Interestingly, gene expression profiles of brain regions with highly individualized connectivity patterns and elevated number of sequence alterations are devoted to <span style="font-style: italic;">neuropeptide-signaling-pathways</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">chemical-synaptic-transmission</span>. Our findings support that genetic <span style="font-style: italic;">sequence alterations</span> may underlie important aspects of brain connectome individualities in humans.Significance Statement: The neurobiological underpinnings of our individuality as humans are still an unsolved question. Although the notion that genetic variation drives an individual’s brain organization has been previously postulated, specific links between neural connectivity and gene expression profiles have remained elusive. In this study, we identified the magnitude of population-based sequence alterations in discrete cortical regions and compared them to the brain topological distribution of functional connectivity variability across an independent human sample. We discovered that brain regions with high degree of connectional individuality are defined by increased rates of genetic sequence alterations; these findings specifically implicated genes involved in <span style="font-style: italic;">neuropeptide-signaling pathways</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">chemical-synaptic transmission</span>. These observations support that genetic <span style="font-style: italic;">sequence alterations</span> may underlie important aspects of the emergence of the brain individuality across humans.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Sparse representation is considered an important coding strategy for cortical processing in various sensory modalities. It remains unclear how cortical sparseness arises and is being regulated. Here, unbiased recordings from primary auditory cortex of awake adult mice revealed salient sparseness in layer (L)2/3, with a majority of excitatory neurons exhibiting no increased spiking in response to each of sound types tested. Sparse representation was not observed in parvalbumin (PV) inhibitory neurons. The nonresponding neurons did receive auditory-evoked synaptic inputs, marked by weaker excitation and lower excitation/inhibition (E/I) ratios than responding cells. Sparse representation arises during development in an experience-dependent manner, accompanied by differential changes of excitatory input strength and a transition from unimodal to bimodal distribution of E/I ratios. Sparseness level could be reduced by suppressing PV or L1 inhibitory neurons. Thus, sparse representation may be dynamically regulated via modulating E/I balance, optimizing cortical representation of the external sensory world.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Neural stem cells (NSCs) in the adult mouse hippocampus occur in a specific neurogenic niche, where a multitude of extracellular signaling molecules converges to regulate NSC proliferation as well as fate and functional integration. However, the underlying mechanisms how NSCs react to extrinsic signals and convert them to intracellular responses still remains elusive. NSCs contain a functional endocannabinoid system, including the cannabinoid type-1 receptor (CB1). To decipher whether CB1 regulates adult neurogenesis directly or indirectly <span style="font-style: italic;">in vivo</span>, we performed NSC-specific conditional inactivation of CB1 by using triple-transgenic mice. Here, we show that lack of CB1 in NSCs is sufficient to decrease proliferation of the stem cell pool, which consequently leads to a reduction in the number of newborn neurons. Furthermore, neuronal differentiation was compromised at the level of dendritic maturation pointing towards a postsynaptic role of CB1 <span style="font-style: italic;">in vivo</span>. Deteriorated neurogenesis in NSC-specific CB1 knock-outs additionally resulted in reduced long-term potentiation in the hippocampal formation. The observed cellular and physiological alterations led to decreased short-term spatial memory and increased depression-like behavior. These results demonstrate that CB1 expressed in NSCs and their progeny controls neurogenesis in adult mice to regulate the NSC stem cell pool, dendritic morphology, activity-dependent plasticity, and behavior.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>With increasing attention on the developmental causes of neuropsychiatric disorders, appropriate animal models are crucial to identifying causes and assessing potential interventions. The common marmoset is an ideal model as it has sophisticated social/emotional behavior, reaching adulthood within 2 years of birth. Magnetic resonance imaging was used in an accelerated longitudinal cohort (<span style="font-style: italic;">n</span> = 41; aged 3–27 months; scanned 2–7 times over 2 years). Splines were used to model nonlinear trajectories of grey matter volume development in 53 cortical areas and 16 subcortical nuclei. Generally, volumes increased before puberty, peaked, and declined into adulthood. We identified 3 milestones of grey matter development: I) age at peak volume; II) age at onset of volume decline; and III) age at maximum rate of volume decline. These milestones differentiated growth trajectories of primary sensory/motor cortical areas from those of association cortex but also revealed distinct trajectories between association cortices. Cluster analysis of trajectories showed that prefrontal cortex was the most heterogenous of association regions, comprising areas with distinct milestones and developmental trajectories. These results highlight the potential of high-field structural MRI to define the dynamics of primate brain development and importantly to identify when specific prefrontal circuits may be most vulnerable to environmental impact.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Aberrant regulation and activity of synaptic proteins may cause synaptic pathology in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of mood disorder patients. Carboxy-terminal PDZ ligand of NOS1 (CAPON) is a critical scaffold protein linked to synaptic proteins like nitric oxide synthase 1, synapsins. We hypothesized that CAPON is altered together with its interacting synaptic proteins in the PFC in mood disorder patients and may contribute to depression-like behaviors in mice subjected to chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS). Here, we found that CAPON-immunoreactivity (ir) was significantly increased in the dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC) and anterior cingulate cortex in major depressive disorder (MDD), which was accompanied by an upregulation of spinophilin-ir and a downregulation of synapsin-ir. The increases in CAPON and spinophilin and the decrease in synapsin in the DLPFC of MDD patients were also seen in the PFC of CUMS mice. CAPON-ir positively correlated with spinophilin-ir (but not with synapsin-ir) in mood disorder patients. CAPON colocalized with spinophilin in the DLPFC of MDD patients and interacted with spinophilin in human brain. Viral-mediated CAPON downregulation in the medial PFC notably reversed the depression-like behaviors in the CUMS mice. These data suggest that CAPON may contribute to aspects of depressive behavior, possibly as an interacting protein for spinophilin in the PFC.</span>
