              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Data-driven causal analysis of observational biological time series</a></h4>

              
                Complex systems are challenging to understand, especially when they defy manipulative experiments for practical or ethical reasons. Several fields have developed parallel approaches to infer causal relations from observational time series. Yet, these methods are easy to misunderstand and often controversial. Here, we provide an accessible and critical review of three statistical causal discovery approaches (pairwise correlation, Granger causality, and state space reconstruction), using examples inspired by ecological processes. For each approach, we ask what it tests for, what causal statement it might imply, and when it could lead us astray. We devise new ways of visualizing key concepts, describe some novel pathologies of existing methods, and point out how so-called ‘model-free’ causality tests are not assumption-free. We hope that our synthesis will facilitate thoughtful application of methods, promote communication across different fields, and encourage explicit statements of assumptions. A video walkthrough is available (Video 1 or <a href="https://youtu.be/AIV0ttQrjK8">https://youtu.be/AIV0ttQrjK8</a>).

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Multiscale Computer Modeling of Spreading Depolarization in Brain Slices</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Spreading depolarization (SD) is a slow-moving wave of neuronal depolarization accompanied by a breakdown of ion concentration homeostasis, followed by long periods of neuronal silence (spreading depression), and is associated with several neurologic conditions. We developed multiscale (ions to tissue slice) computer models of SD in brain slices using the NEURON simulator: 36,000 neurons (two voltage-gated ion channels; three leak channels; three ion exchangers/pumps) in the extracellular space (ECS) of a slice (1 mm sides, varying thicknesses) with ion (K<sup>+</sup>, Cl<sup>&ndash;</sup>, Na<sup>+</sup>) and O<SUB>2</SUB> diffusion and equilibration with a surrounding bath. Glia and neurons cleared K<sup>+</sup> from the ECS via Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> pumps. SD propagated through the slices at realistic speeds of 2&ndash;4 mm/min, which increased by as much as 50% in models incorporating the effects of hypoxia or propionate. In both cases, the speedup was mediated principally by ECS shrinkage. Our model allows us to make testable predictions, including the following: (1) SD can be inhibited by enlarging ECS volume; (2) SD velocity will be greater in areas with greater neuronal density, total neuronal volume, or larger/more dendrites; (3) SD is all-or-none: initiating K<sup>+</sup> bolus properties have little impact on SD speed; (4) Slice thickness influences SD because of relative hypoxia in the slice core, exacerbated by SD in a pathologic cycle; and (5) SD and high neuronal spike rates will be observed in the core of the slice. Cells in the periphery of the slice near an oxygenated bath will resist SD.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">TMS Does Not Increase BOLD Activity at the Site of Stimulation: A Review of All Concurrent TMS-fMRI Studies</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is widely used for understanding brain function in neurologically intact subjects and for the treatment of various disorders. However, the precise neurophysiological effects of TMS at the site of stimulation remain poorly understood. The local effects of TMS can be studied using concurrent TMS-functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), a technique where TMS is delivered during fMRI scanning. However, although concurrent TMS-fMRI was developed over 20 years ago and dozens of studies have used this technique, there is still no consensus on whether TMS increases blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) activity at the site of stimulation. To address this question, here we review all previous concurrent TMS-fMRI studies that reported analyses of BOLD activity at the target location. We find evidence that TMS increases local BOLD activity when stimulating the primary motor (M1) and visual (V1) cortices but that these effects are likely driven by the downstream consequences of TMS (finger twitches and phosphenes). However, TMS does not appear to increase BOLD activity at the site of stimulation for areas outside of the M1 and V1 when conducted at rest. We examine the possible reasons for such lack of BOLD signal increase based on recent work in nonhuman animals. We argue that the current evidence points to TMS inducing periods of increased and decreased neuronal firing that mostly cancel each other out and therefore lead to no change in the overall BOLD signal.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">New Subregions of the Mouse Entopeduncular Nucleus Defined by the Complementary Immunoreactivities for Substance P and Cannabinoid Type-1 Receptor Combined with Distributions of Different Neuronal Types</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The entopeduncular nucleus (EPN) and substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) constitute the output nuclei of the basal ganglia, but studies on the EPN are limited compared with those on the SNr. Both nuclei receive projections from the striatum with axons containing substance P (SP) and cannabinoid type-1 receptor (CB1R), and immunoreactivities for these substances show complementary patterns in the striatum and SNr. In this study, we revealed a similar complementarity in the mouse EPN, combined it with region-specific neuronal distributions, and defined subregions of the EPN. First, the EPN was divided into two areas, one showing low SP and high CB1R (lSP/hCB1R) immunoreactivities, and the other showing high SP and low CB1R (hSP/lCB1R). The former received inputs from the dorsolateral striatum that are innervated by sensorimotor cortices, whereas the latter received inputs from the medial striatum that are innervated by limbic/association cortices. Then, the lSP/hCB1R area was further divided into the dorsolateral subregion in the rostral EPN and the core subregion in the caudal EPN, the latter characterized by the concentration of parvalbumin-positive neurons targeting the ventral anterior&ndash;ventral lateral thalamic nucleus. The hSP/lCB1R area was divided into the ventromedial subregion in the rostral EPN and the shell subregion in the caudal EPN, the former characterized by the concentration of nitric oxide synthase-positive neurons targeting the lateral habenula (LHb). Somatostatin-positive neurons targeting the LHb were located diffusely in three subregions other than the core. These findings illuminate structural organization inside the basal ganglia, suggesting mechanisms for sorting diverse information through parallel loops with differing synaptic modulation by CB1R.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Studies on the ethnopharmacology, antimicrobial activity, and toxicity of Catha edulis (Vahl.) Endl., in Sprague Dawley rats [version 2; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The Mbeere South community of Embu County consume leaves of Catha edulis for its stimulant and euphoretic actions. Other indigenous uses of the plant are undocumented. Information on the pharmacology and safety of this plant is also scanty. This study aimed to document the ethnopharmacology, antimicrobial properties, and toxicity of C. edulis leaves collected from the Mbeere South community in Kenya. Methods: Ethnopharmacological data was collected from 35 informants using semi-structured questionnaires. Leaf extracts of C. edulis were prepared using acetone, water, and methanol. The antimicrobial properties of these extracts were evaluated against Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Candida albicans. The toxicity of the aqueous extract was determined using hematological, biochemical, and histopathological parameters in male and female Sprague Dawley rats at 250 mg/kg, 500 mg/kg, and 1000 mg/kg doses over 28 days. p<0.05 was considered significant. Results: All informants were male, most were married, >50 years old, with >10 years of experience. The sources, local names, preparation, storage conditions, indications, frequency of use, dosage, and side effects of C. edulis were documented. All extracts were ineffective against E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and C. albicans. They had limited efficacy against B. cereus and S. aureus. Significant differences were observed in the hematological and biochemical parameters of rats at the tested doses. Low, intermediate, and high doses of the aqueous extract of C. edulis produced local congestion of the cardiac and hepatic vessels. Localized interstitial connective tissue proliferation, multifocal kidney interstitial hemorrhage, and localized tubular epithelium necrosis were also observed in female rats. Conclusions: The ethnobotanical uses of C. edulis among the Mbeere South community were documented for the first time. Limited antimicrobial efficacy and toxicity at high doses limit the use of leaves of C. edulis.

                Vaccines have played a central role in dealing with COVID-19 pandemic. Now regulatory agencies in USA and around the world have begun approving vaccination for kids. Long term safety profile of live attenuated viral vaccines, inactivated viral vaccines and peptide-based vaccines are well studied in children, are safe and can play a central role in controlling the spread of COVID19 in children. But the long-term safety profile of viral vector-based vaccines is not studied. In the present correspondence we highlight the possibility of random insertional mutagenesis and potential side effects, which might be evident after long-term.  Regulators must take into consideration the possibility of insertional mutagenesis and conduct long term studies before approving the viral vector vaccines in children, so that the public have trust in the regulatory agencies and are compliant towards vaccinating their children with safe and effective vaccines.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: A rare presentation of prostate cancer with peritoneal carcinomatosis and malignant ascites complicated by tumor lysis syndrome [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Only 32 cases of prostate cancer with peritoneal carcinomatosis and ascites have currently been reported in the literature. We present the first reported case of prostate cancer with peritoneal carcinomatosis and malignant ascites whose treatment was complicated by tumor lysis syndrome along with a literature review evaluating similar cases. Case: We present a rare case of a 78-year-old retired Caucasian male with recurrent metastatic prostate cancer and malignant ascites. He had previously received definitive radiotherapy for localized prostate cancer but presented with bilateral hydronephrosis and right-sided bladder wall thickening 10 years later. He had imaging evidence of locoregional recurrence with elevated prostate specific antigen (PSA) and was initiated on combined androgen blockade with intramuscular leuprolide and oral bicalutamide. After being transferred to Scripps Clinic, he was found to have a solitary right upper lobe pulmonary lesion for which he completed stereotactic body radiation therapy. Then, 10 months later, he developed new onset malignant ascites and was treated with two cycles of intravenous docetaxel. Treatment resulted in improvement in his ascites and reduction in PSA. Unfortunately, his course was complicated by tumor lysis syndrome, encephalopathy, Escherichia coli bacteremia, and a fatal saddle pulmonary embolism. Conclusions: (1) Occurrence of ascites in prostate cancer patients is associated with worse prognosis than non-ascitic variants. (2) More common etiologies of ascites must be evaluated for. (3) Ascitic fluid prostate specific antigen (PSA) measurement may aid in diagnosis of malignant ascites in cases with diagnostic uncertainty. (4) Patients with advanced disease may benefit from combined hormonal and cytotoxic therapies. (5) Awareness of the occurrence of tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) in patients treated for prostate cancer can help identify patients in whom prophylaxis would be beneficial.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The influence of strategic innovation management on firm innovation performance in the Indonesian mid-size telecommunication industry [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The telecommunication industry was one of the Indonesian government's priorities in the national development plan 2015-2035. “Primary Industry” was the term for the priority industries with the central role as the prime mover in the future national economy. Various natural, human, technological, innovative, and creative resources were imperative in supporting the underlining national industry development plan. Strategic innovation management refers to the entire sequence of innovation practices, including competition mechanism analysis, such as creating an innovative vision, business strategy alignment, disseminating strategy at an entire organizational level, market tendency, technology, and competitor’s action. Firm innovation performance refers to the measurement of innovation efficiency (the number of new products, product novelty, new product development speed, and new product success rate) and innovation profitability (new product revenue proportion, quality enhancement, cost reduction, and value improvement) conducted by the firm. This study investigates the effect of Innovation Strategy, Organizational Structure, Innovation Culture, Technological Capability, and Customer-Supplier Relationship (these were the practice of Strategic Innovation Management mentioned in various literature) on Firm Innovation Performance.  Methods: A quantitative method, from a practical perspective, was employed to investigate the causal relationship between strategic innovation management and firm innovation performance. Data was gathered through a validated and reliable questionnaire disseminated to 90 respondents. It included a representative from the four sub-sectors of the telecommunication industry, namely fixed networks, wireless networks, telecommunication services, and special telecommunication.  Results: The survey found that firms within the telecommunication industry already employed Strategic Innovation Management practices. Moreover, this study also found that Innovation Culture, Technological Capability, and Customer-Suppler Relationship significantly influence Firm Innovation Performance.  Conclusion:   The implementation of Strategic Innovation Management in the mid-size companies within Indonesia's telecommunication industry appears to be relatively high. It indicates that firms within the industry were able to strategically compete by implementing Strategic Innovation Management.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Does online mindfulness-based intervention help college students succeed in their job search during the COVID-19 pandemic? [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Immediately after graduation from university, college students need to make significant decisions about starting their careers or pursuing higher studies. They are also pressured to meet the expectations and demands of self, others, and the environment. Owing to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the aforementioned challenging decisions may become hazardous stressors for college students. Hence, the researchers intended to assist and assess the college students involved in student placements. The research goal was to investigate the impact of mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) on the stress and self-esteem of college students involved in student placements.  Methods: One hundred college students participating in the campus placements were selected using purposive sampling from Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham University in Coimbatore, India. For evaluation purposes, college students were administered the perceived stress, Rosenberg self-esteem, and Kuppuswamy socio-economic scales. Seventy-five college students were selected for the MBI process and were administered with a pre-intervention and post-intervention without a control group research design. Results: Statistical analysis including analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the Bonferroni post hoc test showed a significant increase in self-esteem and a decrease in the stress of the college students involved in placements. Conclusions: Thus, the researchers recommend that policymakers create awareness, include MBI in the curriculum, and allocate funds for training ventures in educational institutions to assist college students in their challenging life journeys

                Background: The prevalence of depression is higher among women in the general population. While previous studies have contributed to demonstrating a higher risk of depression among women, there is a scarcity of studies on depression issues among women who experienced life as a spouse to drug addicts. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the association between parental stress faced in raising children and depression. Moreover, the study intended to examine the impact of parental stress on depression as mediated by resilience. Methods: Using the purposive sampling method, a total of 132 B40 wives of drug addicts were chosen to participate in this study. Data were collected from six states in Malaysia using a structured questionnaire consisting of the Parental Stress Scale (PSS), Brief Resilience Scale (BRS), and Zung’s Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS). SmartPLS software version 3.3.7 was used to analyze the data collected. Results: Path analysis revealed that parental stress was significantly associated with depression through resilience. Specifically, the indirect effect highlighted that resilience was a partial mediator in the association between parental stress and depression. Nevertheless, it is also shown that even after accounting for the mediating role of resilience, parental stress still has a positive impact on depression. Conclusions: The present study proffers additional strategies to drug addicts’ wives, advocates, academicians, practitioners, and policymakers to approach depression issues in this community for better well-being.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Habitat loss exacerbates pathogen spread: An Agent-based model of avian influenza infection in migratory waterfowl</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Shenglai Yin, Yanjie Xu, Mingshuai Xu, Mart C. M. de Jong, Mees R. S. Huisman, Andrea Contina, Herbert H. T. Prins, Zheng Y. X. Huang, Willem F. de Boer</p>

Habitat availability determines the distribution of migratory waterfowl along their flyway, which further influences the transmission and spatial spread of avian influenza viruses (AIVs). The extensive habitat loss in the East Asian-Australasian Flyway (EAAF) may have potentially altered the virus spread and transmission, but those consequences are rarely studied. We constructed 6 fall migration networks that differed in their level of habitat loss, wherein an increase in habitat loss resulted in smaller networks with fewer sites and links. We integrated an agent-based model and a susceptible-infected-recovered model to simulate waterfowl migration and AIV transmission. We found that extensive habitat loss in the EAAF can 1) relocate the outbreaks northwards, responding to the distribution changes of wintering waterfowl geese, 2) increase the outbreak risk in remaining sites due to larger goose congregations, and 3) facilitate AIV transmission in the migratory population. In addition, our modeling output was in line with the predictions from the concept of “migratory escape”, i.e., the migration allows the geese to “escape” from the location where infection risk is high, affecting the pattern of infection prevalence in the waterfowl population. Our modeling shed light on the potential consequences of habitat loss in spreading and transmitting AIV at the flyway scale and suggested the driving mechanisms behind these effects, indicating the importance of conservation in changing spatial and temporal patterns of AIV outbreaks.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Network modeling of dynamic brain interactions predicts emergence of neural information that supports human cognitive behavior</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Ravi D. Mill, Julia L. Hamilton, Emily C. Winfield, Nicole Lalta, Richard H. Chen, Michael W. Cole</p>

How cognitive task behavior is generated by brain network interactions is a central question in neuroscience. Answering this question calls for the development of novel analysis tools that can firstly capture neural signatures of task information with high spatial and temporal precision (the “where and when”) and then allow for empirical testing of alternative network models of brain function that link information to behavior (the “how”). We outline a novel network modeling approach suited to this purpose that is applied to noninvasive functional neuroimaging data in humans. We first dynamically decoded the spatiotemporal signatures of task information in the human brain by combining MRI-individualized source electroencephalography (EEG) with multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA). A newly developed network modeling approach—dynamic activity flow modeling—then simulated the flow of task-evoked activity over more causally interpretable (relative to standard functional connectivity [FC] approaches) resting-state functional connections (dynamic, lagged, direct, and directional). We demonstrate the utility of this modeling approach by applying it to elucidate network processes underlying sensory–motor information flow in the brain, revealing accurate predictions of empirical response information dynamics underlying behavior. Extending the model toward simulating network lesions suggested a role for the cognitive control networks (CCNs) as primary drivers of response information flow, transitioning from early dorsal attention network-dominated sensory-to-response transformation to later collaborative CCN engagement during response selection. These results demonstrate the utility of the dynamic activity flow modeling approach in identifying the generative network processes underlying neurocognitive phenomena.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Community-level dietary intake of sodium, potassium, and sodium-to-potassium ratio as a global public health problem: a systematic review and meta-analysis [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Widespread adoption of a westernized diet represents a major lifestyle change characterized by substantially higher sodium consumption and lower potassium intake, which is related to cardiovascular morbidity. Methods: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis over published studies in accordance with quantifying the dietary intake of sodium and potassium of the universal population across the world. The PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar databases were used to find research that pronounced 24-hour urinary sodium or potassium excretion (reference period: 2014–2021). The effect size was estimated using the fixed-effect model; sub-group analysis become accomplished to determine urinary sodium and potassium excretion disaggregated by geographical location. Publication bias became evaluated the usage of graphical funnel plot. Data analysis was performed using STATA 16. Results: Forty-three studies (n= 62,940) qualified the selection criteria. The mean urinary excretion of sodium and potassium was 156.73 mmol/24h [95% confidence interval (CI), 148.98–164.47] and 48.89 mmol/24 h (95% CI, 43.61–54.17), respectively; the mean urinary sodium/potassium ratio was 3.68 (95% CI, 2.96–4.40). Conclusions: This updated systematic review highlights excessively high dietary intake of sodium and low intake of potassium at the community level in most parts of the world. The urinary Na/K ratio exceeded the level recommended by the WHO guidelines.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Peccary, a metaprogramming open-source R platform to improve pharmacometrics efficiency [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: A pharmacometrics (PMx) workflow usually requires several software tools to cover all the steps from data analysis to model evaluation and simulations. However, these tools do not always communicate well together, compromising the efficiency of the whole process. Highly inspired by the markdown/pandoc system, we developed Peccary, an R package and its dedicated Shiny Application with the objective to accelerate the use of previously released R packages through various translation and metaprogramming processes.  Methods: Peccary was developed with an agile method, progressively aggregating snippets of R code produced during real-life pharmacometrics works.  Its first subpackage, PeccAnalysis, can be used to produce and evaluate various R code for population description (using table1 package), plot exploration (ggplot) and non-compartment analysis (pknca). The second subpackage, PeccaReverse, allows writing a structural model using a minimalist (simplified deSolve) syntax, before metaprogramming model simulations (using either deSolve or RxODE) and design evaluation (through PopED), along with performing various model syntax translations (e.g., into NONMEM, Monolix or nlmixr files). Finally, the third subpackage, PeccaResult, standardizes run outputs of several PMx software (NONMEM, Monolix, Adapt, nlmixr) to perform various diagnostic evaluation tasks.  Results: The metaprogramming system used in PeccAnalysis and PeccaReverse has many advantages. First, it simplifies the use of previously mentioned packages (by reducing the required knowledge and the time needed to program the output creation). Second, it creates links between independent tools (for instance using the same inputs for several tasks). Third, the produced R code can be reviewed for eventual manual modification, verification (quality control) or traceable report integration.  Conclusion: Overall, Peccary was successful in improving PMx efficiency by providing a Shiny R platform that can produce various outputs during live meetings while keeping the possibility to extract Peccary-independent R source code for further in-depth control.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The effect of betel habits on blood glucose levels in the Karo ethnic community, Karo district [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Betel habit is a hereditary tradition from the ancestors of the Batak-Karo tribe, Indonesia. Karo people believe that betel habit is their unifier. The betel process begins with concocting a mixture of ingredients such as betel leaf, lime, gambier, areca nut, and with/ without tobacco addition, then chewed slowly. Our previous study showed that gambier extracts (Uncaria gambier Roxb), can reduce blood glucose levels(BGL) in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)patients. This study aimed to analyze whether the habit of chewing betel can affect BGL in the Karo ethnic community in the Karo district. Methods: In total, 48 participants from the Karo community were divided into 4 groups (n=12 per group), namely: I. non-T2DM participants without betel habits; II. non-T2DM participants with betel habit; III. T2DM participants without betel habit and IV. T2DM participants with betel habit. The sampling technique was consecutive sampling. Data were collected by interviews and blood sampling (fasting and 2 hours postprandial (2hPP)). The collected data analyzed by paired t-test, Independent sample t-test, Wilcoxon, and Mann-Whitney with a significance level of p-value <0.05. Results: This study showed that fasting BGL condition in group-I compared to group II (84.33±12.32 vs 81.00±4.84) mg/dl and group-III compared to group-IV (196.25±104.81 vs 150.00±42.45) mg/dl had no significant difference. Also, the BGL of 2hPP condition in group-I compared to group-II (111.25 ±22.62 vs 108.33±18.99) mg/dl, and group-III compared to group-IV (314.92±128.97 vs 229.25±58.26) mg/dl, in statistically there was no difference (p>0.05). Although the data showed that group-III was higher than group-IV. Conclusions: This study concludes that with/without betel habits affect blood sugar levels in type 2 diabetes subjects (Groups III and IV).

                Up to 25% of patients with long COVID experience persistent night sweats. However, in most cases they remain untreated until they disappear on their own. Since SARS-CoV-2 is known to disrupt glucose homeostasis, we hypothesized that impaired mitochondria would result in faster glycogen depletion at night due to reduced ATP production yield, inducing adrenaline production ultimately leading to the onset of persistent night sweats. To test our hypothesis we investigated whether incorporating carbohydrates into the diet of three non-diabetic patients with long COVID before bedtime would have any effect decreasing their night sweats. Remarkably, after one week with the dietary intervention, the patients reported that their night sweats had completely disappeared. Therefore, we propose carbohydrate supplementation as an affordable solution for night sweats in long COVID patients.

                Background: Tuberculosis (TB) and diabetes mellitus (DM) co-morbidity is one of the rising public health problems. There is growing evidence that DM is an important risk factor for TB. This study was carried out to know the prevalence of DM among newly detected sputum positive pulmonary TB patients registered in District Tuberculosis Centre and to assess the risk factors of DM among TB patients. Methods: In a cross-sectional study, newly detected sputum positive pulmonary TB patients were screened for DM (those having symptoms of DM). Furthermore, they were diagnosed by detecting blood glucose levels (≥200 mg/dL). Mean, standard deviation (SD), Chi-squared and Fisher-Freeman-Halton exact tests were used to determine the significant associations. P-values less than 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. Results: A total of 215 TB patients were included in this study. The prevalence of DM among TB patients was found to be 23.7% (2.8% known and 97.8% new cases). Significant associations were found between age (>46 years old), educational status, smoking habits, alcohol consumption, physical activity, presence of DM symptoms and family history of DM. Conclusions: Routine screening for DM is mandatory due to its increasing prevalence, which may help in early diagnosis and to reduce complications by proper management that in turn helps in the successful outcome of TB treatment.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">How mission-driven policies challenge traditional research funding systems [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                For decades, public research funding systems have operated with the dual objectives of fostering research excellence on the one side and research contributing to innovation and growth on the other. These two objectives have to a large extent been pursued and institutionalized separately. Recently, a third objective has become increasingly prominent: to orient public research towards societal challenges through missions. This paper stresses that a precondition for achieving this new objective is successful coordination across the whole value chain of research and a more integrated and holistic approach to the design and implementation of funding policies. So far, limited attention has been paid to the risk that such coordination may be in conflict with dominant rationales underlying the current design of funding systems. In this study, we examine the challenges associated with the institutionalization of this emerging objective from both a theoretical and an empirical perspective. The theoretical analysis builds on historical institutionalism and argues that a partial conversion of the funding system as a whole is necessary for the new rationale to succeed. The empirical analysis focuses on two different national settings, the Danish and the Norwegian, and highlights challenges and tensions experienced by funding bodies responsible for operationalizing mission-driven research funding instruments, based on interviews with experts and key funding actors. We conclude that the key institutions in both national systems are attempting to adjust to the increasing political focus on missions through layering rather than processes of conversion, which we argue is necessary for funding organizations to successfully implement mission-driven policies. Finally, implications for the success of mission-driven policies are discussed.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Medial temporal lobe (MTL) atrophy is a core feature of age-related cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease (AD). While regional volumes and thickness are often used as a proxy for neurodegeneration, they lack the sensitivity to serve as an accurate diagnostic test and indicate advanced neurodegeneration. Here, we used a submillimeter resolution diffusion weighted MRI sequence (ZOOMit) to quantify microstructural properties of hippocampal subfields in older adults (63–98 years old) using tensor derived measures: fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD). We demonstrate that the high-resolution sequence, and not a standard resolution sequence, identifies dissociable profiles for CA1, dentate gyrus (DG), and the collateral sulcus. Using ZOOMit, we show that advanced age is associated with increased MD of the CA1 and DG as well as decreased FA of the DG. Increased MD of the DG, reflecting decreased cellular density, mediated the relationship between age and word list recall. Further, increased MD in the DG, but not DG volume, was linked to worse spatial pattern separation. Our results demonstrate that ultrahigh-resolution diffusion imaging enables the detection of microstructural differences in hippocampal subfield integrity and will lead to novel insights into the mechanisms of age-related memory loss.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The hippocampal formation is essential for spatial navigation and episodic memory. The anatomical structure is largely similar across mammalian species, apart from the deep polymorphic layer of the dentate gyrus and the adjacent part of cornu ammonis 3 (CA3) which feature substantial variations. In rodents, the polymorphic layer has a triangular cross-section abutting on the end of the CA3 pyramidal layer, while in primates it is long and band-shaped capping the expanded CA3 end, which here lacks a distinct pyramidal layer. This structural variation has resulted in a confusing nomenclature and unclear anatomical criteria for the definition of the dentate-ammonic border. Seeking to clarify the border, we present here a light microscopic investigation based on Golgi-impregnated and Timm–thionin-stained sections of the Artiodactyla sheep and domestic pig, in which the dentate gyrus and CA3 end have some topographical features in common with primates. In short, the band-shaped polymorphic layer coincides with the Timm-positive mossy fiber collateral plexus and the Timm-negative subgranular zone. While the soma and excrescence-covered proximal dendrites of the mossy cells are localized within the plexus, the peripheral mossy cell dendrites extend outside the plexus, both into the granular and molecular layers, and the CA3. The main mossy fibers leave the collateral plexus in a scattered formation to converge gradually through the CA3 end in between the dispersed pyramidal cells, which are of three subtypes, as in monkey, with the classical apical subtype dominating near the hidden blade, the nonapical subtype near the exposed blade, and the dentate subtype being the only pyramidal cells that extend dendrites into the dentate gyrus. In agreement with our previous study in mink, the findings show that the border between the dentate gyrus and the CA3 end can be more accurately localized by the mossy fiber system than by cyto-architecture alone.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Learning shifts the preferred theta phase of gamma oscillations in CA1</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Hippocampal neuronal oscillations reflect different cognitive processes and can therefore be used to dissect the role of hippocampal subfields in learning and memory. In particular, it has been suggested that encoding and retrieval is associated with slow gamma (25–55 Hz) and fast gamma (60–100 Hz) oscillations, respectively, which appear in a nested manner at specific phases of the ongoing theta oscillations (4–12 Hz). However, the relationship between memory demand and the theta phase of gamma oscillations remains unclear. Here, we assessed the theta phase preference of gamma oscillations in the CA1 region, at the starting and junction zones of a T-maze, while rats were learning an appetitive task. We found that the theta phase preference of slow gamma showed a ~180° phase shift when animals switched from novice to skilled performance during task acquisition. This phase-shift was not present at the junction zone, where animals chose a right or left turn within the T-maze, suggesting that a recall/decision process had already taken place at the starting zone. Our findings indicate that slow gamma oscillations support both encoding and retrieval, depending on the theta phase at which they occur. These properties are particularly evident prior to cognitive engagement in an acquired spatial task.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Assessing mild cognitive impairment using object‐location memory in immersive virtual environments</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Pathological changes in the medial temporal lobe (MTL) are found in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and aging. The earliest pathological accumulation of tau colocalizes with the areas of the MTL involved in object processing as part of a wider anterolateral network. Here, we sought to assess the diagnostic potential of memory for object locations in iVR environments in individuals at high risk of AD dementia (amnestic mild cognitive impairment [aMCI] <i>n</i> = 23) as compared to age-related cognitive decline. Consistent with our primary hypothesis that early AD would be associated with impaired object location, aMCI patients exhibited impaired spatial feature binding. Compared to both older (<i>n</i> = 24) and younger (<i>n</i> = 53) controls, aMCI patients, recalled object locations with significantly less accuracy (<i>p</i> &lt; .001), with a trend toward an impaired identification of the object's correct context (<i>p</i> = .05). Importantly, these findings were not explained by deficits in object recognition (<i>p</i> = .6). These deficits differentiated aMCI from controls with greater accuracy (AUC = 0.89) than the standard neuropsychological tests. Within the aMCI group, 16 had CSF biomarkers indicative of their likely AD status (MCI+ <i>n</i> = 9 vs. MCI− <i>n</i> = 7). MCI+ showed lower accuracy in the object-context association than MCI− (<i>p</i> = .03) suggesting a selective deficit in object-context binding postulated to be associated with anterior-temporal areas. MRI volumetric analysis across healthy older participants and aMCI revealed that test performance positively correlates with lateral entorhinal cortex volumes (<i>p</i> &lt; .05) and hippocampus volumes (<i>p</i> &lt; .01), consistent with their hypothesized role in binding contextual and spatial information with object identity. Our results indicate that tests relying on the anterolateral object processing stream, and in particular requiring successful binding of an object with spatial information, may aid detection of pre-dementia AD due to the underlying early spread of tau pathology.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Prefrontal and hippocampal theta rhythm show anxiolytic‐like changes during periaqueductal‐elicited “panic” in rats</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Anxiety and panic are both elicited by threat and co-occur clinically. But, at the neural level, anxiety appears to inhibit the generation of panic; and vice versa. Anxiety and panic are thought to engage more anterior (a) and mid-posterior (m) parts of the periaqueductal gray (PAG), respectively. Anxiety also engages the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex. Here, we tested if mPAG but not aPAG stimulation would suppress prefrontal and hippocampal theta rhythm as do anxiolytic drugs. Twelve male rats with implanted electrodes were stimulated alternately (30 s interval) in the left PAG or right reticular formation (reticularis pontis oralis [RPO]—as a positive control) with recording in the left prelimbic cortex and left and right hippocampus. PAG stimulation was set to produce freezing and RPO to produce 7–8 Hz theta rhythm before tests lasting 10 min on each of 5 days. mPAG stimulation decreased, and aPAG increased, theta power at all sites during elicited freezing. mPAG, but not aPAG, stimulation decreased prefrontal theta frequency. Stimulation did not substantially change circuit dynamics (pairwise phase consistency and partial directed coherence). Together with previous reports, our data suggest that panic- and anxiety-control systems are mutually inhibitory, and neural separation of anxiety and panic extends down to the aPAG and mPAG, respectively. Our findings are consistent with recent proposals that fear and anxiety are controlled by parallel neural hierarchies extending from PAG to the prefrontal cortex.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">Glycine-bound NMDA receptors are stretch-activated</a></h4>

              
                In a recent study, Belin et al. demonstrated that glycine-bound NMDA receptors can be activated by mechanical forces in the absence of the neurotransmitter glutamate. The stretch-gated receptor exhibits biophysical properties similar to those of glutamate-gated receptors. These findings reveal that glycine-bound NMDA receptors could behave as mechanosensors in central nervous system (CNS) physiology.

                This review by Zeinelden et al. discusses the origin of neuroblastoma from the developing sympathoadrenal lineage. The authors argue that neuroblastoma is a disease of arrested differentiation and describe how tumor cell heterogeneity reflects underlying developmental mechanisms.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Artificially stimulating retrotransposon activity increases mortality and accelerates a subset of aging phenotypes in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Transposable elements (TE) are mobile sequences of DNA that can become transcriptionally active as an animal ages. Whether TE activity is simply a byproduct of heterochromatin breakdown or can contribute towards the aging process is not known. Here we place the TE <i>gypsy</i> under the control of the UAS GAL4 system to model TE activation during aging. We find that increased TE activity shortens the lifespan of male<i> D. melanogaster</i>. The effect is only apparent in middle aged animals. The increase in mortality is not seen in young animals. An intact reverse transcriptase is necessary for the decrease in lifespan implicating a DNA mediated process in the effect. The decline in lifespan in the active <i>gypsy</i> flies is accompanied by the acceleration of a subset of aging phenotypes. TE activity increases sensitivity to oxidative stress and promotes a decline in circadian rhythmicity. The overexpression of the Forkhead-box O family (FOXO) stress response transcription factor can partially rescue the detrimental effects of increased TE activity on lifespan. Our results provide evidence that active TEs can behave as effectors in the aging process and suggest a potential novel role for dFOXO in its promotion of longevity in <i>D. melanogaster</i>.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Double NPY motifs at the N-terminus of the yeast t-SNARE Sso2 synergistically bind Sec3 to promote membrane fusion</a></h4>

              
                Exocytosis is an active vesicle trafficking process by which eukaryotes secrete materials to the extracellular environment and insert membrane proteins into the plasma membrane. The final step of exocytosis in yeast involves the assembly of two t-SNAREs, Sso1/2 and Sec9, with the v-SNARE, Snc1/2, on secretory vesicles. The rate-limiting step in this process is the formation of a binary complex of the two t-SNAREs. Despite a previous report of acceleration of binary complex assembly by Sec3, it remains unknown how Sso2 is efficiently recruited to the vesicle-docking site marked by Sec3. Here we report a crystal structure of the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of Sec3 in complex with a nearly full-length version of Sso2 lacking only its C-terminal transmembrane helix. The structure shows a previously uncharacterized binding site for Sec3 at the N-terminus of Sso2, consisting of two highly conserved triple residue motifs (NPY: Asn-Pro-Tyr). We further reveal that the two NPY motifs bind Sec3 synergistically, which together with the previously reported binding interface constitute dual-site interactions between Sso2 and Sec3 to drive the fusion of secretory vesicles at target sites on the plasma membrane.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Structure of Mycobacterium tuberculosis Cya, an evolutionary ancestor of the mammalian membrane adenylyl cyclases</a></h4>

              
                <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> adenylyl cyclase (AC) Rv1625c / Cya is an evolutionary ancestor of the mammalian membrane ACs and a model system for studies of their structure and function. Although the vital role of ACs in cellular signaling is well established, the function of their transmembrane (TM) regions remains unknown. Here we describe the cryo-EM structure of Cya bound to a stabilizing nanobody at 3.6 Å resolution. The TM helices 1-5 form a structurally conserved domain that facilitates the assembly of the helical and catalytic domains. The TM region contains discrete pockets accessible from the extracellular and cytosolic side of the membrane. Neutralization of the negatively charged extracellular pocket Ex1 destabilizes the cytosolic helical domain and reduces the catalytic activity of the enzyme. The TM domain acts as a functional component of Cya, guiding the assembly of the catalytic domain and providing the means for direct regulation of catalytic activity in response to extracellular ligands.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Audiovisual task switching rapidly modulates sound encoding in mouse auditory cortex</a></h4>

              
                In everyday behavior, sensory systems are in constant competition for attentional resources, but the cellular and circuit-level mechanisms of modality-selective attention remain largely uninvestigated. We conducted translaminar recordings in mouse auditory cortex (AC) during an audiovisual (AV) attention shifting task. Attending to sound elements in an AV stream reduced both pre-stimulus and stimulus-evoked spiking activity, primarily in deep layer neurons and neurons without spectrotemporal tuning. Despite reduced spiking, stimulus decoder accuracy was preserved, suggesting improved sound encoding efficiency. Similarly, task-irrelevant mapping stimuli during intertrial intervals evoked fewer spikes without impairing stimulus encoding, indicating that attentional modulation generalized beyond training stimuli. Importantly, spiking reductions predicted trial-to-trial behavioral accuracy during auditory attention, but not visual attention. Together, these findings suggest auditory attention facilitates sound discrimination by filtering sound-irrelevant background activity in AC, and that the deepest cortical layers serve as a hub for integrating extramodal contextual information.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Supraorbital whiskers act as wind-antennae in rat anemotaxis</a></h4>

              
                We know little about mammalian anemotaxis, wind-sensing. Recently, however, Hartmann and colleagues showed whisker-based anemotaxis in rats. This groundbreaking study prompted us to investigate how rat whiskers sense airflow. To this end, we tracked whisker tips in anesthetized or cadaver rats under no (shielded) airflow, low (ambient) airflow and high (fan-blowing) airflow conditions. Whisker tips showed little movement under no airflow conditions and all whisker tips moved during high airflow. Low airflow conditions, most similar to naturally occurring wind stimuli, engaged whisker tips differentially. While most facial whiskers showed little movement, long supraorbital, , A1, {beta}, and {gamma} whiskers showed strong movements, with long supraorbital whisker showing maximal displacements in low airflow. We mapped the cortical representation of the long supraorbital whiskers and found wind-sensitive-whisker barrels cluster in the posterolateral barrel map. Interestingly, the long supraorbital whisker differs from other whiskers in its exposed dorsal position, upward bending, length and thin diameter. Ex vivo extracted long supraorbital whiskers also showed exceptional airflow displacements, suggesting whisker-intrinsic biomechanics endow the supraorbital whisker with unique airflow sensitivity. To study the behavioral significance of whisker airflow responses we developed an airflow-sensing paradigm. We found that rats spontaneously turn towards weak (hand-flap) and strong (cardboard-flap) airflow stimuli in complete darkness. We then found selective trimming of wind-responsive whiskers diminished airflow turning responses more than trimming of non-wind-responsive whiskers. Lidocaine injections targeted to supraorbital whisker follicles also diminished airflow turning responses compared to control injections. We conclude that supraorbital whiskers act as wind antennae.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Mitochondrial decline in the ageing old world primate retina: little evidence for difference between the centre and periphery</a></h4>

              
                Mitochondrial decline is a key feature of ageing. The retina has more mitochondria than any other tissue and ages rapidly. To understand human retinal ageing it is critical to examine old world primates that have similar visual systems to humans, and do so across central and peripheral regions, as there is evidence for early central decline. Hence, we examine mitochondrial metrics in young and ageing Macaca fascicularis retinae. In spite of reduced ATP with age, primate mitochondrial complex activity did not decline. But mitochondrial membrane potentials were reduced significantly, and concomitantly, mitochondrial membrane permeability increased. The mitochondrial marker Tom20 declined significantly, consistent with reduced mitochondria number, while VDAC, a voltage dependent anion channel and diffusion pore associated with apoptosis increased significantly. In spite of these clear age-related changes, there was almost no evidence for regional differences between the centre and the periphery. Primate cones do not die with age, but many showed marked structural decline with vacuous spaces in proximal inner segments normally occupied by endoplasmic reticulum (ER), that regulate mitochondrial autophagy. In many peripheral cones, ER was displaced by the nucleus that transposed across the outer limiting membrane and could become embedded in mitochondrial populations. These data are consistent with significant changes in retinal mitochondria in old world primate ageing but provide little if any evidence that aged central mitochondria suffer more than those in the periphery.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Modeling the development of cortical responses in primate dorsal (where) pathway to optic flow using hierarchical neural field models</a></h4>

              
                Although there is a plethora of modelling literature dedicated to the object recognition processes of the ventral (what) pathway of primate visual systems, modelling studies on the motion sensitive regions like the Medial superior temporal area (MST) of the dorsal (where) pathway are relatively scarce. Neurons in the MST area of the macaque monkey respond selectively to different types of optic flow sequences such as radial and rotational flows. We present three models that are designed to simulate the computation of optic flow performed by the MST neurons in primates. The first two models are each composed of 3 stages: the first stage comprises the Direction Selective Mosaic Network (DSMN), the second stage comprises the Cell Plane Network (CPNW) or the Hebbian Network (HBNW) and the third stage comprises the optic flow network (OF). The three stages roughly correspond to V1-MT-MST areas respectively in the primate motion pathway. Both these models are trained stage by stage using a biologically plausible variation of Hebbian learning. On the other hand, model-3 consists of the Velocity Selective Mosaic Network (VSMN) followed by a convolutional neural network (CNN) which is trained using supervised backpropagation algorithm. We created various dot configurations that can move in translational, radial, and rotational trajectories to make training and test set. The simulation results show that, while neurons in model-1 and model-2 could account for MSTd cell properties found neurobiologically, model-3 neuron responses are consistent with the idea of functional hierarchy in the macaque motion pathway. These results also suggest that the deep learning models could offer a computationally elegant and biologically plausible solution to simulate the development of cortical responses of the primate motion pathway.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural sequences in primate prefrontal cortex encode working memory in naturalistic environments</a></h4>

              
                Working memory is the ability to briefly remember and manipulate information after it becomes unavailable to the senses. The mechanisms supporting working memory coding in the primate brain remain controversial. Here we demonstrate that microcircuits in layers 2/3 of the primate lateral prefrontal cortex dynamically represent memory content in a naturalistic task through sequential activation of single neurons. We simultaneously recorded the activity of hundreds of neurons in the lateral prefrontal cortex of macaque monkeys during a naturalistic visuospatial working memory task set in a virtual environment. We found that the sequential activation of single neurons encoded trajectories to target locations held in working memory. Neural sequences were not a mere successive activation of cells with memory fields at specific spatial locations, but an abstract representation of the subject's trajectory to the target. Neural sequences were less correlated to target trajectories during perception and were not found during working memory tasks lacking the spatiotemporal structure of the naturalistic task. Finally, ketamine administration distorted neural sequences, selectively decreasing working memory performance. Our results indicate that neurons in the lateral prefrontal cortex causally encode working memory in naturalistic conditions via complex and temporally precise activation patterns.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A Double Dissociation between Savings and Long-Term Memory in Motor Learning</a></h4>

              
                Both declarative and procedural memories are easier to reacquire than learn from scratch. This advantage, known as savings, has been widely assumed to result from the reemergence of stable long-term memories. In fact, the presence of savings has often been used as a marker for whether a memory had been consolidated. However, recent findings have demonstrated that motor learning rates can be systematically controlled, providing a mechanistic alternative to the reemergence of a stable long-term memory, and recent work has reported conflicting results about whether implicit contributions to savings in motor learning are present, absent, or inverted, suggesting a limited understanding of the underlying mechanisms. In order to elucidate the mechanism responsible for savings in motor learning, we investigate the relationship between savings and longterm memory by determining how they depend on different components of motor learning. To accomplish this, we experimentally dissect motor adaptation based on short-term (1-minute) temporal persistence. Surprisingly, we find that a temporally-volatile component of implicit learning leads to savings whereas temporally-persistent learning does not, but that temporally-persistent learning leads to long-term memory at 24 hours whereas temporally-volatile learning does not. Moreover, we find that temporally-persistent implicit learning not only fails to contribute to savings, but that it produces an anti-savings which acts to reduce the net savings, and we show that the balance between temporally-volatile and temporally-persistent components can explain seemingly inconsistent reports about implicit savings. The clear double dissociation between the mechanisms for savings and long-term memory formation challenges widespread assumptions about the connection between savings and memory consolidation, and provides new insight into the mechanisms for motor learning.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Navigating Multiple Environments with Emergent Grid Cell Remapping</a></h4>

              
                When animals encounter a new environment, their cells with spatially modulated activity such as place cells and grid cells remap. Grid cells are particular in their remapping in that populations coherently remap as observed in spacing, orientation and phase changes. This process points to generality in grid cell activity that forms a standard computation across environments, which many speculate is path integration. Recently, normative artificial neural network models have shown that path integration and grid-cell-like activity can be obtained in recurrent neural networks (RNN) trained to navigate in a simulated two-dimensional environment. Remarkably, the emergent spatial profile of these grid-like cells is similar to biological cell responses in that they set up a toroidal structure. However, these models have not yet been tested in multiple environments relative to biological remapping. In this work, we extend the RNN normative model to multiple environments, modelled with place cell global remapping. Through this perturbation, we show (i) that the model can navigate multiple environments, (ii) that putative grid cells remain biologically plausible, (iii) a mechanism of how grid cells may remap, and (iv) a discussion on generalisation with inertial navigation in the grid and place cell network.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Distinct roles of forward and backward alpha-band waves in spatial visual attention</a></h4>

              
                Previous research has associated alpha-band [8-12Hz] oscillations with inhibitory functions (Klimesch et al., 2007; Jensen and Mazaheri, 2010): for instance, several studies showed that visual attention increases alpha-band power in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the attended location (Thut et al., 2006; Handel et al., 2011). However, other studies demonstrated that alpha oscillations positively correlate with visual perception (Busch et al., 2009; Vanrullen and MacDonald, 2012), hinting at different processes underlying their dynamics. Here, using an approach based on traveling waves, we demonstrate that there are two functionally distinct alpha-band oscillations propagating in different directions. We analyzed EEG recordings from two datasets of human participants (N=32, both genders) performing a covert visual attention task. Participants were instructed to detect a brief target by covertly attending to the screen's left or right side. Our analysis reveals two distinct processes: allocating attention to one hemifield increases top-down alpha-band waves propagating from frontal to occipital regions ipsilateral to the attended location, both with or without visual stimulation. These top-down oscillatory waves correlate positively with alpha-band power in frontal and occipital regions. Yet, different alpha-band waves propagate from occipital to frontal regions and contralateral to the attended location. Crucially, these forward waves were present only during visual stimulation, suggesting a separate mechanism related to visual processing. Together, these results reveal two distinct processes reflected by different propagation directions, demonstrating the importance of considering oscillations as traveling waves when characterizing their functional role.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Independent synaptic inputs to motor neurons driving antagonist muscles</a></h4>

              
                The CNS may produce the same endpoint trajectory or torque profile with different muscle activation patterns. What differentiates these patterns is the presence of co-contraction, which does not contribute to joint torque generation but allows to modulate mechanical impedance. Whether co-contraction is controlled through the same synaptic input to motor neurons involved in generating joint torque is still unclear. We hypothesized that co-contraction is controlled through a specific synaptic input, independent from that underlying the control of torque. To test this hypothesis, we asked participants to concurrently generate multi-directional isometric forces at the hand and to modulate the co-contraction of arm muscles to displace and stabilize a virtual end-effector. The firings of motor units were identified through decomposition of High-Density EMGs collected from two antagonist muscles, Biceps Brachii and Triceps Brachii. We found significant peaks in the coherence between the neural drive to the two muscles, suggesting the existence of a common input modulating co-contraction across different exerted forces. Moreover, the within-muscle coherence computed after removing the component synchronized with the drive to the antagonist muscle or with the exerted force revealed two subsets of motor neurons that were selectively recruited to generate joint torque or modulate co-contraction. This study is the first to directly investigate the extent of shared versus independent control of antagonist muscles at the motor neuron level in a task involving concurrent force generation and modulation of co-contraction.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural similarity between overlapping events at learning differentially affects reinstatement across the cortex</a></h4>

              
                Episodic memory often involves high overlap between the actors, locations, and objects of everyday events. Under some circumstances, it may be beneficial to distinguish, or differentiate, neural representations of similar events to avoid interference at recall. Alternatively, forming overlapping representations of similar events, or integration, may aid recall by linking shared information between memories. It is currently unclear how the brain supports these seemingly conflicting functions of differentiation and integration. We used multivoxel pattern similarity analysis (MVPA) of fMRI data and neural-network analysis of visual similarity to examine how highly overlapping naturalistic events are encoded in patterns of cortical activity, and how the degree of differentiation versus integration at encoding affects later retrieval. Participants performed an episodic memory task in which they learned and recalled naturalistic video stimuli with high feature overlap. Visually similar videos were encoded in overlapping patterns of neural activity in temporal, parietal, and occipital regions, suggesting integration. We further found that encoding processes differentially predicted later reinstatement across the cortex. In visual processing regions in occipital cortex, greater differentiation at encoding predicted later reinstatement. Higher-level sensory processing regions in temporal and parietal lobes showed the opposite pattern, whereby highly integrated stimuli showed greater reinstatement. Moreover, integration in high-level sensory processing regions during encoding predicted greater accuracy and vividness at recall. These findings provide novel evidence that encoding-related differentiation and integration processes across the cortex have divergent effects on later recall of highly similar naturalistic events.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Saccades are coordinated with directed circuit dynamics and stable but distinct hippocampal patterns that promote memory formation</a></h4>

              
                During natural viewing, humans explore their environment by moving the eyes - a process that involves saccades to guide attention and shape memory. Saccades are controlled by visuo-oculomotor regions and are known to impact medial temporal lobe processing, but the circuit dynamics in humans are unclear. Here, we asked which of the functional routes between the visual cortex, frontal eye fields, and the hippocampus facilitates memory encoding during visual exploration and whether saccades affect neural representations. Forty-eight human participants underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and continuous monitoring of eye gaze while studying scenes and performing a recognition memory test thereafter. We discovered saccade-related excitatory coupling from the visual cortex and frontal eye fields towards the hippocampus, independent of memory. This was complemented by hippocampal inhibition of the visual cortex that determined whether participants would later remember or forget. Moreover, saccades were associated with overall stable but distinct hippocampal voxel patterns during memory formation and the degree of pattern distinctiveness positively scaled with inhibition along the hippocampus-to-visual cortex route. This suggests that eye movements are timed to the orchestration of circuit connectivity and neural representations, setting the stage for memory formation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Uncovering brain tissue architecture across scales with super-resolution light microscopy</a></h4>

              
                Mapping the complex and dense arrangement of cells and their connectivity in brain tissue demands nanoscale spatial resolution imaging. Super-resolution optical microscopy excels at visualizing specific molecules and individual cells but fails to provide tissue context. Here we developed Comprehensive Analysis of Tissues across Scales (CATS), a technology to densely map brain tissue architecture from millimeter regional to nanoscopic synaptic scales in diverse chemically fixed brain preparations, including rodent and human. CATS leverages fixation-compatible extracellular labeling and advanced optical readout, in particular stimulated-emission depletion and expansion microscopy, to comprehensively delineate cellular structures. It enables 3D-reconstructing single synapses and mapping synaptic connectivity by identification and tailored analysis of putative synaptic cleft regions. Applying CATS to the hippocampal mossy fiber circuitry, we demonstrate its power to reveal the system's molecularly informed ultrastructure across spatial scales and assess local connectivity by reconstructing and quantifying the synaptic input and output structure of identified neurons.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A PATHWAY FOR T3 SIGNALING IN THE BRAIN TO IMPROVE THE VARIABLE EFFECTIVENESS OF THERAPY WITH L-T4</a></h4>

              
                The effectiveness of therapy for hypothyroidism with levothyroxine (L-T4) depends on patient's ability to activate T4 to T3; altered in carriers of a common deiodinase polymorphism (Thr92Ala-DIO2). Some patients that exhibit impaired mood and cognition improve with liothyronine (L-T3), but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Here we show that the T3-indicator mouse carrying the Thr92Ala-DIO2 polymorphism exhibits a hippocampal-specific reduction in T3 activation and signaling that limits the effectiveness of L-T4 therapy. To understand the L-T3 effect, we used a compartmentalized microfluid device and identified a novel neuronal pathway of T3 transport and action that involves axonal T3 uptake into clathrin-dependent, endosomal/non-degradative lysosomes (NDLs). NDLs-containing T3 are retrogradely transported via microtubules, delivering relatively large amounts of T3 to the cell nucleus, doubling the expression of the T3-responsive reporter gene. The NDLs also contain the monocarboxylate transporter 8 (Mct8) and the type 3 deiodinase (Dio3), which transports and inactivates T3, respectively. Notwithstanding, T3 gets away from degradation because D3 active center is in the cytosol. These findings provide (i) a basis for the variable effectiveness of L-T4 therapy, (ii) a pathway for L-T3 to reach neurons, and (iii) resolve the paradox of T3 signaling in the brain amid high D3 activity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Timing of Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation at M1 Does Not Affect Motor Sequence Learning</a></h4>

              
                Administering anodal tDCS at the primary motor cortex (M1) at various temporal loci relative to motor training is reported to affect subsequent performance gains. Stimulation administered in conjunction with motor training appears to offer the most robust benefit that emerges during offline epochs. This conclusion is made, however, based on between-experiment comparisons that involved varied methodologies. The present experiment addressed this shortcoming by administering the same 15-minute dose of anodal tDCS at M1 before, during, or after practice of a serial reaction time task (SRTT). It was anticipated that exogenous stimulation during practice with a novel SRTT would facilitate offline gains. Ninety participants were randomly assigned to one of four groups: tDCS before practice, tDCS during practice, tDCS after practice, or no tDCS. Each participant was exposed to 15 minutes of 2 mA of tDCS and motor training of an eight-element SRTT. The anode was placed at right M1 with the cathode at left M1, and the left hand was used to execute the SRTT. Test blocks were administered 1 and 24 hours after practice concluded. The results revealed significant offline gain for all conditions at the 1-hour and 24-hour test blocks. Importantly, exposure to anodal tDCS at M1 at any point before, during, or after motor training failed to change the trajectory of skill development as compared to the no stimulation control condition. These data add to the growing body of evidence questioning the efficacy of exogenous stimulation as an adjunct to motor training for fostering skill learning.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Arrestin-3 agonism at D3 dopamine receptors defines a subclass of second generation antipsychotics that promotes drug tolerance</a></h4>

              
                Second generation antipsychotics (SGAs) are front-line treatments for serious mental illness. Often, individual patients benefit only from some SGAs and not others. The mechanisms underlying this unpredictability in treatment efficacy remain unclear. All SGAs bind the D3 dopamine receptor (D3R) and are traditionally considered antagonists for dopamine receptor signaling. Here, we report that some clinically important SGAs function as arrestin-3 agonists at D3R, resulting in modulation of calcium channels localized to the site of action potential initiation in prefrontal cortex pyramidal neurons. We further show that chronic treatment with an arrestin-3 agonist-SGA, but not an antagonist-SGA, abolishes D3R function through post-endocytic receptor degradation by G-protein coupled receptor-associated sorting protein-1 (GASP1). These results implicate D3R-arrestin-3 signaling as a source of SGA variability, highlighting the importance of including arrestin-3 signaling in characterizations of drug action. Furthermore, they suggest that post-endocytic receptor trafficking that occurs during chronic SGA treatment may contribute to treatment efficacy.

                The olfactory bulb is known to carry out computations for the olfactory perception of concentration invariance of odor recognition, a perception that is essential for life as we know it. However it is not known whether these computations require the extensive feedback to the bulb from the many brain regions which send this feedback. We have measured the concentration dependence of the mitral cell output of the bulb before and after blocking this feedback by lidocaine infusion into the medial olfactory peduncle. Surprisingly we found that the concentration dependence of the mitral cell output was unaffected by the lidocaine block of feedback. Furthermore the computation is rapid; it is complete within a single 250 msec inhalation. The computations for concentration invariance are most likely carried out within the olfactory bulb itself and they are carried out quickly.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Loss of LRP1 in adult neural stem cells impairs migration to ischemic lesions</a></h4>

              
                After ischemia, cells in the brain parenchyma upregulate stromal derived factor 1 (SDF1), driving chemokine receptor CXCR4-mediated migration of adult neural stem cells from the subventricular zone (SVZ) to the ischemic injury. We discovered a novel regulator of CXCR4 in neural stem cells, low-density lipoprotein receptor related protein 1 (LRP1). We employed a tamoxifen-inducible Nestin-Cre to drive expression of a tdTomato reporter and also knockout floxed LRP1 in adult mice and then subjected mice to middle-cerebral artery occlusion. Examination 2 weeks post-stroke reveals a loss of tdTomato positive cells localizing from the SVZ to the lesion. We show that loss of LRP1 disrupts CXCR4-mediated neural stem cell migration in vitro, which is likely driven by LRP1-mediated loss of CXCR4 expression in vivo. Altogether, our results suggest that LRP1 is a novel regulator of CXCR4 in neural stem cells.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A tradeoff between acoustic and linguistic feature encoding in spoken language comprehension</a></h4>

              
                When we comprehend language from speech, the phase of the neural response aligns with particular features of the speech input, resulting in a phenomenon referred to as neural tracking. In recent years, a large body of work has demonstrated the tracking of the acoustic envelope and abstract linguistic units at the phoneme and word levels, and beyond. However, the degree to which speech tracking is driven by acoustic edges of the signal, or by internally-generated linguistic units, or by the interplay of both, remains contentious. In this study, we used naturalistic story-listening to investigate (1) whether phoneme-level features are tracked over and above acoustic edges, (2) whether word entropy, which can reflect sentence- and discourse-level constraints, impacted the encoding of acoustic and phoneme-level features, and (3) whether the tracking of acoustic edges was enhanced or suppressed during comprehension of a first language (Dutch) compared to a statistically-familiar but uncomprehended language (French). We first show that encoding models with phoneme-level linguistic features, in addition to acoustic features, uncovered an increased neural tracking response; this signal was further amplified in a comprehended language, putatively reflecting the transformation of acoustic features into internally-generated phoneme-level representations. Phonemes were tracked more strongly in a comprehended language, suggesting that language comprehension functions as a neural filter over acoustic edges of the speech signal as it transforms sensory signals into abstract linguistic units. We then show that word entropy enhances neural tracking of both acoustic and phonemic features when sentence- and discourse-context are less constraining. When language was not comprehended, acoustic features, but not phonemic ones, were more strongly modulated, but in contrast, when a first language is comprehended, phoneme features are more strongly modulated. Taken together, our findings highlight the flexible modulation of acoustic, and phonemic features by sentence and discourse-level constraint in language comprehension, and document the neural transformation from speech perception to language comprehension, consistent with an account of language processing as a neural filter from sensory to abstract representations.

	<p>The auditory phantom sensation of tinnitus is associated with neural hyperactivity. Modulating this hyperactivity using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has shown beneficial effects in human studies. Previously, we investigated rTMS in a tinnitus animal model and showed that rTMS over prefrontal cortex (PFC) attenuated tinnitus soon after treatment, likely via indirect effects on auditory pathways. Here, we explored the duration of these beneficial effects. Acoustic trauma was used to induce hearing loss and tinnitus in guinea pigs. Once tinnitus developed, high-frequency (20 Hz), high-intensity rTMS was applied over PFC for two weeks (weekdays only; 10 min/day). Behavioral signs of tinnitus were monitored for 6 weeks after treatment ended. Tinnitus developed in 77% of animals between 13 and 60 days post-trauma. rTMS treatment significantly reduced the signs of tinnitus at 1 week on a group level, but individual responses varied greatly at week 2 until week 6. Three (33%) of the animals showed the attenuation of tinnitus for the full 6 weeks, 45% for 1&amp;amp;ndash;4 weeks and 22% were non-responders. This study provides further support for the efficacy of high-frequency repetitive stimulation over the PFC as a therapeutic tool for tinnitus, but also highlights individual variation observed in human studies.</p>

	<p>High-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) has been shown to play an important role in improving consciousness in patients with disorders of consciousness (DOCs), but its neuroelectrophysiological evidence is still lacking. To better explain the electrophysiological mechanisms of the effects of HD-tDCS on patients with DOCs, 22 DOC patients underwent 10 anodal HD-tDCS sessions of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). This study used the Coma Recovery Scale-Revised (CRS-R) to assess the level of consciousness in DOC patients. According to whether the CRS-R score increased before and after stimulation, DOC patients were divided into a responsive group and a non-responsive group. By comparing the differences in resting-state EEG functional connectivity between different frequency bands and brain regions, as well as the relationship between functional connectivity values and clinical scores, the electrophysiological mechanism of the clinical effects of HD-tDCS was further explored. The change of the phase locking value (PLV) on the theta frequency band in the left frontal&amp;amp;ndash;parietooccipital region was positively correlated with the change in the CRS-R scores. As the number of interventions increased, we observed that in the responsive group, the change in PLV showed an upward trend, and the increase in the PLV appeared in the left frontal&amp;amp;ndash;parietooccipital region at 4&amp;amp;ndash;8 Hz and in the intra-bifrontal region at 8&amp;amp;ndash;13 Hz. In the non-responsive group, although the CRS-R scores did not change after stimulation, the PLV showed a downward trend, and the decrease in the PLV appeared in the intra-bifrontal region at 8&amp;amp;ndash;13 Hz. In addition, at the three-month follow-up, patients with increased PLV in the intra-bifrontal region at 8&amp;amp;ndash;13 Hz after repeated HD-tDCS stimulation had better outcomes than those without. Repeated anodal stimulation of the left DLPFC with HD-tDCS resulted in improved consciousness in some patients with DOCs. The increase in functional connectivity in the brain regions may be associated with the improvement of related awareness after HD-tDCS and may be a predictor of better long-term outcomes.</p>

	<p>The purpose of the work was to investigate whether electroacupuncture (EA) could ameliorate migraine central sensitization by modulating microglial activation and the subsequent release of inflammatory cytokines in the trigeminal nucleus caudalis (TNC) in a rat model. Establishment of a rat model of recurrent migraine was achieved through repeated dural electrical stimulation (DES). After nine sessions of acupuncture treatment at Fengchi (GB20), facial mechanical thresholds were measured by electronic von Frey measurements. Microglial activation and cytokine receptors of TNC were evaluated by immunofluorescence staining. The expression of microglial biological marker Ibal-1, proinflammatory cytokines, and cytokine receptors in the TNC were evaluated by Western blot and/or real-time polymerase chain reaction. In addition, the effects of inhibition of microglial activation on facial thresholds and neuronal activation (i.e., expression of c-Fos in the TNC) induced by DES were observed. After consecutive EA-GB20 treatments, the facial withdrawal threshold was significantly higher than in the model group at different time points (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). The hyperreactivity of microglia induced by DES was significantly inhibited, and the expressions of Ibal-1, interleukin-1&amp;amp;beta;, tumor necrosis factor-&amp;amp;alpha;, and their receptors in the TNC were also significantly decreased (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). Inhibition of microglia by minocycline demonstrated an acupuncture-like role, which was manifested by ameliorated mechanical hyperalgesia and decreased neuronal expression of c-Fos, Iba-1, and inflammatory factors. EA at GB20 could ameliorate migraine facial allodynia by inhibiting microglial activation and the subsequent release of inflammatory cytokines and their receptors in the TNC.</p>

	<p>Tinnitus is defined as the phantom perception of sound. To date, there is no curative treatment, and contemporary treatments have failed to show beneficial outcomes. Deep brain stimulation has been suggested as a potential therapy for refractory tinnitus. However, the optimal target and stimulation regimens remain to be defined. Herein, we investigated metabolic and neuronal activity changes using cytochrome C oxidase histochemistry and c-Fos immunohistochemistry in a noise trauma-induced rat model of tinnitus. We also assessed changes in neuronal activity following medial geniculate body (MGB) high-frequency stimulation (HFS). Metabolic activity was reduced in the primary auditory cortex, MGB and CA1 region of the hippocampus in noise-exposed rats. Additionally, c-Fos expression was increased in the primary auditory cortex of those animals. Furthermore, MGB-HFS enhanced c-Fos expression in the thalamic reticular nucleus. We concluded that noise trauma alters tissue activity in multiple brain areas including the auditory and limbic regions. MGB-HFS resulted in higher neuronal activity in the thalamic reticular nucleus. Given the prominent role of the auditory thalamus in tinnitus, these data provide more rationales towards targeting the MGB with HFS as a symptom management tool in tinnitus.</p>

	<p>Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is increasingly used for therapeutic purposes in attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) is the most targeted region of tDCS studies in ADHD. There is limited knowledge and mixed results about the relevance of left or right DLPFCs in ADHD&amp;amp;rsquo;s cognitive deficits. No study so far has investigated the impact of the increased excitability of both left and right DLPFC with anodal tDCS on cognitive deficits in ADHD. Here, we explored the impact of online bilateral anodal left and right DLPFC tDCS on executive dysfunction in children with ADHD. Twenty-two children with ADHD (mean age &amp;amp;plusmn; SD =8.86 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1.80) received bilateral anodal online tDCS over the left and right DLPFC (1.5 mA, 15 min) in two separate sessions in active and sham states. They underwent a battery of four neuropsychological tasks of executive functions during stimulation that measured working memory, cognitive flexibility, response inhibition, and executive control. Bilateral anodal left and right DLPFC tDCS did not improve performance on working memory, cognitive flexibility, and response inhibition. Executive control was, however, partially improved for those who received active tDCS first. The upregulation of bilateral DLPFC tDCS with anodal polarity does not improve executive dysfunction in children with ADHD. The unilateral modulation of DLPFC with anodal tDCS may be more beneficial to cognitive deficits in ADHD in light of previous works targeting only left and/or right DLPFC.</p>

	<p>Spatial orientation and navigation are fundamental abilities in daily life that develop gradually during childhood, although their development is still not clear. The main aim of the present narrative review was to trace the development of navigational skills in middle childhood (6 to 12 years old) by means of studies present in the literature. To this aim, this review took into account the terminology, methodologies, different paradigms, and apparatuses used to investigate egocentric self-centered and allocentric world-centered representations, besides the different types of spaces (reaching/small/large; physical/virtual). Furthermore, this review provided a brief description of the development of navigational strategies and competences in toddlers and preschool children (0&amp;amp;ndash;5 years). The main result of this review showed how middle childhood is a crucial period for the improvement and development of allocentric strategies, including metric information. In fact, during this developmental window, children learn to handle proximal and distal cues, to transpose paper and virtual information into real environments, up to performing similarly to adults. This narrative review could represent a starting point to better clarify the development of navigation and spatial orientation, finalized to trace a development curve useful to map normal development and to have a term of comparison to assess performance in atypical development.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>C57BL/6 is the most commonly used mouse strain in neurobehavioral research, serving as a background for multiple transgenic lines. However, C57BL/6 exhibit behavioral and sensorimotor disadvantages that worsen with age. We bred FVB/NJ females and C57BL/6J males to generate first-generation hybrid offspring (FVB/NJ x C57BL/6J)F1. The hybrid mice exhibit reduced anxiety-like behavior, improved learning, and enhanced long-term spatial memory. In contrast to both progenitors, hybrids maintain sensorimotor performance upon aging and exhibit improved long-term memory. The hybrids are larger than C57BL/6J, exhibiting enhanced running behavior on a linear track during freely-moving electrophysiological recordings. Hybrids exhibit typical rate and phase coding of space by CA1 pyramidal cells. Hybrids generated by crossing FVB/NJ females with transgenic males of a C57BL/6 background support optogenetic neuronal control in neocortex and hippocampus. The hybrid mice provide an improved model for neurobehavioral studies combining complex behavior, electrophysiology, and genetic tools readily available in C57BL/6 mice.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Cannabinoid 1 and mu-Opioid Receptor Agonists Synergistically Inhibit Abdominal Pain and Lack Side Effects in Mice</a></h4>

              
                <p>While effective in treating abdominal pain, opioids have significant side effects. Recent legalization of cannabis will likely promote use of cannabinoids as an adjunct or alternative to opioids, despite a lack of evidence. We aimed to investigate whether cannabinoids inhibit mouse colonic nociception, alone or in combination with opioids at low doses. Experiments were performed on C57BL/6 male and female mice. Visceral nociception was evaluated by measuring visceromotor responses (VMR), afferent nerve mechanosensitivity in flat-sheet colon preparations, and excitability of isolated DRG neurons. Blood oxygen saturation, locomotion, and defecation were measured to evaluate side effects. An agonist of cannabinoid 1 receptor (CB1R), arachidonyl-2'-chloroethylamide (ACEA), dose-dependently decreased VMR. ACEA and HU-210 (another CB1R agonist) also attenuated colonic afferent nerve mechanosensitivity. Additionally, HU-210 concentration-dependently decreased DRG neuron excitability, which was reversed by the CB1R antagonist AM-251. Conversely, cannabinoid 2 receptor (CB2R) agonists did not attenuate VMR, afferent nerve mechanosensitivity, or DRG neuron excitability. Combination of subanalgesic doses of CB1R and &micro;-opioid receptor agonists decreased VMR; importantly, this analgesic effect was preserved after 6 d of twice daily treatment. This combination also attenuated afferent nerve mechanosensitivity and DRG neuron excitability, which was inhibited by neuronal nitric oxide synthase and guanylate cyclase inhibitors. This combination avoided side effects (decreased oxygen saturation and colonic transit) caused by analgesic dose of morphine. Activation of CB1R, but not CB2R, decreased colonic nociception both alone and in synergy with &micro;-opioid receptor. Thus, CB1R agonists may enable opioid dose reduction and avoid opioid-related side effects.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> One of the most cited needs for patients with abdominal pain are safe and effective treatment options. The effectiveness of opioids in the management of abdominal pain is undermined by severe adverse side effects. Therefore, strategies to replace opioids or reduce the doses of opioids to suppress abdominal pain is needed. This study in mice demonstrates that cannabinoid 1 receptor (CB1R) agonists inhibit visceral sensation. Furthermore, a combination of subanalgesic doses of &micro;-opioid receptor agonist and CB1R agonist markedly reduce abdominal pain without causing the side effects of high-dose opioids. Thus, CB1R agonists, alone or in combination with low-dose opioids, may be a novel and safe treatment strategy for abdominal pain.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">T-Type Ca2+ Channels Boost Neurotransmission in Mammalian Cone Photoreceptors</a></h4>

              
                <p>It is a commonly accepted view that light stimulation of mammalian photoreceptors causes a graded change in membrane potential instead of developing a spike. The presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels serve as a crucial link for the coding of membrane potential variations into neurotransmitter release. Ca<SUB>v</SUB>1.4 L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels are expressed in photoreceptor terminals, but the complete pool of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels in cone photoreceptors appears to be more diverse. Here, we discovered, employing whole-cell patch-clamp recording from cone photoreceptor terminals in both sexes of mice, that their Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents are composed of low- (T-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels) and high- (L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels) voltage-activated components. Furthermore, Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels exerted self-generated spike behavior in dark membrane potentials, and spikes were generated in response to light/dark transition. The application of fast and slow Ca<sup>2+</sup> chelators revealed that T-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels are located close to the release machinery. Furthermore, capacitance measurements indicated that they are involved in evoked vesicle release. Additionally, RT-PCR experiments showed the presence of Ca<SUB>v</SUB>3.2 T-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels in cone photoreceptors but not in rod photoreceptors. Altogether, we found several crucial functions of T-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, which increase the functional repertoire of cone photoreceptors. Namely, they extend cone photoreceptor light-responsive membrane potential range, amplify dark responses, generate spikes, increase intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels, and boost synaptic transmission.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Photoreceptors provide the first synapse for coding light information. The key elements in synaptic transmission are the voltage-sensitive Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels. Here, we provide evidence that mouse cone photoreceptors express low-voltage-activated Ca<SUB>v</SUB>3.2 T-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels in addition to high-voltage-activated L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels. The presence of T-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels in cone photoreceptors appears to extend their light-responsive membrane potential range, amplify dark response, generate spikes, increase intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels, and boost synaptic transmission. By these functions, Ca<SUB>v</SUB>3.2 T-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels increase the functional repertoire of cone photoreceptors.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">DYRK1A Regulates the Bidirectional Axonal Transport of APP in Human-Derived Neurons</a></h4>

              
                <p><I>Dyrk1a</I> triplication in Down's syndrome and its overexpression in Alzheimer's disease suggest a role for increased DYRK1A activity in the abnormal metabolism of APP. Transport defects are early phenotypes in the progression of Alzheimer's disease, which lead to APP processing impairments. However, whether DYRK1A regulates the intracellular transport and delivery of APP in human neurons remains unknown. From a proteomic dataset of human cerebral organoids treated with harmine, a DYRK1A inhibitor, we found expression changes in protein clusters associated with the control of microtubule-based transport and in close interaction with the APP vesicle. Live imaging of APP axonal transport in human-derived neurons treated with harmine or overexpressing a dominant negative DYRK1A revealed a reduction in APP vesicle density and enhanced the stochastic behavior of retrograde vesicle transport. Moreover, harmine increased the fraction of slow segmental velocities and changed speed transitions supporting a DYRK1A-mediated effect in the exchange of active motor configuration. Contrarily, the overexpression of DYRK1A in human polarized neurons increased the axonal density of APP vesicles and enhanced the processivity of retrograde APP. In addition, increased DYRK1A activity induced faster retrograde segmental velocities together with significant changes in slow to fast anterograde and retrograde speed transitions, suggesting the facilitation of the active motor configuration. Our results highlight DYRK1A as a modulator of the axonal transport machinery driving APP intracellular distribution in neurons, and stress DYRK1A inhibition as a putative therapeutic intervention to restore APP axonal transport in Down's syndrome and Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Axonal transport defects are early events in the progression of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying transport defects remain elusive. <I>Dyrk1a</I> kinase is triplicated in Down's syndrome and overexpressed in Alzheimer's disease, suggesting that DYRK1A dysfunction affects molecular pathways leading to early-onset neurodegeneration. Here, we show by live imaging of human-derived neurons that DYRK1A activity differentially regulates the intracellular trafficking of APP. Further, single-particle analysis revealed DYRK1A as a modulator of axonal transport and the configuration of active motors within the APP vesicle. Our work highlights DYRK1A as a regulator of APP axonal transport and metabolism, supporting DYRK1A inhibition as a therapeutic strategy to restore intracellular dynamics in Alzheimer's disease.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">V1-Origin Bidirectional Plasticity in Visual Thalamo-Ventral Pathway and Its Contribution to Saliency Detection of Dynamic Visual Inputs</a></h4>

              
                <p>Visual neural plasticity and V1 saliency detection are vital for efficient coding of dynamically changing visual inputs. However, how does neural plasticity contribute to saliency detection of temporal statistically distributed visual stream remains unclear. Therefore, we adopted randomly presented but unevenly distributed stimuli with multiple orientations and examined the single-unit responses evoked by this biased orientation-adaptation protocol by single-unit recordings in the visual thalamo&ndash;ventral pathway of cats (of either sex). We found neuronal responses potentiated when the probability of biased orientation was slightly higher than other nonbiased ones and suppressed when the probability became much higher. This single neuronal short-term bidirectional plasticity is selectively induced by optimal stimuli but is interocularly transferable. It is inducible in LGN, Area 17, and Area 21a with distinct and hierarchically progressive patterns. With the results of latency analysis, receptive field structural test, cortical lesion, and simulations, we suggest this bidirectional plasticity may principally originate from the adaptation competition between excitatory and inhibitory components of V1 neuronal receptive field. In our simulation, above bidirectional plasticity could achieve saliency detection of dynamic visual inputs. These findings demonstrate a rapid probability dependent plasticity on the neural coding of visual stream and suggest its functional role in the efficient coding and saliency detection of dynamic environment.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Novel elements within a dynamic visual stream can pop up from the context, which is vital for rapid response to a dynamically changing world. Saliency detection is a promising bottom-up mechanism contributing to efficient selection of visual inputs, wherein visual adaptation also plays a significant role. However, the saliency detection of dynamic visual stream is poorly understood. Here, we found a novel form of visual short-term bidirectional plasticity in multistages of the visual system that contributes to saliency detection of dynamic visual inputs. This bidirectional plasticity may principally originate from the local balance of excitation inhibition in primary visual cortex and propagates to lower and higher visual areas with progressive pattern change. Our findings suggest the excitation-inhibition balance within the visual system contributes to visual efficient coding.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Monkey Prefrontal Single-Unit Activity Reflecting Category-Based Logical Thinking Process and Its Neural Network Model</a></h4>

              
                <p>Category-based thinking is a fundamental form of logical thinking. Here, we aimed to investigate its neural process at the local circuit level in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). We recorded single-unit PFC activity while male monkeys (<I>Macaca fuscata</I>) performed a task in which the category and rule were prerequisites of logical thinking and the outcome contingency was its consequence. Different groups of neurons coded a single type of information discretely or multiple types in a transitional form. Results of time-by-time analysis of neuronal activity suggest an information flow from category-coding and rule-coding neurons to transitional intermediate neurons, and then to contingency-coding neurons. Category-coding, rule-coding, and contingency-coding neurons showed stable coding of information, whereas intermediate neurons showed dynamic coding, as if it integrated category and rule to derive contingency. A similar process was confirmed by using a spiking neural network model that consisted of subnetworks coding category and rule on the input layer and those coding contingency on the output layer, with a subnetwork for integration in the intermediate layer. These results suggest that category-based logical thinking is realized in the PFC by separated neural populations organized for working in a feedforward manner.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> To elucidate the neural process for logical thinking, we combined an in-depth analysis of single-unit activity data with a biologically plausible computational model. Results of time-by-time analysis of prefrontal neuronal activity suggest an information flow from category-coding and rule-coding neurons to transitional intermediate neurons, and then to contingency-coding neurons. Category-coding, rule-coding, and contingency-coding neurons showed stable coding, whereas intermediate neurons showed dynamic coding, as if they integrated category and rule to derive contingency. A spiking neural network model reproduced similar temporal changes of information as the recorded neuronal data. Our results suggest that the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is critically involved in category-based thought process, and this process may be produced by separated neural populations organized for working in a feedforward manner.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Extensive Connections of the Canine Olfactory Pathway Revealed by Tractography and Dissection</a></h4>

              
                <p>The olfactory sense of the domestic dog is widely recognized as being highly sensitive with a diverse function; however, little is known about the structure of its olfactory system. This study examined a cohort of mixed-sex mesaticephalic canines and used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), an MRI technique, to map connections from the olfactory bulb to other cortical regions of the brain. The results were validated using the Klingler dissection method. An extensive pathway composed of five white matter tracts connecting to the occipital lobe, cortical spinal tract, limbic system, piriform lobe, and entorhinal pathway was identified. This is the first documentation of a direct connection between the olfactory bulb and occipital lobe in any species and is a step toward further understanding how the dog integrates olfactory stimuli into their cognitive function.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The highly sensitive olfactory system of the domestic dog is largely unexplored. We applied diffusion tractography and dissection techniques to evaluate the white matter connections associated with the olfactory system in a large cohort of dogs. We discovered an extensive white matter network extending from the olfactory bulb to form novel connections directly to other cortices of the brain. This is the first documentation of these novel olfactory connections and provides new insight into how dogs integrate olfactory stimuli in their cognitive functioning.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Task Context Modulates Feature-Selective Responses in Area V4</a></h4>

              
                <p>Feature selectivity of visual cortical responses measured during passive fixation provides only a partial view of selectivity because it does not account for the influence of cognitive factors. Here we focus on primate area V4 and ask how neuronal tuning is modulated by task engagement. We investigated whether responses to colored shapes during active shape discrimination are simple, stimulus-agnostic, scaled versions of responses during passive fixation, akin to results from attentional studies. Alternatively, responses could be subject to stimulus-specific scaling, that is, responses to different stimuli are modulated differently, resulting in changes in underlying shape/color selectivity. Among 83 well-isolated V4 neurons in two male macaques, only a minority (16 of 83), which were weakly tuned to both shape and color, displayed responses during fixation and discrimination tasks that could be related by stimulus-agnostic scaling. The majority (67 of 83), which were strongly tuned to shape, color, or both, displayed stimulus-dependent response changes during discrimination. For some of these neurons (39 of 83), the shape or color of the stimulus dictated the magnitude of the change, and for others (28 of 83) it was the combination of stimulus shape and color. Importantly, for neurons with one strong and one weak tuning dimension, stimulus-dependent response changes during discrimination were associated with a relative increase in selectivity along the stronger tuning dimension, without changes in tuning peak. These results reveal that more strongly tuned V4 neurons may also be more flexible in their selectivity, and imbalances in selectivity are amplified during active task contexts.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Tuning for stimulus features is typically characterized by recording responses during passive fixation, but cognitive factors, including attention, influence responses in visual cortex. To determine how behavioral engagement influences neuronal responses in area V4, we compared responses to colored shapes during passive fixation and active behavior. For a large fraction of neurons, differences in responses between passive fixation and active behavior depended on the identity of the visual stimulus. For a subgroup of strongly feature-selective neurons, this response modulation was associated with enhanced selectivity for one feature at the expense of selectivity for the other. Such flexibility in tuning strength could improve performance in tasks requiring active judgment of stimuli.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Reward Enhances Memory via Age-Varying Online and Offline Neural Mechanisms across Development</a></h4>

              
                <p>Reward motivation enhances memory through interactions between mesolimbic, hippocampal, and cortical systems, both during and after encoding. Developmental changes in these distributed neural circuits may lead to age-related differences in reward-motivated memory and the underlying neural mechanisms. Converging evidence from cross-species studies suggests that subcortical dopamine signaling is increased during adolescence, which may lead to stronger memory representations of rewarding, relative to mundane, events and changes in the contributions of underlying subcortical and cortical brain mechanisms across age. Here, we used fMRI to examine how reward motivation influences the "online" encoding and "offline" postencoding brain mechanisms that support long-term associative memory from childhood to adulthood in human participants of both sexes. We found that reward motivation led to both age-invariant enhancements and nonlinear age-related differences in associative memory after 24 h. Furthermore, reward-related memory benefits were linked to age-varying neural mechanisms. During encoding, interactions between the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and ventral tegmental area (VTA) were associated with better high-reward memory to a greater degree with increasing age. Preencoding to postencoding changes in functional connectivity between the anterior hippocampus and VTA were also associated with better high-reward memory, but more so at younger ages. Our findings suggest that there may be developmental differences in the contributions of offline subcortical and online cortical brain mechanisms supporting reward-motivated memory.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> A substantial body of research has examined the neural mechanisms through which reward influences memory formation in adults. However, despite extensive evidence that both reward processing and associative memory undergo dynamic change across development, few studies have examined age-related changes in these processes. We found both age-invariant and nonlinear age-related differences in reward-motivated memory. Moreover, our findings point to developmental differences in the processes through which reward modulates the prioritization of information in long-term memory, with greater early reliance on offline subcortical consolidation mechanisms and increased contribution of systems-level online encoding circuitry with increasing age. These results highlight dynamic developmental changes in the cognitive and neural mechanisms through which motivationally salient information is prioritized in memory from childhood to adulthood.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Experiencing Surprise: The Temporal Dynamics of Its Impact on Memory</a></h4>

              
                <p>To efficiently process information, the brain shifts between encoding and retrieval states, prioritizing bottom-up or top-down processing accordingly. Expectation violation before or during learning has been shown to trigger an adaptive encoding mechanism, resulting in better memory for unexpected events. Using fMRI, we explored (1) whether this encoding mechanism is also triggered during retrieval, and if so, (2) what the temporal dynamics of its mnemonic consequences are. Male and female participants studied object images, then, with new objects, they learned a contingency between a cue and a semantic category. Rule-abiding (expected) and violating (unexpected) targets and similar foils were used at test. We found interactions between previous and current similar events' expectation, such that when an expected event followed a similar but unexpected event, its performance was boosted, underpinned by activation in the hippocampus, midbrain, and occipital cortex. In contrast, a sequence of two unexpected similar events also triggered occipital engagement; however, this did not enhance memory performance. Taken together, our findings suggest that when the goal is to retrieve, encountering surprising events engages an encoding mechanism, supported by bottom-up processing, that may enhance memory for future related events.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Optimizing the balance between new learning and the retrieval of existing knowledge is an ongoing process, at the core of human cognition. Previous research into memory encoding suggests experiencing surprise leads to the prioritization of the learning of new memories, forming an adaptive encoding mechanism. We examined whether this mechanism is also engaged when the current goal is to retrieve information. Our results demonstrate that an expectation-driven shift toward an encoding state, supported by enhanced perceptual processing, is beneficial for the correct identification of subsequent expected similar events. These findings have important implications for our understanding of the temporal dynamics of the adaptive encoding of information into memory.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">A Role for the Anterior Hippocampus in Autobiographical Memory Construction Regardless of Temporal Distance</a></h4>

              
                <p>Mounting evidence suggests distinct functional contributions of the anterior and posterior hippocampus to autobiographical memory retrieval, but how these subregions function under different retrieval demands as memories age is not yet understood. Specifically, autobiographical memory retrieval is not a homogeneous process; rather, it is thought to consist of the following multiple stages: an early stage of memory construction and a later stage of detailed elaboration, which may differently engage the hippocampus over time. In the present study, we analyzed data from 40 participants (23 female/17 male) who constructed and overtly elaborated on recent and remote memories in response to picture cues in the fMRI scanner. We previously reported a temporal gradient in the posterior hippocampus during the elaboration period of autobiographical retrieval, with posterior hippocampal activation observed for recent but not remote time points. Here, we consider the previously unanalyzed construction stage of retrieval, where participants searched for and selected a memory. We found no evidence of a temporal gradient during memory construction, instead observing strong anterior hippocampus activity regardless of memory remoteness. Our findings suggest a unique contribution of the anterior hippocampus to the construction process of autobiographical retrieval over time. These findings highlight that retrieval processes, which have yet to be integrated with current models of systems consolidation, offer novel insights into hippocampal subregion function over time.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Hippocampal contributions to autobiographical memory retrieval may depend on several distinct factors including memory age and the retrieval process engaged. We previously found that the contribution of the posterior hippocampus to detailed elaborative retrieval diminishes as memories age, with no reliable activation of the anterior hippocampus over time. Here, we report that consideration of the earlier "construction" period of retrieval, where participants search for and retrieve general aspects of the memory, yielded significant anterior hippocampus activation regardless of memory age. These results provide evidence for a unique contribution of the anterior hippocampus to the constructive process of autobiographical retrieval over time and suggest that component processes of retrieval should be integrated into models of systems consolidation.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Genetic Mapping of APP and Amyloid-{beta} Biology Modulation by Trisomy 21</a></h4>

              
                <p>Individuals who have Down syndrome (DS) frequently develop early onset Alzheimer's disease (AD), a neurodegenerative condition caused by the buildup of aggregated amyloid-&beta; (A&beta;) and tau proteins in the brain. A&beta; is produced by amyloid precursor protein (<I>APP</I>), a gene located on chromosome 21. People who have DS have three copies of chromosome 21 and thus also an additional copy of <I>APP</I>; this genetic change drives the early development of AD in these individuals. Here we use a combination of next-generation mouse models of DS (Tc1, Dp3Tyb, Dp(10)2Yey and Dp(17)3Yey) and a knockin mouse model of A&beta; accumulation (<I>App<sup>NL-F</sup></I>) to determine how chromosome 21 genes, other than <I>APP</I>, modulate APP/A&beta; in the brain when in three copies. Using both male and female mice, we demonstrate that three copies of other chromosome 21 genes are sufficient to partially ameliorate A&beta; accumulation in the brain. We go on to identify a subregion of chromosome 21 that contains the gene(s) causing this decrease in A&beta; accumulation and investigate the role of two lead candidate genes, <I>Dyrk1a</I> and <I>Bace2</I>. Thus, an additional copy of chromosome 21 genes, other than <I>APP</I>, can modulate APP/A&beta; in the brain under physiological conditions. This work provides critical mechanistic insight into the development of disease and an explanation for the typically later age of onset of dementia in people who have AD in DS, compared with those who have familial AD caused by triplication of <I>APP</I>.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Trisomy of chromosome 21 is a commonly occurring genetic risk factor for early-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD), which has been previously attributed to people with Down syndrome having three copies of the amyloid precursor protein (<I>APP</I>) gene, which is encoded on chromosome 21. However, we have shown that an extra copy of other chromosome 21 genes modifies AD-like phenotypes independently of <I>APP</I> copy number (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B49">Wiseman et al., 2018</cross-ref>; <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B44">Tosh et al., 2021</cross-ref>). Here, we use a mapping approach to narrow down the genetic cause of the modulation of pathology, demonstrating that gene(s) on chromosome 21 decrease A&beta; accumulation in the brain, independently of alterations to full-length APP or C-terminal fragment abundance and that just 38 genes are sufficient to cause this.</p>

                <p>Atypical sensory processing is now thought to be a core feature of the autism spectrum. Influential theories have proposed that both increased and decreased neural response reliability within sensory systems could underlie altered sensory processing in autism. Here, we report evidence for abnormally increased reliability of visual-evoked responses in layer 2/3 neurons of adult male and female primary visual cortex in the MECP2-duplication syndrome animal model of autism. Increased response reliability was due in part to decreased response amplitude, decreased fluctuations in endogenous activity, and an abnormal decoupling of visual-evoked activity from endogenous activity. Similar to what was observed neuronally, the optokinetic reflex occurred more reliably at low contrasts in mutant mice compared with controls. Retinal responses did not explain our observations. These data suggest that the circuit mechanisms for combining sensory-evoked and endogenous signal and noise processes may be altered in this form of syndromic autism.</p>

Visual-evoked activity was abnormally decoupled from endogenous activity in mutant mice, suggesting in line with the influential "hypo-priors" theory of autism that sensory priors embedded in endogenous activity may have less influence on perception in autism.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Positively charged mineral surfaces promoted the accumulation of organic intermediates at the origin of metabolism</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Amir Akbari, Bernhard O. Palsson</p>

Identifying plausible mechanisms for compartmentalization and accumulation of the organic intermediates of early metabolic cycles in primitive cells has been a major challenge in theories of life’s origins. Here, we propose a mechanism, where positive membrane potentials elevate the concentration of the organic intermediates. Positive membrane potentials are generated by positively charged surfaces of protocell membranes due to accumulation of transition metals. We find that (i) positive membrane potentials comparable in magnitude to those of modern cells can increase the concentration of the organic intermediates by several orders of magnitude; (ii) generation of large membrane potentials destabilize ion distributions; (iii) violation of electroneutrality is necessary to induce nonzero membrane potentials; and (iv) violation of electroneutrality enhances osmotic pressure and diminishes reaction efficiency, resulting in an evolutionary driving force for the formation of lipid membranes, specialized ion channels, and active transport systems.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Understanding the structure of cognitive noise</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jian-Qiao Zhu, Pablo León-Villagrá, Nick Chater, Adam N. Sanborn</p>

Human cognition is fundamentally noisy. While routinely regarded as a nuisance in experimental investigation, the few studies investigating properties of cognitive noise have found surprising structure. A first line of research has shown that inter-response-time distributions are heavy-tailed. That is, response times between subsequent trials usually change only a small amount, but with occasional large changes. A second, separate, line of research has found that participants’ estimates and response times both exhibit long-range autocorrelations (i.e., 1/<i>f</i> noise). Thus, each judgment and response time not only depends on its immediate predecessor but also on many previous responses. These two lines of research use different tasks and have distinct theoretical explanations: models that account for heavy-tailed response times do not predict 1/<i>f</i> autocorrelations and vice versa. Here, we find that 1/<i>f</i> noise and heavy-tailed response distributions co-occur in both types of tasks. We also show that a statistical sampling algorithm, developed to deal with patchy environments, generates both heavy-tailed distributions and 1/<i>f</i> noise, suggesting that cognitive noise may be a functional adaptation to dealing with a complex world.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Niclosamide-loaded nanoparticles disrupt Candida biofilms and protect mice from mucosal candidiasis</a></h4>

<i>Candida albicans</i> biofilms are a complex multilayer community of cells that are resistant to almost all classes of antifungal drugs. The bottommost layers of biofilms experience nutrient limitation where <i>C</i>. <i>albicans</i> cells are required to respire. We previously reported that a protein Ndu1 is essential for <i>Candida</i> mitochondrial respiration; loss of <i>NDU1</i> causes inability of <i>C</i>. <i>albicans</i> to grow on alternative carbon sources and triggers early biofilm detachment. Here, we screened a repurposed library of FDA-approved small molecule inhibitors to identify those that prevent NDU1-associated functions. We identified an antihelminthic drug, Niclosamide (NCL), which not only prevented growth on acetate, <i>C</i>. <i>albicans</i> hyphenation and early biofilm growth, but also completely disengaged fully grown biofilms of drug-resistant <i>C</i>. <i>albicans</i> and <i>Candida auris</i> from their growth surface. To overcome the suboptimal solubility and permeability of NCL that is well known to affect its in vivo efficacy, we developed NCL-encapsulated Eudragit EPO (an FDA-approved polymer) nanoparticles (NCL-EPO-NPs) with high niclosamide loading, which also provided long-term stability. The developed NCL-EPO-NPs completely penetrated mature biofilms and attained anti-biofilm activity at low microgram concentrations. NCL-EPO-NPs induced ROS activity in <i>C</i>. <i>albicans</i> and drastically reduced oxygen consumption rate in the fungus, similar to that seen in an NDU1 mutant. NCL-EPO-NPs also significantly abrogated mucocutaneous candidiasis by fluconazole-resistant strains of <i>C</i>. <i>albicans</i>, in mice models of oropharyngeal and vulvovaginal candidiasis. To our knowledge, this is the first study that targets biofilm detachment as a target to get rid of drug-resistant <i>Candida</i> biofilms and uses NPs of an FDA-approved nontoxic drug to improve biofilm penetrability and microbial killing.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The most frequent genetic cause of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is the hexanucleotide repeat expansion in <i>C9orf72</i>. An important neuropathological hallmark associated with this mutation is the accumulation of the phosphorylated form of TAR (trans-activation response element) DNA-binding protein 43 (pTDP-43). Glia plays a crucial role in the neurodegeneration observed in <i>C9orf72</i>-associated disorders. However, less is known about the role of oligodendrocytes (OLs). Here, we applied digital neuropathological methods to compare the expression pattern of glial cells in the frontal cortex (FrCx) of human post-mortem samples from patients with C9-FTLD and C9-FTLD/ALS, sporadic FTLD (sFTLD), and healthy controls (HCs). We also compared MBP levels in CSF from an independent clinical FTD cohort. We observed an increase in GFAP, and Iba1 immunoreactivity in C9 and sFTLD compared to controls in the gray matter (GM) of the FrCx. We observed a decrease in MBP immunoreactivity in the GM and white matter (WM) of the FrCx of C9, compared to HC and sFTLD. There was a negative correlation between MBP and pTDP-43 in C9 in the WM of the FrCx. We observed an increase in CSF MBP concentrations in C9 and sFTLD compared to HC. In conclusion, the C9 expansion is associated with myelin loss in the frontal cortex. This loss of MBP may be a result of oligodendroglial dysfunction due to the expansion or the presence of pTDP-43 in OLs. Understanding these biological processes will help to identify specific pathways associated with the <i>C9orf72</i> expansion.</p>

<p>Cocaine effects on brain glucose metabolism were evaluated in three different situations: after maintaining animals in a home cage; exposing them to open field; keeping them under anesthesia. When performing brain PET scanning, locomotor activity induced by cocaine might be a relevant factor, as in animals under anesthesia an acute cocaine injection induced higher [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG brain uptake. This is not seen when animals are left awake to experience the locomotor stimulant effect of the drug.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>We verified if cocaine-induced peripheral activation might disrupt [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG brain uptake after a cocaine challenge and suggested an optimal protocol to measure cocaine-induced brain metabolic alterations in mice. C57Bl/6 male mice were injected with [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG and randomly separated into three groups. Groups 1 and 2 were kept conscious after [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG administration and after 5 min received saline or cocaine (20 mg/kg). The animals in group 1 (<i>n</i> = 5) were then evaluated in the open field for 30 min and those from group 2 (<i>n</i> = 6) were kept alone in a home cage for the same period. Forty-five minutes after [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG administration, images were acquired for 30 min. Group 3 (<i>n</i> = 6) was kept anesthetized and image acquisition started immediately after tracer injection, for 75 min. Saline (Day 1) or cocaine (Day 2) was injected 5 min after starting acquisition. Another set of animals (<i>n</i> = 5) were treated with cocaine every other day for 10 days or saline (<i>n</i> = 6) and were scanned with the dynamic protocol to verify its efficacy. [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG uptake increased after cocaine administration when compared to baseline only in animals kept under anesthesia. No brain effect of cocaine was observed in animals submitted to the open field or kept in the home cage. The use of anesthesia is essential to visualize cocaine-induced changes in brain metabolism by [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG PET, providing an interesting preclinical approach to investigate naïve subjects and enabling a bidirectional translational science approach for better understanding of cocaine use disorder.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a parasomnia characterized by polysomnography-confirmed REM sleep without atonia and dream-enacting behaviors. This disorder is considered a prodromal syndrome of alpha-synucleinopathies like Parkinson's disease (PD), where it affects more than 50% of PD patients. The underlying pathology of RBD has been generally understood to involve the pontine nuclei within the brainstem. However, the complete pathophysiology beyond the brainstem remains unclear as does its relationship with PD pathology. Therefore, this review aims to survey the neuroimaging literature involving PET, SPECT, and MR imaging techniques to provide an updated understanding of the neuro-chemical, structural, and functional changes in both RBD and PD patients comorbid with RBD. This review found neuroimaging evidence that indicate alterations to the dopaminergic and cholinergic system, blood perfusion, and glucose metabolism in both RBD patients and PD patients with RBD. Beyond the brainstem, structural and functional changes were found to involve the nigrostriatal system, limbic system, and the cortex—suggesting that RBD is a multi-systemic neurodegenerative process. Future investigations are encouraged to follow RBD patients longitudinally using multimodal imaging techniques to enhance our understanding of this parasomnia disorder. Uncovering which individuals are most likely to develop an alpha-synuclein disorder in the prodromal phase will improve patient outcomes and potentially aid in the development of novel treatments for patients affected by RBD.</p>

<p>The activity of spinal glymphatic system of rats with painful diabetic neuropathy was inhibited, and our results indicated that the increased number of GFAP positive astrocytes and aquaporin-4 polarity reversal may worked as its mechanism.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The glymphatic system is a recently discovered glial-dependent macroscopic interstitial waste clearance system that promotes the efficient elimination of soluble proteins and metabolites from the central nervous system. Its anatomic foundation is the astrocytes and aquaporin-4 (AQP4) water channels on the endfeet of astrocytes. The aim of this study is to evaluate the plasticity of the spinal glymphatic system in male SD rats with painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN) induced by type 2 diabetes mellitus. PDN rats were modeled under a high-fat and high-glucose diet with a low dose of streptozotocin. MRI was applied to observe the infiltration and clearance of contrast to indicate the functional variability of the glymphatic system at the spinal cord level. The paw withdrawal threshold was used to represent mechanical allodynia. The numerical change of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) positive astrocytes was assessed and the polarity reversal of AQP4 protein was measured by immunofluorescence. As a result, deceased contrast infiltration and clearance, enhanced mechanical allodynia, increased number of GFAP positive astrocytes, and reversed polarity of AQP4 protein were found in the PDN rats. The above molecular level changes may contribute to the impairment of the spinal glymphatic system in PDN rats. This study revealed the molecular and functional variations of the spinal glymphatic system in PDN rats and for the first time indicated that there might be a correlation between the impaired spinal glymphatic system and PDN rats.</p>

<p>Oxidative stress is induced by Kainate in neuroglobin KO and WT mice. In Ngb-KO mice this is not counter balanced and c-fos (a transcription factor) expression is increased leading to activation of downstream targets resulting in seizure.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Neuroglobin (Ngb) is found in the neurones of several different brain areas and is known to bind oxygen and other gaseous molecules and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in vitro, but it does not seem to act as a respiratory molecule for neurones. Using male and female Ngb-knockout (KO) mice, we addressed the role of Ngb in neuronal brain activity using behavioral tests but found no differences in general behaviors, memory processes, and anxiety−/depression-like behaviors. Oxidative stress and ROS play key roles in epileptogenesis, and oxidative injury produced by an excessive production of free radicals is involved in the initiation and progression of epilepsy. The ROS binding properties led us to hypothesize that lack of Ngb could affect central coping with excitatory stimuli. We consequently explored whether exposure to the excitatory molecule kainate (KA) would increase severity of seizures in mice lacking Ngb. We found that the duration and severity of seizures were increased, while the latency time to develop seizures was shortened in Ngb-KO compared to wildtype adult female mice. Consistently, c-fos expression after KA was significantly increased in Ngb-KO mice in the amygdala and piriform cortex, regions rich in Ngb and known to be centrally involved in seizure generation. Moreover, the measured c-fos expression levels were correlated with seizure susceptibility. With these new findings combined with previous studies we propose that Ngb could constitute an intrinsic defense mechanism against neuronal hyperexcitability and oxidative stress by buffering of ROS in amygdala and other Ngb-containing brain regions.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Parkinson's disease (PD) pathology is the most common motor neurodegenerative disease that occurs due to the progressive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons of the nigrostriatal pathway of the brain. The histopathological hallmark of the disease is fibrillary aggregate called Lewy bodies which majorly contain α-synuclein, suggesting the critical implication of diminished protein degradation mechanisms in disease pathogenesis. This α-synuclein-containing Lewy bodies are evident in both experimental models as well as in postmortem PD brain and are speculated to be pathogenic but still, the lineal association between these aggregates and the complexity of disease pathology is not yet well established and needs further attention. However, it has been reported that α-synuclein aggregates have consorted with the declined proteasome and lysosome activities. Therefore, in this review, we reappraise intracellular protein degradation mechanisms during PD pathology. This article focused on the findings of the last two decades suggesting the implications of protein degradation mechanisms in disease pathogenesis and based on shreds of evidence, some of the approaches are also suggested which may be adopted to find out the novel therapeutic targets for the management of PD patients.</p>

     alt="Enhanced nociceptive behavior and expansion of associated primary afferents in a rabbit model of cerebral palsy"/>
<p>Most individuals with cerebral palsy (CP) experience pain, yet it is understudied. We demonstrate altered distribution of nociceptive afferents in the dorsal horn of neonatal rabbits that experienced hypoxic–ischemic injury in utero; these anatomical changes were associated with nocifensive behavior indicative of pain. Our findings suggest that CP-causative injuries alter spinal sensory pathways (not only descending motor circuits), contributing to increased pain in CP.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Spastic cerebral palsy (CP) is a movement disorder marked by hypertonia and hyperreflexia; the most prevalent comorbidity is pain. Since spinal nociceptive afferents contribute to both the sensation of painful stimuli as well as reflex circuits involved in movement, we investigated the relationship between prenatal hypoxia–ischemia (HI) injury which can cause CP, and possible changes in spinal nociceptive circuitry. To do this, we examined nociceptive afferents and mechanical and thermal sensitivity of New Zealand White rabbit kits after prenatal HI or a sham surgical procedure. As described previously, a range of motor deficits similar to spastic CP was observed in kits born naturally after HI (40 min at ~70%–80% gestation). We found that HI caused an expansion of peptidergic afferents (marked by expression of calcitonin gene-related peptide) in both the superficial and deep dorsal horn at postnatal day (P)5. Non-peptidergic nociceptive afferent arborization (labeled by isolectin B4) was unaltered in HI kits, but overlap of the two populations (peptidergic and non-peptidergic nociceptors) was increased by HI. Density of glial fibrillary acidic protein was unchanged within spinal cord white matter regions important in nociceptive transmission at P5. We found that mechanical and thermal nociception was enhanced in HI kits even in the absence of motor deficits. These findings suggest that prenatal HI injury impacts spinal sensory pathways in addition to the more well-established disruptions to descending motor circuits. In conclusion, changes to spinal nociceptive circuitry could disrupt spinal reflexes and contribute to pain experienced by individuals with CP.</p>

     alt="Effect of endogenous purines on electrically evoked ACh release at the mouse neuromuscular junction"/>
<p>At mammalian neuromuscular junction, ATP is co-released with the neurotransmitter ACh, and once in the synaptic cleft, it is hydrolyzed to adenosine. We report that, when motor nerve terminals are depolarized by electrical stimulation of the phrenic nerve, the activation of presynaptic purinergic receptors are able to modulate ACh release depending on the frequency and pattern of stimulation.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>At the mouse neuromuscular junction, adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is co-released with the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh), and its metabolite adenosine, modulate neurotransmitter release by activating presynaptic inhibitory P2Y<sub>13</sub> receptors (a subtype of ATP/adenosine diphosphate [ADP] receptor), inhibitory A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>3</sub> adenosine receptors, and excitatory A<sub>2A</sub> adenosine receptors. To study the effect of endogenous purines, when phrenic-diaphragm preparations are depolarized by different nerve stimulation patterns, we analyzed the effect of the antagonists for P2Y<sub>13</sub>, A<sub>1</sub>, A<sub>3</sub>, and A<sub>2A</sub> receptors (AR-C69931MX, 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine, MRS-1191, and SCH-58261, respectively) on the amplitude of the end-plate potentials of the trains, and contrasted these results with those obtained with the selective agonists of these receptors (2-methylthioadenosine 5′-diphosphate trisodium salt hydrate, 2-chloro-N<sup>6</sup>-cyclopentyl-adenosine, inosine, and PSB-0777, respectively). During continuous 0.5-Hz stimulation, the amount of endogenous purines was not enough to activate purinergic receptors, while at continuous 5-Hz stimulation, an incipient action of endogenous purines on P2Y<sub>13</sub>, A<sub>1</sub> and A3 receptors might be evident just at the end of the trains. During continuous 50-Hz stimulation, the concentration of endogenous ATP/ADP and adenosine exerted an inhibitory action on ACh release after of the initial phase of the train, but when the nerve was stimulated at intermittent 50 Hz (5 bursts), this behavior was not observed. Excitatory A<sub>2A</sub> receptors were only activated when continuous 100-Hz stimulation was applied. In conclusion, when motor nerve terminals are depolarized by repetitive stimulation of the phrenic nerve, endogenous ATP/ADP and adenosine are able to fine-tune neurosecretion depending on the frequency and pattern of stimulation.</p>

     alt="Sex differences in morphine sensitivity are associated with differential glial expression in the brainstem of rats with neuropathic pain"/>
<p>It is well known that males and females show significant differences in both the analgesic and emetic effects of opiates. Our data provide evidence that changes in the morphology and activity of astrocytes in morphine sensitive and pain modulatory medullary regions might underlie these clinically important effects.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Chronic pain is more prevalent and reported to be more severe in women. Opioid analgesics are less effective in women and result in stronger nauseant effects. The neurobiological mechanisms underlying these sex differences have yet to be clearly defined, though recent research has suggested neuronal–glial interactions are likely involved. We have previously shown that similar to people, morphine is less effective at reducing pain behaviors in female rats. In this study, we used the immunohistochemical detection of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expression to investigate sex differences in astrocyte density and morphology in six medullary regions known to be modulated by pain and/or opioids. Morphine administration had small sex-dependent effects on overall GFAP expression, but not on astrocyte morphology, in the rostral ventromedial medulla, the subnucleus reticularis dorsalis, and the area postrema. Significant sex differences in the density and morphology of GFAP immunopositive astrocytes were detected in all six regions. In general, GFAP-positive cells in females showed smaller volumes and reduced complexity than those observed in males. Furthermore, females showed lower overall GFAP expression in all regions except for the area postrema, the critical medullary region responsible for opioid-induced nausea and emesis. These data support the possibility that differences in astrocyte activity might underlie the sex differences seen in the processing of opioids in the context of chronic neuropathic pain.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Mitochondria are one of the essential cellular organelles. Apart from being considered as the powerhouse of the cell, mitochondria have been widely known to regulate redox reaction, inflammation, cell survival, cell death, metabolism, etc., and are implicated in the progression of numerous disease conditions including neurodegenerative diseases. Since brain is an energy-demanding organ, mitochondria and their functions are important for maintaining normal brain homeostasis. Alterations in mitochondrial gene expression, mutations, and epigenetic modification contribute to inflammation and neurodegeneration. Dysregulation of reactive oxygen species production by mitochondria and aggregation of proteins in neurons leads to alteration in mitochondria functions which further causes neuronal death and progression of neurodegeneration. Pharmacological studies have prioritized mitochondria as a possible drug target in the regulation of neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, the present review article has been intended to provide a comprehensive understanding of mitochondrial role in the development and progression of neurodegenerative diseases mainly Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, multiple sclerosis, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis followed by possible intervention and future treatment strategies to combat mitochondrial-mediated neurodegeneration.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The social prescribing of psychosocial interventions in the treatment of addictions and substance use disorders with military veterans: a reclamation of identity and belonging [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Social prescribing is a way of connecting individuals to a source of support within the community to help improve their health and well-being. Social prescribing programmes are being widely promoted within the United Kingdom (UK) and United States as non-pharmaceutical interventions for those living with addiction and substance misuse needs. These needs have been exasperated by the recent COVID-19 pandemic and global economic crisis, with emerging research indicating short-term and long-term detrimental effects on physical and mental health due to substance misuse and addictions. Psychosocial interventions utilize psychological or social factors rather than an overreliance on biological interventions to treat the health impacts of mental illnesses such as addictions and substance use disorder. In this paper, I will discuss the associated determinants of addictions and substance for the military veteran population, as well as how the social prescribing of psychosocial interventions could be used to reaffirm participant’s identity and enhance their sense of belonging for military veterans, using a real-world example in Wales, UK.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: Clinical outcome of prolonged cord prolapse [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Abstract: Umbilical cord prolapse is an uncommon obstetric emergency with high neonatal morbidity and mortality. It is a rare entity with incidence ranging from 0.1 to 0.6%. Timely recognition and immediate interventions are needed for better outcome. Here, we present a case of 28-year-old multigravida of term pregnancy with cord prolapse of seven hours following rupture of membrane. She was experiencing vaginal leakage in the absence of abdominal pain, and was referred from the peripheral health center with the provisional diagnosis of cord prolapse. She finally underwent emergency caesarean section with good neonatal outcome at tertiary care center.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Inconclusive results of SARS-CoV2 RT-qPCR: To retest or not? [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) is widely used to detect SARS-CoV-2 infections. A small proportion (3-5%) of the samples turn out to be inconclusive which are difficult to interpret and require repeat testing. Methods: This study utilizing RT-qPCR for SARS-CoV-2 collected data from the viral RNA extracted using Maccura Mag-Bind RNA from NPOP specimen, then amplified and quantified using Maccura SARS-CoV-2 Fluorescent PCR kit. The data with inconclusive interpretation and re-test results were selected and further analysed. Results: The retrospective analysis of 247 inconclusive samples that were retested was included in the study. Among the inconclusive results from the first test, 80% of samples which expressed SARS-CoV-2 N and E genes (without ORF1ab gene) turned out to be positive in the repeat test (p < 0.001), while 55% of samples that had only one gene expressed initially, were positive on repeat testing. The E gene was detected (without N and ORF1ab gene) in nine samples, of which seven were negative on re-testing. Conclusions: Our study suggests that it is beneficial to repeat the SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR test, especially when two genes are expressed, while detection of only E gene in the first test can be regarded as negative.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10969861/most-recent">Small sensory spinal lesions that affect hand function in monkeys greatly alter primary afferent and motor neuron connections in the cord</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Small sensory spinal injuries induce plasticity across the neuraxis, but little is understood about their effect on segmental connections or motor neuron (MN) function. Here, we begin to address this at two levels. First, we compared afferent input distributions from the skin and muscles of the digits with corresponding MN pools to determine their spatial relationship, in both the normal state and 4–6 months after a unilateral dorsal root/dorsal column lesion (DRL/DCL), affecting digits 1–3. Second, we looked at specific changes to MN inputs and membrane properties that likely impact functional recovery. Monkeys received a targeted unilateral DRL/DCL, and 4–6 months later, cholera toxin subunit B (CT-B) was injected bilaterally into either the distal pads of digits 1–3, or related intrinsic hand muscles, to label inputs to the cord, and corresponding MNs. In controls (unlesioned side), cutaneous and proprioceptive afferents from digits 1–3 showed different distribution patterns but similar rostrocaudal spread within the dorsal horn from C1 to T2. In contrast, MNs were distributed across just two segments (C7–8). Following the lesion, sensory inputs were significantly diminished across all 10 segments, though this did not alter MN distributions. Afferent and monoamine inputs, as well as KCC2 cotransporters, were also significantly altered on the cell membrane of CT-B labeled MNs postlesion. In contrast, inhibitory neurotransmission and perineuronal net integrity were not altered at this prechronic timepoint.  Our findings indicate that even a small sensory injury can significantly impact sensory and motor spinal neurons and provide new insight into the complex process of recovery.</p>

                Temporal summation in the spinal cord is linked to pathological pain. In a translational genetic association study in this issue of Neuron, Trendafilova et al. (2022) identify the sodium-calcium exchanger 3 as a negative regulator of temporal summation and hypersensitivity via its modulation of calcium homeostasis.

                Novelty and uncertainty are powerful drivers of exploration that are often conflated. In this issue of Neuron, Cockburn and colleagues dissociate the two and report a key interaction: close to task termination, novel options appear much more attractive relative to uncertain options.
