	<p>The effects of transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) frequency on brain oscillations and cortical excitability are still controversial. Therefore, this study investigated how different tACS frequencies differentially modulate cortical oscillation and inhibition. To do so, we first determined the optimal positioning of tACS electrodes through an electric field simulation constructed from magnetic resonance images. Seven electrode configurations were tested on the electric field of the precentral gyrus (hand motor area). We determined that the Cz-CP1 configuration was optimal, as it resulted in higher electric field values and minimized the intra-individual differences in the electric field. Therefore, tACS was delivered to the hand motor area through this arrangement at a fixed frequency of 10 Hz (alpha-tACS) or 20 Hz (beta-tACS) with a peak-to-peak amplitude of 0.6 mA for 20 min. We found that alpha- and beta-tACS resulted in larger alpha and beta oscillations, respectively, compared with the oscillations observed after sham-tACS. In addition, alpha- and beta-tACS decreased the amplitudes of conditioned motor evoked potentials and increased alpha and beta activity, respectively. Correspondingly, alpha- and beta-tACSs enhanced cortical inhibition. These results show that tACS frequency differentially affects motor cortex oscillation and inhibition.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Leigh syndrome: a study of 209 patients at the Beijing Children's Hospital</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Leigh syndrome (LS) is a heterogeneous neurodegenerative disease and the most frequent pediatric manifestation of mitochondrial disease. In the largest patient collection to date, this study aimed to provide new insights into the clinical and genetic spectrum of LS, defect-specific associations, and predictors of disease course and survival.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Clinical, metabolic, neuroimaging, onset, and survival data were collected from the medical records of 209 patients referred to the Beijing Children's Hospital with symmetrical basal ganglia and/or brainstem neuroimaging changes indicative of LS by 30 centers from the Chinese network of mitochondrial disease (mitoC-NET) between January 2013 and July 2021 for exploratory analysis.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Pathogenic variants were identified in 52 genes, most frequently <i>MT-ATP6</i>, <i>SURF1,</i> and <i>PDHA1</i>. Maternally inherited variants accounted for 42% (heteroplasmy level ≥ 90% in 64%). Phenotypes spanned 92 Human Phenotype Ontology terms. Elevated serum lactate (144/195), global developmental delay (142/209), and developmental regression (103/209) were most frequent. Discriminating neuroimaging and/or clinical features were identified for <i>MT-ATP6</i> (m.9176 T &gt; C)<i>, MT-ND5, PDHA1, SUCLG1,</i> and <i>SURF1</i>. Poorest survival was associated with <i>MT-ND5, MT-ATP6</i> (m.8993 T &gt; C and m.9176 T &gt; C), <i>SURF1</i>, and <i>ALDH5A1</i> (≤50% 3 year survival), in contrast to milder defects with specific treatment (<i>ECHS1</i> and <i>SLC19A3</i>, 100% 3 year survival).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our data define phenotype, onset, and survival of LS in a defect-specific manner, identifying features discriminating between genetic defects and predictive of disease outcome. These findings are essential to early diagnosis, in optimizing family counselling, and to the design and monitoring of future clinical trials, the next frontier of LS research.</p>

                As SARS-CoV-2 variants accumulate mutations, there is a risk of ineffective neutralizing antibodies against new variants and potential re-infection. Halfmann et al. report that, in the hamster model, previous infection with an early prototypical SARS-CoV-2 isolate prevents re-infection of the Delta variant and its transmission to naïve hamsters.

                Invasive electromyography opened a new window to explore motoneuron behaviour in vivo. However, the technique is limited by the small fraction of active motoneurons that can be concurrently detected, precluding a population analysis in natural tasks. Here, we developed a high-density intramuscular electrode for in vivo human recordings along with a fully automatic methodology that could detect the discharges of action potentials of up to 67 concurrently active motoneurons with 99% accuracy. These data revealed that motoneurons of the same pool receive common synaptic input at frequencies up to 75 Hz and that late recruited motoneurons inhibit the discharges of those recruited earlier. These results constitute an important step in the population coding analysis of the human motor system in vivo.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Evolution of neural activity in circuits bridging sensory and abstract knowledge</a></h4>

              
                The ability to associate sensory stimuli with abstract classes is critical for survival. How are these associations implemented in brain circuits? And what governs how neural activity evolves during abstract knowledge acquisition? To investigate these questions, we consider a circuit model that learns to map sensory inputs into abstract classes via gradient descent synaptic plasticity. We focus on typical neuroscience tasks (simple, and context-dependent, categorization), and study how both synaptic connectivity and neural activity evolve during learning. To make contact with the current generation of experiments we focus on the latter, and analyze activity via standard measures such as selectivity, correlations, and tuning symmetry. We find that the model is able to capture experimental observations, including seemingly disparate ones. We determine how, in the model, the behaviour of these activity measures depends on details of the circuit and the task. These dependencies make experimentally-testable predictions about the circuitry supporting abstract knowledge acquisition in the brain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neuronal membrane proteasomes homeostatically regulate neural circuit activity in vivo and are required for learning-induced behavioral plasticity</a></h4>

              
                Protein degradation is critical for brain function through processes that remain poorly understood. Here we investigated the in vivo function of a recently reported neuronal membrane-associated proteasome (NMP) in the brain of Xenopus laevis tadpoles. We demonstrated that NMPs are present in the tadpole brain with biochemistry and electron microscopy, and showed that they actively degrade neuronal activity-induced nascent proteins. Using in vivo calcium imaging in the optic tectum, we showed that acute inhibition of NMP function rapidly increased spontaneous neuronal activity, resulting in hyper-synchronization among tectal neurons. At the circuit level, inhibiting NMPs abolished learning-dependent improvement in a visuomotor behavior paradigm in live animals. Our data provide the first in vivo characterization of NMP functions in the vertebrate nervous system and suggest that NMP-mediated degradation of activity-induced nascent proteins may serve as a homeostatic modulatory mechanism in neurons that is critical for regulating neuronal activity and experience-dependent circuit plasticity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cannabinoid receptor 1 is required for neurodevelopment of striosome-dendron bouquets</a></h4>

              
                Cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1R) has strong effects on neurogenesis and axon pathfinding in the prenatal brain. Endocannabinoids that activate CB1R are abundant in the early postnatal brain and in mothers milk, but few studies have investigated their function in newborns. We examined postnatal CB1R expression in the major striatonigral circuit from striosomes of the striatum to the dopamine-containing neurons of the substantia nigra. CB1R enrichment was first detectable between postnatal days 5 and 7, and this timing coincided with the formation of striosome-dendron bouquets, the elaborate anatomical structures by which striosomal neurons control dopaminergic cell activity through inhibitory synapses. In Cnr1 knockouts lacking CB1R expression, striosome-dendron bouquets were markedly disorganized by postnatal day 11 and at adulthood, suggesting a postnatal pathfinding connectivity function for CB1R in connecting striosomal axons and dopaminergic neurons analogous to CB1Rs prenatal function in other brain regions. Our finding that CB1R plays a major role in postnatal wiring of the striatonigral dopamine system, with lasting consequences at least in mice, points to a crucial need to determine whether lactating mothers use of CB1R agonists (e.g., in marijuana) or antagonists (e.g., type 2 diabetes therapies) can disrupt brain development in nursing offspring.

                Objective CRISPR-Cas9-generated zebrafish carrying a 12 base-pair deletion in stxbpb1b, a paralog sharing 79% amino acid sequence identity with human, exhibit spontaneous electrographic seizures during larval stages of development. Zebrafish stxbp1b mutants provide an efficient preclinical platform to test antiseizure therapeutics. The present study was designed to test prototype antiepileptic drugs approved for clinical use and two recently identified repurposed drugs with antiseizure activity. Methods Larval homozygous stxbp1b zebrafish (4 days post-fertilization) were agarose-embedded and monitored for electrographic seizure activity using a local field recording electrode placed in midbrain. Frequency of ictal-like events was evaluated at baseline and following 45 min of continuous drug exposure (1 mM, bath application). Analysis was performed on coded files by an experimenter blinded to drug treatment and genotype. Results Phenytoin, valproate, ethosuximide, levetiracetam, and diazepam had no effect on ictal-like event frequency in stxbp1b mutant zebrafish. Clemizole and trazodone decreased ictal-like event frequency in stxbp1b mutant zebrafish by 80% and 83%, respectively. These results suggest that repurposed drugs with serotonin receptor binding affinities could be effective antiseizure treatments. Significance Clemizole and trazodone were identified in a larval zebrafish model for Dravet syndrome. Based primarily on these preclinical zebrafish studies, compassionate-use and double-blind clinical trials with both drugs have progressed. The present study extends this approach to a preclinical zebrafish model representing STXBP1-related disorders, and suggests that future clinical studies may be warranted.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The NAD+ precursor NMN activates dSarm to trigger axon degeneration in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Axon degeneration contributes to the disruption of neuronal circuit function in diseased and injured nervous systems. Severed axons degenerate following the activation of an evolutionarily conserved signaling pathway, which culminates in the activation of SARM1 in mammals to execute the pathological depletion of the metabolite NAD+. SARM1 NADase activity is activated by the NAD+ precursor nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN). In mammals, keeping NMN levels low potently preserves axons after injury, however, it remains unclear whether NMN is also a key mediator of axon degeneration, and dSarm activation, in flies. Here, we demonstrate that lowering NMN levels in Drosophila through the expression of a newly generated prokaryotic NMN-Deamidase (NMN-D) preserves severed axons for months and keeps them circuit-integrated for weeks. NMN-D alters the NAD+ metabolic flux by lowering NMN, while NAD+ remains unchanged in vivo. Increased NMN synthesis, by the expression of mouse nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (mNAMPT), leads to faster axon degeneration after injury. We also show that NMN-induced activation of dSarm mediates axon degeneration in vivo. Finally, NMN-D delays neurodegeneration caused by loss of the sole NMN-consuming and NAD+-synthesizing enzyme dNmnat. Our results reveal a critical role for NMN in neurodegeneration in Drosophila, which extends beyond axonal injury. The potent neuroprotection by reducing NMN levels is similar or even stronger than the interference with other essential mediators of axon degeneration in Drosophila.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Interplay between rule learning and rule switching in a perceptual categorization task</a></h4>

              
                When performing a task in a changing world, sometimes we switch between rules already learned; at other times we must learn rules anew. Often we must do both, switching between known rules while also constantly re-estimating them. Here, we show these two processes, rule switching and rule learning, rely on distinct but intertwined computations, namely fast inference and slower incremental learning. To this end, we studied how monkeys switched between three rules. Each rule was compositional, requiring the animal to discriminate one of two features of a stimulus and then respond with an associated eye movement along one of two different response axes. By modeling behavior we found the animals learned the axis of response using fast inference (rule switching) while continuously re-estimating the stimulus-response associations within an axis (rule learning). Our results shed light on the computational interactions between rule switching and rule learning, and make testable neural predictions for these interactions.

	<p>Nervous system involvement in patients with SLE, termed neuropsychiatric SLE (NPSLE), constitutes a diagnostic challenge, and its management is still poorly optimised. This review summarises recent insights over the past decade in laboratory biomarkers of diagnosis, monitoring, and prognosis of NPSLE. An initial systematic search in the Medline and Web of Science was conducted to guide the selection of articles. Emerging diagnostic biomarkers in NPSLE that displayed satisfactory ability to discriminate between NPSLE and controls include serum interleukin (IL)-6, microRNA (miR)-23a, miR-155, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) &amp;amp;alpha;-Klotho. CSF lipocalin-2, macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), and immunoglobulin (Ig)M also displayed such ability in two ethnically diverse cohorts. Serum interferon (IFN)-&amp;amp;alpha; and neuron specific enolase (NSE) were recently reported to moderately correlate with disease activity in patients with active NPSLE. CSF IL-8, IL-13, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) exhibited excellent sensitivity, yet poorer specificity, as predictors of response to therapy in patients with NPSLE. The overall lack of validation studies across multiple and diverse cohorts necessitates further and well-concerted investigations. Nevertheless, we propound CSF lipocalin 2 among molecules that hold promise as reliable diagnostic biomarkers in NPSLE.</p>

	<p>Gelsemine is an active principle and a major alkaloid found in Gelsemium genus of plants belonging to the Loganiaceae family. The aim of the present study was to explore whether gelsemine exerts anxiolytic effects on a mouse model of chronic-unpredictable-mild-stress (CUMS)-induced anxiety-like behaviors. NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, downregulated cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were also evaluated as potential mechanisms. First, gelsemine reversed a CUMS-induced decrease in body-weight gain in mice. Next, gelsemine alleviated CUMS-induced anxiety-like behaviors, as evidenced by the increased distance traveled in the central zone of the open-field test, both the increased percentage of time spent and distance traveled in the light compartment, the increased number of transitions between compartments in the light/dark-transition test, and the increased percentage of entries and time spent in the open arm of the elevated plus-maze. In addition, gelsemine decreased the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-1&amp;amp;beta; and IL-6, in the hypothalamus and hippocampus of CUMS mice. Interestingly, further investigations revealed that gelsemine inhibited the CUMS-induced activation of NLRP3-inflammasome pathways and downregulated CREB and BDNF overexpression in the hypothalamus. In summary, gelsemine alleviated anxiety-like behaviors in the CUMS-induced mouse model. Gelsemine exerted its anxiolytic effects by modulating the NLRP3 and CREB/BDNF pathways.</p>

	<p>Ever since it was first reported in Wuhan, China, the coronavirus-induced disease of 2019 (COVID-19) has become an enigma of sorts with ever expanding reports of direct and indirect effects of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on almost all the vital organ systems. Along with inciting acute pulmonary complications, the virus attacks the cardiac, renal, hepatic, and gastrointestinal systems as well as the central nervous system (CNS). The person-to-person variability in susceptibility of individuals to disease severity still remains a puzzle, although the comorbidities and the age/gender of a person are believed to play a key role. SARS-CoV-2 needs angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor for its infectivity, and the association between SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 leads to a decline in ACE2 activity and its neuroprotective effects. Acute respiratory distress may also induce hypoxia, leading to increased oxidative stress and neurodegeneration. Infection of the neurons along with peripheral leukocytes&amp;amp;rsquo; activation results in proinflammatory cytokine release, rendering the brain more susceptible to neurodegenerative changes. Due to the advancement in molecular biology techniques and vaccine development programs, the world now has hope to relatively quickly study and combat the deadly virus. On the other side, however, the virus seems to be still evolving with new variants being discovered periodically. In keeping up with the pace of this virus, there has been an avalanche of studies. This review provides an update on the recent progress in adjudicating the CNS-related mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection and its potential to incite or accelerate neurodegeneration in surviving patients. Current as well as emerging therapeutic opportunities and biomarker development are highlighted.</p>

	<p>Mephedrone belongs to the &amp;amp;ldquo;party drugs&amp;amp;rdquo; thanks to its psychostimulant effects, similar to the ones observed after amphetamines. Though mephedrone is used worldwide by humans and in laboratory animals, not all properties of this drug have been discovered yet. Therefore, the main aim of this study was to expand the knowledge about mephedrone&amp;amp;rsquo;s activity in living organisms. A set of behavioral tests (i.e., measurement of the spontaneous locomotor activity, rotarod, chimney, elevated plus maze with its modification, novel object recognition, and pentylenetetrazol seizure tests) were carried out in male albino Swiss mice. Different dose ranges of mephedrone (0.05&amp;amp;ndash;5 mg/kg) were administered. We demonstrated that mephedrone at a dose of 5 mg/kg rapidly increased the spontaneous locomotor activity of the tested mice and its repeated administration led to the development of tolerance to these effects. Mephedrone showed the anxiolytic-like potential and improved spatial memory, but it did not affect recognition memory. Moreover, the drug seemed not to have any anticonvulsant or proconvulsant activity. In conclusion, mephedrone induces many central effects. It easily crosses the blood-brain barrier and peaks in the brain quickly after exposure. Our experiment on inducing a hyperlocomotion effect showed that mephedrone&amp;amp;lsquo;s effects are transient and lasted for a relatively short time.</p>

	<p>Asian Americans are disproportionately affected by chronic hepatitis B (CHB), with incidence and mortality rates well above those experienced by non-Hispanic white populations. The goal of this study was to examine the association between depression and modifiable lifestyle behaviors among Asian Americans with CHB, with a comparison between those on hepatitis medication and those not on medication. In total, 313 Asian Americans with CHB were recruited through outpatient clinics and community-based organizations to participate in an in-person baseline assessment. We collected data on participants&amp;amp;rsquo; sociodemographic characteristics, health-related behaviors, depression symptoms, and modifiable lifestyle behaviors. Bivariate analyses (two sample t-test and chi-square test of independence) and multivariable logistic regression were conducted. We found a high prevalence of depression among individuals living with CHB (41.81% among those not on antiviral medication and 39.71% among those on medication). Multivariate logistic regression results showed that Chinese ethnicity (vs. Vietnamese) and lack of physical activity were significantly associated with a higher risk of mild/severe depression, regardless of medication status. However, the protective effect of physical activity was strong for those on antiviral medication. Furthermore, being employed was significantly associated with a lower risk for depression among Asian Americans on medication, while younger age and being currently married were significantly associated with lower risk of depression among those not on medication. Our findings highlight the significance of physical activity among Asian Americans with CHB, especially for those on antiviral medication. Future prospective research efforts are needed to better identify the potential behavioral mechanisms of depression and provide insights for the psychopharmacological management in this vulnerable population.</p>

	<p>Background: Gray matter (GM) density and cortical thickness (CT) obtained from structural magnetic resonance imaging are representative GM morphological measures that have been commonly used in Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD) subtype research. However, how the two measures affect the definition of AD subtypes remains unclear. Methods: A total of 180 AD patients from the ADNI database were used to identify AD subgroups. The subtypes were identified via a data-driven strategy based on the density features and CT features, respectively. Then, the similarity between the two features in AD subtype definition was analyzed. Results: Four distinct subtypes were discovered by both density and CT features: diffuse atrophy AD, minimal atrophy AD (MAD), left temporal dominant atrophy AD (LTAD), and occipital sparing AD. The matched subtypes exhibited relatively high similarity in atrophy patterns and neuropsychological and neuropathological characteristics. They differed only in MAD and LTAD regarding the carrying of apolipoprotein E &amp;amp;epsilon;2. Conclusions: The results verified that different representative morphological GM measurement methods could produce similar AD subtypes. Meanwhile, the influences of apolipoprotein E genotype, asymmetric disease progression, and their interactions should be considered and included in the AD subtype definition. This study provides a valuable reference for selecting features in future studies of AD subtypes.</p>

	<p>Motor imagery (MI) refers to the mental rehearsal of movement in the absence of overt motor action, which can activate or inhibit cortical excitability. EEG mu/beta oscillations recorded over the human motor cortex have been shown to be consistently suppressed during both the imagination and performance of movements, although the specific effect on brain function remains to be confirmed. In this study, Granger causality (GC) was used to construct the brain functional network of subjects during motor imagery and resting state based on EEG in order to explore the effects of motor imagery on brain function. Parameters of the brain functional network were compared and analyzed, including degree, clustering coefficient, characteristic path length and global efficiency of EEG mu/beta rhythm in different states. The results showed that the clustering coefficient and efficiency of EEG mu/beta rhythm decreased significantly during motor imagery (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05), while degree distribution and characteristic path length increased significantly (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05), mainly concentrated in the frontal lobe and sensorimotor area. For the resting state after motor imagery, the changes of brain functional characteristics were roughly similar to those of the task state. Therefore, it is concluded that motor imagery plays an important role in activation of cortical excitability.</p>

	<p>We aimed to search whether neurological symptoms or signs (NSS) and the MEWS (Modified Early Warning Score) score were associated with in-hospital mortality or oxygen requirement during the first 14 days of hospitalization in COVID-19 patients recruited at the University Hospital in Krakow, Poland. The detailed clinical questionnaires on twenty NSS were either filled out by patients prospectively or retrospectively assessed by neurologists based on daily medical records. NSS were considered high or low-risk if they were associated with increased or decreased mortality in the univariable analysis. This cohort study included 349 patients with COVID-19 (median age 64, interquartile range (51&amp;amp;ndash;77), women 54.72%). The presence of high-risk NSS (decreased level of consciousness, delirium, seizures, and symptoms of stroke or transient ischemic attack) or its combination with the absence of low-risk NSS (headache, dizziness, decreased mood, and fatigue) increased the risk of in-hospital mortality in SARS-CoV-2 infection 3.13 and 7.67-fold, respectively. The presence of low-risk NSS decreased the risk of in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients more than 6-fold. Death in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, apart from NSS, was predicted by older age, neoplasm, and higher MEWS scores on admission. High-risk NSS or their combination with the absence of low-risk NSS increased the risk of oxygen requirement during hospitalization in COVID-19 patients 4.48 and 1.86-fold, respectively. Independent predictors of oxygen therapy during hospitalization in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection were also older age, male sex, neoplasm, and higher MEWS score on admission.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The propensity to sign-track is associated with externalizing behaviour and distinct patterns of reward-related brain activation in youth</a></h4>

              
                Externalizing behaviours in childhood often predict impulse control disorders in adulthood; however, the underlying biobehavioural risk factors are incompletely understood. In animals, the propensity to sign-track, or the degree to which incentive motivational value is attributed to reward cues, is associated with externalizing-type behaviours and deficits in executive control. Using a Pavlovian conditioned approach paradigm, we quantified sign-tracking in healthy 9-12-year-olds. We also measured parent-reported externalizing behaviours and anticipatory neural activations to outcome-predicting cues using the monetary incentive delay fMRI task. Sign-tracking was associated with attentional and inhibitory control deficits and the degree of amygdala, but not cortical, activation during reward anticipation. These findings support the hypothesis that youth with a propensity to sign-track are prone to externalizing tendencies, with an over-reliance on subcortical cue-reactive brain systems. This research highlights sign-tracking as a promising experimental approach delineating the behavioural and neural circuitry of individuals at risk for externalizing disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Nonlinear super-resolution signal processing for subcellular analysis of calcium dynamics</a></h4>

              
                Optical (fluorescence) imaging of ionic dynamics has revolutionized neuroscience as it allows the study of neural activity across spatially identified populations. Quantification of fluorescence signals is commonly performed using ratiometric measures, like the {Delta}F/F. Although these measures are robust and easy to implement, they do not take advantage of the temporal information available in time-varying signals. Moreover, since a baseline (reference) period needs to be selected, their application is often limited to the quantification of stimulus-evoked activity. Here, we present a new approach, called ARES, based on the quantification of residuals after linear autoregression. We demonstrate the utility of ARES to quantify the functional dynamics of stimulus representation in cortical networks and show that it improves the spatial and temporal resolution with respect to {Delta}F/F. We further show that ARES can be used to study subcellular calcium dynamics and exemplify its utility to describe the spatiotemporal dynamics of calcium signal localization in compartmental network recordings. ARES offers a novel method for quantitative analysis of optical imaging data

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">GABABR agonist baclofen promotes central nervous system remyelination</a></h4>

              
                Promoting remyelination - the endogenous response by which lost myelin sheaths are regenerated - is considered as a potential neuroprotective strategy to prevent/limit the development of permanent neurological disability in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). To this end, a number of clinical trials are investigating the potential of existing drugs to enhance oligodendrocyte progenitor cell (OPC) differentiation, the process that fails in chronic MS lesions. As we previously reported that oligodendroglia lineage cells express GABAB receptors (GABABRs) both in vitro and in vivo, and that GABABR-mediated signaling enhances OPC differentiation and myelination in vitro, here we focused on the remyelinating potential of the best-known GABABR agonist baclofen (Bac), already approved to treat spasticity in MS. We demonstrated that Bac increases myelin protein production following lysolecithin (LPC)-induced demyelination in cerebellar ex vivo slices. In addition, Bac administration enhanced OPC differentiation and remyelination in LPC-induced spinal cord lesions in adult mice. Thus, our results suggest that Bac should be considered as a potential therapeutic agent, not only to treat spasticity, but also to improve remyelination in patients with MS.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Categorization and discrimination of human and non-human primate affective vocalizations: investigation of the frontal cortex activity through fNIRS.</a></h4>

              
                Many species, including humans and non-human primates, react differently to threatening or pleasant situations. Because of its adaptiveness, recognizing affective signals is likely to be reflected in a capability of modern humans to recognize other closely related species call content. However, at both behavioural and neural levels, only few studies have used a comparative approach to understand affective decoding processes in humans, particularly with respect to affective vocalizations. Previous research in neuroscience about the recognition of human affective vocalizations has shown the critical involvement of temporal and frontal regions. In particular, frontal regions have been reported as crucial in the explicit decoding of vocal emotions especially in different task complexity such as discrimination or categorization. The aim of this study using functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) was to specifically investigate the neural activity of the inferior frontal cortex pars triangularis (IFGtri) and the prefrontal cortex (PFC) underlying categorization (A versus B) and discrimination (A versus non-A) mechanisms of positive and negative affects in human, great apes (chimpanzee and bonobo), and monkey (rhesus macaque) vocalizations. We also analysed participants behavioural responses and correlated them with the recorded frontal activations. While performing the tasks, fNIRS data revealed a clear distinction between the two frontal regions, with a general positive activation of IFGtri compared to a decrease of PFC activity. We also found a modulation of IFGtri and PFC activations depending on both the species considered and on task complexity; with generally more activity in the IFGtri during discrimination compared to categorization, and a more intense decrease of the PFC in categorization compared to discrimination. Behaviourally, participants recognized almost all affective cues in all species vocalizations at above chance levels in the discrimination task (except for threatening bonobo calls). For categorization, they mostly correctly identified at levels significantly above chance affective contents in human and great ape vocalizations but not in macaque calls. Overall, these findings support the hypothesis of a pre-human origin of affective recognition processing inherited from our common ancestor with other great apes and processed in the frontal cortex. Our results also highlight behavioural differences related to task complexity, i.e. between categorization and discrimination processes, and the differential involvement of the PFC and the IFGtri, which seems necessary to explicitly decode affects in all primate vocalizations.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Learning the Vector Coding of Egocentric Boundary Cells from Visual Data</a></h4>

              
                The use of spatial maps to navigate through the world requires a complex ongoing transformation of egocentric views of the environment into position within the allocentric map. Recent research has discovered neurons in retrosplenial cortex and other structures that could mediate the transformation from egocentric views to allocentric views. These egocentric boundary cells (EBCs) respond to the egocentric direction and distance of barriers relative to an animals point of view. This egocentric coding based on the visual features of barriers would seem to require complex dynamics of cortical interactions. However, computational models presented here show that egocentric boundary cells can be generated with a remarkably simple synaptic learning rule that forms a sparse representation of visual input as an animal explores the environment. Simulation of this simple sparse synaptic modification generates a population of egocentric boundary cells with distributions of direction and distance coding that strikingly resemble those observed within the retrosplenial cortex. This provides a framework for understanding the properties of neuronal populations in the retrosplenial cortex that may be essential for interfacing egocentric sensory information with allocentric spatial maps of the world formed by neurons in downstream areas including the grid cells in entorhinal cortex and place cells in the hippocampus.

                The representation of the surrounding world emerges through integration of sensory information and actions. We present a novel neural model which implements non-local, parallel information processing on a neocolumnar architecture with lateral interconnections. Information is integrated into a holographic wave interference pattern. We compare the simulated in silico pattern with observed in vivo invasive and non-invasive electrophysiological data in human and non-human primates. Our model replicates the modulation of neural high-frequency activity during visual perception showing that phase-locked low and high-frequency oscillations self-organize efficiently and carry high information content. The simulation further models how criticality (high content) of information processing emerges given a sufficiently high number of correlated neurons. Non-local information processing, forming one holographic wave pattern, suggests a platform for emergence of conscious perception.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Circadian volume changes in hippocampal glia studied by label-free interferometric imaging</a></h4>

              
                Complex brain functions, including learning and memory, arise in part from the modulatory role of astrocytes on neuronal circuits. Functionally, the dentate gyrus (DG) exhibits differences in the acquisition of long-term potentiation (LTP) between day and night. We hypothesize that the dynamic nature of astrocyte morphology plays an important role in the functional circuitry of hippocampal learning and memory, specifically in the DG. Standard microscopy techniques, such as differential interference contrast (DIC), present insufficient contrast for detecting changes in astrocyte structure and function and are unable to inform on the intrinsic structure of the sample in a quantitative manner. Recently, gradient light interference microscopy (GLIM) has been developed to upgrade a DIC microscope with quantitative capabilities such as single-cell dry mass and volume characterization. Here, we present a methodology for combining GLIM and electrophysiology to quantify the astrocyte morphological behavior over the day-night cycle. Co-localized measurements of GLIM and fluorescence allowed us to quantify the dry masses and volumes of hundreds of astrocytes. Our results indicate that, on average, there is a 25% cell volume reduction during the nocturnal cycle. Remarkably, this cell volume change takes place at constant dry mass, which suggests that the volume regulation occurs primarily through aqueous medium exchange with the environment.

                Animals live in highly dynamic worlds, utilising sensorimotor circuits to rapidly process information and drive behaviours. For example, dragonflies are aerial predators which react to movements of prey within tens of milliseconds. These pursuits are likely controlled by identified neurons in the dragonfly, which have well-characterized physiological responses to moving targets. Predominantly, neural activity in these circuits are interpreted in the context of a rate code, where information is conveyed by changes in the number of spikes over a given time. However, such a description of neuronal activity is difficult to achieve in real-world, real-time scenarios. Here, we contrast a neuroscientists post-hoc view of spiking activity with the information available to the animal in real-time. We describe how performance of a rate code is readily overestimated and outline a rate codes significant limitations in driving rapid behaviours.

                Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is characterized by the progressive degeneration of motor neurons accompanied by the accumulation of the morphologically and functionally altered glial cells. Reactive astrocytes and microglia secrete pro-inflammatory mediators and contribute to disease progression. Notably, oligodendrocyte functions are disrupted in ALS, including trophic support, myelination, and oligodendrocyte differentiation. ALS patients and mutant SOD1 mice models display reduced levels of myelin basic protein (MBP) and monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1) contributing to impairment of oligodendrocyte function. Lactate, an active metabolite capable of moving into or out of cells, acts as a signaling molecule, transported exclusively by monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs) .We showed previously, that AMD3100 increases the lactate transporter MCT1 in an animal models of Alzheimers disease (AD) and ALS. AMD3100 is a reversible antagonist of CXCR4, and therefore inhibits the CXCR4/CXCL12 axis. AMD3100 was shown to have beneficial effects on extension of SOD1G93A mice life-span and enabling migration of hematopoietic stem cells (HSPCs) from bone marrow to periphery. The low content of lactate and transporters in SOD1G93A mice model led us to propose a novel combined treatment with AMD3100 and exogeneous L-lactate. The combined treatment attenuated neuroinflammation and remyelination but did not have a significant extension of SOD1G93A mice life-span compared with AMD3100 treatment alone.

	<p>One growing area of multitasking research involves a focus on performing cognitive and motor tasks in tandem. In these situations, increasing either cognitive or motor demands has implications for performance in both tasks, an effect which is thought to be due to competing neural resources. Separate research suggests that non-invasive brain stimulation may offer a means to mitigate performance decrements experienced during multitasking. In the present study, we investigated the degree to which a commercially available non-invasive brain stimulation device (Halo Sport) alters balance performance in the presence of different types of cognitive demands. Specifically, we tested if performing a secondary cognitive task impacts postural sway in healthy young adults and if we could mitigate this impact using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) applied over the primary motor cortex. Furthermore, we included conditions of unstable and stable surfaces and found that lower surface stability increased postural sway. In addition, we found that cognitive load impacted postural sway but in the opposite pattern we had anticipated, with higher sway found in the single-task control condition compared to executive function conditions. Finally, we found a small but significant effect of tDCS on balance with decreased sway for active (compared to sham) tDCS.</p>

	<p>Number sense is the ability to estimate the number of items, and it is common to many species. Despite the numerous studies dedicated to unveiling how numerosity is processed in the human brain, to date, it is not clear whether the representation of numerosity is supported by a single general mechanism or by multiple mechanisms. Since it is known that deafness entails a selective impairment in the processing of temporal information, we assessed the approximate numerical abilities of deaf individuals to disentangle these two hypotheses. We used a numerosity discrimination task (2AFC) and an estimation task, in both cases using sequential (temporal) or simultaneous (spatial) stimuli. The results showed a selective impairment of the deaf participants compared with the controls (hearing) in the temporal numerosity discrimination task, while no difference was found to discriminate spatial numerosity. Interestingly, the deaf and hearing participants did not differ in spatial or temporal numerosity estimation. Overall, our results suggest that the deficit in temporal processing induced by deafness also impacts perception in other domains such as numerosity, where sensory information is conveyed in a temporal format, which further suggests the existence of separate mechanisms subserving the processing of temporal and spatial numerosity.</p>

	<p>The study of the contribution of spatial transformation skills to driving behavior is a research topic substantiated by scarce evidence. In previous studies, we found that mental rotation and perspective-taking skills have an influence on performance in driving tasks by conveying the distal effects of the general cognitive efficiency on the execution of driving maneuvers. Studies have provided evidence on the relevance of the cognitive processes of encoding, imagined rotation, and spatial orientation in the accuracy of both the vehicle management during stressful driving situations and the acquisition of visual information on the traffic scenario. Results can find applications in both the training and the assessment of fitness to drive, as well as in the study of interaction between the drivers and in-vehicle devices. The lack of cross-validations in path analysis models cannot be assumed, a priori, to be capitalizing on chance and as an example of bad science. The non-replicability of a study should be demonstrated before it is proclaimed. The purpose of this reply was to address the questions raised by Kelly et al. (2022)&amp;amp;mdash;that is, &amp;amp;ldquo;Do these results seem replicable?&amp;amp;rdquo; and &amp;amp;ldquo;How do these results advance our understanding of brain function and/or human behavior?&amp;amp;rdquo;&amp;amp;mdash;by providing additional information on the study in question.</p>

	<p>Acute aerobic high-intensity interval exercise (HIIE) has demonstrated positive effects on inhibitory control and P3 event-related potential (ERP) in young adults. However, the evidence is not well established regarding the effects of different HIIE modalities that incorporate aerobic-resistance training on these cognitive and neurocognitive outcomes. The purpose of this investigation was to examine the transient effects of HIIE-aerobic and HIIE-aerobic/resistance on P3 and Flanker task performance. Participants (n = 24; 18&amp;amp;ndash;25 years old) completed the Flanker task at two time points (30 min and 85 min) following 9 min of HIIE-aerobic (intermittent bouts of walking and running at 90% of maximal heart rate), HIIE-aerobic/resistance (intermittent bouts of walking and high-intensity calisthenics), and seated rest on three separate counterbalanced days. Results revealed no changes in Flanker performance (i.e., reaction time and response accuracy) or P3 (latency and mean amplitude) following either HIIE conditions compared to seated rest. Together, these data suggest inhibitory control and neuroelectric underpinnings are not affected by different modalities of HIIE at 30 min and 85 min post-exercise. Such findings reveal that engaging in short bouts of different HIIE modalities for overall health neither improves nor diminishes inhibitory control and brain function for an extended period throughout the day.</p>

	<p>Background: Cognitive deficits are common in multiple sclerosis (MS) and affect patients at all stages of the disease, regardless of phenotype. Aims: This literature review focuses the cognitive deficits observed in secondary progressive MS (SPMS). It is mainly based on studies that compared the frequency and main characteristics of cognitive deficits in SPMS with other phenotypes. Methods: A bibliographic search was carried out using the PubMed database with the following keywords: multiple sclerosis, secondary-progressive, cognition. Results: Thirteen studies were initially selected that were published in English, reporting the neuropsychological data of a sample of at least 30 patients with SPMS, comparing them with patients with other phenotypes. Studies suggest that there is an association between the duration of the disease and the frequency and extent of the cognitive disorders. Studies also showed that the SP form is associated with an increased frequency of cognitive impairment and with an increased severity as compared to relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). Compared to RRMS, progressive forms of MS are associated with more severe impairment in certain cognitive areas, such as episodic verbal memory, information processing speed, working memory, or verbal fluency. Two studies showed that cognitive performances decline overtime in SPMS. Conclusion: Cognitive disorders are more frequent and more severe in the SP form than in relapsing course of MS. The profile of cognitive impairment encountered in the SP form also appears to be different from those found in the other phenotypes.</p>

	<p>Early life trauma has a negative impact on the developing brain, and this can lead to a wide range of mental illnesses later in life. Childhood trauma is associated with increased psychotic symptoms and negative emotions such as depressive, anxiety, and stress symptoms in adulthood. Childhood trauma has also been shown to influence sub-clinical &amp;amp;lsquo;schizotypy&amp;amp;rsquo; characteristics of psychosis in the general population. As it has been reported that mental health outcomes after early life trauma exposure are influenced by gender, the current study aimed to investigate the gender differences in the relationship between childhood trauma, schizotypy and negative emotions. Sixty-one non-clinical participants (33 men and 28 women) aged between 18 and 45 completed self-report questionnaires to measure early life trauma, schizotypy and negative emotions. Despite similar levels of childhood trauma in men and women, early life trauma in women was associated with increased schizotypy personality characteristics (Cognitive Disorganisation) and increased depression, anxiety and stress later in life, but no correlations were observed in men. Our findings suggest that the sociocultural and biological processes affected by early life adversities may differ between the genders. Women may be more vulnerable to the influence of childhood trauma, which may be associated with increased psychopathology later in life.</p>

	<p>Recessive hereditary methemoglobinemia (RHM) due to NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase deficiency is a rare disease caused by pathogenic variants in CYB5R3. Unlike type I, in RHM type II (RHM2), the enzymatic defect affects erythrocytes and all body tissues, thus resulting in cyanosis and neurological impairment. Although the first description of RHM2 dates back to the mid-1950s, detailed clinical and neuroimaging information are available for only a few patients. Here, we describe a new patient with RHM2 that harbors an unreported homozygous 31 Kb deletion involving part of CYB5R3, and showing a peculiar neuroimaging pattern resembling a ponto-cerebellar hypoplasia-like condition. A careful review of the available literature was performed with the aim of better delineating neurological and neuroimaging as well as the genotypic spectra of this extremely rare disease.</p>

	<p>Prominent cortical vessels on susceptibility-weighted imaging (PCV&amp;amp;ndash;SWI) correlate with poor leptomeningeal collaterals. However, little is known about PCV&amp;amp;ndash;SWI in recanalization therapy-treated patients with anterior circulation large vessel occlusions (LVO). We investigated PCV&amp;amp;ndash;SWI-based assessment of leptomeningeal collaterals and outcome predictions in 100 such patients in an observational study. We assessed PCV&amp;amp;ndash;SWI using the Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score and evaluated leptomeningeal collaterals on multiphase CT angiography (mCTA). Predictive abilities were analyzed using multivariable logistic regression and area of receiver operating curves (AUCs). The extent of PCV&amp;amp;ndash;SWI correlated with leptomeningeal collaterals on mCTA (Spearman test, r = 0.77; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001); their presence was associated with worse functional outcomes and a lower successful recanalization rate (adjusted odds ratios = 0.24 and 0.23, 95% CIs = 0.08&amp;amp;ndash;0.65 and 0.08&amp;amp;ndash;0.65, respectively). The presence of PCV&amp;amp;ndash;SWI predicted outcomes better than good collaterals on mCTA did (C-statistic = 0.84 vs. 0.80; 3-month modified Rankin Scale (mRS) 0&amp;amp;ndash;2 = 0.75 vs. 0.67 for successful recanalization). Comparison of AUCs showed that they had similar abilities for predicting outcomes (p = 0.68 for 3-month mRS 0&amp;amp;ndash;2; p = 0.23 for successful recanalization). These results suggest that PCV&amp;amp;ndash;SWI is a useful feature for assessing leptomeningeal collaterals in acute ischemic stroke patients with anterior circulation LVO and predicting outcomes after recanalization therapy.</p>

	<p>Background: Emerging molecular and genetic biomarkers have been introduced to classify gliomas in the past decades. Here, we introduced a risk signature based on the cellular response to the IL-4 gene set through Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression analysis. Methods: In this study, we provide a bioinformatic profiling of our risk signature for the malignancy, prognosis and immune phenotype of glioma. A cohort of 325 patients with whole genome RNA-seq expression data from the Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA) dataset was used as the training set, while another cohort of 667 patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset was used as the validating set. The LASSO model identified a 10-gene signature which was considered as the optimal model. Results: The signature was confirmed to be a good predictor of clinical and molecular features involved in the malignancy of gliomas. We also identified that our risk signature could serve as an independently prognostic biomarker in patients with gliomas (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001). Correlation analysis showed that our risk signature was strongly correlated with the Tregs, M0 macrophages and NK cells infiltrated in the microenvironment of glioma, which might be a supplement to the existing incomplete innate immune mechanism of glioma phenotypes. Conclusions: Our IL-4-related gene signature was associated with more aggressive and immunosuppressive phenotypes of gliomas. The risk score could predict prognosis independently in glioma, which might provide a new insight for understanding the IL-4 involved mechanism of gliomas.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Passive Proprioceptive Training Alters the Sensitivity of Muscle Spindles to Imposed Movements</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Humans rely on precise proprioceptive feedback from our muscles, which is important in both the acquisition and execution of movements, to perform daily activities. Somatosensory input from the body shapes motor learning through central processes, as demonstrated for tasks using the arm, under active (self-generated) and passive conditions. Presently, we investigated whether passive movement training of the ankle increased proprioceptive acuity (psychophysical experiment) and whether it changed the peripheral proprioceptive afferent signal (microneurography experiment). In the psychophysical experiment, the ankle of 32 healthy human participants was moved passively using pairs of ramp-and-hold movements in different directions. In a pretraining test, participants made judgements about the movement direction in a two-alternative forced choice paradigm. Participants then underwent passive movement training, but only half were cued for learning, where a reference position was signaled by a sound and the participant had to learn to recognize this position; they then completed a post-training test. In a paradigm using the same setup, nine healthy participants underwent microneurography recordings of Ia muscle afferents from the peroneal nerve, where all were cued during training. In the psychophysical experiment, proprioceptive acuity improved with training only in the cued group. In the microneurography experiment, we found that muscle afferent firing was modulated, via an increase in the dynamic index, after training. We suggest that changes in muscle afferent input from the periphery can contribute to and support central perceptual and motor learning, as shown under passive conditions using ankle movements, which may be exploited for movement rehabilitation.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Exposure of the fetus to alcohol (ethanol) via maternal consumption during pregnancy can result in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD), hallmarked by long-term physical, behavioral, and intellectual abnormalities. In our preclinical mouse model of FASD, prenatal ethanol exposure disrupts tangential migration of corticopetal GABAergic interneurons (GINs) in the embryonic medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). We postulated that ethanol perturbed the normal pattern of tangential migration via enhancing GABA<SUB>A</SUB> receptor-mediated membrane depolarization that prevails during embryonic development in GABAergic cortical interneurons. However, beyond this, our understanding of the underlying mechanisms is incomplete. Here, we tested the hypothesis that the ethanol-enhanced depolarization triggers downstream an increase in high-voltage-activated nifedipine-sensitive L-type calcium channel (LTCC) activity and provide evidence implicating calcium dynamics in the signaling scheme underlying the migration of embryonic GINs and its aberrance. Tangentially migrating Nkx2.1<sup>+</sup> GINs expressed immunoreactivity to Cav1.2, the canonical neuronal isoform of the L-type calcium channel. Prenatal ethanol exposure did not alter its protein expression profile in the embryonic mPFC. However, exposing ethanol concomitantly with the LTCC blocker nifedipine prevented the ethanol-induced aberrant migration both <I>in vitro</I> and <I>in vivo</I>. In addition, whole-cell patch clamp recording of LTCCs in GINs migrating in embryonic mPFC slices revealed that acutely applied ethanol potentiated LTCC activity in migrating GINs. Based on evidence reported in the present study, we conclude that calcium is an important intracellular intermediary downstream of GABA<SUB>A</SUB> receptor-mediated depolarization in the mechanistic scheme of an ethanol-induced aberrant tangential migration of embryonic GABAergic cortical interneurons.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Applications of GIS and geospatial analyses in COVID-19 research: A systematic review [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Geographic information science (GIS) has established itself as a distinct domain and incredibly useful whenever the research is related to geography, space, and other spatio-temporal dimensions. However, the scientific landscape on the integration of GIS in COVID-related studies is largely unknown. In this systematic review, we assessed the current evidence on the implementation of GIS and other geospatial tools in the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We systematically retrieved and reviewed 79 research articles that either directly used GIS or other geospatial tools as part of their analysis. We grouped the identified papers under six broader thematic groups based on the objectives and research questions of the study- environmental, socio-economic, and cultural, public health, spatial transmission, computer-aided modeling, and data mining. Results: The interdisciplinary nature of how geographic and spatial analysis was used in COVID-19 research was notable among the reviewed papers. Geospatial techniques, especially WebGIS, have even been widely used to visualize the data on a map and were critical to informing the public regarding the spread of the virus, especially during the early days of the pandemic. This review not only provided an overarching view on how GIS has been used in COVID-19 research so far but also concluded that geospatial analysis and technologies could be used in future public health emergencies along with statistical and other socio-economic modeling techniques. Our review also highlighted how scientific communities and policymakers could leverage GIS to extract useful information to make an informed decision in the future. Conclusions:  Despite the limited applications of GIS in identifying the nature and spatio-temporal pattern of this raging pandemic, there are opportunities to utilize these techniques in handling the pandemic. The use of spatial analysis and GIS could significantly improve how we understand the pandemic as well as address the underserviced demographic groups and communities.

                Background: Research Software is a concept that has been only recently clarified. In this paper we address the need for a similar enlightenment concerning the Research Data concept. Methods: Our contribution begins by reviewing the Research Software definition, which includes the analysis of software as a legal concept, followed by the study of its production in the research environment and within the Open Science framework. Then we explore the challenges of a data definition and some of the Research Data definitions proposed in the literature. Results: We propose a Research Data concept featuring three characteristics: the data should be produced (collected, processed, analyzed, shared & disseminated) to answer a scientific question, by a scientific team, and has yield a result published or disseminated in some article or scientific contribution of any kind. Conclusions: The analysis of this definition and the context in which it is proposed provides some answers to the Borgman’s conundrum challenges, that is, which Research Data might be shared, by whom, with whom, under what conditions, why, and to what effects. They are completed with answers to the questions: how? and where?

                Background: Open Science seeks to render research outputs visible, accessible and reusable. In this context, Research Data and Research Software sharing and dissemination issues provide real challenges to the scientific community, as consequence of recent progress in political, legal and funding requirements. Methods: We take advantage from the approach we have developed in a precedent publication, in which we have highlighted the similarities between the Research Data and Research Software definitions. Results: The similarities between Research Data and Research Software definitions can be extended to propose protocols for Research Data dissemination and evaluation derived from those already proposed for Research Software dissemination and evaluation. We also analyze FAIR principles for these outputs. Conclusions: Our proposals here provide concrete instructions for Research Data and Research Software producers to make them more findable and accessible, as well as arguments to choose suitable dissemination platforms to complete the FAIR framework. Future work could analyze the potential extension of this parallelism to other kinds of research outputs that are disseminated under similar conditions to those of Research Data and Research Software, that is, without widely accepted publication procedures involving editors or other external actors and where the dissemination is usually restricted through the hands of the production team.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Economic burden of out-of-pocket expenditure, productivity cost during pregnancy and COVID-19 impact on household economy in a cohort of pregnant women in Anuradhapura District, Sri Lanka; A study protocol [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservat</a></h4>

              
                Background: Investigating the out-of-pocket expenditure (OOPE) associated with maternal health is important since OOPE directly affects the affordability of health services. Global evidence suggests the importance of capturing the productivity cost during pregnancy in terms of absenteeism and presenteeism. Furthermore, the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on the household economy needs to be further evaluated as pregnant women are one of the most vulnerable groups. This study aims at determining the economic burden of OOPE, productivity cost, and COVID-19 impact on pregnant women's household economy in a cohort of pregnant women in Anuradhapura District, Sri Lanka. Methods: The study setting is all 22 Medical Officer of Health (MOH) areas in Anuradhapura district, Sri Lanka. The study has three components; a follow-up study of a cohort of pregnant women to assess the magnitude and associated factors of OOPE and to assess the productivity cost (Component 1), a qualitative case study to explore the impact and causes of the OOPE under free health services (Component 2) and a cross-sectional study to describe the effects of COVID-19 outbreak on household economy (Component 3). The study samples consist of 1,393 and 1,460 participants for components one and three, respectively, and 25 pregnant women will be recruited for component two. The data will be analyzed using descriptive, parametric, and non-parametric statistics for the first and third components and thematic analysis for the second component. Discussion: With the lack of evidence on OOPE, productivity loss/cost in terms of maternal health, and COVID-19 impact on household economy in Sri Lanka, the evidence generated from this study would be valuable for policymakers, health care administrators, and health care practitioners globally, regionally, and locally to plan for future measures for reducing the OOPE, productivity loss/cost, and minimizing the economic hardship of the COVID-19 outbreak during pregnancy.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Towards an interprofessional competency-based model in South Africa: A Delphi study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The overall objective of any health professional curriculum is to ensure that the knowledge, skills and attitudes of the students are influenced by the curriculum and to instil these attributes into the students, to help them become capable, compassionate and inquisitive health professionals. Therefore, there is the need for medical educators to align their learning objectives with the core competencies needed to achieve this. Currently, in interprofessional education, it is not always clear which activities may be used to facilitate the development of interprofessional core competencies. However, if health professional students are exposed to the interprofessional core competencies effectively, it may result in health  care professionals who have an improved understanding of interprofessional practices, thus improving these practices within their specific professions. The objective of this study was to identify teaching strategies and activities that aim to develop interprofessional competencies in undergraduate health care students at the University of the Western Cape, South Africa. Methods: In this study the Delphi method was used to reach a consensus on the most appropriate activities and assessment methods to use in an interprofessional curriculum that would assist in instilling interprofessional core competencies in undergraduate health care students. Results: 19 experts out of 69 invited participants took part in this Delphi study. The activities highlighted were case studies, joint clinical placements, simulations, role plays and workshops/discussions. The assessment forms highlighted by participants were portfolios, reflection and rubrics. Conclusion: It was evident from this study that such activities can be used to instil more than one core competency in undergraduate health care students.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Knowledge, attitude, and practices associated with avian influenza among undergraduate university students of East Java Indonesia: A cross-sectional survey [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Several public health strategic actions are required for effective avian influenza (AI) prevention and control, as well as the development of a communication plan to keep undergraduate students sufficiently informed on how to avoid or reduce exposure. The aim of the survey was to measure the level of knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAPs) toward AI among undergraduate university students in East Java, Indonesia, and observe the correlation between KAPs and the factors associated with the control and prevention of AI.  Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among undergraduate students to collect information about AI-related KAPs. Students were selected from three faculties of Universitas Airlangga Surabaya Indonesia (Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Faculty of Fisheries and Marine, and Faculty of Science and Technology). Students voluntarily responded to a pre-designed questionnaire. Results: A total of 425 students (222 female; and 203 male), of ages ranging from 18 years (n=240) to 20-30 years (n=185), responded to the survey. This cohort consisted of 157 students from the Faculty of Fisheries and Marine, 149 from the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, and 119 from the Faculty of Science and Technology. The results indicated that appropriate knowledge was obtained by 76.94% of students; significantly higher levels were seen in Faculty of Veterinary Medicine students as compared to the other two faculties (p<0.05). 72.89% of students documented positive attitudes; veterinary medicine students had significantly more positive attitudes than other faculties (p<0.05). Proactive behaviors were observed in 56.90% of students. The aggregate scores for KAPs were 6.93 ± 0.77 (range: 0-9) for knowledge, 7.6 ± 1.25 (range: 0-10) for attitude, and 9.1 ± 1.5 (range: 0-12) for practice.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Tailored PRISMA 2020 flow diagrams for living systematic reviews: a methodological survey and a proposal [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: While the PRISMA flow diagram is widely used for reporting standard systematic reviews (SRs), it was not designed for capturing the results of continual searches for studies in living systematic reviews (LSRs). The objectives of this study are (1) to assess how published LSRs report on the flow of studies through the different phases of the review for the different updates; (2) to propose an approach to reporting on that flow. Methods: For objective 1, we identified all LSRs published up to April 2021. We abstracted information regarding their general characteristics and how they reported on search results. For objective 2, we based our proposal for tailored PRISMA approaches on the findings from objective 1, as well as on our experience with conducting Cochrane LSRs. Results: We identified 279 living publications relating to 76 LSRs. Of the 279 publications, 11% were protocols, 23% were base versions (i.e., the first version), 50% were partial updates (i.e., does not include all typical sections of an SR), and 16% were full updates (i.e., includes all typical sections of an SR). We identified six ways to reporting the study flow: base separately, each update separately (38%); numbers not reported (32%); latest update separately, all previous versions combined (20%); base separately, all updates combined (7%); latest update version only (3%); all versions combined (0%). We propose recording in detail the results of the searches to keep track of all identified records. For structuring the flow diagram, we propose using one of four approaches. Conclusion: We identified six ways for reporting the study flow through the different phases of the review for the different update versions. We propose to document in detail the study flow for the different search updates and select one of our four tailored PRISMA diagram approaches to present that study flow.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A three-dimensional multiscale model for the prediction of thrombus growth under flow with single-platelet resolution</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Kaushik N. Shankar, Yiyuan Zhang, Talid Sinno, Scott L. Diamond</p>

Modeling thrombus growth in pathological flows allows evaluation of risk under patient-specific pharmacological, hematological, and hemodynamical conditions. We have developed a 3D multiscale framework for the prediction of thrombus growth under flow on a spatially resolved surface presenting collagen and tissue factor (TF). The multiscale framework is composed of four coupled modules: a Neural Network (NN) that accounts for platelet signaling, a Lattice Kinetic Monte Carlo (LKMC) simulation for tracking platelet positions, a Finite Volume Method (FVM) simulator for solving convection-diffusion-reaction equations describing agonist release and transport, and a Lattice Boltzmann (LB) flow solver for computing the blood flow field over the growing thrombus. A reduced model of the coagulation cascade was embedded into the framework to account for TF-driven thrombin production. The 3D model was first tested against in vitro microfluidics experiments of whole blood perfusion with various antiplatelet agents targeting COX-1, P<sub>2</sub>Y<sub>1</sub>, or the IP receptor. The model was able to accurately capture the evolution and morphology of the growing thrombus. Certain problems of 2D models for thrombus growth (artifactual dendritic growth) were naturally avoided with realistic trajectories of platelets in 3D flow. The generalizability of the 3D multiscale solver enabled simulations of important clinical situations, such as cylindrical blood vessels and acute flow narrowing (stenosis). Enhanced platelet-platelet bonding at pathologically high shear rates (e.g., von Willebrand factor unfolding) was required for accurately describing thrombus growth in stenotic flows. Overall, the approach allows consideration of patient-specific platelet signaling and vascular geometry for the prediction of thrombotic episodes.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Modeling the temporal dynamics of master regulators and CtrA proteolysis in Caulobacter crescentus cell cycle</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Chunrui Xu, Layne T. Watson, Henry Hollis, Michelle Dai, Xiangyu Yao, Yang Cao, Minghan Chen</p>

The cell cycle of <i>Caulobacter crescentus</i> involves the polar morphogenesis and an asymmetric cell division driven by precise interactions and regulations of proteins, which makes <i>Caulobacter</i> an ideal model organism for investigating bacterial cell development and differentiation. The abundance of molecular data accumulated on <i>Caulobacter</i> motivates system biologists to analyze the complex regulatory network of cell cycle via quantitative modeling. In this paper, We propose a comprehensive model to accurately characterize the underlying mechanisms of cell cycle regulation based on the study of: a) chromosome replication and methylation; b) interactive pathways of five master regulatory proteins including DnaA, GcrA, CcrM, CtrA, and SciP, as well as novel consideration of their corresponding mRNAs; c) cell cycle-dependent proteolysis of CtrA through hierarchical protease complexes. The temporal dynamics of our simulation results are able to closely replicate an extensive set of experimental observations and capture the main phenotype of seven mutant strains of <i>Caulobacter crescentus</i>. Collectively, the proposed model can be used to predict phenotypes of other mutant cases, especially for nonviable strains which are hard to cultivate and observe. Moreover, the module of cyclic proteolysis is an efficient tool to study the metabolism of proteins with similar mechanisms.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Traveling waves in the prefrontal cortex during working memory</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Sayak Bhattacharya, Scott L. Brincat, Mikael Lundqvist, Earl K. Miller</p>

Neural oscillations are evident across cortex but their spatial structure is not well- explored. Are oscillations stationary or do they form “traveling waves”, i.e., spatially organized patterns whose peaks and troughs move sequentially across cortex? Here, we show that oscillations in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) organized as traveling waves in the theta (4-8Hz), alpha (8-12Hz) and beta (12-30Hz) bands. Some traveling waves were planar but most rotated. The waves were modulated during performance of a working memory task. During baseline conditions, waves flowed bidirectionally along a specific axis of orientation. Waves in different frequency bands could travel in different directions. During task performance, there was an increase in waves in one direction over the other, especially in the beta band.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">From complete cross-docking to partners identification and binding sites predictions</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Chloé Dequeker, Yasser Mohseni Behbahani, Laurent David, Elodie Laine, Alessandra Carbone</p>

Proteins ensure their biological functions by interacting with each other. Hence, characterising protein interactions is fundamental for our understanding of the cellular machinery, and for improving medicine and bioengineering. Over the past years, a large body of experimental data has been accumulated on who interacts with whom and in what manner. However, these data are highly heterogeneous and sometimes contradictory, noisy, and biased. <i>Ab initio</i> methods provide a means to a “blind” protein-protein interaction network reconstruction. Here, we report on a molecular cross-docking-based approach for the identification of protein partners. The docking algorithm uses a coarse-grained representation of the protein structures and treats them as rigid bodies. We applied the approach to a few hundred of proteins, in the unbound conformations, and we systematically investigated the influence of several key ingredients, such as the size and quality of the interfaces, and the scoring function. We achieved some significant improvement compared to previous works, and a very high discriminative power on some specific functional classes. We provide a readout of the contributions of shape and physico-chemical complementarity, interface matching, and specificity, in the predictions. In addition, we assessed the ability of the approach to account for protein surface multiple usages, and we compared it with a sequence-based deep learning method. This work may contribute to guiding the exploitation of the large amounts of protein structural models now available toward the discovery of unexpected partners and their complex structure characterisation.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Adhesion-regulated junction slippage controls cell intercalation dynamics in an Apposed-Cortex Adhesion Model</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Alexander Nestor-Bergmann, Guy B. Blanchard, Nathan Hervieux, Alexander G. Fletcher, Jocelyn Étienne, Bénédicte Sanson</p>

Cell intercalation is a key cell behaviour of morphogenesis and wound healing, where local cell neighbour exchanges can cause dramatic tissue deformations such as body axis extension. Substantial experimental work has identified the key molecular players facilitating intercalation, but there remains a lack of consensus and understanding of their physical roles. Existing biophysical models that represent cell-cell contacts with single edges cannot study cell neighbour exchange as a continuous process, where neighbouring cell cortices must uncouple. Here, we develop an Apposed-Cortex Adhesion Model (ACAM) to understand active cell intercalation behaviours in the context of a 2D epithelial tissue. The junctional actomyosin cortex of every cell is modelled as a continuous viscoelastic rope-loop, explicitly representing cortices facing each other at bicellular junctions and the adhesion molecules that couple them. The model parameters relate directly to the properties of the key subcellular players that drive dynamics, providing a multi-scale understanding of cell behaviours. We show that active cell neighbour exchanges can be driven by purely junctional mechanisms. Active contractility and cortical turnover in a single bicellular junction are sufficient to shrink and remove a junction. Next, a new, orthogonal junction extends passively. The ACAM reveals how the turnover of adhesion molecules regulates tension transmission and junction deformation rates by controlling slippage between apposed cell cortices. The model additionally predicts that rosettes, which form when a vertex becomes common to many cells, are more likely to occur in actively intercalating tissues with strong friction from adhesion molecules.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Parametric Copula-GP model for analyzing multidimensional neuronal and behavioral relationships</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Nina Kudryashova, Theoklitos Amvrosiadis, Nathalie Dupuy, Nathalie Rochefort, Arno Onken</p>

One of the main goals of current systems neuroscience is to understand how neuronal populations integrate sensory information to inform behavior. However, estimating stimulus or behavioral information that is encoded in high-dimensional neuronal populations is challenging. We propose a method based on parametric copulas which allows modeling joint distributions of neuronal and behavioral variables characterized by different statistics and timescales. To account for temporal or spatial changes in dependencies between variables, we model varying copula parameters by means of Gaussian Processes (GP). We validate the resulting Copula-GP framework on synthetic data and on neuronal and behavioral recordings obtained in awake mice. We show that the use of a parametric description of the high-dimensional dependence structure in our method provides better accuracy in mutual information estimation in higher dimensions compared to other non-parametric methods. Moreover, by quantifying the redundancy between neuronal and behavioral variables, our model exposed the location of the reward zone in an unsupervised manner (i.e., without using any explicit cues about the task structure). These results demonstrate that the Copula-GP framework is particularly useful for the analysis of complex multidimensional relationships between neuronal, sensory and behavioral variables.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Positional SHAP (PoSHAP) for Interpretation of machine learning models trained from biological sequences</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Quinn Dickinson, Jesse G. Meyer</p>

Machine learning with multi-layered artificial neural networks, also known as “deep learning,” is effective for making biological predictions. However, model interpretation is challenging, especially for sequential input data used with recurrent neural network architectures. Here, we introduce a framework called “Positional SHAP” (PoSHAP) to interpret models trained from biological sequences by utilizing SHapely Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to generate positional model interpretations. We demonstrate this using three long short-term memory (LSTM) regression models that predict peptide properties, including binding affinity to major histocompatibility complexes (MHC), and collisional cross section (CCS) measured by ion mobility spectrometry. Interpretation of these models with PoSHAP reproduced MHC class I (rhesus macaque Mamu-A1*001 and human A*11:01) peptide binding motifs, reflected known properties of peptide CCS, and provided new insights into interpositional dependencies of amino acid interactions. PoSHAP should have widespread utility for interpreting a variety of models trained from biological sequences.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Efficient and error-free fluorescent gene tagging in human organoids without double-strand DNA cleavage</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yannik Bollen, Joris H. Hageman, Petra van Leenen, Lucca L. M. Derks, Bas Ponsioen, Julian R. Buissant des Amorie, Ingrid Verlaan-Klink, Myrna van den Bos, Leon W. M. M. Terstappen, Ruben van Boxtel, Hugo J. G. Snippert</p>

CRISPR-associated nucleases are powerful tools for precise genome editing of model systems, including human organoids. Current methods describing fluorescent gene tagging in organoids rely on the generation of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) to stimulate homology-directed repair (HDR) or nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ)-mediated integration of the desired knock-in. A major downside associated with DSB-mediated genome editing is the required clonal selection and expansion of candidate organoids to verify the genomic integrity of the targeted locus and to confirm the absence of off-target indels. By contrast, concurrent nicking of the genomic locus and targeting vector, known as in-trans paired nicking (ITPN), stimulates efficient HDR-mediated genome editing to generate large knock-ins without introducing DSBs. Here, we show that ITPN allows for fast, highly efficient, and indel-free fluorescent gene tagging in human normal and cancer organoids. Highlighting the ease and efficiency of ITPN, we generate triple fluorescent knock-in organoids where 3 genomic loci were simultaneously modified in a single round of targeting. In addition, we generated model systems with allele-specific readouts by differentially modifying maternal and paternal alleles in one step. ITPN using our palette of targeting vectors, publicly available from Addgene, is ideally suited for generating error-free heterozygous knock-ins in human organoids.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">A high-throughput method to deliver targeted optogenetic stimulation to moving C. elegans populations</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Mochi Liu, Sandeep Kumar, Anuj K. Sharma, Andrew M. Leifer</p>

We present a high-throughput optogenetic illumination system capable of simultaneous closed-loop light delivery to specified targets in populations of moving <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>. The instrument addresses 3 technical challenges: It delivers targeted illumination to specified regions of the animal’s body such as its head or tail; it automatically delivers stimuli triggered upon the animal’s behavior; and it achieves high throughput by targeting many animals simultaneously. The instrument was used to optogenetically probe the animal’s behavioral response to competing mechanosensory stimuli in the the anterior and posterior gentle touch receptor neurons. Responses to more than 43,418 stimulus events from a range of anterior–posterior intensity combinations were measured. The animal’s probability of sprinting forward in response to a mechanosensory stimulus depended on both the anterior and posterior stimulation intensity, while the probability of reversing depended primarily on the anterior stimulation intensity. We also probed the animal’s response to mechanosensory stimulation during the onset of turning, a relatively rare behavioral event, by delivering stimuli automatically when the animal began to turn. Using this closed-loop approach, over 9,700 stimulus events were delivered during turning onset at a rate of 9.2 events per worm hour, a greater than 25-fold increase in throughput compared to previous investigations. These measurements validate with greater statistical power previous findings that turning acts to gate mechanosensory evoked reversals. Compared to previous approaches, the current system offers targeted optogenetic stimulation to specific body regions or behaviors with many fold increases in throughput to better constrain quantitative models of sensorimotor processing.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">SRXN1 blood levels negatively correlate with hippocampal atrophy and cognitive decline [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Cognitive decline, correlating with hippocampal atrophy, characterizes several neurodegenerative disorders having a background of low-level chronic inflammation and oxidative stress. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, we examined how cognitive decline and hippocampal subfields volume are associated with the expression of redox and inflammatory genes in peripheral blood. We analyzed 34 individuals with different cognitive scores according to Mini-Mental State Examination, corrected by age and education (adjMMSE). We identified a group presenting cognitive decline (CD) with adjMMSE<27 (n=14) and a normal cognition (NC) group with adjMMSE≥27 (n=20). A multiparametric approach, comprising structural magnetic resonance imaging measurement of different hippocampal segments and blood mRNA expression of redox and inflammatory genes was applied. Results: Our findings indicate that hippocampal segment volumes correlate positively with adjMMSE and negatively with the blood transcript levels of 19 genes, mostly redox genes correlating especially with the left subiculum and presubiculum. A strong negative correlation between hippocampal subfields atrophy and SRXN1 redox gene is emphasized. Conclusions: Concluding, these results suggest that SRXN1 might be a valuable candidate blood biomarker for non-invasively monitoring the evolution of hippocampal atrophy in CD patients.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Comparison of invasive histological and molecular methods in the diagnosis of Helicobacter pylori from gastric biopsies of Sudanese patients: a cross-sectional study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The continuous rise in the number of patients suffering from Helicobacter pylori is probably due to the changes in modern life. Nowadays, patients suffering from gastrointestinal problems are diagnosed through invasive and non-invasive techniques. The choice of a diagnostic test is influenced by factors such as the tests' sensitivity and specificity, the clinical conditions, and the cost-effectiveness of the testing strategy. This study aimed to compare molecular detection methods of H. pylori by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting the 16S rRNA, ureA and glmM genes with an invasive histopathological technique. Methods: 290 gastric biopsies were collected using gastrointestinal endoscopy from patients with gastritis symptoms in different hospitals in Khartoum state. Two gastric biopsies were collected from each patient for PCR and histopathology. Results: A total of 103 (35.5%) samples were positive by histopathological examination, 88 (30.3%) by 16S rRNA, 39 (13.4%) by glmM gene, and 56 (19.3%) by ureA gene. The highest sensitivity was observed in 16S rRNA (46.6%), followed by glmM (24.3%) and ureA (23.3%). While the best specificity was observed in glmM gene (92.5%), followed by ureA (82.3%) and 16S rRNA (78.6%). Conclusion: PCR test targeting the 16S rRNA gene exhibited the best results for molecular detection of H. pylori compared to other genes.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Brace versus cast following surgical treatment of distal radial fracture: a prospective randomised study comparing quality of recovery [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Immobilisation following surgical treatment of distal radial fractures (DRF) is traditionally performed with a dorsal cast splint. There is an interest in changing the rigid cast to a removable brace. This can reduce the risk for cast-corrections, complications and improve recovery of function. The aim of the study was to compare quality of recovery (QoR) between brace and traditional cast for immobilisation during the first postoperative week. Methods: 60 patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status 1–3, scheduled for surgical treatment of DRF under a supraclavicular block (SCB) in a day-surgery setting were randomised into two groups of immobilisation post-surgery; brace (n=30) versus traditional cast (n=30). Study objectives were: differences in self-assessed QoR using the QoR-15 questionnaire, postoperative oral oxycodone consumption, perioperative time events and unplanned healthcare contacts one week postoperatively. Results: 54 patients, 46 females/eight males were included in the analysis; 27 with brace and 27 with traditional cast. QoR-15 median scores improved significantly from baseline/preoperative to day 7 (brace p=0.001, cast p=0.001) with no differences between the two groups. The only difference found was that patients in the brace group had significantly worse pain score 24-hours post-surgery (p=0.022). No significant differences were seen in total median oxycodone consumption the first three postoperative days. No differences were found in perioperative events or unplanned healthcare contacts. Conclusions: Brace appears to be a feasible option to traditional cast for immobilisation following surgical treatment of DRF. The early QoR was similar in both groups apart from more pain in the brace group the first 24 postoperative hours.

                The aim of the present study is to report the indirect evaluation of cervical stimulation considering the effect of the duration of the stimulus on the control of intraocular pressure in a patient with bilateral glaucoma with important ocular edema.  A 47-year-old woman reported the onset of pain and bilateral tearing in the eyes at 35 years of age and was diagnosed with glaucoma. The patient began clinical treatment, but intraocular pressure remained 35 to 40 mmHg even with the use of four eye medications in the form of drops. The patient reported that her vision was always blurred despite the use of the eyedrops. The patient was submitted to the Godoy & Godoy method of cervical lymphatic therapy to reduce the edema. The ophthalmologist measured her intraocular pressure every two and three days. We found that the pressure was maintained below 20 mmHg when lymphatic therapy was performed every two days, but intraocular pressure increased and the vision became blurred when therapy was performed every three days. The Godoy & Godoy method of cervical lymphatic therapy constitutes a novel lymphatic system stimulation strategy that maintains its effect on intraocular pressure for approximately 48 hours, as demonstrated through an indirect evaluation.

                Background: eHealth makes use of information and communication technologies (ICT) to improve health. In the digital age, the use of eHealth applications and other health-related applications has gained popularity, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of the pandemic, many uncertainties have arisen, causing stress and affecting the mental health of many skilled workers in the digital industry, particularly in the ICT, computing, and creative media industries. eHealth applications have the potential to benefit people's health. As a prerequisite for effective implementation of eHealth for mental wellness (EHMW), this paper examines the acceptance of EHMW among digital workers in Malaysia.  The objectives of this research are two-fold: 1) To explore the acceptance of EHMW among digital workers in a local Premier Digital Tech Institution (PDTI), and 2) To explore how these talents' demographic profiles, mental health literacy and workplace wellness influence their acceptance of EHMW.   Methods: This research surveyed 41 digital workers who played vital roles in providing digital skills at a tertiary education level.    Results: Most respondents agreed that eHealth was appropriate for managing mental wellness. Among the three eHealth domains for managing mental wellness, the acceptance level is the highest for the application domain of "interacting for health", with male respondents more likely to accept the use of EHMW.  Conclusions: This small-scale survey could not fully examine the acceptance of eHealth and its usage patterns for mental wellness among digital workers in Malaysia. Future research will target more digital workers in Malaysia. This research addresses the research gap on the eHealth perspectives of digital workers on their acceptance, and the potential influence of demographic profiles, mental health literacy, and workplace wellness on EHMW's acceptance of digital health tools/platforms to promote their mental wellness.

<p>The study investigated the anti-depressant and anxiolytic effects of different selective stimulation of ventral tegmental area dopaminergic pathways projecting through the mfb. The data suggests that different stimulation strategies can modulate various depressive- and anxiety-like phenotypes.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Major depressive disorder is one of the most common mental disorders, and more than 300 million of people suffer from depression worldwide. Recent clinical trials indicate that deep brain stimulation of the superolateral medial forebrain bundle (mfb) can have rapid and long-term antidepressant effects in patients with treatment-resistant depression. However, the mechanisms of action are elusive. In this study, using female rats, we demonstrate the antidepressant effects of selective optogenetic stimulation of the ventral tegmental area's dopaminergic (DA) neurons passing through the mfb and compare different stimulation patterns. Chronic mild unpredictable stress (CMUS) induced depressive-like, but not anxiety-like phenotype. Short-term and long-term stimulation demonstrated antidepressant effect (OSST) and improved anxiolytic effect (EPM), while long-term stimulation during CMUS induction prevented depressive-like behavior (OSST and USV) and improved anxiolytic effect (EPM). The results highlight that long-term accumulative stimulation on DA pathways is required for antidepressant and anxiolytic effect.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">COVID-19 home isolation and food consumption patterns: Investigating the correlates of poor dietary diversity in Lebanon: a cross-sectional study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The unfurling COVID-19 pandemic has uncovered the defenselessness of the Lebanese food system leading to serious implication in maintaining a healthy sustainable lifestyle. Aim: The main purpose of this study is to examine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on food consumption patterns and dietary diversity of the Lebanese people. Methods: The online survey, completed between April and June 2020, consisted of a cross-sectional study on 2282 Lebanese participants (mean age: 29.36±12.221, 80.9% women) that was part of a survey across 38 different countries conducted by De Backer, C. et al. A food frequency questionnaire was used to investigate the consumption patterns along with the calculation of the Food Consumption Score (FCS), a proxy indicator of dietary diversity. Data collected on cooking attitudes, shopping, and food stock identify the community mitigation measures. Results: Home isolation due to COVID-19 induced an increase in the consumption of legumes and pulses (3.2%, p-value=0.001) and whole wheat groups (2.8%, p-value=0.03). In contrast, a decrease of 5.4%, 6.9%, 5.8%, 5.1%, 3.1%, 3.4% and 2.8% was observed in the consumption of fruits (p-value=0), vegetables (p-value=0), processed meats, poultry, and fish (p-value=0), other dairy products (p-value=0), sweet snacks (p-value=0.001), sugared beverages (p-value=0), fats and oils (p-value=0.001), respectively. The FCS decreased by 4.6%. As food-related behaviors, most cooking attitudes, and practices (10 out of 13) showed an amelioration during the lockdown and the proportions of food stocked have been changing since the start of the pandemic seeing higher amounts of pasta, rice or other grains, flour, and legumes/pulses stocked. Conclusion: To conclude, the hostile home isolation strategy followed to prevent the COVID-19 spread in Lebanon, came at a high nutritional cost, driving poor dietary diversity.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Extension of the PRISMA 2020 statement for living systematic reviews (LSRs): protocol [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: While the PRISMA 2020 statement is intended to guide the reporting of original systematic reviews, updated systematic reviews, and living systematic reviews (LSRs), its explanation and elaboration document notes that additional considerations for updated systematic reviews and LSRs may need to be addressed. This paper reports the protocol for developing an extension of the PRISMA 2020 statement for LSRs. Methods: We will follow the EQUATOR Network’s guidance for developing health research reporting guidelines. We will review the literature to identify possible items of the PRISMA 2020 checklist that need modification, as well as new items that need to be added. Then, we will survey representatives of different stakeholder groups for their views on the proposed modifications of the PRISMA 2020 checklist. We will summarize, present, and discuss the results of the survey in an online meeting, aiming to reach consensus on the content of the LSR extension. We will then draft the checklist, explanation and elaboration for each item, and flow diagram for the PRISMA 2020 extension. Then, we will share these initial documents with stakeholder representatives for final feedback and approval. Discussion: We anticipate that the PRISMA 2020 extension for LSRs will benefit LSR authors, editors, and peer reviewers of LSRs, as well as different users of LSRs, including guideline developers, policy makers, healthcare providers, patients, and other stakeholders.

<p>Anti-LINGO-1 antibody could improve the behavioral performance of APP/PS1 mice in Morris water maze and Y-maze. The positive effects of anti-LINGO-1 antibody on the cognition of APP/PS1 mice might be related to the anti-LINGO-1 antibody-induced promotion of the differentiation, maturation, and myelination of oligodendrocytes in the hippocampus. The results indicated that LINGO-1 might be a promising target in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Leucine-rich repeat and immunoglobulin-like domain-containing nogo receptor-interacting protein 1 (LINGO-1), a negative regulator of oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination, is associated with cognitive function, and its expression is highly upregulated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Anti-LINGO-1 antibody treatment can effectively antagonize the negative regulatory effect of LINGO-1. In this study, we aim to assess the effect of anti-LINGO-1 antibody treatment on cognition and hippocampal oligodendrocytes in an AD transgenic animal model. First, 10-month-old male amyloid-β (Aβ) protein precursor (APP)/presenilin 1 (PS1) mice were administered anti-LINGO-1 antibody for 8 weeks. Then, learning and memory abilities were assessed with the Morris water maze (MWM) and Y-maze tests, and Aβ deposition and hippocampal oligodendrocytes were investigated by immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, and stereology. We found that anti-LINGO-1 antibody alleviated the deficits in spatial learning and memory abilities and working and reference memory abilities, decreased the density of LINGO-1 positive cells, decreased Aβ deposition, significantly increased the number of mature oligodendrocytes and the density of myelin, reversed the abnormal increases in the number of oligodendrocyte lineage cells and the densities of oligodendrocytes precursor cells in APP/PS1 mice. Our results provide evidence that LINGO-1 might be involved in the process of oligodendrocyte dysmaturity in the hippocampus of AD mice, and that antagonizing LINGO-1 can alleviate cognitive deficits in APP/PS1 mice and decrease Aβ deposition and promote oligodendrocyte differentiation and maturation in the hippocampus of these mice. Our findings suggest that changes in LINGO-1 and oligodendrocytes in the hippocampus play important roles in the pathogenesis of AD and that antagonizing LINGO-1 might be a potential therapeutic strategy for AD.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Prior uncontrolled studies have reported seizure reductions following deep brain stimulation (DBS) in patients with Lennox–Gastaut syndrome (LGS), but evidence from randomized controlled studies is lacking. We aimed to formally assess the efficacy and safety of DBS to the centromedian thalamic nucleus (CM) for the treatment of LGS.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We conducted a prospective, double-blind, randomized study of continuous, cycling stimulation of CM-DBS, in patients with LGS. Following pre- and post-implantation periods, half received 3 months of stimulation (blinded phase), then all received 3 months of stimulation (unblinded phase). The primary outcome was the proportion of participants with ≥50% reduction in diary-recorded seizures in stimulated versus control participants, measured at the end of the blinded phase. A secondary outcome was the proportion of participants with a ≥50% reduction in electrographic seizures on 24-hour ambulatory electroencephalography (EEG) at the end of the blinded phase.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Between November 2017 and December 2019, 20 young adults with LGS (17–37 years;13 women) underwent bilateral CM-DBS at a single center in Australia, with 19 randomized (treatment, n = 10 and control, n = 9). Fifty percent of the stimulation group achieved ≥50% seizure reduction, compared with 22% of controls (odds ratio [OR] = 3.1, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.44–21.45, <i>p</i> = 0.25). For electrographic seizures, 59% of the stimulation group had ≥50% reduction at the end of the blinded phase, compared with none of the controls (OR= 23.25, 95% CI = 1.0–538.4, <i>p</i> = 0.05). Across all patients, median seizure reduction (baseline vs study exit) was 46.7% (interquartile range [IQR] = 28–67%) for diary-recorded seizures and 53.8% (IQR = 27–73%) for electrographic seizures.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>CM-DBS in patients with LGS reduced electrographic rather than diary-recorded seizures, after 3 months of stimulation. Fifty percent of all participants had diary-recorded seizures reduced by half at the study exit, providing supporting evidence of the treatment effect. ANN NEUROL 2022;91:253–267</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Spinal Cord Atrophy Predicts Progressive Disease in Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>A major challenge in multiple sclerosis (MS) research is the understanding of silent progression and Progressive MS. Using a novel method to accurately capture upper cervical cord area from legacy brain MRI scans we aimed to study the role of spinal cord and brain atrophy for silent progression and conversion to secondary progressive disease (SPMS).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>From a single-center observational study, all RRMS (n = 360) and SPMS (n = 47) patients and 80 matched controls were evaluated. RRMS patient subsets who converted to SPMS (n = 54) or silently progressed (n = 159), respectively, during the 12-year observation period were compared to clinically matched RRMS patients remaining RRMS (n = 54) or stable (n = 147), respectively. From brain MRI, we assessed the value of brain and spinal cord measures to predict silent progression and SPMS conversion.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Patients who developed SPMS showed faster cord atrophy rates (−2.19%/yr) at least 4 years before conversion compared to their RRMS matches (−0.88%/yr, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Spinal cord atrophy rates decelerated after conversion (−1.63%/yr, <i>p</i> = 0.010) towards those of SPMS patients from study entry (−1.04%). Each 1% faster spinal cord atrophy rate was associated with 69% (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001) and 53% (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001) shorter time to silent progression and SPMS conversion, respectively.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Silent progression and conversion to secondary progressive disease are predominantly related to cervical cord atrophy. This atrophy is often present from the earliest disease stages and predicts the speed of silent progression and conversion to Progressive MS. Diagnosis of SPMS is rather a late recognition of this neurodegenerative process than a distinct disease phase. ANN NEUROL 2022;91:268–281</p>

                <p>Current therapeutic development in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) relies on individual randomized clinical trials to test a specific investigational product in a single patient population. This approach has intrinsic limitations, including cost, time, and lack of flexibility. Adaptive platform trials represent a novel approach to investigate several interventions for a single disease in a continuous manner. Already in use in oncology, this approach is now being employed more often in neurology. Here, we describe a newly launched platform trial for ALS. The Healey ALS Platform Trial is testing multiple investigational products concurrently in people with ALS, with the goal of rapidly identifying novel treatments, biomarkers, and trial endpoints.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Aerobic Exercise Alters Brain Function and Structure in Parkinson's Disease: A Randomized Controlled Trial</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Randomized clinical trials have shown that aerobic exercise attenuates motor symptom progression in Parkinson's disease, but the underlying neural mechanisms are unclear. Here, we investigated how aerobic exercise influences disease-related functional and structural changes in the corticostriatal sensorimotor network, which is involved in the emergence of motor deficits in Parkinson's disease. Additionally, we explored effects of aerobic exercise on tissue integrity of the substantia nigra, and on behavioral and cerebral indices of cognitive control.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The Park-in-Shape trial is a single-center, double-blind randomized controlled trial in 130 Parkinson's disease patients who were randomly assigned (1:1 ratio) to aerobic exercise (stationary home trainer) or stretching (active control) interventions (duration = 6 months). An unselected subset from this trial (exercise, n = 25; stretching, n = 31) underwent resting-state functional and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and an oculomotor cognitive control task (pro- and antisaccades), at baseline and at 6-month follow-up.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Aerobic exercise, but not stretching, led to increased functional connectivity of the anterior putamen with the sensorimotor cortex relative to the posterior putamen. Behaviorally, aerobic exercise also improved cognitive control. Furthermore, aerobic exercise increased functional connectivity in the right frontoparietal network, proportionally to fitness improvements, and it reduced global brain atrophy.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>MRI, clinical, and behavioral results converge toward the conclusion that aerobic exercise stabilizes disease progression in the corticostriatal sensorimotor network and enhances cognitive performance. ANN NEUROL 2022;91:203–216</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>ATP synthase (ATPase) is responsible for the majority of ATP production. Nevertheless, disease phenotypes associated with mutations in ATPase subunits are extremely rare. We aimed at expanding the spectrum of ATPase-related diseases.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Whole-exome sequencing in cohorts with 2,962 patients diagnosed with mitochondrial disease and/or dystonia and international collaboration were used to identify deleterious variants in ATPase-encoding genes. Findings were complemented by transcriptional and proteomic profiling of patient fibroblasts. ATPase integrity and activity were assayed using cells and tissues from 5 patients.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We present 10 total individuals with biallelic or de novo monoallelic variants in nuclear ATPase subunit genes. Three unrelated patients showed the same homozygous missense <i>ATP5F1E</i> mutation (including one published case). An intronic splice-disrupting alteration in compound heterozygosity with a nonsense variant in <i>ATP5PO</i> was found in one patient. Three patients had de novo heterozygous missense variants in <i>ATP5F1A</i>, whereas another 3 were heterozygous for <i>ATP5MC3</i> de novo missense changes. Bioinformatics methods and populational data supported the variants’ pathogenicity. Immunohistochemistry, proteomics, and/or immunoblotting revealed significantly reduced ATPase amounts in association to <i>ATP5F1E</i> and <i>ATP5PO</i> mutations. Diminished activity and/or defective assembly of ATPase was demonstrated by enzymatic assays and/or immunoblotting in patient samples bearing <i>ATP5F1A</i>-p.Arg207His, <i>ATP5MC3</i>-p.Gly79Val, and <i>ATP5MC3</i>-p.Asn106Lys. The associated clinical profiles were heterogeneous, ranging from hypotonia with spontaneous resolution (1/10) to epilepsy with early death (1/10) or variable persistent abnormalities, including movement disorders, developmental delay, intellectual disability, hyperlactatemia, and other neurologic and systemic features. Although potentially reflecting an ascertainment bias, dystonia was common (7/10).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our results establish evidence for a previously unrecognized role of ATPase nuclear-gene defects in phenotypes characterized by neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative features. ANN NEUROL 2022;91:225–237</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Myelin regeneration in the human central nervous system relies on progenitor cells within the tissue parenchyma, with possible contribution from previously myelinating oligodendrocytes (OLs). In multiple sclerosis, a demyelinating disorder, variables affecting remyelination efficiency include age, severity of initial injury, and progenitor cell properties. Our aim was to investigate the effects of age and differentiation on the myelination potential of human OL lineage cells.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We derived viable primary OL lineage cells from surgical resections of pediatric and adult brain tissue. Ensheathment capacity using nanofiber assays and transcriptomic profiles from RNA sequencing were compared between A2B5+ antibody-selected progenitors and mature OLs (non-selected cells).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We demonstrate that pediatric progenitor and mature cells ensheathed nanofibers more robustly than did adult progenitor and mature cells, respectively. Within both age groups, the percentage of fibers ensheathed and ensheathment length per fiber were greater for A2B5+ progenitors. Gene expression of OL progenitor markers <i>PDGFRA</i> and <i>PTPRZ1</i> were higher in A2B5+ versus A2B5− cells and in pediatric A2B5+ versus adult A2B5+ cells. The p38 MAP kinases and actin cytoskeleton-associated pathways were upregulated in pediatric cells; both have been shown to regulate OL process outgrowth. Significant upregulation of “cell senescence” genes was detected in pediatric samples; this could reflect their role in development and the increased susceptibility of pediatric OLs to activating cell death responses to stress.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings identify specific biological pathways relevant to myelination that are differentially enriched in human pediatric and adult OL lineage cells and suggest potential targets for remyelination enhancing therapies. ANN NEUROL 2022;91:178–191</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Network Localization of Unconscious Visual Perception in Blindsight</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Blindsight is a disorder where brain injury causes loss of conscious but not unconscious visual perception. Prior studies have produced conflicting results regarding the neuroanatomical pathways involved in this unconscious perception.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed a systematic literature search to identify lesion locations causing visual field loss in patients with blindsight (n = 34) and patients without blindsight (n = 35). Resting state functional connectivity between each lesion location and all other brain voxels was computed using a large connectome database (n = 1,000). Connections significantly associated with blindsight (vs no blindsight) were identified.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Functional connectivity between lesion locations and the ipsilesional medial pulvinar was significantly associated with blindsight (family wise error <i>p</i> = 0.029). No significant connectivity differences were found to other brain regions previously implicated in blindsight. This finding was independent of methods (eg, flipping lesions to the left or right) and stimulus type (moving vs static).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Induction of Human Motor Cortex Plasticity by Theta Burst Transcranial Ultrasound Stimulation</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Transcranial ultrasound stimulation (TUS) is a promising noninvasive brain stimulation technique with advantages of high spatial precision and ability to target deep brain regions. This study aimed to develop a TUS protocol to effectively induce brain plasticity in human subjects.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>An 80-second train of theta burst patterned TUS (tbTUS), regularly patterned TUS (rTUS) with the same sonication duration, and sham tbTUS was delivered to the motor cortex in healthy subjects. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was used to examine changes in corticospinal excitability, intracortical inhibition and facilitation, and the site of plasticity induction. The effects of motor cortical tbTUS on a visuomotor task and the effects of occipital cortex tbTUS on motor cortical excitability were also tested.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The tbTUS produced consistent increase in corticospinal excitability for at least 30 minutes, whereas rTUS and sham tbTUS produced no significant change. tbTUS decreased short-interval intracortical inhibition and increased intracortical facilitation. The effects of TMS in different current directions suggested that the site of the plastic changes was within the motor cortex. tbTUS to the occipital cortex did not change motor cortical excitability. Motor cortical tbTUS shortened movement time in a visuomotor task.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>tbTUS is a novel and efficient paradigm to induce cortical plasticity in humans. It has the potential to be developed for neuromodulation treatment for neurological and psychiatric disorders, and to advance neuroscience research. ANN NEUROL 2022;91:238–252</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Subcortical Volumes as Early Predictors of Fatigue in Multiple Sclerosis</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Fatigue is a frequent and severe symptom in multiple sclerosis (MS), but its pathophysiological origin remains incompletely understood. We aimed to examine the predictive value of subcortical gray matter volumes for fatigue severity at disease onset and after 4 years by applying structural equation modeling (SEM).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This multicenter cohort study included 601 treatment-naive patients with MS after the first demyelinating event. All patients underwent a standardized 3T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) protocol. A subgroup of 230 patients with available clinical follow-up data after 4 years was also analyzed. Associations of subcortical volumes (included into SEM) with MS-related fatigue were studied regarding their predictive value. In addition, subcortical regions that have a central role in the brain network (hubs) were determined through structural covariance network (SCN) analysis.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Predictive causal modeling identified volumes of the caudate (s [standardized path coefficient] = 0.763, <i>p</i> = 0.003 [left]; s = 0.755, <i>p</i> = 0.006 [right]), putamen (s = 0.614, <i>p</i> = 0.002 [left]; s = 0.606, <i>p</i> = 0.003 [right]) and pallidum (s = 0.606, <i>p</i> = 0.012 [left]; s = 0.606, <i>p</i> = 0.012 [right]) as prognostic factors for fatigue severity in the cross-sectional cohort. Moreover, the volume of the pons was additionally predictive for fatigue severity in the longitudinal cohort (s = 0.605, <i>p</i> = 0.013). In the SCN analysis, network hubs in patients with fatigue worsening were detected in the putamen (<i>p</i> = 0.008 [left]; <i>p</i> = 0.007 [right]) and pons (<i>p</i> = 0.0001).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We unveiled predictive associations of specific subcortical gray matter volumes with fatigue in an early and initially untreated MS cohort. The colocalization of these subcortical structures with network hubs suggests an early role of these brain regions in terms of fatigue evolution. ANN NEUROL 2022;91:192–202</p>

                <p>Narcolepsy type 1 (NT1) is a chronic sleep disorder correlated with loss of hypocretin(orexin). In NT1 post-mortem brains, we observed 88% reduction in corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH)-positive neurons in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and significantly less CRH-positive fibers in the median eminence, whereas CRH-neurons in the locus coeruleus and thalamus, and other PVN neuronal populations were spared: that is, vasopressin, oxytocin, tyrosine hydroxylase, and thyrotropin releasing hormone-expressing neurons. Other hypothalamic cell groups, that is, the suprachiasmatic, ventrolateral preoptic, infundibular, and supraoptic nuclei and nucleus basalis of Meynert, were unaffected. The surprising selective decrease in CRH-neurons provide novel targets for diagnostics and therapeutic interventions. ANN NEUROL 2022;91:282–288</p>

                <p>An illustration of lesion network mapping of blindsight-negative versus blindsight. This begins with representative lesion locations from a blindsight and blindsight-negative patient. Lesions were consolidated into a single hemisphere for analysis. Connectivity between each lesion location and the rest of the brain was computed using a normative database of resting state functional connectivity from 1000 healthy subjects. Pictured are the connectivity patterns derived from the two representative lesion locations. Connectivity differences between lesion locations from blindsight-negative (n=35) versus blindsight patients (n=34) were identified using a two-sample, voxelwise t-test within a mask of regions previously implicated in blindsight (dark grey). Lesions in blindsight-negative patients showed greater functional connectivity to the medial pulvinar (pulvinar in blue outline) compared to lesions in blindsight patients.

                Kotagiri et al. find that SARS-CoV-2 infection versus vaccination induces distinct changes in the B cell receptor repertoire, including prominent clonal expansion in IgA and IgM after infection, but IgG after vaccination. A broad anti-spike response to infection contrasts with a narrower RBD-focused one after vaccination, potentially informing vaccination strategies.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Volume growth in animal cells is cell cycle dependent and shows additive fluctuations</a></h4>

              
                The way proliferating animal cells coordinate the growth of their mass, volume, and other relevant size parameters is a long-standing question in biology. Studies focusing on cell mass have identified patterns of mass growth as a function of time and cell cycle phase, but little is known about volume growth. To address this question, we improved our fluorescence exclusion method of volume measurement (FXm) and obtained 1700 single-cell volume growth trajectories of HeLa cells. We find that, during most of the cell cycle, volume growth is close to exponential and proceeds at a higher rate in S-G2 than in G1. Comparing the data with a mathematical model, we establish that the cell-to-cell variability in volume growth arises from constant-amplitude fluctuations in volume steps rather than fluctuations of the underlying specific growth rate. We hypothesize that such ‘additive noise’ could emerge from the processes that regulate volume adaptation to biophysical cues, such as tension or osmotic pressure.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Laminar microcircuitry of visual cortex producing attention-associated electric fields</a></h4>

              
                Cognitive operations are widely studied by measuring electric fields through EEG and ECoG. However, despite their widespread use, the neural circuitry giving rise to these signals remains unknown because the functional architecture of cortical columns producing attention-associated electric fields has not been explored. Here we detail the laminar cortical circuitry underlying an attention-associated electric field measured over posterior regions of the brain in humans and monkeys. First, we identified visual cortical area V4 as one plausible contributor to this attention-associated electric field through inverse modeling of cranial EEG in macaque monkeys performing a visual attention task. Next, we performed laminar neurophysiological recordings on the prelunate gyrus and identified the electric-field-producing dipoles as synaptic activity in distinct cortical layers of area V4. Specifically, activation in the extragranular layers of cortex resulted in the generation of the attention-associated dipole. Feature selectivity of a given cortical column determined the overall contribution to this electric field. Columns selective for the attended feature contributed more to the electric field than columns selective for a different feature. Lastly, the laminar profile of synaptic activity generated by V4 was sufficient to produce an attention-associated signal measurable outside of the column. These findings suggest that the top-down recipient cortical layers produce an attention-associated electric field that can be measured extracortically with the relative contribution of each column depending upon the underlying functional architecture.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Primate malarias as a model for cross-species parasite transmission</a></h4>

              
                Parasites regularly switch into new host species, representing a disease burden and conservation risk to the hosts. The distribution of these parasites also gives insight into characteristics of ecological networks and genetic mechanisms of host-parasite interactions. Some parasites are shared across many species, whereas others tend to be restricted to hosts from a single species. Understanding the mechanisms producing this distribution of host specificity can enable more effective interventions and potentially identify genetic targets for vaccines or therapies. As ecological connections between human and local animal populations increase, the risk to human and wildlife health from novel parasites also increases. Which of these parasites will fizzle out and which have the potential to become widespread in humans? We consider the case of primate malarias, caused by <i>Plasmodium</i> parasites, to investigate the interacting ecological and evolutionary mechanisms that put human and nonhuman primates at risk for infection. <i>Plasmodium</i> host switching from nonhuman primates to humans led to ancient introductions of the most common malaria-causing agents in humans today, and new parasite switching is a growing threat, especially in Asia and South America. Based on a wild host-<i>Plasmodium</i> occurrence database, we highlight geographic areas of concern and potential areas to target further sampling. We also discuss methodological developments that will facilitate clinical and field-based interventions to improve human and wildlife health based on this eco-evolutionary perspective.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Characterization of the neurogenic niche in the aging dentate gyrus using iterative immunofluorescence imaging</a></h4>

              
                Advancing age causes reduced hippocampal neurogenesis, associated with age-related cognitive decline. The spatial relationship of age-induced alterations in neural stem cells (NSCs) and surrounding cells within the hippocampal niche remains poorly understood due to limitations of antibody-based cellular phenotyping. We established iterative indirect immunofluorescence imaging (4i) in tissue sections, allowing for simultaneous detection of 18 proteins to characterize NSCs and surrounding cells in 2-, 6-, and 12-month-old mice. We show that reorganization of the dentate gyrus (DG) niche already occurs in middle-aged mice, paralleling the decline in neurogenesis. 4i-based tissue analysis of the DG identifies changes in cell-type contributions to the blood-brain barrier and microenvironments surrounding NSCs to play a pivotal role to preserve neurogenic permissiveness. The data provided represent a resource to characterize the principles causing alterations of stem cell-associated plasticity within the aging DG and provide a blueprint to analyze somatic stem cell niches across lifespan in complex tissues.

                Taxa with vast distribution ranges often display unresolved phylogeographic structures and unclear taxonomic boundaries resulting into hidden diversity. This hypothesis-driven study reveals the evolutionary history of Bufonidae, covering the phylogeographic patterns found in Holarctic bufonids from the West Gondwana to the phylogenetic taxonomy of Asiatic true toads in the Eastern Palearctic. We used an integrative approach relying on fossilised birth-death calibrations, population dynamic, gene-flow, species distribution and species delimitation modelling to resolve the biogeography of the clade and highlight cryptic lineages. We verified the near-simultaneous Miocene radiations within Western and Eastern Palearctic <i>Bufo</i>, c. 14.49 - 10.00 Mya, temporally matching with the maximum dust outflows in Central Asian deserts. Contrary to earlier studies, we demonstrated that the combined impacts of long dispersal and ice-age refugia equally contributed to the current genetic structure of <i>Bufo</i> in East Asia. Our findings reveal a climate-driven adaptation in septentrional Eastern Asian <i>Bufo</i>, explained its range shifts towards northern latitudes. We resolve species boundaries within the Eastern Palearctic <i>Bufo</i>, and redefine the taxonomic and conservation units of the northeastern species: <i>B. sachalinensis </i>and its subspecies.

                During the development of the vertebrate embryo, segmented structures called somites are periodically formed from the presomitic mesoderm (PSM), and give rise to the vertebral column. While somite formation has been studied in several animal models, it is less clear how well this process is conserved in humans. Recent progress has made it possible to study aspects of human paraxial mesoderm development such as the human segmentation clock <i>in vitro</i> using human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), however, somite formation has not been observed in these monolayer cultures. Here, we describe the generation of human paraxial mesoderm (PM) organoids from hPSCs (termed Somitoids), which recapitulate the molecular, morphological and functional features of paraxial mesoderm development, including formation of somite-like structures <i>in vitro</i>. Using a quantitative image-based screen, we identify critical parameters such as initial cell number and signaling modulations that reproducibly yielded formation of somite-like structures in our organoid system. In addition, using single-cell RNA sequencing and 3D imaging, we show that PM organoids both transcriptionally and morphologically resemble their <i>in vivo</i> counterparts and can be differentiated into somite derivatives. Our organoid system is reproducible and scalable, allowing for the systematic and quantitative analysis of human spinal cord development and disease <i>in vitro</i>.

                <sup>1</sup>H MRI maps brain structure and function non-invasively through versatile contrasts that exploit inhomogeneity in tissue micro-environments. Inferring histopathological information from MRI findings, however, remains challenging due to absence of direct links between MRI signals and cellular structures. Here, we show that deep convolutional neural networks, developed using co-registered multi-contrast MRI and histological data of the mouse brain, can estimate histological staining intensity directly from MRI signals at each voxel. The results provide three-dimensional maps of axons and myelin with tissue contrasts that closely mimics target histology and enhanced sensitivity and specificity compared to conventional MRI markers. Furthermore, the relative contribution of each MRI contrast within the networks can be used to optimize multi-contrast MRI acquisition. We anticipate our method to be a starting point for translation of MRI results into easy-to-understand virtual histology for neurobiologists and provide resources for validating novel MRI techniques.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Single-cell atlas of early chick development reveals gradual segregation of neural crest lineage from the neural plate border during neurulation</a></h4>

              
                The epiblast of vertebrate embryos is comprised of neural and non-neural ectoderm, with the border territory at their intersection harboring neural crest and cranial placode progenitors. Here, we a generate single-cell atlas of the developing chick epiblast from late gastrulation through early neurulation stages to define transcriptional changes in the emerging ‘neural plate border’ as well as other regions of the epiblast. Focusing on the border territory, the results reveal gradual establishment of heterogeneous neural plate border signatures, including novel genes that we validate by fluorescent in situ hybridization. Developmental trajectory analysis infers that segregation of neural plate border lineages only commences at early neurulation, rather than at gastrulation as previously predicted. We find that cells expressing the prospective neural crest marker <i>Pax7</i> contribute to multiple lineages, and a subset of premigratory neural crest cells shares a transcriptional signature with their border precursors. Together, our results suggest that cells at the neural plate border remain heterogeneous until early neurulation, at which time progenitors become progressively allocated toward defined neural crest and placode lineages. The data also can be mined to reveal changes throughout the developing epiblast.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Molecular markers of mechanosensation in glycinergic neurons in the avian lumbosacral spinal cord</a></h4>

              
                Birds are exceptionally adept at controlling their body position. For example, they can coordinate rapid movements of their body while stabilizing their head. Intriguingly, this ability may rely in part on a mechanosensory organ in the avian lower spinal cord called the lumbosacral organ (LSO). However, molecular mechanotransduction mechanisms have not been identified in the avian spinal cord. Here, we report the presence of glycinergic neurons in the LSO that exhibit immunoreactivity for myosin7a and epsin, molecules essential for function and maintenance of hair cells in the inner ear. Specifically, we find glycinergic cell bodies near the central canal and processes that extend laterally to the accessory lobes and spinal ligaments. These LSO neurons are reminiscent of glycinergic neurons in a recently-described lateral spinal proprioceptive organ in zebrafish that detects spinal bending. The avian LSO, however, is located inside a series of fused vertebrae called the synsacrum, which constrains spinal bending. We suggest the LSO may be a modification and elaboration of a pre-existing mechanosensory spinal network in vertebrates. A mechanistic understanding of its function may be an important clue to understanding the evolution and development of avian locomotion.

                Serotonin 5HT2c receptors have been implicated in the pathophysiology of both mood disorders and substance use disorders, but the precise cells and circuits mediating the effects on behavior have yet to be identified. In this study, we employed anatomical tracing, in-vivo fiber photometry with both calcium and serotonin sensors, electrophysiology, chemogenetics, and genetic manipulations of the 5HT2c receptor to identify two populations of neurons expressing serotonin 5HT2c receptors, one in the lateral habenula and one in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, that sex-specifically co-regulate affective behaviors and are modulated by binge alcohol consumption. These findings may have implications for the development of sex-specific treatments for mood disorders and substance use disorders targeting the brain serotonin systems.

                Behavioural feedback is critical for learning in the cerebral cortex. However, such feedback is often not readily available. How the cerebral cortex learns efficiently despite the sparse nature of feedback remains unclear. Inspired by recent deep learning algorithms, we introduce a systems-level computational model of cerebro-cerebellar interactions. In this model a cerebral recurrent network receives feedback predictions from a cerebellar network, thereby decoupling learning in cerebral networks from future feedback. When trained in a simple sensorimotor task the model shows faster learning and reduced dysmetria-like behaviours, in line with the widely observed functional impact of the cerebellum. Next, we demonstrate that these results generalise to more complex motor and cognitive tasks. Finally, the model makes several experimentally testable predictions regarding (1) cerebro-cerebellar task-specific representations over learning, (2) task-specific benefits of cerebellar predictions and (3) the differential impact of cerebellar and inferior olive lesions. Overall, our work offers a theoretical framework of cerebro-cerebellar networks as feedback decoupling machines.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">On the clinical benefit of on-scalp MEG: A modeling study of on-scalp MEG epileptic activity source estimation ability</a></h4>

              
                Objective: Whole-head on scalp magnetoencephalography (osMEG) is a novel, cutting-edge functional neuroimaging technique that positions MEG sensors closer to the cortical sources. OsMEG allows both for free head movements and improved spatial resolution compared to conventional MEG. OsMEG thus might improve clinical epilepsy evaluations. However, it remains largely unknown how osMEG characterizes epileptic activity. Here, we aimed to compare epileptic activity source estimation accuracy of osMEG, high-density EEG (hd-EEG), conventional MEG (convMEG) and subdural EEG (sbdEEG). Method: IED and seizure onset zone source estimations of osMEG, hdEEG, convMEG and sbdEEG were evaluated using equivalent current dipoles. Cancellation index of all non-invasive modalities were calculated and compared statistically. To further investigate any similarity between osMEG and sbdEEG, representational similarity analysis was used to compare IED source estimations of these two modalities. Results: We found that osMEG IED source estimations were significantly (p<0.05) better than both convMEG and hdEEG. Furthermore, osMEG mesial temporal lobe SOZ source estimations were superior to those of convMEG and hdEEG. OsMEG cancellation index did not differ significantly from convMEG. Interestingly, comparing osMEG and sbdEEG IED source estimation demonstrated that osMEG might be less sensitive to source directions than convMEG. Conclusion: We demonstrated that whole-head osMEG exhibited very accurate non-invasive IED and SOZ source estimations, better than both hd-EEG and convMEG. Significance: OsMEG has a promising potential to become a safe, highly sensitive neuroimaging modality for whole head epilepsy evaluations.

                Perception can be refined by experience up to certain limits. It is unclear if limitations are absolute or could be partially overcome via enhanced neuromodulation and/or plasticity. Recent studies highlight the utility of peripheral nerve stimulation - specifically vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) - for altering neural activity and augmenting experience-dependent plasticity, although little is known about central mechanisms recruited by VNS. Here we developed an auditory discrimination task for mice implanted with a VNS electrode. VNS occurring during behavior gradually improved discrimination abilities beyond the level achieved by training alone. Using two-photon imaging, we identified changes to auditory cortical responses and activation of cortically-projecting cholinergic axons with VNS. Anatomical and optogenetic experiments revealed that VNS seemed to enhance task performance via activation of the central cholinergic system. These results highlight the importance of cholinergic modulation for the efficacy of VNS, perhaps enabling further refinement of VNS methodology for clinical conditions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Curiosity and mesolimbic functional connectivity drive information seeking in real life</a></h4>

              
                Curiosity reflects the intrinsic motivation of an individual to seek information in order to close information gaps. Laboratory-based experiments have shown that both curiosity and information seeking are associated with enhanced neural dynamics in the mesolimbic dopaminergic circuit. However, it is unclear whether curiosity and its associated neural dynamics in the dopaminergic circuit drive information seeking in real life. The present study investigated (i) whether curiosity traits predict different characteristics of real-life information seeking and (ii) whether functional connectivity within the mesolimbic dopaminergic circuit is associated with information seeking outside of the laboratory. Up to 15 month before the COVID-19 pandemic, we conducted curiosity and anxiety questionnaires as well as a 10-minute resting-state fMRI session. In a follow-up survey early during the COVID-19 pandemic, participants repeated the questionnaires and filled out an additional questionnaire about their COVID-19-related information seeking. Curiosity but not anxiety remained stable over time. Individual differences in curiosity were positively associated with the frequency of information-seeking behaviour. Anxiety during the pandemic was not linked to any characteristics of real-life information seeking. Interestingly, the frequency of information seeking was also independently predicted by individual differences in resting-state functional connectivity between the ventral tegmental area and the nucleus accumbens. The present translational study paves the way for future studies on the role of curiosity in real-life information seeking by showing that curiosity drives information seeking in real-life situations and that the curiosity-promoting mesolimbic dopaminergic functional network supports the frequency of real-life information-seeking behaviour.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Face processing in the infant brain after pandemic lockdown</a></h4>

              
                The role of visual experience in the development of face processing has long been debated. We present a new angle on this question through a serendipitous study that cannot easily be repeated. Infants viewed short blocks of faces during fMRI in a repetition suppression task. The same identity was presented multiple times in half of the blocks (Repeat condition) and different identities were presented once each in the other half (Novel condition). In adults, the fusiform face area (FFA) tends to show greater neural activity for Novel vs. Repeat blocks in such designs, suggesting that it can distinguish same vs. different face identities. As part of an ongoing study, we collected data before the COVID-19 pandemic and after an initial State lockdown was lifted. The resulting sample of 12 infants (9 - 24 months) divided equally into pre- and post-lockdown groups with matching ages and data quantity/quality. The groups had strikingly different FFA responses: pre-lockdown infants showed repetition suppression (Novel > Repeat), whereas post-lockdown infants showed the opposite (Repeat > Novel), often referred to as repetition enhancement. These findings provide speculative evidence that altered visual experience during the lockdown, or other correlated environmental changes, may have affected face processing in the infant brain.

                The aging brain is characterized by a progressive increase in neuroinflammation and central insulin resistance, which contribute to neurodegenerative diseases and cognitive impairment. Recently, the Interventions Testing Program (ITP) demonstrated that the anti-diabetes drug, Canagliflozin (Cana), a sodium-glucose transporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2i), led to lower fasting glucose and improved glucose tolerance in both sexes, but extended median lifespan by 14% only in male mice. Here we show that Cana treatment significantly improved central insulin sensitivity in the hypothalamus and the hippocampus of 30-month-old male mice. Remarkably, Cana-treated mice showed significant reductions in age-associated hypothalamic gliosis with a decrease in inflammatory cytokine production by microglia in both sexes. In the hippocampus, Cana reduced microgliosis and astrogliosis in males, but not in female mice. The decrease in microgliosis was partially dependent on mTOR signaling, as evidenced by reduced phosphorylation of S6 kinase in microglia of Cana-treated aged male, but not female mice. Remarkably, Cana treatment improved exploratory and locomotor activity of 30-month-old male but not female mice. Taken together, our findings demonstrate sex-specific neuroprotective effects of Cana treatment, suggesting its application for the potential treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.

                Cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5 (CDKL5) deficiency disorder (CDD) is a devastating rare neurodevelopmental disease without a cure, caused by mutations of the serine/threonine kinase CDKL5 highly expressed in the forebrain. CDD is characterized by early-onset seizures, severe intellectual disabilities, autistic-like traits, sensorimotor and cortical visual impairments (CVI). The lack of an effective therapeutic strategy for CDD urgently demands the identification of novel druggable targets potentially relevant for CDD pathophysiology. To this aim, we studied metabotropic glutamate receptors 5 (mGluR5) for their important role in critical mechanisms involved in CDD, i.e.: synaptogenesis, dendritic spines formation/maturation and synaptic plasticity, and because mGluR5 function depends on the postsynaptic protein Homer1bc that is downregulated in the cerebral cortex of CDKL5-/y mice. In this study, we reveal that CDKL5 loss tampers with (i) the strength of Homer1bc-mGluR5 binding, (ii) the synaptic localization of mGluR5 and (iii) the mGluR5-mediated enhancement of NMDA-induced neuronal responses. Importantly, we showed that the stimulation of mGluR5 activity by administering in mice positive-allosteric-modulators, i.e.: 3-Cyano-N-(1,3-diphenyl-1H-pyrazol-5-yl)benzamide (CDPPB) or RO6807794, corrected the synaptic, functional and behavioural defects shown by CDKL5-/y mice. Notably, the cerebral cortex of 2 CDD patients show similar changes in the synaptic organization to mutant CDKL5 mice, including a reduced mGluR5 expression, suggesting that mGluR5 represent a promising therapeutic target for CDD patients.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Probabilistic forward replay of anticipated stimulus sequences in human primary visual cortex and hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                The ability to recognize and predict future spatiotemporal sequences is vital for perception. It has been proposed that the brain makes 'intelligent guesses' about future inputs by forward replaying these events. However, it is unknown whether and how this mechanism incorporates the probabilistic structure that is inherent to naturalistic environments. Here we tested forward replay in human V1 and hippocampus using a probabilistic cueing paradigm. Participants were exposed to two visual moving dot sequences (A and B) that shared the same starting point. Each stimulus sequence was paired with either a high or a low tone that predicted which sequence would follow with 80% cue validity (probabilistic context) or 50% cue validity (random context). We found that after exposure, the auditory cue together with the starting point triggered simultaneous forward replay of both the likely (A) and the less likely (B) stimulus sequence. Crucially, forward replay preserved the probabilistic relationship of the environment, such that the likely sequence was associated with greater anticipatory V1 activity compared to the less likely stimulus sequence. Analogous to V1, forward replay in hippocampus was also found to preserve the probabilistic cue-sequence relationship. Further, the anterior hippocampus was found to represent the predicted stimulus sequence, irrespective of the input, while the posterior hippocampus revealed a prediction error-like signal that was only observed when predictions were violated. These findings show how mnemonic and sensory areas coordinate predictive representations in probabilistic contexts to improve perceptual processing.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Connectivity dynamics and cognitive variability during aging</a></h4>

              
                Aging is accompanied by cognitive changes but strong variations across individuals exists. One of the ways to characterize this individual variability is to use techniques such as magnetoencephalography (MEG) to measure the dynamics of synchronization between brain regions and the variability of this connectivity over time. Indeed, few studies have focused on the fluctuations in the dynamics of brain networks over time and their evolution with age. We therefore used this method on the Cam-CAN database. We show here that with age an increase in the variability of brain synchronization, as well as a reversal of the direction of information transfer in the default mode network (DMN), in delta frequency band takes place. These changes in functional connectivity were associated with cognitive decline. These results suggest that advancing age is accompanied by a functional disorganization of dynamic networks with a loss of communication stability and a decrease in the information transmitted. This could be partly due to the loss of integrity of the network structure.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">High spatial overlap but diverging age-related trajectories of cortical MRI markers aiming to represent intracortical myelin and microstructure</a></h4>

              
                Cortical thickness (CT), gray-white matter contrast (GWC), boundary sharpness coefficient (BSC), and T1-weighted/T2-weighted ratio (T1w/T2w) are cortical metrics derived from standard T1- and T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images that are often interpreted as representing or being influenced by intracortical myelin content. However, there is little empirical evidence to justify these interpretations nor have the homologies or differences between these measures been examined. We examined differences and similarities in group mean and age-related trends with the underlying hypothesis that different measures sensitive to similar changes in underlying myelo- and microstructural processes should be highly related. We further probe their sensitivity to cellular organization using the BigBrain, a high-resolution digitized volume stemming from a whole human brain histologically stained for cell bodies with the Merker stain. The measures were generated on both the MRI-derived images of 127 healthy subjects, aged 18 to 81, and on the BigBrain volume using cortical surfaces that were generated with the CIVET 2.1.0 pipeline. Comparing MRI markers between themselves, our results revealed generally high overlap in spatial distribution (i.e., group mean), but mostly divergent age trajectories in the shape, direction, and spatial distribution of the linear age effect. Significant spatial relationships were found between the BSC and GWC and their BigBrain equivalent, as well as a correlation approaching significance between the BigBrain intensities and the T1w/T2w ratio in gray matter (GM) both sampled at half cortical depth. We conclude that the microstructural properties at the source of spatial distributions of MRI cortical markers (e.g. GM myelin) can be different from microstructural changes that affect these markers in aging. While our findings highlight a discrepancy in the interpretation of the biological underpinnings of the cortical markers, they also highlight their potential complementarity, as they are largely independent in aging. Our BigBrain results indicate a general trend of GM T1w signal and myelin being spatially related to the density of cells, which is possibly more pronounced in superficial cortical layers.

                Synaptic plasticity encodes learning as changes in the strength of synapses, sub-micron structures that mediate communication between brain cells. Due to their small size and high density, synapses are extremely difficult to image in vivo, limiting our ability to directly relate synaptic plasticity with behavior. Here, we developed a combination of computational and biological methods to overcome these challenges. First, we trained a deep learning image restoration algorithm that combines the advantages of ex vivo super-resolution and in vivo imaging modalities to overcome limitations specific to each optical system. Applied to in vivo images from transgenic mice expressing fluorescently labeled synaptic proteins, this restoration algorithm super-resolved diffraction-limited synapses, enabling identification and longitudinal tracking of synaptic plasticity underlying behavior with unprecedented spatial resolution. More generally, our method demonstrates the capabilities of image enhancement to learn from ex vivo data and imaging techniques to improve in vivo imaging resolution.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Structural covariance and heritability of the optic tract and primary visual cortex in living human brains</a></h4>

              
                Individual differences among human brains exist at many scales, spanning gene expression, white matter tissue properties, and the size and shape of cortical areas. One notable example is an approximately 3-fold range in the size of human primary visual cortex (V1), a much larger range than is found in overall brain size. A previous study (Andrews et al., 1997) reported a correlation between optic tract cross-section area and V1 size in post-mortem human brains, suggesting that there may be a common developmental mechanism for multiple components of the visual pathways. We evaluated the relationship between properties of the optic tract and V1 in a much larger sample of living human brains by analyzing the Human Connectome Project 7 Tesla Retinotopy Dataset. This dataset includes retinotopic maps measured with functional MRI (fMRI) and fiber tract data measured with diffusion MRI (dMRI). We found a negative correlation between optic tract fractional anisotropy and V1 surface area (r = -0.2). This correlation, though small, was consistent across multiple dMRI datasets differing in acquisition parameters. Further, we found that both V1 size and optic tract properties were correlated among twins, with higher correlations for monozygotic than dizygotic twins, indicating a high degree of heritability for both properties. Together, these results demonstrate covariation across individuals in properties of the retina (optic tract) and cortex (V1) and show that each is influenced by genetic factors.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Penalized Decomposition Using Residuals (PeDecURe) for Nuisance Variable Adjustment in Multivariate Pattern Analysis</a></h4>

              
                In neuroimaging studies, multivariate methods provide a framework for studying associations between complex patterns distributed throughout the brain and neurological, psychiatric, and behavioral phenotypes. However, mitigating the influence of nuisance variables, such as confounders, remains a critical challenge in multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA). In studies of Alzheimer's Disease, for example, imbalance in disease rates across age and sex may make it difficult to distinguish between structural patterns in the brain (as measured by neuroimaging scans) attributable to disease progression and those characteristic of typical human aging or sex differences. Concerningly, when not properly adjusted for, nuisance variables can obscure interpretations and preclude the generalizability of findings from neuroimaging studies. Motivated by this critical issue, in this work we examine the impact of nuisance variables on features extracted from image decomposition methods and propose Penalized Decomposition Using Residuals (PeDecURe), a new MVPA method for obtaining nuisance variable-adjusted features. PeDecURe estimates primary directions of variation which maximize covariance between residualized imaging features and a variable of interest (e.g., Alzheimer's diagnosis) while simultaneously mitigating the influence of nuisance variation through a penalty on the covariance between residualized imaging features and those variables. Using features estimated using PeDecURe's first direction of variation, we train an accurate and generalizable predictive model, as evidenced by its robustness in testing samples with different underlying nuisance variable distributions. We compare PeDecURe to commonly used decomposition methods (principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares) as well as a confounder-adjusted variation of PCA. We find that features derived from PeDecURe offer greater accuracy and generalizability and lower partial correlations with nuisance variables compared with the other methods. While PeDecURe is primarily motivated by MVPA in the context of neuroimaging, it is broadly applicable to datasets where the dimensionality or complexity of the covariance structure calls for novel methods to handle sources of nuisance variation.

                100-250 amino acid 'micropeptides' are hidden throughout mammalian genomes, though few functional studies of micropeptides are published. Here, we describe a micropeptide known as the Plasticity Associated Neural Transcript Short (Pants), located in the 22q11.2 region of the human genome, the microdeletion of which conveys a high risk for schizophrenia. Our data show that Pants is upregulated in early adulthood in the mossy fiber circuit of the hippocampus, where it exerts a powerful negative effect on long-term potentiation (LTP). Pants is secreted from neurons, where it associates with synapses but is rapidly degraded with stimulation. Pants dynamically interacts with Rtn4/Nogo, a well-studied regulator of adult plasticity. This study shows that neural micropeptides can act as architectural modules that increase the diversity of the known proteome.

                Aging is a complex process involving transcriptomic changes associated with deterioration across multiple tissues and organs, including the brain. Recent studies using heterochronic parabiosis have shown that various aspects of aging-associated decline are modifiable or even reversible. To better understand how this occurs, we performed single-cell transcriptomic profiling of young and old mouse brains following parabiosis. For each cell type, we catalogued alterations in gene expression, molecular pathways, transcriptional networks, ligand-receptor interactions, and senescence status. Our analyses identified gene signatures demonstrating that heterochronic parabiosis regulates several hallmarks of aging in a cell-type-specific manner. Brain endothelial cells were found to be especially malleable to this intervention, exhibiting dynamic transcriptional changes that affect vascular structure and function. These findings suggest novel strategies for slowing deterioration and driving regeneration in the aging brain through approaches that do not rely on disease-specific mechanisms or actions of individual circulating factors.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Static magnetic stimulation induces structural plasticity at the axon initial segment of inhibitory cortical neurons</a></h4>

              
                Static magnetic stimulation (SMS) is a form of non-invasive brain stimulation that can alter neural activity and induce neural plasticity that outlasts the period of stimulation. While SMS is typically delivered for short periods (e.g., 10 minutes) to alter corticospinal excitability or motor behaviours, the plasticity mechanisms that can be induced with longer periods of stimulation have not been explored. In mammalian neurons, the axon initial segment (AIS) is the site of action potential initiation and undergoes structural plasticity as a homeostatic mechanism to counteract chronic changes in neuronal activity. Therefore, we investigated whether the chronic application of SMS would induce structural AIS plasticity in cortical neurons. SMS (0.5 Tesla in intensity) was delivered to postnatally derived mouse primary cortical neurons consisting of mainly inhibitory neurons, for 6 or 48 hours beginning from 7 days in vitro (DIV7). AIS structural plasticity (length and starting distance from the soma) was quantified immediately after and 24 hours post-stimulation. Following 6 hours of stimulation, we observed an immediate decrease in median AIS length compared to control, that persisted to 24 hours post stimulation. In addition, there was a distal shift in the AIS start position relative to the soma that was only observed 24 hours after the 6-hour stimulation. Following 48 hours of stimulation, we observed an immediate shortening of AIS length and a distal shift in AIS start position relative to the soma, however only the distal shift in AIS start position persisted to 24 hours post-stimulation. Our findings provide the foundation to expand the use of SMS to more chronic applications as a method to study or promote AIS plasticity non-invasively.

                Memory reactivation during Non-Rapid Eye Movement (NREM) sleep is important for memory consolidation but it remains unclear exactly how such activity promotes the development of a stable memory representation. We used Targeted Memory Reactivation (TMR) in combination with longitudinal structural and functional MRI to track the evolution of a motor memory trace over 20 days. We show that repeated reactivation of motor memory during sleep leads to increased precuneus activation 24 h post-TMR. Interestingly, a decrease in precuneus activity over the next 10 days predicts longer-term cueing benefit. We also find both functional and structural changes in sensorimotor cortex in association with effects of TMR 20 days post-encoding. These findings demonstrate that TMR can engage precuneus in the short-term while also impacting on task-related structure and function over longer timescales.

                Photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) is an alternative to LASIK and can cause intense acute pain that is often not relieved by standard treatments. To assess potential therapeutics for this type of acute pain, appropriate preclinical models are needed. Herein we describe a rodent preclinical model of PRK and a multi-faceted approach to determine the therapeutic potential of resveratrol, a natural phytoestrogen, on pain, tear production, and the corneal epithelium. Studies were conducted in male and female Sprague-Dawley rats. Heptanol was applied to one eye and the superficial corneal epithelium was removed, mimicking the abrasion seen in PRK. Spontaneous pain was assessed with orbital tightening (OT) scores for 7 days. Corneal abrasion increased OT scores in both male and female rats with peak responses at 24 - 48 hours. Topical application of resveratrol had a sex-specific effect on OT scores and tear production. Resveratrol increased OT scores in abraded males, but not females, at 72 hours and 1 week after abrasion. Resveratrol dose-dependently increased tear production in abraded males, but had no effect in abraded females. While there was no correlation between OT score at 1 week and tear production, CGRP content of corneal nerves was positively correlated with 1 week OT score. There was also a significant increase in CD68-labeled macrophages in resveratrol-treated abraded corneas as compared to naive corneas. These findings demonstrate the usefulness of our preclinical PRK model for the assessment of ocular pain therapeutics and indicate that topical resveratrol may not be useful for managing PRK-induced pain.

                Music is core to human experience across cultures. Multiple brain regions are engaged in music perception, but the neural dynamics of music processing are not well defined. We applied predictive modeling tools to intracranial EEG data recorded from 29 patients who passively listened to a song (Another Brick in the Wall, Part 1, Pink Floyd), focusing on high-frequency activity (HFA; 70-150Hz) as a marker of local neural population activity. Encoding models characterized the spectrotemporal receptive fields (STRFs) of each electrode and decoding models investigated the population-level song representation. With the STRFs, we confirmed a central role of bilateral superior temporal gyri (STG) in music perception with additional involvement of bilateral sensory-motor cortices (SMC) and inferior frontal gyri (IFG). We also observed a right hemispheric preference for music perception. Using both an independent component analysis (ICA) and temporal modulations, we observed cortical regions tuned to specific musical elements including the vocals, lead guitar notes and rhythm guitar patterns. An ablation analysis selectively removed music-responsive electrodes from decoding models to assess the contribution of anatomical and functional regions to representing the song's acoustics. Ablating electrodes from either left and right hemispheres sites deteriorated decoding accuracy, and we confirmed a right STG preference for music perception. We also report, to our knowledge, the first attempt at reconstructing the song from neural activity using both linear and non-linear decoding models, and discuss methodological factors impacting decoding accuracy.

                How does binge drinking alcohol change synaptic function, and do these changes maintain binge consumption? The anterior insular cortex (AIC) and dorsolateral striatum (DLS) are brain regions implicated in alcohol use disorder. In mice, we found that binge drinking alcohol produced glutamatergic synaptic adaptations selective to AIC inputs within the DLS. Photoexciting AIC[-&gt;]DLS circuitry during binge drinking decreased alcohol, but not water consumption and altered alcohol drinking mechanics. Further, drinking mechanics alone from drinking session data predicted alcohol-related circuit changes. AIC[-&gt;]DLS manipulation did not alter operant, valence, or anxiety-related behaviors. These findings suggest that alcohol-mediated changes in AIC inputs govern behavioral sequences that maintain binge drinking and may serve as a circuit-based biomarker for the development of alcohol use disorder.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Predicting the Degree of Distracted Driving Based on fNIRS Functional Connectivity: A Pilot Study</a></h4>

              
                Distracted driving is one of the main causes of traffic accidents. By predicting the attentional state of drivers, it is possible to prevent distractions and promote safe driving. In this study, we developed a model that could predict the degree of distracted driving based on brain activity. Changes in oxyhemoglobin concentrations were measured in drivers while driving a real car using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). A regression model was constructed for each participant using functional connectivity as an explanatory variable and break reaction time to random beeps while driving as an objective variable. As a result, we were able to construct a prediction model for 11 of the 12 participants. Furthermore, the regression model with the highest prediction accuracy for each participant was analyzed to gain a better understanding of the neural basis of distracted driving. The 11 models were classified into five clusters by hierarchical clustering based on their functional connectivity edges used in each cluster. The results showed that the combinations of the dorsal attention network (DAN) sensory motor network (SMN) and DAN ventral attention network (VAN) connections were common in all clusters and that these networks were essential to predict the degree of distraction in complex multitask driving. They also confirmed the existence of multiple types of prediction models with different within- and between-network connectivity patterns. These results indicate that it is possible to predict the degree of distracted driving based on the brain activity of the driver during actual driving. These results are expected to contribute to the development of safe driving systems and elucidation of the neural basis of distracted driving.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Widespread alterations in microRNA biogenesis in human Huntington's disease putamen</a></h4>

              
                Altered microRNA (miRNA) expression is a common feature of Huntington's disease (HD) and could participate in disease onset and progression. However, little is known about the underlying causes of miRNA disruption in HD. We and others have previously shown that mutant Huntingtin (mHTT) binds to Ago2, a central component of miRNA biogenesis, and disrupts mature miRNA levels. In this study, we sought to determine if miRNA maturation per se was compromised in HD. Towards this end, we characterized t major miRNA biogenesis pathway components and miRNA maturation products (pri-miRNA, pre-miRNA, and mature) in human HD (N=41, Vonsattel grades HD2-4) and healthy control (N=25) subjects. Notably, the striatum (putamen) and cortex (BA39) from the same individuals were analyzed in parallel. We show that Ago2, Drosha, and Dicer were strongly downregulated in human HD at early stages of disease. Using a panel of HD-related miRNAs (miR-10b, miR-196b, miR-132, miR-212, miR-127, miR-128), we uncovered various types of maturation defects in HD brain, the most prominent occurring at the pre-miRNA to mature miRNA maturation step. Consistent with earlier findings, we provide evidence that alterations in autophagy could participate in miRNA maturation defects. Notably, most changes occurred in the striatum, which is more prone to HTT aggregation and neurodegeneration. Likewise, we observed no significant alterations in miRNA biogenesis in human HD cortex and blood, strengthening tissue-specific effects. Overall, these data provide important clues into the underlying mechanisms behind miRNA alterations in HD-susceptible tissues. Further investigations are now required to understand the biological, diagnostic, and therapeutic implications of miRNA/RNAi biogenesis defects in HD and related neurodegenerative disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Decoding the temporal dynamics of affective scene processing</a></h4>

              
                Natural images containing affective scenes are used extensively to investigate the neural mechanisms of visual emotion processing. Functional fMRI studies have shown that these images activate a large-scale distributed brain network that encompasses areas in visual, temporal, and frontal cortices. The underlying spatial and temporal dynamics among these network structures, however, remain to be characterized. We recorded simultaneous EEG-fMRI data while participants passively viewed affective images from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS). Applying multivariate pattern analysis to decode EEG data, and representational similarity analysis to fuse EEG data with simultaneously recorded fMRI data, we found that: (1) ~100 ms after picture onset, perceptual processing of complex visual scenes began in early visual cortex, proceeding to ventral visual cortex at ~160 ms, (2) between ~200 and ~300 ms (pleasant pictures: ~200 ms; unpleasant pictures: ~260 ms), affect-specific neural representations began to form, supported mainly by areas in occipital and temporal cortices, and (3) affect-specific neural representations, lasting up to ~2 s, were stable and exhibited temporally generalizable activity patterns. These results suggest that affective scene representations in the brain are formed in a valence-dependent manner and are sustained by recurrent neural interactions among distributed brain areas.

                Humans utilize egocentric and allocentric spatial information to guide goal-directed movements. Egocentric encoding is a well-known property of brain areas along the dorsal pathway. We ask if dorsal stream reach planning areas like parietal reach region (PRR) and dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) also encode object-centered (allocentric) information. During two consecutive instructed delay periods, rhesus monkeys first memorized an object-relative target position and then planned a reach to this position after the object re-occurred at variable positions with potentially different size. In both areas, we find predominant object-centered encoding during visual memory, which is invariant to object position and object size, and predominant egocentric encoding during reach planning. Such dynamic transition from allo- to egocentric encoding within individual dorsal stream areas contrasts the idea of task-independent functional segregation between processing pathways. Instead, demand-specific local computations might facilitate spatial cognition in dynamic environments to facilitate motor planning towards objects changing their location.

                The graph thresholding is a frequently used practice of eliminating the weak connections in brain functional connectivity graphs. The main aim of the procedure is to delete the spurious connections in the data. However, the choice of the threshold is arbitrary and the effect of the threshold choice in not fully understood. Here we present the description of the changes in the global measures of a functional connectivity graph depending on the different proportional thresholds based on the 146 resting-state EEG recordings. The dynamics is presented in five different synchronization measures (wPLI, ImCoh, Coherence, ciPLV, PPC) in sensors and source spaces. The analysis shows significant changes in the graphs global connectivity measures as a function of the chosen threshold which may influence on the outcome of the study. The choice of the threshold could lead to the different study conclusions, thus it is necessary to improve the reasoning behind the choice of the different analytic options and consider adoption of different analytic approaches.

                The development of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) has transformed human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection from a lethal diagnosis into a chronic disease, and people living with HIV on cART can experience an almost normal life expectancy. However, these individuals often develop various complications that lead to decreased quality of life, one of the most significant of which is neuropathic pain and development of painful peripheral sensory neuropathy (PSN). Critically, although cART is thought to induce pain pathogenesis, the relative contribution of different classes of antiretrovirals has not been systematically investigated. In this study, we measured development of pathological pain and peripheral neuropathy in mice orally treated with distinct antiretrovirals at their translational dosages. Our results show that only nucleoside reverse transcriptases (NRTIs), but not other types of antiretrovirals, such as proteinase inhibitors, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, integrase strand transfer inhibitors, and CCR5 antagonists, induce pathological pain and PSN. Thus, these findings suggest that NRTIs are the major class of antiretrovirals in cART that promote development of neuropathic pain. As NRTIs form the essential backbone of multiple different current cART regimens, it is of paramount clinical importance to better understand the underlying mechanism to facilitate design of less toxic forms of these drugs and or potential mitigation strategies.

                According to Braak's hypothesis, it is plausible that Parkinson's disease (PD) starts in the enteric nervous system (ENS) to spread the brain via the vagus nerve. Thus, we were wondering whether human inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) can progress with appearance of pathogenic alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) in the gastrointestinal tract and midbrain dopaminergic neurons. Analysis of human gastrointestinal tract sections from IBD patients demonstrated the presence of pathogenic phosphorylated alpha-syn in both myenteric (Auerbach's) and submucosal (Meissner's) plexuses. Remarkably, PD subjects exhibit alpha-syn pathology in identical gastrointestinal locations. Analysis of human midbrain sections from IBD subjects revealed a clear displacement of neuromelanin in some nigral neurons from the ventral mesencephalon, which were inherently associated with presence of alpha-syn aggregates reminiscent of pale bodies. We also used different dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-based rat models of gut inflammation (subchronic and chronic) to study the appearance of phosphorylated alpha-syn inclusions in both Auerbach's and Meissner's plexuses (gut), and in dopaminergic neuritic processes (brain) along with degeneration of nigral dopaminergic neurons, which are considered classical hallmarks of PD. Vagotomized DSS-treated animals exhibited pathological alpha-syn in the gut but failed to show dopaminergic cells degeneration and alpha-syn aggregation in the ventral mesencephalon. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that Braak's hypothesis is plausible.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Changes in cellular ferritin distribution of human brain tissue during autolysis revealed using analytical electron microscopy</a></h4>

              
                Iron in the human brain is stored in the cores of ferritin proteins. Excess iron has been implicated in neurological disorders, so a careful balance of the iron concentration is thought to be essential for human health. Though it is known that oligodendrocytes contain most of the brain ferritin, followed by other glial cells and neurons, little is known about changes in the cellular ferritin distribution when total iron load changes. Moreover, changes in the number of filled ferritins or in their cellular distribution during autolysis have not been revealed yet. To reveal these changes, we examined brain samples taken from six deceased humans at different post mortem times. To compare samples with different ferritin content, the samples included the frontal gray and frontal white matter, which store a low amount of iron, and the putamen and globus pallidus, which store a high amount of iron. We quantified the number of loaded ferritin cores from iron L - elemental maps obtained with energy filtered transmission electron microscopy and compared this number to the iron concentrations determined using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and quantitative magnetic resonance imaging. The more loaded ferritin cores we found in the tissues, the higher the proportion of ferritins found in neurons instead of glial cells, indicating that total ferritin load scales with the proportion of ferritin that is located in neurons. Second, we found a statistically significant correlation between the post mortem interval and the amount / concentration of loaded ferritins and found that this concentration is highly dependent on the post mortem interval (PMI): the longer the PMI, the lower the ferritin concentration found in a sample. Third, the longer the post mortem interval, the higher the proportion of ferritins found in neurons instead of glial cells, indicating that ferritin loss during autolysis affects neurons and glial cells at different rates.

	<p>Ataxia with oculomotor apraxia type 2 (AOA2), also known as autosomal recessive spinocerebellar ataxia with axonal neuropathy-2 (SCAN2) (OMIM #606002), is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by early-onset progressive cerebellar ataxia, polyneuropathy, and elevated levels of alpha-fetoprotein. It is caused by mutations in the SETX (OMIM #608465) gene. The prevalence of this disease is widely varied, from non-existent up to 1/150,000, depending on the region. Until now, no cases of AOA2/SCAN2 have been reported in Taiwan. Methods: Next-generation sequencing was used to detect disease-causing mutations of SETX in a Taiwanese patient presenting with autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia, polyneuropathy, and elevated alpha-fetoprotein. The candidate mutations were further confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Sanger sequencing. Results: A compound heterozygous mutation of SETX c.6859C &amp;amp;gt; T (p.R2287X) and c.7034-7036del was identified. The c.6859C &amp;amp;gt; T (p.R2287X) has been previously found in a Saudi Arabia family, whereas c.7034-7036del is a novel mutation. Both mutations were predicted by bioinformatics programs to be likely pathogenic (having a damaging effect). We also reviewed the literature to address the reported clinical features of AOA2 from different populations. Conclusions: To our knowledge, we are the first to report a Taiwanese patient with AOA2/SCAN2, a result obtained by utilizing next-generation sequencing. The literature review shows that ataxia, polyneuropathy, and elevated AFP are common features and ocular motor apraxia (OMA) is a variable sign of AOA2 from different populations. OMA is rare and saccadic ocular pursuit and nystagmus are common in East Asian AOA2.</p>

	<p>Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder with an unclear etiology and no disease-modifying treatment to date. PD is considered a multifactorial disease, since both genetic and environmental factors contribute to its pathogenesis, although the molecular mechanisms linking these two key disease modifiers remain obscure. In this context, epigenetic mechanisms that alter gene expression without affecting the DNA sequence through DNA methylation, histone post-transcriptional modifications, and non-coding RNAs may represent the key mediators of the genetic&amp;amp;ndash;environmental interactions underlying PD pathogenesis. Environmental exposures may cause chemical alterations in several cellular functions, including gene expression. Emerging evidence has highlighted that smoking, coffee consumption, pesticide exposure, and heavy metals (manganese, arsenic, lead, etc.) may potentially affect the risk of PD development at least partially via epigenetic modifications. Herein, we discuss recent accumulating pre-clinical and clinical evidence of the impact of lifestyle and environmental factors on the epigenetic mechanisms underlying PD development, aiming to shed more light on the pathogenesis and stimulate future research.</p>

	<p>Background: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex developmental condition that affects the whole family. The gap between childrens&amp;amp;rsquo; needs and their satisfaction, especially regarding what concerns the presence of social and healthcare services, is still a source of burden, particularly after the transition to adulthood. Our study aimed to gather a comprehensive view on how parents of adults with ASD perceive (and interact with) health and social services, and how the provision of care impacts family quality of life with the aim to advise ASD intervention programs. The goal is to identify specific areas of change useful to influence autism intervention strategies so that they more effectively meet the needs of young people with autism and their families. Methods: We conducted two focus groups with parents of young adults with ASD. A semi-structured focus group methodology was adopted. The QoL conceptual framework guided data collection and analysis as part of a directed theory-driven content analysis approach. Results: The lack of structured care pathways and the low level of integration of different services were the main limits reported by parents during the focus group, while a shared positive perception of the experience conducted together as caring families emerged. Conclusions: The experience here reported claims for a greater role of the institutions in order to facilitate the building of networks that are really inclusive for persons with autism in society and to support the implementation of innovative solutions for the welfare system. Furthermore, parents stressed the need for the provision of support to the family.</p>

	<p>Mental disorders are observed in neuromuscular diseases, especially now that patients are living longer. Psychiatric symptoms may be severe and psychopharmacological treatments may be required. However, very little is known about pharmacotherapy in these conditions. We aimed to summarize the current knowledge on the use of psychopharmacological treatments for mental disorders in patients living with a neuromuscular disease. A scoping review was performed using the methodology of the Joanna Briggs Institute. Four databases were searched from January 2000 to July 2021. Articles were screened based on titles and abstracts. Full-text papers published in peer-reviewed journals in English were selected. Twenty-six articles met eligibility criteria, all being case reports/series focusing on the psychopharmacological control of psychiatric symptoms for the following conditions: myasthenia gravis (n = 11), Duchenne (n = 5) and Becker (n = 3) muscular dystrophy, mitochondrial disorders (n = 3), glycogen storage disease (n = 1), myotonic dystrophy (n = 1), hyperkalemic periodic paralysis (n = 1), and congenital myasthenic syndrome (n = 1). None of the articles provided details on the decision-making process to choose a specific drug/regimen or on follow-up strategies to monitor safety and efficacy. Larger studies showing real-world data would be required to guide consensus-based recommendations, thus improving current standards of care and, ultimately, the quality of life of patients and their families.</p>

	<p>Heart rate variability (HRV) has been suggested to reflect executive function and related neural activity. Executive dysfunction has been suggested to play an important role in the pathophysiology of emotional disorders. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether HRV showed a significant correlation with electroencephalogram (EEG) during a working memory performance in patients with depressive or anxiety disorder. A retrospective analysis was conducted with data from 61 patients with depressive disorder (43 women and 18 men) and 59 patients with anxiety disorder (35 women and 24 men). HRV was measured in the resting state, and EEG was recorded in the resting state and during the execution of a working memory task. It was performed in patients with depressive and anxiety disorder, and the paired sample t-test between resting state and task performance, as well as the partial correlation analysis between HRV and EEG, was conducted. Both depressed and anxious patients showed weaker beta relative power during the working memory task compared to the rest period. The resting-state EEG did not correlate with HRV parameters in both groups. In depressed patients, HRV showed a positive correlation with delta power during the task and a negative correlation with beta relative power during the task. In patients with anxiety disorder, HRV showed a significant positive correlation with theta power of the right frontal region during the task. Our results suggest that HRV would be related to executive-function-related neural activity in patients with depressive or anxiety disorder. Future studies with more subjects, including healthy controls, are needed to verify the correlation between HRV and EEG and to come up with a more comprehensive picture of neurobiological changes in emotional disorders.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Life expectancy in humans is increasing, resulting in a growing aging population, that is accompanied by an increased disposition to develop cognitive deterioration. Hypometabolism is one of the multiple factors related to inefficient brain function during aging. This review emphasizes the metabolic interactions between glial cells (astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and microglia) and neurons, particularly, during aging. Glial cells provide support and protection to neurons allowing adequate synaptic activity. We address metabolic coupling from the expression of transporters, availability of substrates, metabolic pathways, and mitochondrial activity. In aging, the main metabolic exchange machinery is altered with inefficient levels of nutrients and detrimental mitochondrial activity that results in high reactive oxygen species levels and reduced ATP production, generating a highly inflammatory environment that favors deregulated cell death. Here, we provide an overview of the glial-to-neuron mechanisms, from the molecular components to the cell types, emphasizing aging as the crucial risk factor for developing neurodegenerative/neuroinflammatory diseases.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Timing of Splenectomy after Acute Spinal Cord Injury</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating condition. Splenectomy may play a protective role in the development of SCI. However, little is known about whether the timing of splenectomy affects the outcome after SCI. Investigation into splenectomy after SCI would provide insight into how the timing can be selected following SCI to improve neurologic outcomes. Rats were randomized into a sham group, a nonsplenectomized group (NonSPX), four splenectomized groups with the surgery performed immediately, 6 h, 12 h, and 24 h after SCI (SPX0, SPX6, SPX12, and SPX24, respectively). Rats were subjected to severe contusive SCI at the level of the third thoracic vertebra. At different time points following SCI, Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan (BBB) score was used to assess the recovery of injury. The animals in each group were randomly selected for tissue collection at days 3, 14, and 28 after surgery. Then, immunohistochemistry of immunologic cells was performed and inflammatory mediators were determined. Our study showed that splenectomy within 6 h after SCI improved BBB scores as compared with splenectomy more than 12 h after SCI, and decrease the immune cell responses to SCI. Protein levels of interleukin (IL)-1&beta; and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-&alpha; were significantly elevated in nonsplenectomized group compared with sham group. No difference was observed in IL-10 at the lesion site between splenectomized and nonsplenectomized groups at 3 d post-SCI. The study demonstrates that splenectomy within 6 h after SCI would lessen the development of SCI and improve outcome.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Does the impact of medical publications vary by disease indication and publication type? An exploration using a novel, value-based, publication metric framework: the EMPIRE Index [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The EMPIRE (EMpirical Publication Impact and Reach Evaluation) Index is a value-based, multi-component metric framework to assess the impact of medical publications in terms of relevance to different stakeholders. It comprises three component scores (social, scholarly and societal impact), each incorporating related altmetrics that indicate a different aspect of engagement with the publication. Here, we present an exploratory investigation of whether publication types or disease indications influence EMPIRE Index scores. Methods: Article-level metrics were extracted and EMPIRE Index scores were calculated for 5825 journal articles published from 1 May 2017 to 1 May 2018, representing 12 disease indications (chosen to reflect a wide variety of common and rare diseases with a variety of aetiologies) and five publication types. Results: There were significant differences in scores between article types and disease indications. Median (95% CI) social and scholarly impact scores ranged from 1.2 (0.3–1.6) to 4.8 (3.1–6.6), respectively, for phase 3 clinical trials, and from 0.3 (0.3–0.4) to 2.3 (1.9–2.6), respectively, for observational studies. Social and scholarly impact scores were highest for multiple sclerosis publications and lowest for non-small cell lung cancer publications. Systematic reviews achieved greater impact than regular reviews. Median trends in the social impact of different disease areas matched the level of public interest as assessed through Google search interest. Although most articles did not register societal impact, mean societal impact scores were highest for migraine publications. Conclusions: The EMPIRE Index successfully identified differences in impact by disease area and publication type, which supports the notion that the impact of each publication needs to be evaluated in the context of these factors, and potentially others. These findings should be considered when using the EMPIRE Index to assess publication impact.

Project-based learning (PBL) is a dynamic student-centred teaching method that encourages students to solve real-life problems while fostering engagement and critical thinking. Here, we report on a PBL course on metabolic network modelling that has been running for several years within the Master in Integrated Systems Biology (MISB) at the University of Luxembourg. This 2-week full-time block course comprises an introduction into the core concepts and methods of constraint-based modelling (CBM), applied to toy models and large-scale networks alongside the preparation of individual student projects in week 1 and, in week 2, the presentation and execution of these projects. We describe in detail the schedule and content of the course, exemplary student projects, and reflect on outcomes and lessons learned. PBL requires the full engagement of students and teachers and gives a rewarding teaching experience. The presented course can serve as a role model and inspiration for other similar courses.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Colon stroma mediates an inflammation-driven fibroblastic response controlling matrix remodeling and healing</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Guadalupe J. Jasso, Alok Jaiswal, Mukund Varma, Tyler Laszewski, Angelo Grauel, Abdifatah Omar, Nilsa Silva, Glenn Dranoff, Jeffrey A. Porter, Keith Mansfield, Viviana Cremasco, Aviv Regev, Ramnik J. Xavier, Daniel B. Graham</p>

Chronic inflammation is often associated with the development of tissue fibrosis, but how mesenchymal cell responses dictate pathological fibrosis versus resolution and healing remains unclear. Defining stromal heterogeneity and identifying molecular circuits driving extracellular matrix deposition and remodeling stands to illuminate the relationship between inflammation, fibrosis, and healing. We performed single-cell RNA-sequencing of colon-derived stromal cells and identified distinct classes of fibroblasts with gene signatures that are differentially regulated by chronic inflammation, including IL-11–producing inflammatory fibroblasts. We further identify a transcriptional program associated with <i>trans</i>-differentiation of mucosa-associated fibroblasts and define a functional gene signature associated with matrix deposition and remodeling in the inflamed colon. Our analysis supports a critical role for the metalloprotease Adamdec1 at the interface between tissue remodeling and healing during colitis, demonstrating its requirement for colon epithelial integrity. These findings provide mechanistic insight into how inflammation perturbs stromal cell behaviors to drive fibroblastic responses controlling mucosal matrix remodeling and healing.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">The NKCC1 ion transporter modulates microglial phenotype and inflammatory response to brain injury in a cell-autonomous manner</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Krisztina Tóth, Nikolett Lénárt, Péter Berki, Rebeka Fekete, Eszter Szabadits, Balázs Pósfai, Csaba Cserép, Ahmad Alatshan, Szilvia Benkő, Dániel Kiss, Christian A. Hübner, Attila Gulyás, Kai Kaila, Zsuzsanna Környei, Ádám Dénes</p>

The NKCC1 ion transporter contributes to the pathophysiology of common neurological disorders, but its function in microglia, the main inflammatory cells of the brain, has remained unclear to date. Therefore, we generated a novel transgenic mouse line in which microglial NKCC1 was deleted. We show that microglial NKCC1 shapes both baseline and reactive microglia morphology, process recruitment to the site of injury, and adaptation to changes in cellular volume in a cell-autonomous manner via regulating membrane conductance. In addition, microglial NKCC1 deficiency results in NLRP3 inflammasome priming and increased production of interleukin-1β (IL-1β), rendering microglia prone to exaggerated inflammatory responses. In line with this, central (intracortical) administration of the NKCC1 blocker, bumetanide, potentiated intracortical lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced cytokine levels. In contrast, systemic bumetanide application decreased inflammation in the brain. Microglial NKCC1 KO animals exposed to experimental stroke showed significantly increased brain injury, inflammation, cerebral edema, and, worse, neurological outcome. Thus, NKCC1 emerges as an important player in controlling microglial ion homeostasis and inflammatory responses through which microglia modulate brain injury. The contribution of microglia to central NKCC1 actions is likely to be relevant for common neurological disorders.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Evaluation of the rapid, multi-country, parallel process, multi-tasking approach to startup of short-term technical assistance to improve service delivery in newborn and child health in the context of USAID’s Zika response in four Eastern and Southern Car</a></h4>

              
                Background: In 2018, the USAID Applying Science to Strengthen and Improve Systems (ASSIST) Project started a new partnership with four Eastern and Southern Caribbean countries impacted by the Zika virus: Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, St. Kitts and Nevis, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines.  The goal of the project was to provide short-term technical assistance (STTA) to strengthen the health systems’ capacity to detect newborns and young children potentially affected by Zika and to address their health needs.  To meet these objectives, ASSIST developed an innovative approach based on its existing model for service delivery improvement. This novel approach is known as Rapid, Multi-country, Parallel Process, Multi-tasking Approach for a Project Startup (RMPP-MAPS).  An evaluation was conducted to document the STTA startup activities, to identify enabling and constraining factors, and to capture lessons learned. Methods: An external consultant conducted remote in-depth interviews with individuals involved in the startup using semi-structured interview guides and retrieved data from the review of project documents. Results: Using RMPP-MAPS, the ASSIST Project successfully implemented the startup for complex STTA in four countries within less than four months, spanning mid-May to early September 2018. Project milestones included achieving buy-in from stakeholders, co-developing the technical scope and materials, and rapidly executing critical operational functions.  Dedicated project teams, country leaderships, and local champions were essential to overcoming the main challenges, which included a condensed timeframe, lack of in-country offices, and country-level factors such as a shortage of health care workers and a weak health infrastructure.  Conclusions: The RMPP-MAPS is a feasible and resource-efficient mechanism of interest to implementers, donors, and low and middle-income countries facing temporal and financial limitations to rapidly addressing public health priorities.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Plasma p‐tau231, p‐tau181, PET biomarkers and cognitive change in older adults</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To evaluate novel plasma p-tau231, p-tau181 as well as Aβ<sub>40</sub> and Aβ<sub>42</sub> assays as indicators of tau and Aβ pathologies measured with positron emission tomography (PET), and their association with cognitive change, in cognitively unimpaired older adults.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In a cohort of 244 older adults at risk of AD owing to a family history of AD dementia, we measured single molecule array (Simoa)-based plasma tau biomarkers (p-tau231, p-tau181), Aβ<sub>40</sub> and Aβ<sub>42</sub> with immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry, and Simoa NfL. A subset of 129 participants underwent amyloid-β (<sup>18</sup>F-NAV4694) and tau (<sup>18</sup>F-flortaucipir) PET assessments. We investigated plasma biomarker associations with Aβ and tau PET at the global and voxel level and tested plasma biomarker combinations for improved detection of Aβ-PET positivity. We also investigated associations with 8-year cognitive change.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Plasma p-tau biomarkers correlated with flortaucipir binding in medial temporal, parietal and inferior temporal regions. P-tau231 showed further associations in lateral parietal and occipital cortices. Plasma Aβ<sub>42/40</sub> explained more variance in global Aβ-PET binding than Aβ<sub>42</sub> alone. P-tau231 also showed strong and widespread associations with cortical Aβ-PET binding. Combining Aβ<sub>42/40</sub> with p-tau231 or p-tau181 allowed for good distinction between Aβ-negative and -positive participants (AUC range 0.81-0.86). Individuals with low plasma Aβ<sub>42/40</sub> and high p-tau experienced faster cognitive decline.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Plasma p-tau231 showed more robust associations with PET biomarkers than p-tau181 in pre-symptomatic individuals. The combination of p-tau and Aβ<sub>42/40</sub> biomarkers detected early AD pathology and cognitive decline. Such markers could be used as pre-screening tools to reduce the cost of prevention trials.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Prevalence of cancer as a comorbid in COVID-19 patients and their characteristics: a meta-analysis study [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Cancer patients are considered susceptible to coronavirus disease (COVID-19) due to an immunosuppressive state. This study determined the prevalence of cancer as a comorbid in COVID-19 patients, severe events, case fatality rate, history of anticancer therapy associated with severe events, and type of cancer in cancer patients with COVID-19 in the world. Methods: This study used a meta-analysis study approach, sourcing studies from various countries related to cancer and COVID-19. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were established to select studies. A PRISMA flowchart was presented to assess the selection process. Data from inclusion studies were analyzed using Review Manager 5.4. Results: The prevalence of cancer as a comorbid in COVID-19 patients was 4.63% (95% CI, 3.78-5.49%) worldwide. The lowest prevalence was the Asian study group with 2.36% (95% CI, 1.86-2.87%) and the highest prevalence was the European study group with 10.93% (95% CI, 6.62-15.24%). About 43.26% (95% CI, 34.71-51.80%) of COVID-19 patients with cancer as comorbid experienced severe events of COVID-19. In total, 58.13% (95% CI, 42.79-73.48%) of COVID-19 patients with cancer as a comorbid who in the last month had a history of anticancer therapy experienced severe events. The prevalence of lung cancer in cancer patients with COVID-19 was 20.23% (95% CI, 7.67-32.78%). Forest plots are also presented related to the results of meta-analysis research. Conclusions: High prevalence of cancer as a comorbid among COVID-19 patients indicates the susceptibility of cancer patients to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Cancer as a comorbid in COVID-19 patients and use of anticancer therapy increase severe events of COVID-19.

                Background: Uncaria gambir is one Uncaria species that exclusively grows in Indonesia. The phytochemical constituents of this species have been widely explored and its extracts are used as traditional medicine. However, the relationship between Uncaria gambir and other Uncaria species is still unknown. DNA barcoding was used in this study to reveal this relationship. Methods: Genomic DNA was isolated from four main cultivated variants of Uncaria gambir species in Indonesia. ITS primer was used to amplify the specific gene region. Genetic distance analysis was carried out on Uncaria gambir and 12 other Uncaria species. A phylogenetic tree was created to determine the relationship among Uncaria species using the maximum likelihood method. Results: The ITS primer successfully amplified the ITS region in Uncaria gambir. Genetic distance and phylogenetic tree analyses showed that Uncaria gambir has a close relationship with Uncaria scandens, Uncaria yunnanensis, and Uncaria macrophylla which is also indicated by Interspecific distance analysis. Conclusions: Although the DNA barcoding gap is absent in genetic distance analysis, the phylogenetic tree analysis from the ITS region can differentiate Uncaria gambir from other Uncaria species.

                Background: The objective of this systematic review was to compare the accuracy of radiographic and protrusive occlusal record (POR) methods in determining horizontal condylar guidance (HCG) angles in dentate and edentulous patients. Methods: Studies assessing condylar guiding angles in dentulous/partially edentulous and totally edentulous patients free of temporomandibular disorders using both radiographic and protrusive occlusal record methods were included. A comprehensive search with PubMed/MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Web of Science, Google Scholar and Open Grey databases was done. Two reviewers extracted the data after eligibility assessment. Study quality was examined using the NIH quality assessment tool and graded based on tooth selection, number of root canals assessed, study environment, number of observers, test reliability report, validation approach, validation criteria, and validity reliability. A meta-analysis of pooled data, subgroups and sensitivity analysis was performed using RevMan (P<0.05). Results: The qualitative synthesis contained 33 papers, 32 of which were included in the meta-analysis. The standardised mean difference between the radiographic and protrusive occlusal record methods for right and left HCG angle in dentate patients was 0.68 [0.37, 0.98] and 0.63 [0.32, 0.95], respectively, and for right and left HCG angle in edentulous patients was 0.80 [0.36, 1.24] and 0.66 [0.18, 1.15], indicating a statistically significant difference (p<0.05). Conclusions: Clinical variability among the selected studies could not be completely avoided and the sample sizes were limited, resulting in a lack of statistical power. To rule out potential causes of heterogeneity, subgroup and sensitivity analyses were done separately for dentate and edentulous individuals for the right and left HCG angle. The present systematic review and meta-analysis concluded that for the dentate and edentulous patients, the right and left HCG angle values determined by radiographic method showed statistically significant difference as compared to the protrusive occlusal records.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A population of in silico models identifies the interplay between Nav 1.8 conductance and potassium currents as key in regulating human dorsal root ganglion neuron excitability [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The Nav 1.8 sodium channel has a key role in generating repetitive action potentials in nociceptive human dorsal root ganglion neurons. Nav 1.8 is differentiated from other voltage-gated sodium channels by its unusually slow inactivation kinetics and depolarised voltage-dependence of activation. These features are particularly pronounced in the human Nav 1.8 channel and allow the channel to remain active during repolarisation. Gain-of-function mutations in Nav 1.8 have been linked to neuropathic pain and selective blockers of Nav 1.8 have been developed as potential new analgesics. However, it is not well understood how modulating the Nav 1.8 conductance alters neuronal excitability and how this depends on the balance of other ion channels expressed by nociceptive neurons. Methods: To investigate this, we developed a novel computational model of the human dorsal root ganglion neuron and used it to construct a population of models that mimicked inter-neuronal heterogeneity in ionic conductances and action potential morphology Results: By simulating changes to the Nav 1.8 conductance in the population of models, we found that moderately increasing the Nav 1.8 conductance led to increased firing rate, as expected, but increasing Nav 1.8 conductance beyond an inflection point caused firing rate to decrease. We found that the delayed rectifier and M-type potassium conductances were also critical for determining neuronal excitability. In particular, altering the delayed rectifier potassium conductance shifted the position of the Nav 1.8 inflection point and therefore the relationship between Nav 1.8 conductance and firing rate. Conclusions: Our results suggest that the effects of modulating Nav 1.8 in a nociceptive neuron can depend significantly on other conductances, particularly potassium conductances.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: Large bone defect reconstruction in lower extremities with ipsilateral transposition fibular graft with combined inlay and onlay technique using plate and screw fixation (fibula pro tibia technique) [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer revi</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Management of large bone defect is a challenging problem. Hahns, in 1884, introduced the first use of fibula pro tibia to bridge a large defect of the tibia due to chronic osteomyelitis. In this case, we did a transposition of the ipsilateral fibular with inlay and onlay technique using a locking plate and screw into the defect of the tibia. Case presentation: A 20-year-old male came to our emergency department at RSUD Dr. Saiful Anwar, Malang, Indonesia with an open fracture grade III B of his left lower leg. We found a large defect of the tibia approximately 7.5 cm after regular wound care for ten months. Then, we performed ipsilateral transposition fibular graft with combined inlay and onlay technique using a locking plate and screw fixation. No infections occurred and there was progressive callus formation with extending ossification along the periosteal tissue in the four-month postoperative evaluation. There was no leg length discrepancy, and the union sign showed that the patient could achieve full range of movement (ROM) and walk with crutches without pain with a Lower Extremity Functional Scale (LEFS) score of 62. Discussion: Contralateral fibula graft carries a high risk of endangering the unaffected limb. The ipsilateral fibula can be utilized to replace the missing segment with minimal morbidity. The purpose of combining ipsilateral fibular transport with the inlay and onlay technique is to minimalize the gap defect between fracture fragments, therefore enhancing the union rate of the bone. Conclusion: The fibula pro tibia technique can be used as an alternative treatment option for large gap bone defects in lower extremities with minimal complication.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">COVID-19, Cation Dysmetabolism, Sialic Acid, CD147, ACE2, Viroporins, Hepcidin and Ferroptosis: A Possible Unifying Hypothesis [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: iron and calcium dysmetabolism, with hyperferritinemia, hypoferremia, hypocalcemia and anemia have been documented in the majority of COVID-19 patients at later/worse stages. Furthermore, complementary to ACE2, both sialic acid (SA) molecules and CD147 proved relevant host receptors for SARS-CoV-2 entry, which explains the viral attack to multiple types of cells, including erythrocytes, endothelium and neural tissue. Several authors advocated that cell ferroptosis may be the core and final cell degenerative mechanism. Methods: a literature research was performed in several scientific search engines, such as PubMed Central, Cochrane Library, Chemical Abstract Service. More than 500 articles were retrieved until mid-December 2021, to highlight the available evidence about the investigated issues. Results: based on COVID-19 literature data, we have highlighted a few pathophysiological mechanisms, associated with virus-based cation dysmetabolism, multi-organ attack, mitochondria degeneration and ferroptosis. Our suggested elucidated pathological sequence is: a) spike protein subunit S1 docking with sialylated membrane glycoproteins/receptors (ACE2, CD147), and S2 subunit fusion with the lipid layer; b) cell membrane morpho-functional changes due to the consequent electro-chemical variations and viroporin action, which induce an altered ion channel function and intracellular cation accumulation; c) additional intracellular iron concentration due to a deregulated hepcidin-ferroportin axis, with higher hepcidin levels. Viral invasion may also affect erythrocytes/erythroid precursors, endothelial cells and macrophages, through SA and CD147 receptors, with relative hemoglobin and iron/calcium dysmetabolism. AB0 blood group, hemochromatosis, or environmental elements may represent possible factors which affect individual susceptibility to COVID-19.     Conclusions: our literature analysis confirms the combined role of SA molecules, ACE2, CD147, viroporins and hepcidin in determining the cation dysmetabolism and final ferroptosis in the cells infected by SARS-CoV-2. The altered ion channels and electrochemical gradients of the cell membrane have a pivotal role in the virus entry and cell dysmetabolism, with subsequent multi-organ immune-inflammatory degeneration and erythrocyte/hemoglobin alterations.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>A growing body of research details spatial representation in bat hippocampus, and experiments have yet to explore hippocampal neuron responses to sonar signals in animals that rely on echolocation for spatial navigation. To bridge this gap, we investigated bat hippocampal responses to natural echolocation sounds in a non-spatial context. In this experiment, we recorded from CA1 of the hippocampus of three awake bats that listened passively to single echolocation calls, call-echo pairs, or natural echolocation sequences. Our data analysis identified a subset of neurons showing response selectivity to the duration of single echolocation calls. However, the sampled population of CA1 neurons did not respond selectively to call-echo delay, a stimulus dimension posited to simulate target distance in recordings from auditory brain regions of bats. A population analysis revealed ensemble coding of call duration and sequence identity. These findings open the door to many new investigations of auditory coding in the mammalian hippocampus.</p>
