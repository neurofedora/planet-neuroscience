              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Children Develop Adult-Like Visual Sensitivity to Image Memorability by the Age of Four</a></h4>

              
                Adults have been shown to consistently remember and forget certain images despite large individual differences, suggesting a population-wide sensitivity to an image's intrinsic memorability--a measure of how successfully an image is remembered. While a decade of research has focused on image memorability among adults, the developmental trajectory of these consistencies in memory is understudied. Here, we investigate by what age children gain adult-like sensitivity to the image memorability effect. We utilized data from Saragosa-Harris et al. (2021), where 137 children aged between 3 and 5 years old encoded animal-scene image pairs and then after a 5-minute, 24-hour, or 1-week delay performed a cued recognition task for each scene target given its animal cue. We tested adults' memory of the same scene images using ResMem (Needell & Bainbridge, 2022), a pre-trained deep neural network that predicts adult image memorability scores, and using an online behavioral continuous recognition task (N = 116). Results showed that ResMem predictions, as a proxy of adults' memory, predicted scene memory of children by the age of 4 and were the most predictive of children's memory across ages after a long, 1-week delay. Children at age 3 show non-adult-like consistent memory patterns, implying that the non-adult-like memory patterns were not due to poor memory performance. Instead, 3-year-olds may have consistently used certain visual memory strategies that become less optimal as they age. Our results suggest that adult-like sensitivity to image memorability emerges by the age of 4 through experience.

	<p>Prior evidence suggests domain-specific working memory (WM) buffers for maintaining phonological (i.e., speech sound) and semantic (i.e., meaning) information. The phonological WM buffer&amp;amp;rsquo;s proposed location is in the left supramarginal gyrus (SMG), whereas semantic WM has been related to the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), the middle frontal gyrus (MFG), and the angular gyrus (AG). However, less is known about the white matter correlates of phonological and semantic WM. We tested 45 individuals with left hemisphere brain damage on single word processing, phonological WM, and semantic WM tasks and obtained T1 and diffusion weighted neuroimaging. Virtual dissections were performed for each participants&amp;amp;rsquo; arcuate fasciculus (AF), inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF), inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF), middle longitudinal fasciculus (MLF), and uncinate fasciculus (UF), which connect the proposed domain-specific WM buffers with perceptual or processing regions. The results showed that the left ILF, MLF, IFOF, and the direct segment of the AF were related to semantic WM performance. Phonological WM was related to both the left ILF and the MLF. This work informs our understanding of the white matter correlates of WM, especially semantic WM, which has not previously been investigated. In addition, this work helps to adjudicate between theories of verbal WM, providing some evidence for separate pathways supporting phonological and semantic WM.</p>

	<p>Early detection of autism provides access to early intervention and subsequently fewer lifelong challenges. However, disparities in screening have been associated with socioeconomic status (SES) and race, and disparities in surveillance have been associated with clinician knowledge and beliefs about autism identification. The present study examines associations between demographic variables and clinician beliefs, and agreement between screening results and clinician surveillance. Surveillance included activities used by the primary care clinicians (PCCs) to assess risk for autism. PCCs reported their beliefs about autism screening and identification, their sex, race, years in practice, and racial distribution of their patient population. Children&amp;amp;rsquo;s demographic information was also collected. PCCs identified children as having, or not having, an increased likelihood of autism, and parents of children completed an autism screener. Agreement between screening and surveillance results were examined across PCC, practice, and child demographics. Higher confidence in autism knowledge and screening resources, female PCC sex, and majority White practice patient demographics all predicted agreement between screening and surveillance. Female child sex and higher maternal education also predicted agreement between screening and surveillance. These findings highlight the importance of PCC screening beliefs and child and PCC demographics on the autism identification process.</p>

	<p>It is hypothesized that factors associated with bipolar disorder could, uer defined conditions, produce adaptive behaviors. The aim is to verify whether a genetic feature associated with bipolar disorder can be found in people without bipolar disorder but with hyperactivity/exploration traits. Healthy old adults (N = 40) recruited for a previous study on exercise were subdivided using a previously validated tool into those with and without hyperactivity/exploration traits and compared with a group of old patients with bipolar disorder (N = 21). The genetic variant RS1006737 of CACNA1C was analyzed using blood samples, DNA extraction, real-time PCR, FRET probes, and SANGER method sequencing. People with hyperactivity/exploration traits and without bipolar disorder were like people with bipolar disorder regarding the frequency of the genetic variant (OR = 0.79, CI95%: 0.21&amp;amp;ndash;2.95), but were different from people without either hyperactivity/exploration traits and bipolar disorder (OR = 4.75, CI95%: 1.19&amp;amp;ndash;18.91). The combined group of people with hyperactivity/exploration traits without bipolar disorder plus people with bipolar disorder had a higher frequency of the variant than people without either hyperactivity/exploration traits or bipolar disorder (OR = 4.25, CI95%: 1.24&amp;amp;ndash;14.4). To consider the genetic profile of bipolar disorder not an aberrant condition opens the way to a new approach in which the adaptive potential would be a central point in psychosocial treatment in addition to drug therapy. Future research can confirm the results of our study.</p>

	<p>A nine-year-old boy manifested with headache, progressive mild cognitive decline and hemiparesis, but without clinical epileptic seizures (with abnormal EEG waves). Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed bilateral cortical lesions mainly on the right hemisphere, and new lesions developed in frontal, parietal, occipital and temporal lobes around the old lesions presenting as a lace-like or ring-like enhancement in T1 with contrast over a disease course of five years. A suspected diagnosis of primary angiitis of the central nervous system was initially considered. Treated with high-dose corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulins and monthly pulse cyclophosphamide, his symptoms worsened with the intracranial lesion progression. Brain biopsy of the right frontal lobe was performed nearly five years after onset; prominent neuronal loss, a microglial nodule, as well as parenchymal and perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate within the cortex were found, which coincided with RE pathology changes. Encouragingly, after a regimen of rituximab, lesions on the follow-up brain MRI tended to be stable. Apparently, it was immune-mediated, but did not strictly fit any known disease entity, although it was similar to RE. We summarize this unique case, including clinical characteristics, imaging and pathology findings. We also discuss the diagnosis and treatment, focusing on comparison to RE as well as other possible neurological diseases.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">How Characters Are Learned Leaves Its Mark on the Neural Substrates of Chinese Reading</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Understanding how the brain functions differently as one learns to read may shed light on the controversial nature of the reading ability of human being. Logographic writing system such as Chinese has been found to rely on specialized neural substrates beyond the reading network of alphabetic languages. The ability to read in Chinese has also been proposed to rely on writing skills. However, it was unclear whether the learning-related alteration of neural responses was language specific or resulted from the more reliance on writing practice during acquisition. This study investigated whether the emergence of typical logographic-specific regions relied on learning by writing. We taught proficient alphabetic language readers Chinese characters and used pre-test and post-test to identify changes in two critical stages of reading, namely, orthographic processing and orthographic-to-phonological mapping. Two typical left hemispheric areas for logographic reading showed increased responses to characters in the brains of proficient alphabetic readers after learning, regardless of whether the learning strategy involved writing practice. Moreover, learning strategy modulated the response magnitude or multivoxel patterns in the left superior parietal lobule, left middle frontal gyrus, and right fusiform gyrus, some of which were task dependent. The findings corroborated a limited role of writing in the emergence of logographic-specific reading network and suggested the heterogeneous nature of different brain regions in this network.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Head Orientation Influences Saccade Directions during Free Viewing</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>When looking around a visual scene, humans make saccadic eye movements to fixate objects of interest. While the extraocular muscles can execute saccades in any direction, not all saccade directions are equally likely: saccades in horizontal and vertical directions are most prevalent. Here, we asked whether head orientation plays a role in determining saccade direction biases. Study participants (<I>n</I> = 14) viewed natural scenes and abstract fractals (radially symmetric patterns) through a virtual reality headset equipped with eye tracking. Participants&rsquo; heads were stabilized and tilted at &ndash;30&deg;, 0&deg;, or 30&deg; while viewing the images, which could also be tilted by &ndash;30&deg;, 0&deg;, and 30&deg; relative to the head. To determine whether the biases in saccade direction changed with head tilt, we calculated polar histograms of saccade directions and cross-correlated pairs of histograms to find the angular displacement resulting in the maximum correlation. During free viewing of fractals, saccade biases largely followed the orientation of the head with an average displacement value of 24&deg; when comparing head upright to head tilt in world-referenced coordinates (<I>t</I><SUB>(13)</SUB> = 17.63, <I>p</I> &lt; 0.001). There was a systematic offset of 2.6&deg; in saccade directions, likely reflecting ocular counter roll (OCR; <I>t</I><SUB>(13)</SUB> = 3.13, <I>p</I> = 0.008). When participants viewed an Earth upright natural scene during head tilt, we found that the orientation of the head still influenced saccade directions (<I>t</I><SUB>(13)</SUB> = 3.7, <I>p</I> = 0.001). These results suggest that nonvisual information about head orientation, such as that acquired by vestibular sensors, likely plays a role in saccade generation.</p>

                Background: Uganda has made progress in reducing its HIV prevalence from 7.3% in 2011 to 6% in 2017, however, more needs to be done to meet the World Health Organization (WHO) target of 95% of the population knowing their HIV status, 95% enrolled on treatment and 95% achieving viral suppression. This study aimed to assess the bottlenecks and opportunities towards achieving the 95 95 95 targeted HIV services in the Bukedea district.  Methods: A mixed-methods cross-sectional study was conducted in the Bukedea district covering males and females aged 18-65 years who had consented to participate in the study. We used a purposive sampling procedure to select our study participants. Qualitative data was collected through focus group discussions, key informant interviews, and document reviews for quantitative data. Quantitative data were analyzed using STATA v 14 whereas qualitative data were analyzed using the thematic analysis approach.   Results: The challenges were grouped as patient-related, medication-related, and facility-related. The patient-related challenges were stigma, fear of taking the medication, poor nutrition, long distances, alcoholism, busy working schedules, and domestic violence. The medication-related challenges were side effects and pill burden. The facility-related challenges were inadequate pretest counseling and stock-outs. The use of anti-retroviral drugs (ART) was common in piggery and poultry and the sources of these drugs were reported to be the people on ART and the health workers.   The opportunities included home-based counseling, organizing more outreaches, counseling and health education, targeted testing, and strengthening the Village Health Teams (VHT) networks.  Conclusions: The study revealed that the major challenges towards achieving the targeted 95-95-95 HIV services were stigma, inadequate pre-test counseling, fear of disclosure, and poor adherence due to alcoholism, sharing of drugs with animals and partners. The use of anti-retroviral drugs in animal husbandry was common in the Bukedea District.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The effects of antiretroviral stockout on primary health care nurses in the Ethekwini and Ilembe districts, KwaZulu-Natal [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Nurses face challenges of antiretroviral therapy (ART) stock out when rolling out, leading to drug resistance, poor compliance and decreased viral suppression. Poor viral suppression leads to higher morbidity and mortality rates, hence a need to strengthen supply chain principles in order to achieve equal distribution of resources amongst clinics.  Nurses also need to have relevant guidelines available to prevent treatment failure. The study aimed to describe the effects of ART stockouts on primary health nurses rolling out ART in clinics in KwaZulu Natal. Methods: The study followed a qualitative approach, using a descriptive design. Two primary healthcare clinics in Ilembe and Ethekwini districts were selected for the study. The population comprised of 8 purposively selected participants. In-depth interviews and focus groups were conducted to describe the experiences of primary health care nurses rolling out antiretroviral therapy regarding stockout and how it was managed. Data collection and analysis followed Yates, Partridge and Bruce steps. Ethics and trustworthiness were maintained. Results: The singular theme of inconsistent availability of treatment emerged, as well as sub-themes of means used to manage treatment stockout and supply change management issues. Conclusions: An adequate supply of ART through an efficient supply chain management strategy, ongoing training in primary health care and nurse-initiated management of antiretroviral therapy and the availability of treatment guidelines should be enforced.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Barriers to compliance with evidence-based guidelines for ventilator-associated pneumonia among critical care nurses: A scoping review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Healthcare organizations provide evidence-based guidelines designed to support nurses in preventing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) in intensive care units (ICUs), but there are barriers to compliance with such guidelines. This review explicitly explored evidence of compliance barriers among critical care nurses. Methods: A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and EBSCO databases for relevant English-language studies published between January 2003 and June 2022, focused on barriers to nursing compliance with VAP prevention guidelines. Data was reported according to the Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMAScR) guidelines.  Results: 230 publications were screened, resulting in 53 full-text articles being retrieved after removing duplicates, of which 13 relevant to the aims of the review and meeting the inclusion criteria were included for data extraction. One was a qualitative study, while the remainder were quantitative. Simple descriptive content analysis identified the barriers to critical care nurses’ compliance with VAP prevention guidelines, and categorized them as: (1) work environment barriers (e.g., lack of equipment and supplies; lack of staff and time; lack of educational support; and ineffective supportive system); (2) nurse-related barriers (limited personal competencies); and (3) situation-related barriers (patient health, discomfort, and adverse events). Conclusions: This review revealed important evidence on barriers to VAP prevention guidelines compliance. Nurses are challenged mainly by work-environmental barriers along, with the presence of nurse and situational barriers. It is evident from the findings that further qualitative and mixed-methodology follow-up studies are recommended to further explore the issues in depth.  Healthcare leaders must be aware of these barriers and integrate work policies that assist in overcoming them, to increase compliance.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Anti-angiogenic effect of the combination of low-dose sorafenib and EGCG in HCC-induced Wistar rats [version 3; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background:  Sorafenib is a standard drug used for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma but is often resistant and toxic. Its combination with epigallo-3-catechin gallate leads to reduced resistance and toxicity but an equally effective anti-angiogenic effect.Therefore, this study aims to assess the anti-angiogenic effect of standard-dose Sorafenib compared to the combination of low-dose Sorafenib and epigallo-3-catechin gallate. Methods:  We conducted an animal study and double-blind, randomized controlled trials. A total of 25 male Wistar rats (7 weeks old) were randomly divided into four groups, namely Sham (K), Control (O), a combination of low-dose Sorafenib and epigallo-3-catechin gallate group (X1), and standard-dose Sorafenib group (X2). All groups were injected with N-Nitrosodiethylamine 70 mg/kg body weight (BW) intraperitoneally for ten weeks, except the Sham group. After the development of hepatocellular carcinoma, X1 and X2 were treated for two weeks. Subsequently, liver tissues and tumor masses were examined for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) level and microvascular density expression. Results: There was a significant difference (p=0.007) in the level of VEGF between group X1 (low dose Sorafenib + EGCG) and X2 (Standard dose Sorafenib). However, the differences in VEGF levels of group X1 and X2 compared to group O(Control) were significantly lower, with values p=0.000136 and p=0.019, respectively. The expression of microvascular density between groups X1 and X2  was not entirely different. Meanwhile, a significant difference (p<0.05) was discovered when both groups were compared with the control group. Conclusion: The combination of low-dose Sorafenib with epigallo-3-catechin gallate is superior in reducing the level of VEGF compared to standard-dose Sorafenib and is better than the control. Standard-dose Sorafenib and the combination of low-dose Sorafenib and epigallo-3-catechin gallate have similar effectivity in reducing the expression of microvascular density and could prevent resistance and lower toxicity effects.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Predictive factors for hypothyroidy after hemithyroidectomy [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Hemithyroidectomy is one of the most common procedures performed. It is used to treat patients with benign unilateral nodules. Hemithyroidectomy results in fewer risks of hypothyroidism and the need for thyroid hormone replacement therapy. The present study was designed to identify potential clinicopathologic risk factors associated with the onset of biochemical hypothyroidism. Methods: We conducted a retrospective review of all patients who underwent hemithyroidectomy between 2004 and 2019. Hypothyroidism was defined as a serum thyrotropin level greater than 5 mIU/L. The patients were analyzed for age, sex, preoperative and postoperative thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), state, side, and volume of the remaining lobe, and histologic diagnosis. Results: Hypothyroidism was diagnosed in 30.8% of 214 patients. This complication appeared in the first year in 83.3% of the cases. A preoperative TSH level greater than 1.32 mIU/l, a remaining volume of the lobe less than 3 ml, and the presence of thyroiditis were associated with a significant increase in the risk of developing hypothyroidism (p<0.01). There were no significant differences in age, sex, state, and side of the remaining lobe. The mean thyroxine dose was 57 ± 26 micrograms. Conclusions: The risk of hypothyroidism after hemithyroidectomy should be assessed prior to surgery. Close monitoring is recommended in patients at high risk of developing this complication. However, all patients who undergo hemithyroidectomy should be monitored at least for the first year.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Effectiveness of Gatekeeper Training Program (GTP) on awareness, attitude, mental help seeking intention and gatekeeper behavior among Koraga tribe: A study protocol [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Aim: This study aims to build the capacity of the people at grass root level as gatekeepers of mental health. It will assess the effectiveness of the Gatekeeper Training Program (GTP) on gatekeeper behaviour, awareness, attitude, and mental help seeking intention. Design: An evaluative research approach in two phases. Phase 1: Cross-sectional house-to-house exploratory survey. Phase 2: A quasi-experimental design with multiple follow ups at 0, 6 and 12 months. Method: Data will be collected using standardized tools like Mental Health Knowledge Questionnaire (MHKQ), Community Attitude towards Mentally Ill (CAMIS), Mental Help Seeking Intention (MHSIS) and Gatekeeper Behavior Scale (GBS). For Phase 1, a house-to-house survey will be conducted among the selected colonies of Koraga tribe to determine their awareness, attitude, and mental help seeking intention regarding common mental health problems. Phase 2 includes identification of the leaders/representatives of the selected tribal colonies, and involving them in GTP. Pre-test and multiple post-test will be conducted in Phase 2 at 0, 6, 12 months.  The study is funded by Indian Council of Medical Research from 16 August 2021 for 3 years duration. Discussion: Treatment gap in psychiatric disorders remains an issue of great concern. Evidence based research promotes task shifting approaches in dealing with mental health problems in the community. Capacity building programs like GTP for the underprivileged section of the society are important especially in low and middle income group of countries. Impact: This need based GTP, will ensure mental health first aid in the society. Early identification of people with mental health problems at their doorsteps has huge impact on the prognosis of the illness, closing the treatment gap and stigma reduction.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Sample size variation in single-time post-dose assessment vs multi-time post-dose assessment [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Many randomized trials measure a continuous outcome simultaneously at baseline and after taking the drug. For a single continuous post-treatment outcome, the sample size calculation is simple, but if there are assessments at multiple time points post-treatment then this longitudinal data may give more insights by analyzing the data using the repeated measures method. Also, if the sample size is calculated using the single time-point method for longitudinal data, it may lead to a larger than required sample size, increasing the cost and time. Methods: In this research, an effort is made to determine the size of the sample for repeated measures case and then compared with the single post-baseline case. The sample sizes were examined under different scenarios for the continuous type of response variable. Under Mean contrast and Diff contrast the sample sizes were calculated with different correlations. These two scenarios were again examined under compound symmetry as well as Auto regressive of order 1 type of correlation structure in longitudinal data. The graphical presentation is given for better visualization of the scenarios. Results: Sample size required for highly correlated longitudinal data using multi timepoint sample size derivation method led to much smaller sample size requirement as compared to single timepoint sample size calculation method. Conclusions: This study will help researchers to make better decisions in choosing the right method for sample size determination which may reduce the time and cost of carrying out the experiment. Also, we must carefully assess which method to go with when the correlation is weak. More complex correlation structures are not studied in this article but can be studied in the same fashion.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">AFHIRIS: African Human Iris Dataset (Version 1) [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Biometric systems remain the most widely used methods for identification and authentication purposes. Their wide acceptability has opened up more research into new application areas of biometric systems. However, biometric research requires an appropriate biometric dataset to validate the proposed technique. This dataset could be privately owned or publicly available for research purposes. In the field of iris biometric research, the iris dataset produced by the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CASIA) is the first, most popular, and widely used publicly available iris dataset. However, the increasing popularity and acceptability of human iris-related research have called for additional benchmarks, and therefore, new publicly available databases of human iris images. Existing publicly available human iris datasets have been collected from non-African subjects; therefore, this dataset is the first publicly available human iris dataset of African descent. Three categories of images were collected from 1028 volunteers that participated in the data collection task. The first category was made up of four iris images that were captured when the volunteers used spectacles, while the second category includes four iris images that were captured when the volunteers wore no spectacles. However, the third category of iris images was obtained from eight volunteers that used print-patterned contact lenses. Only four images were captured from volunteers in this category as they were not asked to put on spectacles. In addition to the iris images captured, soft biometric features such as age, gender, state of origin, weight, and height of the volunteers were also captured. It is strongly believed that this unique collection of iris datasets of African descent will open up new research in the study of the human iris.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>MiRNA-124 has been considered to play a significant role in the formation of memory and a variety of neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, the aim is to verify whether miRNA-124 is involved in memory impairment induced by <span class="smallCaps">d</span>-galactose, and explore the underlying neuroprotective mechanism. The results revealed that rapid administration of <span class="smallCaps">d</span>-galactose (1000 mg/kg subcutaneously) in mice caused memory impairments, as determined by Novel Object Recognition test, Morris Water Maze test, and histological assessments. MiRNA-124 agomir is stereotactic injected into hippocampus, thus alleviated memory impairment induced by <span class="smallCaps">d</span>-galactose and reversed the neural damage and neuroinflammation. Furthermore, the results of molecular biological analysis and immunohistochemistry revealed that miRNA-124 markedly reduced neuroinflammation induced by <span class="smallCaps">d</span>-galactose through polarization of microglia as determined by detection of ionized calcium binding adapter molecule 1 (Iba-1), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and arginase-1(Arg-1), which also downregulated inflammatory mediators, including interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and upregulated IL-4 and IL-10. Hence, taken together, the results of the present study suggested that miRNA-124 showed a significant negative correlation with memory impairment and neuroinflammation induced by <span class="smallCaps">d</span>-galactose rapidly, possibly via polarization of microglia from M1 to M2. It is possible that miRNA-124 can be used as a new target for the pathogenesis of memory impairment, including age-associated neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>RGS14 is a multifunctional scaffolding protein that is highly expressed within postsynaptic spines of pyramidal neurons in hippocampal area CA2. Known roles of RGS14 in CA2 include regulating G protein, H-Ras/ERK, and calcium signaling pathways to serve as a natural suppressor of synaptic plasticity and postsynaptic signaling. RGS14 also shows marked postsynaptic expression in major structures of the limbic system and basal ganglia, including the amygdala and both the ventral and dorsal subdivisions of the striatum. In this review, we discuss the signaling functions of RGS14 and its role in postsynaptic strength (long-term potentiation) and spine structural plasticity in CA2 hippocampal neurons, and how RGS14 suppression of plasticity impacts linked behaviors such as spatial learning, object memory, and fear conditioning. We also review RGS14 expression in the limbic system and basal ganglia and speculate on its possible roles in regulating plasticity in these regions, with a focus on behaviors related to emotion and motivation. Finally, we explore the functional implications of RGS14 in various brain circuits and speculate on its possible roles in certain disease states such as hippocampal seizures, addiction, and anxiety disorders.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Allosteric regulation in STAT3 interdomains is mediated by a rigid core: SH2 domain regulation by CCD in D170A variant</a></h4>

Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT3) plays a crucial role in cancer development and thus is a viable target for cancer treatment. STAT3 functions as a dimer mediated by phosphorylation of the SRC-homology 2 (SH2) domain, a key target for therapeutic drugs. While great efforts have been employed towards the development of compounds that directly target the SH2 domain, no compound has yet been approved by the FDA due to a lack of specificity and pharmacologic efficacy. Studies have shown that allosteric regulation of SH2 via the coiled-coil domain (CCD) is an alternative drug design strategy. Several CCD effectors have been shown to modulate SH2 binding and affinity, and at the time of writing at least one drug candidate has entered phase I clinical trials. However, the mechanism for SH2 regulation via CCD is poorly understood. Here, we investigate structural and dynamic features of STAT3 and compare the wild type to the reduced function variant D170A in order to delineate mechanistic differences and propose allosteric pathways. Molecular dynamics simulations were employed to explore conformational space of STAT3 and the variant, followed by structural, conformation, and dynamic analysis. The trajectories explored show distinctive conformational changes in the SH2 domain for the D170A variant, indicating long range allosteric effects. Multiple analyses provide evidence for long range communication pathways between the two STAT3 domains, which seem to be mediated by a rigid core which connects the CCD and SH2 domains via the linker domain (LD) and transmits conformational changes through a network of short-range interactions. The proposed allosteric mechanism provides new insight into the understanding of intramolecular signaling in STAT3 and potential pharmaceutical control of STAT3 specificity and activity.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Exploring a diverse world of effector domains and amyloid signaling motifs in fungal NLR proteins</a></h4>

NLR proteins are intracellular receptors constituting a conserved component of the innate immune system of cellular organisms. In fungi, NLRs are characterized by high diversity of architectures and presence of amyloid signaling. Here, we explore the diverse world of effector and signaling domains of fungal NLRs using state-of-the-art bioinformatic methods including MMseqs2 for fast clustering, probabilistic context-free grammars for sequence analysis, and AlphaFold2 deep neural networks for structure prediction. In addition to substantially improving the overall annotation, especially in basidiomycetes, the study identifies novel domains and reveals the structural similarity of MLKL-related HeLo- and Goodbye-like domains forming the most abundant superfamily of fungal NLR effectors. Moreover, compared to previous studies, we found several times more amyloid motif instances, including novel families, and validated aggregating and prion-forming properties of the most abundant of them <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. Also, through an extensive <i>in silico</i> search, the NLR-associated amyloid signaling was identified in basidiomycetes. The emerging picture highlights similarities and differences in the NLR architectures and amyloid signaling in ascomycetes, basidiomycetes and other branches of life.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A method to estimate the cellular composition of the mouse brain from heterogeneous datasets</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Dimitri Rodarie, Csaba Verasztó, Yann Roussel, Michael Reimann, Daniel Keller, Srikanth Ramaswamy, Henry Markram, Marc-Oliver Gewaltig</p>

The mouse brain contains a rich diversity of inhibitory neuron types that have been characterized by their patterns of gene expression. However, it is still unclear how these cell types are distributed across the mouse brain. We developed a computational method to estimate the densities of different inhibitory neuron types across the mouse brain. Our method allows the unbiased integration of diverse and disparate datasets into one framework to predict inhibitory neuron densities for uncharted brain regions. We constrained our estimates based on previously computed brain-wide neuron densities, gene expression data from <i>in situ</i> hybridization image stacks together with a wide range of values reported in the literature. Using constrained optimization, we derived coherent estimates of cell densities for the different inhibitory neuron types. We estimate that 20.3% of all neurons in the mouse brain are inhibitory. Among all inhibitory neurons, 18% predominantly express parvalbumin (PV), 16% express somatostatin (SST), 3% express vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), and the remainder 63% belong to the residual GABAergic population. We find that our density estimations improve as more literature values are integrated. Our pipeline is extensible, allowing new cell types or data to be integrated as they become available. The data, algorithms, software, and results of our pipeline are publicly available and update the Blue Brain Cell Atlas. This work therefore leverages the research community to collectively converge on the numbers of each cell type in each brain region.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Differences in the functional brain architecture of sustained attention and working memory in youth and adults</a></h4>

Sustained attention (SA) and working memory (WM) are critical processes, but the brain networks supporting these abilities in development are unknown. We characterized the functional brain architecture of SA and WM in 9- to 11-year-old children and adults. First, we found that adult network predictors of SA generalized to predict individual differences and fluctuations in SA in youth. A WM model predicted WM performance both across and within children—and captured individual differences in later recognition memory—but underperformed in youth relative to adults. We next characterized functional connections differentially related to SA and WM in youth compared to adults. Results revealed 2 network configurations: a dominant architecture predicting performance in both age groups and a secondary architecture, more prominent for WM than SA, predicting performance in each age group differently. Thus, functional connectivity (FC) predicts SA and WM in youth, with networks predicting WM performance differing more between youths and adults than those predicting SA.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Alternative splicing liberates a cryptic cytoplasmic isoform of mitochondrial MECR that antagonizes influenza virus</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Steven F. Baker, Helene Meistermann, Manuel Tzouros, Aaron Baker, Sabrina Golling, Juliane Siebourg Polster, Mitchell P. Ledwith, Anthony Gitter, Angelique Augustin, Hassan Javanbakht, Andrew Mehle</p>

Viruses must balance their reliance on host cell machinery for replication while avoiding host defense. Influenza A viruses are zoonotic agents that frequently switch hosts, causing localized outbreaks with the potential for larger pandemics. The host range of influenza virus is limited by the need for successful interactions between the virus and cellular partners. Here we used immunocompetitive capture-mass spectrometry to identify cellular proteins that interact with human- and avian-style viral polymerases. We focused on the proviral activity of heterogenous nuclear ribonuclear protein U-like 1 (hnRNP UL1) and the antiviral activity of mitochondrial enoyl CoA-reductase (MECR). MECR is localized to mitochondria where it functions in mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis (mtFAS). While a small fraction of the polymerase subunit PB2 localizes to the mitochondria, PB2 did not interact with full-length MECR. By contrast, a minor splice variant produces cytoplasmic MECR (cMECR). Ectopic expression of cMECR shows that it binds the viral polymerase and suppresses viral replication by blocking assembly of viral ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNPs). MECR ablation through genome editing or drug treatment is detrimental for cell health, creating a generic block to virus replication. Using the yeast homolog Etr1 to supply the metabolic functions of MECR in MECR-null cells, we showed that specific antiviral activity is independent of mtFAS and is reconstituted by expressing cMECR. Thus, we propose a strategy where alternative splicing produces a cryptic antiviral protein that is embedded within a key metabolic enzyme.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">ERR2 and ERR3 promote the development of gamma motor neuron functional properties required for proprioceptive movement control</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Mudassar N. Khan, Pitchaiah Cherukuri, Francesco Negro, Ashish Rajput, Piotr Fabrowski, Vikas Bansal, Camille Lancelin, Tsung-I Lee, Yehan Bian, William P. Mayer, Turgay Akay, Daniel Müller, Stefan Bonn, Dario Farina, Till Marquardt</p>

The ability of terrestrial vertebrates to effectively move on land is integrally linked to the diversification of motor neurons into types that generate muscle force (alpha motor neurons) and types that modulate muscle proprioception, a task that in mammals is chiefly mediated by gamma motor neurons. The diversification of motor neurons into alpha and gamma types and their respective contributions to movement control have been firmly established in the past 7 decades, while recent studies identified gene expression signatures linked to both motor neuron types. However, the mechanisms that promote the specification of gamma motor neurons and/or their unique properties remained unaddressed. Here, we found that upon selective loss of the orphan nuclear receptors ERR2 and ERR3 (also known as ERRβ, ERRγ or NR3B2, NR3B3, respectively) in motor neurons in mice, morphologically distinguishable gamma motor neurons are generated but do not acquire characteristic functional properties necessary for regulating muscle proprioception, thus disrupting gait and precision movements. Complementary gain-of-function experiments in chick suggest that ERR2 and ERR3 could operate via transcriptional activation of neural activity modulators to promote a gamma motor neuron biophysical signature of low firing thresholds and high firing rates. Our work identifies a mechanism specifying gamma motor neuron functional properties essential for the regulation of proprioceptive movement control.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Efficient coding theory of dynamic attentional modulation</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Wiktor Młynarski, Gašper Tkačik</p>

Activity of sensory neurons is driven not only by external stimuli but also by feedback signals from higher brain areas. Attention is one particularly important internal signal whose presumed role is to modulate sensory representations such that they only encode information currently relevant to the organism at minimal cost. This hypothesis has, however, not yet been expressed in a normative computational framework. Here, by building on normative principles of probabilistic inference and efficient coding, we developed a model of dynamic population coding in the visual cortex. By continuously adapting the sensory code to changing demands of the perceptual observer, an attention-like modulation emerges. This modulation can dramatically reduce the amount of neural activity without deteriorating the accuracy of task-specific inferences. Our results suggest that a range of seemingly disparate cortical phenomena such as intrinsic gain modulation, attention-related tuning modulation, and response variability could be manifestations of the same underlying principles, which combine efficient sensory coding with optimal probabilistic inference in dynamic environments.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Prevalence of mutations in Mendelian stroke genes in early‐onset stroke patients</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Heritability of stroke is assumed not to be low, especially in the young-age stroke population. However, most genetic studies have been performed in highly selected patients with typical clinical or neuroimaging characteristics. We investigated the prevalence of 15 Mendelian stroke genes and explored the relationships between variants and the clinical and neuroimaging characteristics in a large, unselected, young stroke population.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We enrolled patients aged ≤55 years with stroke or transient ischemic attack from a prospective, nationwide, multicenter stroke registry. We identified clinically relevant genetic variants (CRGV) in 15 Mendelian stroke genes (<i>GLA, NOTCH3, HTRA1, RNF213, ACVRL1, ENG, CBS, TREX1, ABCC6, COL4A1, FBN1, NF1, COL3A1, MT-TL1, and APP</i>) using a customized, targeted next-generation sequencing panel.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Among 1,033 patients, 131 (12.7%) had 28 CRGV, most frequently in <i>RNF213</i> (n=59), followed by <i>ABCC6</i> (n=53) and <i>NOTCH3</i> (n=15). The frequency of CRGV differed by ischemic stroke subtypes (<i>p</i>&lt;0.01)—highest in other determined etiology (20.1%), followed by large artery atherosclerosis (13.6%). It also differed between patients aged ≤35 years and those aged 51–55 years (17.1% vs. 9.3%, <i>p</i>=0.02). Only 27.1% and 26.7% of patients with <i>RNF213</i> and <i>NOTCH3</i> variants had typical neuroimaging features of the corresponding disorders, respectively. Variants of uncertain significance (VUS) were found in 15.4% patients.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>CRGV in 15 Mendelian stroke genes may not be uncommon in the young stroke population. The majority of patients with CRGV did not have typical features of the corresponding monogenic disorders. Clinical implications of having CRGV or VUS should be explored.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The Effect of Pyridostigmine as an Antidote for Botulinum Type A: An Experimental Study on Rabbits [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Botulinum toxin (BoNT) or Botox injections are popular non-surgical and non-invasive option to optimize and change an individual’s facial appearance and achieve rejuvenation. Pyridostigmine is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor important in clinical practice. This study evaluated the toxic effect of BoNT to demonstrate the efficacy of anticholinesterase inhibitor pyridostigmine. Methods: We conducted an experimental interventional study to evaluate the antidote effect of pyridostigmine against BoNT. Forty rabbits (skeletally mature males, body weight 1000–2000 g) were included in the study. The rabbits were injected with Clostridium botulinum type A neurotoxin complex (BoNT or Botox), which was reconstituted with 0.9% sterile sodium chloride to a concentration of 100 U/2.5 mL. Animals were divided randomly into four groups (10 in each) as follows: Group 1 (control group), group 2 (pyridostigmine-treated group), group 3 (BoNT only group), and group 4 (BoNT + pyridostigmine treated group). Results: In the control group, there was statistical difference between the rabbits’ weight (P=0.03). The left muscle was significantly heavier than the right (P=0.025). In the pyridostigmine only group, the rabbits’ weight had a high statistical difference during four weeks of the study (P=0.002). In the BoNT injection group, weight had high statistically significant difference four weeks of the study (P=0.033), which was more in first week (1.55±0.2 kg) and then subsequently decreased in the fourth week (1.345±0.13 kg). The mean weight of the rabbits’ right quadriceps muscle was 6.573±1.3 g, which was significantly lower than the mean weight of the rabbits’ left quadriceps muscle (8.09±1.2 g, P=0.0001). Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study conducted in Iraq to investigate the antidote effect of pyridostigmine against BoNT injections. Pyridostigmine and saline caused increased weight of rabbits in comparison to rabbits that received BoNT injections. Pyridostigmine can act as strong antidote against Botox toxicity.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A cross-sectional study on assessment of spiritual health and its associated factors among undergraduate students in a medical college in Mangalore, Karnataka [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Spirituality and spiritual health are an integral component of an individual’s health and wellbeing. Among medical undergraduates and professionals, spiritual health has positive effects on the individual by decreasing burnout, psychological distress, and rates of substance abuse. Spiritual health is also correlated with increased satisfaction and meaning in life. Spiritual health also influences future patient care, builds patient- provider communication channels, and improves patient outcomes. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted to assess the spiritual health levels of medical undergraduates in a medical college, in Karnataka, India, and to identify the factors associated with it. Using a pre-designed, validated semi-structed questionnaire, 600 medical undergraduates were approached and provided the forms. Spiritual health was assessed across the three domains of self-development, self-actualization, and self-realization using the Spiritual Health Assessment Scale (SHAS). Results: A total of 436 medical undergraduates participated. Majority (67.7%) of participants were girls. Most (62%) were found to have fair spiritual health with a large portion of the rest (36%) having good spiritual health and 2% had poor spiritual health. A significant association was found  between spiritual health and the father’s (p=0.005) and mother’s (p=0.012) education levels. Spiritual health was also found to be associated with living in a nuclear family (p=0.04). Conclusions: Majority of the medical undergraduates had fair spiritual health. Parents' education levels and nuclear family were significantly associated with spiritual health.

                Background: Aortic rupture and suture dehiscence can complicate a cardiac operation, especially in case of infections of the surgical site. Such a complication can be life-threatening and require immediate surgical treatment. Case: We report the case of a 13-year-old girl who suffered a sudden dehiscence of the aortic suture line in the context of deep sternal wound infection, while in the surgical intensive care unit after a double valve replacement. Control of bleeding was obtained by the insertion of an endotracheal tube into the ascending aorta and inflation of the tube cuff to plug the aortic bleeding point. The extracorporeal circulation was then established and under deep hypothermic arrest the defect was successfully repaired. The patient was discharged 14 days after surgery and reviewed at the outpatient clinic in good health. Conclusions: An endotracheal tube can be used in cases of uncontrollable aortic bleeding as a life-saving tool to bridge the patient to adequate surgical treatment.

     alt="The role of selective SATB1 deletion in somatostatin expressing interneurons on endogenous network activity and the transition to epilepsy"/>
<p>The dramatic reduction in the numbers of somatostatin interneurons due to the selective deletion of the transcription factor <i>SATB1</i> results in more frequent but shorter cortical Up states. Furthermore, the transition to seizure-like events is accelerated after Mg<sup>2+</sup> washout but is rather unaffected after wash-in of 4-Aminopyridine (4-AP).</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Somatostatin (SST) expressing interneurons are the second most abundant group of inhibitory neurons in the neocortex. They mainly target the apical dendrites of excitatory pyramidal cells and are implicated in feedforward and feedback inhibition. In the present study, we employ a conditional knockout mouse, in which the transcription factor <i>Satb1</i> is selectively deleted in SST-expressing interneurons resulting to the reduction of their number across the somatosensory barrel field. Our goal was to investigate the effect of the reduced number of <i>Satb1</i> mutant SST-interneurons on (i) the endogenous cortical network activity (spontaneously recurring Up/Down states), and (ii) the transition to epileptiform activity. By conducting LFP recordings in acute brain slices from young male and female mice, we demonstrate that mutant animals exhibit significant changes in network excitability, reflected in increased Up state occurrence, decreased Up state duration and higher levels of extracellular spiking activity. Epileptiform activity was induced through two distinct and widely used in vitro protocols: the low magnesium and the 4-Aminopyridine (4-AP) model. In the former, slices from mutant animals manifested shorter latency for the expression of stable seizure-like events. In contrast, when epilepsy was induced by 4-AP, no significant differences were reported. We conclude that normal SST-interneuron function has a significant role both in the regulation of the endogenous network activity, and in the transition to seizure-like discharges in a context-dependent manner.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Diurnal small RNA expression and post-transcriptional regulation in young and old Drosophila melanogaster heads [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: MicroRNAs are a class of small (~22nt) endogenous RNAs that regulate target transcript expression post-transcriptionally. Previous studies characterized age-related changes in diurnal transcript expression but it is not understood how these changes are regulated, and whether they may be attributed in part to changes in microRNA expression or activity with age. Diurnal small RNA expression changes with age were not previously studied. Methods: To interrogate changes in small RNA expression with age, we collected young (5 day) and old (55 day) Drosophila melanogaster around-the-clock and performed deep sequencing on size-selected RNA from whole heads. Results: We found several microRNAs with changes in rhythmicity after aging, and we investigated microRNAs which are differentially expressed with age. We found that predicted targets of differentially expressed microRNAs have RNA-binding and transcription factor activity. We used a previously published method to identify mRNA transcripts which show evidence of microRNA targeting that is altered after aging, and found several that are involved in muscle development and maintenance. Finally, we identified novel microRNAs using the random-forest-based method miRWoods, which surprisingly also discovered transfer RNA-derived fragments. Conclusions: We showed a decrease in global microRNA expression and a corresponding increase in piRNA expression during aging. We also found an increase in rhythmicity of Drosophila small RNAs during aging, including microRNAs, piRNA clusters, and novel transfer RNA-derived fragments. To our knowledge this is the first study examining diurnal small RNA expression around the clock in young and old Drosophila, and as such it paves the way for future research on changes in small RNA regulatory molecules in the context of aging.

                Background: We investigated the potential predictive value along with interpretability of the three-dimensional wavelet decomposition (3D-WD)-based radiomics analysis for characterization of gross-tumor-volumes (GTVs) for patients with Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC). The goal was to characterize and identify the spatial frequencies and regions of primary tumor that are responsible for classifying the HPV status. Methods: One-hundred twenty-eight OPSCC patients (60-HPV+ and 68-HPV-, confirmed by immunohistochemistry-P16-Protein) were retrospectively studied. 3D-WD analysis was performed on the contrast-enhanced-CT images of patients’ primary tumor-GTVs to decompose information into three decomposition levels explained by a series of high-pass and low-pass wavelet coefficients (WCs). Log-Energy-Entropy of the WCs was calculated as radiomics features. A Least-Absolute-Shrinkage-and-Selection-Operation (Lasso) technique combined with a Generalized-Linear-Model (Lasso-GLM) was applied on the feature space to identify and rank the frequency sub-bands associated with the HPV status. The classifier was validated using a nested-cross-validation technique. Average of Area Under ROC (AUC), and Positive and Negative Predictive values (PPV and NPV) were computed to estimate the generalization-error and performance of the classifier. The significant features were used to weight tumor sub-band frequencies to reconstruct the tumor zones with highest information towards characterization of HPV. Results: Among 22 frequency-based features, two low-frequency and two high-frequency features were statistically discriminant between the two cohorts. Results (AUC/PPV/NPV=0.798/0.745/0.823) imply that tumor’s high-frequency and low-frequency components are associated with its HPV positivity and negativity, respectively. Conclusions: This study suggests that compared to the central zones of tumor, peritumoral regions contain more information for characterization of the HPV-status. Albeit subject to confirmation in a larger cohort, this pilot study presents encouraging results in support of the role of frequency-based radiomics analysis towards characterization of tumor microenvironment in patients with OPSCC. By associating this information with tumor pathology, one can potentially link radiomics to underlying biological mechanisms.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">An updated version of the Madagascar periwinkle genome [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                The Madagascar periwinkle, Catharanthus roseus, belongs to the Apocynaceae family. This medicinal plant, endemic to Madagascar, produces many important drugs including the monoterpene indole alkaloids (MIA) vincristine and vinblastine used to treat cancer worldwide. Here, we provide a new version of the C. roseus genome sequence obtained through the combination of Oxford Nanopore Technologies long-reads and Illumina short-reads. This more contiguous assembly consists of 173 scaffolds with a total length of 581.128 Mb and an N50 of 12.241 Mb. Using publicly available RNAseq data, 21,061 protein coding genes were predicted and functionally annotated. A total of 42.87% of the genome was annotated as transposable elements, most of them being long-terminal repeats. Together with the increasing access to MIA-producing plant genomes, this updated version should ease evolutionary studies leading to a better understanding of MIA biosynthetic pathway evolution.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Senataxin and RNase H2 act redundantly to suppress genome instability during class switch recombination</a></h4>

              
                Class switch recombination generates distinct antibody isotypes critical to a robust adaptive immune system, and defects are associated with autoimmune disorders and lymphomagenesis. Transcription is required during class switch recombination to recruit the cytidine deaminase AID—an essential step for the formation of DNA double-strand breaks—and strongly induces the formation of R loops within the immunoglobulin heavy-chain locus. However, the impact of R loops on double-strand break formation and repair during class switch recombination remains unclear. Here, we report that cells lacking two enzymes involved in R loop removal—senataxin and RNase H2—exhibit increased R loop formation and genome instability at the immunoglobulin heavy-chain locus without impacting its transcriptional activity, AID recruitment, or class switch recombination efficiency. Senataxin and RNase H2-deficient cells also exhibit increased insertion mutations at switch junctions, a hallmark of alternative end joining. Importantly, these phenotypes were not observed in cells lacking senataxin or RNase H2B alone. We propose that senataxin acts redundantly with RNase H2 to mediate timely R loop removal, promoting efficient repair while suppressing AID-dependent genome instability and insertional mutagenesis.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Meningeal lymphatic drainage promotes T cell responses against Toxoplasma gondii but is dispensable for parasite control in the brain</a></h4>

              
                The discovery of meningeal lymphatic vessels that drain the central nervous system (CNS) has prompted new insights into how immune responses develop in the brain. In this study, we examined how T cell responses against CNS-derived antigen develop in the context of infection. We found that meningeal lymphatic drainage promotes CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses against the neurotropic parasite <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> in mice, and we observed changes in the dendritic cell compartment of the dural meninges that may support this process. Indeed, we found that mice chronically, but not acutely, infected with <i>T. gondii</i> exhibited a significant expansion and activation of type 1 and type 2 conventional dendritic cells (cDC) in the dural meninges. cDC1s and cDC2s were both capable of sampling cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-derived protein and were found to harbor processed CSF-derived protein in the draining deep cervical lymph nodes. Disrupting meningeal lymphatic drainage via ligation surgery led to a reduction in CD103<sup>+</sup> cDC1 and cDC2 number in the deep cervical lymph nodes and caused an impairment in cDC1 and cDC2 maturation. Concomitantly, lymphatic vessel ligation impaired CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell activation, proliferation, and IFN‑γ production at this site. Surprisingly, however, parasite-specific T cell responses in the brain remained intact following ligation, which may be due to concurrent activation of T cells at non-CNS-draining sites during chronic infection. Collectively, our work reveals that CNS lymphatic drainage supports the development of peripheral T cell responses against <i>T. gondii</i> but remains dispensable for immune protection of the brain.

                Axin1 is a key regulator of canonical Wnt signaling pathway. Roles of Axin1 in skeletal development and in disease occurrence have not been fully defined. Here, we report that Axin1 is essential for lower limb development. Specific deletion of <i>Axin1</i> in limb mesenchymal cells leads to fibular hemimelia (FH)-like phenotype, associated with tarsal coalition. Further studies demonstrate that FH disease is associated with additional defects in <i>Axin1</i> knockout (KO) mice, including decreased osteoclast formation and defects in angiogenesis. We then provide<i> in vivo</i> evidence showing that Axin1 controls limb development through both canonical β-catenin and BMP signaling pathways. We demonstrate that inhibition of β-catenin or BMP signaling could significantly reverse the FH phenotype in mice. Together, our findings reveal that integration of β-catenin and BMP signaling by Axin1 is required for lower limb development. Defect in Axin1 signaling could lead to the development of FH disease.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">TGF-β signaling and Creb5 cooperatively regulate Fgf18 to control pharyngeal muscle development</a></h4>

              
                The communication between myogenic cells and their surrounding connective tissues is indispensable for muscle morphogenesis. During late embryonic development in mice, myogenic progenitors migrate to discrete sites to form individual muscles. The detailed mechanism of this process remains unclear. Using mouse levator veli palatini (LVP) development as a model, we systematically investigated how a distinct connective tissue subpopulation, perimysial fibroblasts, communicates with myogenic cells to regulate mouse pharyngeal myogenesis. Using single-cell RNAseq data analysis, we identified that TGF-β signaling is a key regulator for the perimysial fibroblasts. Loss of TGF-β signaling in the neural crest-derived palatal mesenchyme leads to defects in perimysial fibroblasts and muscle malformation in the soft palate in <i>Osr2<sup>Cre</sup>;Tgfbr1<sup>fl/fl</sup></i> mice. In particular, Creb5, a transcription factor expressed in the perimysial fibroblasts, cooperates with TGF-β signaling to activate expression of <i>Fgf18</i>. Moreover, Fgf18 supports pharyngeal muscle development <i>in vivo</i> and exogenous Fgf18 can partially rescue myogenic cell numbers in <i>Osr2<sup>Cre</sup>;Tgfbr1<sup>fl/fl</sup></i> samples, illustrating that TGF-β-regulated Fgf18 signaling is required for LVP development. Collectively, our findings reveal the mechanism by which TGF-β signaling achieves its functional specificity in defining the perimysial-to-myogenic signals for pharyngeal myogenesis.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Can hubs of the human connectome be identified consistently with diffusion MRI?</a></h4>

              
                Recent years have seen a surge in the use of diffusion MRI to map connectomes in humans, paralleled by a similar increase in pre-processing and analysis choices. Yet these different steps and their effects are rarely compared systematically. Here, in a healthy young adult population (n = 294), we characterized the impact of a range of analysis pipelines on one widely studied property of the human connectome; its degree distribution. We evaluated the effects of 40 pipelines (comparing common choices of parcellation, streamline seeding, tractography algorithm, and streamline propagation constraint) and 44 group-representative connectome reconstruction schemes on highly connected hub regions. We found that hub location is highly variable between pipelines. The choice of parcellation has a major influence on hub architecture, and hub connectivity is highly correlated with regional surface area in most of the assessed pipelines ({rho} > 0.70 in 69% of the pipelines), particularly when using weighted networks. Overall, our results demonstrate the need for prudent decision-making when processing diffusion MRI data, and for carefully considering how different pre-processing choices can influence connectome organization.

                The enhanced cognitive abilities characterizing the human species result from specialized features of neurons and circuits, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here we report that the hominid-specific gene LRRC37B encodes a novel receptor expressed in a subset of human cortical pyramidal neurons (CPNs). LRRC37B protein localizes at the axon initial segment (AIS), the specialized domain triggering action potentials. LRRC37B ectopic expression in mouse CPNs in vivo leads to reduced intrinsic excitability, a distinctive feature of some classes of human CPNs. At the molecular level, LRRC37B acts as a receptor for the secreted ligand FGF13A and interacts with the voltage gated sodium channel (VGSC) beta subunit SCN1B, thereby inhibiting the channel function of VGSC, specifically at the AIS. Electrophysiological recordings in adult human cortical slices reveals that endogenous expression of LRRC37B in human CPNs reduces neuronal excitability. LRRC37B thus acts as a species-specific modifier of human cortical neuron function, with important implications for human brain evolution and diseases.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Optimal parameters for Rapid invisible Frequency Tagging using MEG</a></h4>

              
                Frequency tagging has been demonstrated to be a useful tool for identifying representational-specific neuronal activity in the auditory and visual domains. However, the slow flicker (<30Hz) applied in conventional frequency tagging studies is highly visible and might entrain endogenous neuronal oscillations. Hence, stimulation at faster frequencies that is much less visible and does not interfere with endogenous brain oscillatory activity is a promising new tool. In this study, we set out to examine the optimal stimulation parameters of rapid invisible frequency tagging (RFT/RIFT) with magnetoencephalography (MEG) by quantifying the effects of stimulation frequency, size and position of the flickering patch. Rapid frequency tagging (RFT) using flickers above 50 Hz results in almost invisible stimulation which does not interfere with slower endogenous oscillations; however, the signal is weaker as compared to tagging at slower frequencies so the optimal parameters of stimulation delivery are crucial. The here presented results examining the frequency range between 60Hz and 96Hz suggest that RFT induces brain responses with decreasing strength up to about 84Hz. In addition, even at the smallest flicker patch (2 degrees) focally presented RFT induces a significant oscillatory brain signal at the stimulation frequency (66Hz); however, the elicited response increases with patch size. While focal RFT presentation elicits the strongest response, off-centre presentations do generally mainly elicit a measureable response if presented below the horizontal midline. The results also revealed considerable individual differences in the neuronal responses of to RFT stimulation. Finally, we discuss the comparison of oscillatory measures (coherence and power) and sensor types (planar gradiometers and magnetometers) in order to achieve optimal outcomes. Based on our extensive findings we set forward concrete recommendations for using rapid frequency tagging in human cognitive neuroscience investigations.

                Non-human primates are a critical species for the identification of key biological mechanisms in normal and pathological aging. One of these primates, the mouse lemur, has been widely studied as a model of cerebral aging or Alzheimer's disease. The amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations of blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) can be measured with functional MRI. Within specific frequency bands (e.g. the 0.01 0.1 Hz), these amplitudes were proposed to indirectly reflect neuronal activity as well as glucose metabolism. Here, we first created whole brain maps of the mean amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (mALFF) in middle-aged mouse lemurs. Then, we extracted mALFF in old lemurs to identify age-related changes. A high level of mALFF was detected in the temporal cortex (Brodmann area 20), somatosensory areas (Brodmann area 5), insula (Brodmann area 13/6) and the parietal cortex (Brodmann area 7) of healthy middle-aged mouse lemurs. Aging was associated with alteration of mALFF in somatosensory areas (area 5) and the parietal cortex (area 7).

                Innate defensive responses, while primarily instinctive, must also be flexible and highly adaptive to changes in risk assessment. As such, efficient innate escape behavior requires intricate processing to minimize reaction time while maximizing the success and adaptivity of the action. The superior colliculus (SC) is a subcortical sensorimotor integration center linking sensory threat information and escape. Adaptive changes in innate escape after learning could take a maladaptive turn after severe stress. Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is associated with long-term maladaptive changes after exposure to traumatic events, related to enhanced threat detection and reaction. Such long-term modifications are thought to involve the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), which is implicated in integrating learned emotional values into decisions that drive actions and behaviors. Here, in a series of experiments, we establish the crucial physiological role of specific mPFC neurons, exerting influence on the SC both directly and indirectly through the basal ganglia, in threat detection and reaction after adversity.

                Evoked neural responses to sensory stimuli have been extensively investigated in humans and animal models both to enhance our understanding of brain function and to aid in clinical diagnosis of neurological and neuropsychiatric conditions. Recording and imaging techniques such as electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG), local field potentials (LFPs), and calcium imaging provide complementary information about different aspects of brain activity at different spatial and temporal scales. Modeling and simulations provide a way to integrate these different types of information to clarify underlying neural mechanisms. In this study, we aimed to shed light on the neural dynamics underlying auditory evoked responses by fitting a rate-based model to LFPs recorded via multi-contact electrodes which simultaneously sampled neural activity across cortical laminae. Recordings included neural population responses to best-frequency (BF) and non-BF tones at four representative sites in primary auditory cortex (A1) of awake monkeys. The model considered major neural populations of excitatory, parvalbumin-expressing (PV), and somatostatin-expressing (SOM) neurons across layers 2/3, 4, and 5/6. Unknown parameters, including the connection strength between the populations, were fitted to the data. Our results revealed similar population dynamics, fitted model parameters, predicted equivalent current dipoles (ECD), tuning curves, and lateral inhibition profiles across recording sites and animals, in spite of quite different extracellular current distributions. We found that PV firing rates were higher in BF than in non-BF responses, mainly due to different strengths of tonotopic thalamic input, whereas SOM firing rates were higher in non-BF than in BF responses due to lateral inhibition. In conclusion, we demonstrate the feasibility of the model-fitting approach in identifying the contributions of cell-type specific population activity to stimulus-evoked LFPs across cortical laminae, providing a foundation for further investigations into the dynamics of neural circuits underlying cortical sensory processing.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Electrophysiological indices of distractor processing in visual search are shaped by target expectations.</a></h4>

              
                Although in many cases salient stimuli capture attention involuntarily, it has been proposed recently that under certain conditions the bottom-up signal generated by such stimuli can be proactively suppressed. In support of this signal suppression hypothesis, ERP studies have demonstrated that salient stimuli that do not capture attention elicit a distractor positivity (PD), a putative neural index of suppression. At the same time, it is becoming increasingly clear that regularities across preceding search episodes have a large influence on attentional selection. Yet to date, studies in support of the signal suppression hypothesis have largely ignored the role of selection history on the processing of distractors. The current study addressed this issue by examining how electrophysiological markers of attentional selection (N2pc) and suppression (PD) elicited by targets and distractors respectively were modulated when the search target randomly varied instead of being fixed across trials. Results showed that while target selection was unaffected by this manipulation, both in terms of manual response times, as well as in terms of the N2pc component, the PD component was reliably attenuated when the target features varied randomly across trials. This result demonstrates that the distractor PD, which is typically considered the marker of selective distractor processing cannot unequivocally be attributed to suppression only, as it also, at least in part, reflects the upweighting of target features.

                Background Motor and cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with dopaminergic dysfunction that stems from substantia nigra (SN) degeneration and concomitant -synuclein accumulation. Diffusion MRI can detect microstructural alterations of the SN and its tracts to (sub)cortical regions, but their pathological sensitivity is still poorly understood. Objective To unravel the pathological substrate underlying microstructural alterations of the SN, and its tracts to the dorsal striatum and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in PD. Methods Combining post-mortem in-situ MRI and histopathology, T1-weighted and diffusion MRI of 9 PD, 6 PD with dementia (PDD), 5 dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and 10 control donors were collected. From MRI, mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA) were derived from the SN, and tracts between the SN and caudate nucleus, putamen, and DLPFC. Phosphorylated-Ser129--synuclein and tyrosine hydroxylase immunohistochemistry was included to quantify nigral Lewy pathology and dopaminergic degeneration, respectively. Results Compared to controls, PD and PDD/DLB showed increased MD of the SN and SN-DLPFC tract, as well as increased FA of the SN-caudate nucleus tract. Both PD and PDD/DLB showed nigral Lewy pathology and dopaminergic loss compared to controls. Increased FA of the SN and SN-caudate nucleus tract was associated with SN dopaminergic loss, while increased MD of the SN-DLPFC tract was associated with increased SN Lewy neurite load. Conclusions In PD and PDD/DLB, diffusion MRI captures microstructural alterations of the SN and tracts to the dorsal striatum and DLPFC, which differentially associates with SN dopaminergic degeneration and Lewy neurite pathology.

                Sex is one of the most rewarding and motivating behaviours for humans. Endogenous mu-opioid receptor system (MORs) plays a key role in the mammalian reward circuit. Both human and animal experiments suggest the involvements of MORs in human sexual pleasure, yet this hypothesis currently lacks in vivo support. We used positron emission tomography (PET) with the radioligand [11C]carfentanil, which has high affinity for MORs to quantify endogenous opioid release following orgasm in man. Subjects were scanned twice: Once immediately after reaching an orgasm and once in a baseline state. Haemodynamic activity was measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging during penile stimulation from partner. The PET data revealed significant opioid release in hippocampus. Haemodynamic activity in somatosensory and motor cortices as well as hippocampus and thalamus increased during penile stimulation, and thalamic activation was linearly dependent on self-reported sexual arousal. Altogether these data show that endogenous opioidergic activation in the medial temporal lobe is centrally involved in sexual arousal.

                In motor control, the brain not only sends motor commands to the periphery, but it also generates concurrent internal signals known as corollary discharge that influence the processing of sensory information around the time of movement. Corollary discharge signals are important for the brain to identify sensory input arising from self-motion and to compensate for it, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Using whole-cell patch clamp recordings from single neurons in the optic tectum of zebrafish, we discovered an inhibitory synaptic signal which was temporally locked to spontaneous and visually driven swim patterns. This motor-related synaptic signal transiently suppressed tectal output and was appropriately timed to counteract visually driven excitatory input arising from the fish's own motion. High-resolution calcium imaging revealed brief, highly localized post-swim signals in the tectal neuropil, suggesting that corollary discharge enters the tectum in its most superficial layer. Our results demonstrate how spurious visual input is suppressed during self-motion by motor-related phasic inhibition in the tectum. This may help explain perceptual saccadic suppression observed in many species.

                Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a public health concern ranging along a continuum of severity. The neurobiological motives behind ASD have been widely explored with reports about aberrant brain anatomy and functional connectivity. However, research on the underlying structural connectivity alterations is limited. We propose the application of a novel connectomic measure called Network Normality Score (NNS) to identify brain abnormalities and quantity topological dissimilarities in individuals with ASD. We show that the network topology of structural connectivity is altered in ASD brains relative to healthy controls at the global and system levels. We demonstrate that structural connectivity differences are more pronounced in certain subnetworks. Finally, we quantify the association between network similarity and behavioral autism severity to show the efficacy of NNS as a neuroimaging measure.

                Neural function relies on cellular energy supplies meeting the episodic demands of synaptic activity, but little is known about the extent to which power demands (energy demands per unit time) fluctuate, or the mechanisms that match supply with demand. Here, in individually-identified glutamatergic motor neuron terminals of Drosophila larvae, we leveraged prior macroscopic estimates of power demand to generate profiles of power demand from one action potential to the next. These profiles show that signaling demands can exceed non-signaling demands by 17-fold within milliseconds, and terminals with the greatest fluctuation (volatility) in power demand have the greatest mitochondrial volume and packing density. We elaborated on this quantitative approach to simulate adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels during activity and drove ATP production as a function of the reciprocal of the energy state, but this canonical feedback mechanism appeared to be unable to prevent ATP depletion during locomotion. Muscle cells possess a phosphagen system to buffer ATP levels but phosphagen systems have not been described for motor nerve terminals. We examined these terminals for evidence of a phosphagen system and found the mitochondria to be heavily decorated with an arginine kinase, the key element of invertebrate phosphagen systems. Similarly, an examination of mouse cholinergic motor nerve terminals found mitochondrial creatine kinases, the vertebrate analogues of arginine kinases. Knock down of arginine kinase in Drosophila resulted in rapid depletion of presynaptic ATP during activity, indicating that, in motor nerve terminals, as in muscle, phosphagen systems play a critical role in matching power supply with demand.

                Predicting positive or negative reinforcement from environmental clues is essential to guide decision making and goal-directed behavior. In insect brains the mushroom body is a central structure for learning such valuable associations between sensory signals and reinforcement. We propose a biologically realistic spiking network model of the Drosophila larval olfactory pathway for the association of odors and reinforcement to bias behavior towards either approach or avoidance. We demonstrate that prediction error coding through integration of present and expected reinforcement in dopaminergic neurons can serve as a driving force in learning that can, combined with synaptic homeostasis, account for the experimentally observed features of acquisition and extinction of associations that depend on the intensity of odor and reward, as well as temporal features of the odor/reward pairing. To allow for a direct comparison of our simulation results with behavioral data we model learning-induced plasticity over the full time course of behavioral experiments and simulate locomotion of individual larvae towards or away from odor sources in a virtual environment.

                Electrical stimulation is a powerful therapeutic tool for treating neurologic and neuropsychiatric disorders. Sensing and modulating electrophysiological biomarkers of memory over extended timescales is necessary for tracking and improving memory in humans. Here, we describe results from humans in their natural home environments using a novel, investigational system enabling chronic stimulation and multi-channel recording of anterior thalamic and hippocampal local field potentials during memory tasks. Four people with focal epilepsy performed a free recall verbal memory task repeatedly for up to fifty months on a touch-screen device with wireless signal acquisition with electrophysiology and behavioral data streaming to a cloud environment. Anterior thalamic-hippocampal spectral activities in the theta frequency range were found to correlate with memory processing, to predict task performance, and to be modulated by deep brain stimulation. Our results provide a new biomarker-based technology for chronic remote tracking of memory performance and modulation of the associated neural activities.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The processing of stress in a foreign language modulates functional antagonism between default mode and attention network regions</a></h4>

              
                Lexical stress is an essential element of prosody. Mastering this prosodic feature is challenging, especially in a stress-free foreign language for individuals native to a stress-fixed language, a phenomenon referred to as stress deafness. By using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we elucidated the neuronal underpinnings of stress processing in a stress-free foreign language, and determined the underlying mechanism of stress deafness. Here, we contrasted behavioral and hemodynamic responses revealed by native speakers of a stress-free (German; N = 38) and a stress-fixed (French; N = 47) language while discriminating pairs of words in a stress-free foreign language (Spanish). Consistent with the stress deafness phenomenon, French speakers performed worse than German speakers in discriminating Spanish words based on cues of stress but not of vowel. Whole-brain analyses revealed widespread bilateral networks (cerebral regions including frontal, temporal and parietal areas as well as insular, subcortical and cerebellar structures), overlapping with the ones previously associated with stress processing within native languages. Moreover, our results provide evidence that the structures pertaining to a right-lateralized attention system (i.e., middle frontal gyrus, anterior insula) and the Default Mode Network modulate stress processing as a function of the proficiency level. In comparison to the German speakers, the French speakers activated the attention system and deactivated the Default Mode Network to a stronger degree, reflecting attentive engagement, likely a compensatory mechanism underlying the stress-deaf brain. The mechanism modulating stress processing argues for a rightward lateralization, indeed overlapping with the location covered by the dorsal stream but remaining unspecific to speech.

                The hypothalamic supramammillary nucleus (SuM) plays a key role in controlling wakefulness, but the downstream target regions participating in this control process remain unknown. Here, using circuit-specific fiber photometry and single-neuron electrophysiology together with electroencephalogram, electromyogram and behavioral recordings, we find approximately half of SuM neurons that project to the medial septum (MS) are wake-active. Optogenetic stimulation of axonal terminals of SuM-MS projection induces a rapid and reliable transition to wakefulness from NREM or REM sleep, and chemogenetic activation of SuMMS projecting neurons significantly increases wakefulness time and prolongs latency to sleep. Consistently, chemogenetically inhibiting these neurons significantly reduces wakefulness time and latency to sleep. Therefore, these results identify the MS as a functional downstream target of SuM and provide evidence for a causal role for this hypothalamic-septal projection in wakefulness control.

                Sleep apnea (SA) during pregnancy is detrimental to the health of the pregnancy and neonate, but little is known regarding long-lasting consequences of maternal SA during pregnancy on adult offspring. SA is characterized by repeated cessations in breathing during sleep, resulting in intermittent hypoxia (IH). We show that gestational IH (GIH) in rats reprograms the male fetal neuroimmune system toward enhanced inflammation in a region- and sex-specific manner, which persists into adulthood. Male GIH offspring also had deficits in the neural control of breathing, specifically in the ability to mount compensatory responses to central apnea, an effect that was rescued by a localized anti-inflammatory or microglial depletion. Female GIH offspring appeared unaffected. These results indicate that SA during pregnancy sex- and region-dependently skews offspring microglia toward a pro-inflammatory phenotype, which leads to long-lasting deficits in the capacity to elicit important forms of respiratory neuroplasticity in response to breathing instability. These studies contribute to the growing body of recent evidence indicating that SA during pregnancy may lead to sex-specific neurological deficits in offspring that persist into adulthood.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Mismatch novelty exploration training impairs VPAC1 receptor mediated modulation of hippocampal synaptic plasticity by endogenous VIP</a></h4>

              
                Novelty influences hippocampal-dependent memory through metaplasticity, i.e., experience-dependent adaptations in synaptic plasticity. In this respect, mismatch novelty is known to activate the hippocampal CA1 area in humans and to enhance rat hippocampal-dependent learning and exploration. Mismatch novelty training (NT) by varying spatial configuration of objects in a known environment, enhances rat hippocampal synaptic plasticity. Prefrontal cortex GABAergic projections targeting hippocampal VIP interneurons promote exploration. Since VIP, acting on VPAC1 receptors, restrains both hippocampal LTP and depotentiation by modulating disinhibition we now investigated the impact of NT on VPAC1 receptor modulation of hippocampal synaptic plasticity. NT enhanced both CA1 hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) and depotentiation. Blockade of VIP VPAC1 receptors with PG 97-269 (100nM) enhanced both LTP and depotentiation in naiuml;ve animals but was much less effective in enhancing LTP and depotentiation in NT rats. Altered endogenous VIP modulation of LTP was absent in animals exposed to the empty environment (HT). Modulation of depotentiation by endogenous VIP was absent in animals exposed to a fixed configuration of objects (FT) or in HT animals. HT and FT animals, but not NT; showed mildly enhanced synaptic VPAC1 receptor expression. Altogether this suggests that NT influences hippocampal synaptic plasticity by reshaping brain circuits modulating disinhibition and its control by VIP-expressing hippocampal interneurons. Also, upregulation of VIP VPAC1 receptors maintains VIP control of LTP in FT and HT rats, the absence of this in NT rats leading to enhanced LTP but not influencing depotentiation. This may be relevant to co-adjuvate cognitive recovery therapies in aging or epilepsy, where LTP/LTD imbalance occurs.

                Fragile X syndrome is the most common inherited form of intellectual disability and the leading monogenetic cause of autism. Studies in mouse models of autism spectrum disorders, including the Fmr1 knockout (FX) mouse, suggest that an imbalance between excitation and inhibition in hippocampal circuits contributes to behavioral phenotypes. In addition to changes in excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission, changes in the intrinsic excitability of neurons can also contribute to circuit dysfunction. We and others previously identified changes in multiple voltage-gated ion channels in hippocampal excitatory pyramidal neurons in FX mice. Whether the intrinsic properties of hippocampal inhibitory interneurons are altered in FX remains largely unknown. We made whole-cell current clamp recordings from three types of interneurons in stratum oriens of the hippocampus: fast-spiking cells and two classes of low threshold spiking cells, oriens-lacunosum moleculare (OLM) and low-threshold high Ih (LTH) neurons. We found that in FX mice input resistance and action potential firing frequency were lower in LTH, but not FS or OLM, interneurons compared to wild type. LTH cell input resistance was not different between wild type and FX mice in the presence of the h-channel blocker ZD7288 suggesting a greater contribution of Ih in FX LTH cells. In agreement, we found using voltage clamp recording that Ih was higher in FX LTH cells compared to wild type. Our results suggest that the intrinsic excitability of LTH inhibitory interneurons contribute to altered excitatory/inhibitory balance in the hippocampus of FX mice.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dissociating Attentional Capture from Action Cancellation in the Stop Signal Task</a></h4>

              
                Inhibiting ongoing responses when environmental demands change is a critical component of human motor control. Experimentally, the stop signal task (SST) represents the gold standard response inhibition paradigm. However, an emerging body of evidence suggests that the SST conflates two dissociable sources of inhibition, namely an involuntarily pause associated with attentional capture and the (subsequent) voluntary cancellation of action. The extent to which these processes also occur in other response tasks is unknown. 24 younger (20-35 years) and 23 older (60-85 years) adults completed a series of tasks involving rapid unimanual or bimanual responses to a visual stimulus. A subset of trials required cancellation of one component of an initial bimanual response (i.e., selective stop task; stop left response, continue with right response) or enacting an additional response (e.g., press left button as well as right button). Critically, both tasks involved some infrequent stimuli which bore no behavioural imperative (i.e., they had to be ignored). EMG recordings of voluntary responses during the stopping tasks revealed bimanual covert responses (i.e., muscle activation which was suppressed before a button press ensued), consistent with a pause process, following both stop and ignore stimuli, before the required response was subsequently enacted. Critically, we also observed the behavioural consequences of a similar involuntary pause in trials where action cancellation was not part of the response set (i.e., when the additional stimulus required additional action or ignoring, but not inhibition). The findings shed new light on the mechanisms of inhibition and their generalisability to other task contexts.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A Jacob/nsmf gene knockout does not protect against hypoxia- and NMDA-induced neuronal cell death</a></h4>

              
                Jacob is a synapto-nuclear messenger protein that encodes and transduces the origin of synaptic and extrasynaptic NMDA receptor signals to the nucleus. The protein assembles a signalosome that differs in case of synaptic or extrasynaptic NMDAR activation. Following nuclear import Jacob docks these signalosomes to the transcription factor CREB. We have recently shown that amyloid-beta and extrasynaptic NMDAR activation triggers the translocation of a Jacob signalosome that results in inactivation of the transcription factor CREB, a phenomenon termed Jacob-induced CREB shut-off (JaCS). JaCS contributes to early Alzheimer's disease pathology and a gene knockout of nsmf, the gene encoding Jacob, protects against amyloid pathology. Given that extrasynaptic activity is also involved in acute excitotoxicity, like in stroke, we asked whether nsmf gene knockout will also protect against acute insults, like oxygen and glucose deprivation and excitotoxic NMDA stimulation. Here we show that organotypic hippocampal slices from wild-type and nsmf-/- mice display similar degrees of degeneration when exposed to either oxygen glucose deprivation or 50 uM NMDA incubation. This lack of neuroprotection indicates that JaCS is mainly relevant in conditions of low level chronic extrasynaptic NMDAR activation that results in cellular degeneration induced by alterations in gene transcription.

                Learning requires flexible switching between perceiving and encoding external sensory stimuli, making associations with representations already stored in memory (retrieval) and acting accordingly to adapt to the environment. Hippocampus is known to be central in creating mnemonic representations, but how it could support the integration of these processes of memory encoding and retrieval during repetitive learning experiences has remained unknown. In this study, we recorded local-field potentials (LFPs) from the dorsal hippocampus during classical trace eyeblink conditioning in rats. An auditory conditioned stimulus (CS) was followed by a periorbital shock-unconditioned stimulus (US). From the LFPs, we separated hippocampal oscillations that were linked with the variation in the trial-by-trial processing of the CS from those linked with the gradual learning of the CS-US association over daily sessions of training. Short latency transient theta and gamma band oscillations were associated with learning so that both the oscillation amplitudes (strength) and phase locking increased as a function of training. In contrast, long-latency sustained alpha and beta oscillations were associated with perception of CS. These data show divergent oscillatory neural signatures for perception and learning in hippocampal subfields.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Beat processing in newborn infants cannot be explained by statistical learning based on transition probabilities</a></h4>

              
                Newborn infants have been shown to extract temporal regularities from sound sequences, both in the form of learning regular sequential properties, and extracting periodicity in the input, commonly referred to as a beat. However, these two types of regularities are often indistinguishable in isochronous sequences, as both statistical learning and beat perception can be elicited by the regular alternation of accented and unaccented sounds. Here, we manipulated the isochrony of sound sequences in order to disentangle statistical learning from beat perception in sleeping newborn infants in an EEG experiment, as previously done in adults and macaque monkeys. We used a binary accented sequence that induces a beat when presented with isochronous timing, but not when presented with randomly jittered timing. We compared mismatch responses to infrequent deviants falling on either accented or unaccented (i.e., odd and even) positions. Results showed a clear difference between metrical positions in the isochronous sequence, but not in the equivalent jittered sequence. This suggests that beat processing is present in newborns. However, the current paradigm did not show effects of statistical learning, despite previous evidence for this ability in newborns. These results show that statistical learning does not explain beat processing in newborn infants.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Choice of parcellation atlas might not be too critical for connectomic analysis</a></h4>

              
                Connectomics has been a rapidly growing discipline in neuroimaging and neuroscience that evolved our understanding of the brain. Connectomics involves representing the brain as a network of regions, where the parcellation of the brain into regions using a template atlas is an integral part of the analysis. Over developmental and young adult cohorts of healthy individuals, we investigated how choosing parcellation atlases at certain resolutions affect sex classification and age prediction tasks performed using deep learning on structural connectomes. Datasets were processed on a total of 35 parcellations, where the only significant difference was observed for age prediction on the developmental cohort with a slight improvement on higher resolutions. This indicates that choice of parcellation scheme is generally not critical for deep learning-based age prediction and sex classification. Therefore, results between studies using different parcellation schemes could be comparable and repeating analyses on multiple atlases might be unnecessary.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Newly repopulated spinal cord microglia exhibit a unique transcriptome and coincide with sex-independent pain resolution</a></h4>

              
                Microglia contribute to the initiation of pain, however, a translationally viable approach addressing how or when to modulate these cells remains elusive. We used a targeted, inducible genetic microglial depletion strategy at both the acute and acute-to-chronic transition phases in the clinically-relevant tibial fracture/casting model to determine the contribution of microglia to the initiation and maintenance of pain. We observed complete resolution of pain after transient microglial depletion at the acute-to-chronic phase, which coincided with the timeframe of full repopulation of microglia. These repopulated microglia were morphologically distinct from control microglia, suggesting they may exhibit a unique transcriptome. RNA sequencing of repopulated spinal cord microglia identified genes of interest using weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). We intersected these genes with a newly-generated single nuclei microglial dataset from human dorsal horn spinal cord to identify human-relevant genes that may promote homeostatic features of microglia and ultimately promote pain resolution after injury.

	<p>Background: Over the past decade, many studies in the field of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in stroke have been published in scholarly journals. However, a scientometric analysis focusing on tDCS after stroke is still missing. The purpose of this study is to deliver a bibliometric analysis to investigate the global hotspots and frontiers in the domain of tDCS in stroke from 2012 to 2021. Methods: Articles and reviews related to tDCS in stroke were retrieved and obtained from the Web of Science core collection database from 2012 to 2021. Data visualization and analysis were conducted by using CiteSpace, VOSviewer, and Microsoft Excel 2019. Results: Finally, 371 publications were included in the scientometric analysis, including 288 articles and 83 reviews. The results showed that the number of publications per year increased from 15 to 68 in the last 10 years. Neurosciences was the main research hotspot category (n = 201). Frontiers in Human Neuroscience was the most published journal with 14 papers. The most productive author, institution, and country were Fregni F (n = 13), the League of European Research Universities (n = 37), and the United States of America (n = 98), respectively. A burstness analysis of keywords and the literature indicated that current studies in the field of tDCS in stroke focused on poststroke aphasia, tDCS combined with robotic therapy, and anatomical parameters. Conclusion: The research of tDCS in stroke is predicted to remain a research hotspot in the future. We recommend investigating the curative effect of other different tDCS closed-loop rehabilitation methods for different stroke dysfunctions. In conclusion, this bibliometric study presented the hotspots and trends of tDCS in stroke over the last decade, which may help researchers manage their further studies.</p>

	<p>Objectives: This retrospective cohort study investigated the clinical characteristics and seizure outcomes of patients aged 1&amp;amp;ndash;14 years with drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) who were treated by different typologies of therapy. Methods: Four hundred and eighteen children with DRE were recruited from Sanbo Brain Hospital of Capital Medical University from April 2008 to February 2015. The patients were divided into three groups: medication (n = 134, 32.06%), resection surgery (n = 185, 44.26%), and palliative surgery (n = 99, 23.68%) groups. Demographic characteristics were attained from medical records. All patients were followed up for at least 5 years, with seizure outcomes classified according to International League Against Epilepsy criteria. The psychological outcome was evaluated with the development quotient and Wechsler Intelligence Quotient Scale for children (Chinese version). Results: The most frequent seizure type was generalized tonic seizure in 53.83% of patients. Age at seizure onset in 54.55% of patients was &amp;amp;lt;3 years. The most frequent etiologies were focal cortical dysplasia (FCD). West syndrome was the most common epilepsy syndrome. Favorable seizure outcomes at the 5-year follow-up in the medication, resection surgery, and palliative surgery groups were 5.22%, 77.30%, and 14.14%, respectively. The patients showed varying degrees of improvement in terms of developmental and intellectual outcomes post-treatment. Conclusions: Pediatric patients with DRE were characterized by frequent seizures, a variety of seizure types, and complex etiology. Recurrent seizures severely affected the cognitive function and development of children. Early surgical intervention would be beneficial for seizure control and prevention of mental retardation. Palliative surgery was also a reasonable option for patients who were not suitable candidates for resection surgery.</p>

	<p>This paper, aligned with contemporary thinking in terms of patient-centered care and co-creation of patient care, highlights the limitations of the reductionist approaches to psychiatry, offering an alternative, &amp;amp;ldquo;emergent&amp;amp;rdquo; perspective and approach. Assuming that psychopathological phenomena are essentially relational, what kind of epistemological framework and &amp;amp;lsquo;logic of discovery&amp;amp;rsquo; should be adopted? I review two standard methods I call &amp;amp;lsquo;ticking boxes&amp;amp;rsquo; and &amp;amp;lsquo;drafting arrows&amp;amp;rsquo;. Within the ticking boxes framework, the clinician&amp;amp;rsquo;s main goal is to discover whether a patient showing psychopathological phenomena meets pre-given diagnostic criteria. The process of discovery can be compared to two people assembling a puzzle where the patient has the pieces and the interviewer has the image of the completed design. Drafting arrows consists in constructing pathogenetic diagrams that display linear causative relationships between variables connected by an arrow to other nodes. These explanatory narratives include psychodynamic (motivational) and biological (causal) diagrams. I argue for a third approach called &amp;amp;lsquo;linking dots&amp;amp;rsquo;, a method of discovery based on the emergent properties of psychopathological phenomena. I build on and develop the approach to images and discovery devised by art historian Aby Warburg in his atlas of images Bilderatlas Mnemosyne. The visual constellations created by Warburg in the panels of the Bilderatlas can be understood as a method to reveal the layers of memory and the web of relationships manifested in them, inviting the viewer to participate in the production of meanings, forging ever new connections between the images. It is the viewer&amp;amp;rsquo;s acts of perception that draw relationships between singularities. I suggest that this method is of enormous significance in the context of today&amp;amp;rsquo;s socio-cultural transformation processes and related forms of psychopathological conditions, which can no longer be comprehended using the categories of existing knowledge systems.</p>

	<p>Accurately identifying tumors from MRI scans is of the utmost importance for clinical diagnostics and when making plans regarding brain tumor treatment. However, manual segmentation is a challenging and time-consuming process in practice and exhibits a high degree of variability between doctors. Therefore, an axial attention brain tumor segmentation network was established in this paper, automatically segmenting tumor subregions from multi-modality MRIs. The axial attention mechanism was employed to capture richer semantic information, which makes it easier for models to provide local&amp;amp;ndash;global contextual information by incorporating local and global feature representations while simplifying the computational complexity. The deep supervision mechanism is employed to avoid vanishing gradients and guide the AABTS-Net to generate better feature representations. The hybrid loss is employed in the model to handle the class imbalance of the dataset. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive experiments on the BraTS 2019 and 2020 datasets. The proposed AABTS-Net shows greater robustness and accuracy, which signifies that the model can be employed in clinical practice and provides a new avenue for medical image segmentation systems.</p>

	<p>The present study assessed the effects of anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) combined with treadmill training on spatiotemporal and kinematic variables in stroke survivors using gait speed as the primary outcome. A randomized, sham-controlled, triple-blind, study was conducted involving 28 patients with hemiparesis allocated to two groups. The experimental group was submitted to treadmill training combined with anodal tDCS over the primary motor cortex (M1) of the damaged hemisphere. The control group was submitted to treadmill training combined with sham tDCS. Stimulation was administered (2 mA, 20 min) five times a week for two weeks during treadmill training. No significant differences (p &amp;amp;gt; 0.05) in spatiotemporal variables were found in the intra-group and inter-group analyses. However, the experimental group demonstrated improvements in kinematic variables of the knee and ankle (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05) and these results were maintained one month after the end of the intervention. The inter-group analysis revealed significant differences (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05) with regard to the pelvis, hip and knee. Anodal tDCS over M1 of the damaged hemisphere combined with treadmill training did not affect spatiotemporal variables, but promoted improvements in kinematic variables of the pelvis, hip, knee and ankle and results were maintained one month after treatment.</p>

	<p>Background: chronic idiopathic demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) is an acquired, immune-mediated neuropathy characterized by weakness, sensory symptoms and significant reduction or loss of deep tendon reflexes evolving over 2 months at least, associated with electrophysiological evidence of peripheral nerve demyelination. Recently, subcutaneous immunoglobulins (SCIg) have been introduced in clinical practice as a maintenance therapy for CIDP; nevertheless, electrophysiological and efficacy data are limited. Methods: to evaluate SCIg treatment efficacy, we retrospectively reviewed data from 15 CIDP patients referring to our clinic, receiving SCIg treatment and who performed electrophysiological studies (NCS) and clinical scores (MRC sumscore, INCAT disability score and ISS) before starting the treatment and at least one year after. Results: NCS showed no significant changes before and during treatment for all the nerves explored. Clinical scores did not significantly change between evaluations. Correlation analysis evidenced a positive correlation of cMAPs distal amplitude with MRC sumscore and a trend of negative correlation with the INCAT disability score. Conclusions: SCIg maintenance therapy preserves nerve function in CIDP with a good efficacy and safety. Treatment effectiveness can be assessed with ENG, which represents a useful instrument in the follow-up and prognostic assessment of CIDP.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Neural Signatures of Actively Controlled Self-Motion and the Subjective Encoding of Distance</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Navigating through an environment requires knowledge about one&rsquo;s direction of self-motion (heading) and traveled distance. Behavioral studies showed that human participants can actively reproduce a previously observed travel distance purely based on visual information. Here, we employed electroencephalography (EEG) to investigate the underlying neural processes. We measured, in human observers, event-related potentials (ERPs) during visually simulated straight-forward self-motion across a ground plane. The participants&rsquo; task was to reproduce (active condition) double the distance of a previously seen self-displacement (passive condition) using a gamepad. We recorded the trajectories of self-motion during the active condition and played it back to the participants in a third set of trials (replay condition). We analyzed EEG activity separately for four electrode clusters: frontal (F), central (C), parietal (P), and occipital (O). When aligned to self-motion onset or offset, response modulation of the ERPs was stronger, and several ERP components had different latencies in the passive as compared with the active condition. This result is in line with the concept of predictive coding, which implies modified neural activation for self-induced versus externally induced sensory stimulation. We aligned our data also to the times when subjects passed the (objective) single distance d_obj and the (subjective) single distance d_sub. Remarkably, wavelet-based temporal-frequency analyses revealed enhanced theta-band activation for F, P, and O-clusters shortly before passing d_sub. This enhanced activation could be indicative of a navigation related representation of subjective distance. More generally, our study design allows to investigate subjective perception without interfering neural activation because of the required response action.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Coordinating the four limbs is an important feature of terrestrial mammalian locomotion. When the foot dorsum contacts an obstacle, cutaneous mechanoreceptors send afferent signals to the spinal cord to elicit coordinated reflex responses in the four limbs to ensure dynamic balance and forward progression. To determine how the locomotor pattern of all four limbs changes in response to a sensory perturbation evoked by activating cutaneous afferents from one hindlimb, we electrically stimulated the superficial peroneal (SP) nerve with a relatively long train at four different phases (mid-stance, stance-to-swing transition, mid-swing, and swing-to-stance transition) of the hindlimb cycle in seven adult cats. The largest functional effects of the stimulation were found at mid-swing and at the stance-to-swing transition with several changes in the ipsilateral hindlimb, such as increased activity in muscles that flex the knee and hip joints, increased joint flexion and toe height, increased stride/step lengths and increased swing duration. We also observed several changes in support periods to shift support from the stimulated hindlimb to the other three limbs. The same stimulation applied at mid-stance and the swing-to-stance transition produced more subtle changes in the pattern. We observed no changes in stride and step lengths in the ipsilateral hindlimb with stimulation in these phases. We did observe some slightly greater flexions at the knee and ankle joints with stimulation at mid-stance and a reduction in double support periods and increase in triple support. Our results show that correcting or preventing stumbling involves functional contributions from all four limbs.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Alzheimer&rsquo;s Disease (AD) is characterized by the pathologic assembly of amyloid &beta; (A&beta;) peptide, which deposits into extracellular plaques, and tau, which accumulates in intraneuronal inclusions. To investigate the link between A&beta; and tau pathologies, experimental models featuring both pathologies are needed. We developed a mouse model featuring both tau and A&beta; pathologies by knocking the P290S mutation into murine <I>Mapt</I> and crossing these <I>Mapt</I><sup>P290S</sup> knock-in (KI) mice with the <I>App</I><sup>NL-G-F</sup> KI line. <I>Mapt</I><sup>P290S</sup> KI mice developed a small number of tau inclusions, which increased with age. The amount of tau pathology was significantly larger in <I>App</I><sup>NL-G-F</sup><I>xMapt</I><sup>P290S</sup> KI mice from 18 months of age onward. Tau pathology was higher in limbic areas, including hippocampus, amygdala, and piriform/entorhinal cortex. We also observed AT100-positive and Gallyas-Braak-silver-positive dystrophic neurites containing assembled filamentous tau, as visualized by <I>in situ</I> electron microscopy. Using a cell-based tau seeding assay, we showed that Sarkosyl-insoluble brain extracts from both 18-month-old <I>Mapt</I><sup>P290S</sup> KI and <I>App</I><sup>NL-G-F</sup><I>xMapt</I><sup>P290S</sup> KI mice were seed competent, with brain extracts from double-KI mice seeding significantly more than those from the <I>Mapt</I><sup>P290S</sup> KI mice. Finally, we showed that <I>App</I><sup>NL-G-F</sup><I>xMapt</I><sup>P290S</sup> KI mice had neurodegeneration in the piriform cortex from 18 months of age. We suggest that <I>App</I><sup>NL-G-F</sup><I>xMapt</I><sup>P290S</sup> KI mice provide a good model for studying the interactions of aggregation-prone tau, A&beta;, neuritic plaques, neurodegeneration, and aging.</p>

                Background A photovoltaic (PV) system, especially the stand-alone type, along with a battery storage system, plays a significant role in providing the needed electrical energy to remote, off-grid communities. Methods  In this study, a stand-alone PV solar cell was enhanced to better understand the system operation. Modeling and simulation were performed using MATLAB software. Results  This work has shown that the I-V  (current-voltage) and P-V (power-voltage) characteristics of the modelled system have a profound effect on energy when a pulse width modulation controller is used as a charger. The modelled PV system generated the required energy under different conditions, considering temperature and PV battery voltage mismatches. Conclusion In summary, the simulated model in this study can be considered a system capable of detecting different conditions with the presence or absence of light at different temperatures. Finally, monitoring the temperatures, adjusting the voltage with a suitable charger controller, and selecting solar modules made of optimal materials can increase the efficiency of the solar system and allow it to be used in more applications.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>There is substantial intersubject variability of behavioral and neurophysiological responses to transcranial electrical stimulation (tES), which represents one of the most important limitations of tES. Many tES protocols utilize a fixed experimental parameter set disregarding individual anatomical and physiological properties. This one-size-fits-all approach might be one reason for the observed interindividual response variability. Simulation of current flow applying head models based on available anatomical data can help to individualize stimulation parameters and contribute to the understanding of the causes of this response variability. Current flow modeling can be used to retrospectively investigate the characteristics of tES effectivity. Previous studies examined, for example, the impact of skull defects and lesions on the modulation of current flow and demonstrated effective stimulation intensities in different age groups. Furthermore, uncertainty analysis of electrical conductivities in current flow modeling indicated the most influential tissue compartments. Current flow modeling, when used in prospective study planning, can potentially guide stimulation configurations resulting in individually effective tES. Specifically, current flow modeling using individual or matched head models can be employed by clinicians and scientists to, for example, plan dosage in tES protocols for individuals or groups of participants. We review studies that show a relationship between the presence of behavioral/neurophysiological responses and features derived from individualized current flow models. We highlight the potential benefits of individualized current flow modeling.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">BOREALIS: an R/Bioconductor package to detect outlier methylation from bisulfite sequencing data [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Rare genetic disease studies have benefited from the era of high throughput sequencing. DNA sequencing results in genetic diagnosis of 18-40% of previously unsolved cases, while the incorporation of RNA-Seq analysis has more recently been shown to generate significant numbers of previously unattainable diagnoses.  While DNA methylation remains less explored, multiple inborn diseases resulting from disorders of genomic imprinting are well characterized and a growing body of literature suggests the causative or correlative role of aberrant methylation in diverse rare inherited conditions.  Complex pictures of methylation patterning are also emerging, including the association of regional, multiple specific-site or even single-site methylation, with disease. The systematic application of genomic-wide methylation-based sequencing for undiagnosed cases of rare diseases is a logical progression from current testing paradigms.  Similar to the rationale previously exploited in RNA-based rare disease studies, we can assume that disease-associated or causative methylation aberrations in an individual will demonstrate significant differences from other individuals with unrelated phenotypes.  Thus, aberrantly methylated sites will be outliers from a heterogeneous cohort of individuals. Methods: Based on this rationale, we present BOREALIS: Bisulfite-seq OutlieR MEthylation At SingLeSIte ReSolution.  BOREALIS uses a beta binomial model to identify outlier methylation at single CpG site resolution from bisulfite sequencing data. Results: Utilizing power analyses, we demonstrate that BOREALIS can identify outlier CpG methylation within a cohort of samples.  Furthermore, we show that BOREALIS is tolerant to the inclusion of multiple identical outliers with sufficient cohort size and sequencing depth. Conclusions: The method demonstrates improved performance versus standard statistical testing and is suited for single or multi-site downstream analysis.

                Background: Pleiotropic actions of insulin and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) in the brain are context- and cell-dependent, but whether this holds for their receptors (insulin receptor (IR) and IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR), respectively), is less clear. Methods: We compared mice lacking IR or IGF-IR in glial fibrillary astrocytic protein (GFAP)-expressing astrocytes in a tamoxifen-regulated manner, to clarify their role in this type of glial cells, as the majority of data of their actions in brain have been obtained in neurons. Results: We observed that mice lacking IR in GFAP astrocytes (GFAP IR KO mice) develop mood disturbances and maintained intact cognition, while at the same time show greater pathology when cross-bred with APP/PS1 mice, a model of familial Alzheimer´s disease (AD). Conversely, mice lacking IGF-IR in GFAP astrocytes (GFAP-IGF-IR KO mice) show cognitive disturbances, maintained mood tone, and show control-dependent changes in AD-like pathology. Conclusions: These observations confirm that the role of IR and IGF-IR in the brain is cell-specific and context-dependent.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Improved visualization of high-dimensional data using the distance-of-distance transformation</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jinke Liu, Martin Vinck</p>

Dimensionality reduction tools like t-SNE and UMAP are widely used for high-dimensional data analysis. For instance, these tools are applied in biology to describe spiking patterns of neuronal populations or the genetic profiles of different cell types. Here, we show that when data include noise points that are randomly scattered within a high-dimensional space, a “scattering noise problem” occurs in the low-dimensional embedding where noise points overlap with the cluster points. We show that a simple transformation of the original distance matrix by computing a distance between neighbor distances alleviates this problem and identifies the noise points as a separate cluster. We apply this technique to high-dimensional neuronal spike sequences, as well as the representations of natural images by convolutional neural network units, and find an improvement in the constructed low-dimensional embedding. Thus, we present an improved dimensionality reduction technique for high-dimensional data containing noise points.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A mathematical model of potassium homeostasis: Effect of feedforward and feedback controls</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Melissa M. Stadt, Jessica Leete, Sophia Devinyak, Anita T. Layton</p>

Maintaining normal potassium (K<sup>+</sup>) concentrations in the extra- and intracellular fluid is critical for cell function. K<sup>+</sup> homeostasis is achieved by ensuring proper distribution between extra- and intracellular fluid compartments and by matching K<sup>+</sup> excretion with intake. The Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase pump facilitates K<sup>+</sup> uptake into the skeletal muscle, where most K<sup>+</sup> is stored. Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activity is stimulated by insulin and aldosterone. The kidneys regulate long term K<sup>+</sup> homeostasis by controlling the amount of K<sup>+</sup> excreted through urine. Renal handling of K<sup>+</sup> is mediated by a number of regulatory mechanisms, including an aldosterone-mediated feedback control, in which high extracellular K<sup>+</sup> concentration stimulates aldosterone secretion, which enhances urine K<sup>+</sup> excretion, and a gastrointestinal feedforward control mechanism, in which dietary K<sup>+</sup> intake increases K<sup>+</sup> excretion. Recently, a muscle-kidney cross talk signal has been hypothesized, where the K<sup>+</sup> concentration in skeletal muscle cells directly affects urine K<sup>+</sup> excretion without changes in extracellular K<sup>+</sup> concentration. To understand how these mechanisms coordinate under different K<sup>+</sup> challenges, we have developed a compartmental model of whole-body K<sup>+</sup> regulation. The model represents the intra- and extracellular fluid compartments in a human (male) as well as a detailed kidney compartment. We included (i) the gastrointestinal feedforward control mechanism, (ii) the effect of insulin and (iii) aldosterone on Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase K<sup>+</sup> uptake, and (iv) aldosterone stimulation of renal K<sup>+</sup> secretion. We used this model to investigate the impact of regulatory mechanisms on K<sup>+</sup> homeostasis. Model predictions showed how the regulatory mechanisms synthesize to ensure that the extra- and intracelluller fluid K<sup>+</sup> concentrations remain in normal range in times of K<sup>+</sup> loading and fasting. Additionally, we predict that without the hypothesized muscle-kidney cross talk signal, the model was unable to predict a return to normal extracellular K<sup>+</sup> concentration after a period of high K<sup>+</sup> loading or depletion.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Rapid and predictable genome evolution across three hybrid ant populations</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Pierre Nouhaud, Simon H. Martin, Beatriz Portinha, Vitor C. Sousa, Jonna Kulmuni</p>

Hybridization is frequent in the wild but it is unclear when admixture events lead to predictable outcomes and if so, at what timescale. We show that selection led to correlated sorting of genetic variation rapidly after admixture in 3 hybrid <i>Formica aquilonia</i> × <i>F</i>. <i>polyctena</i> ant populations. Removal of ancestry from the species with the lowest effective population size happened in all populations, consistent with purging of deleterious load. This process was modulated by recombination rate variation and the density of functional sites. Moreover, haplotypes with signatures of positive selection in either species were more likely to fix in hybrids. These mechanisms led to mosaic genomes with comparable ancestry proportions. Our work demonstrates predictable evolution over short timescales after admixture in nature.

                We present a dataset of the monthly cases of pipeline vandalism in Nigeria from January 2015 to January 2021. Data used in this study were collated from the Monthly Financial and Operations Reports (MFOR) of the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC). Each MFOR provides cases of pipeline vandalism during a 12-month span from five key locations; Mosimi, Kaduna, Port Harcourt, Warri, and Gombe. Recorded incidences of pipeline vandalism from these locations were summed and assembled into five groups; namely: historical data, prior-COVID-19, COVID-19 lockdown, and post-COVID-19 lockdown. The data were grouped based on dates. These dates were January 2015 to July 2019, August 2019 to January 2020, February 2020 to July 2020, and August 2020 to January 2021 respectively. The historical data were further sub-divided into four sub-groups based on the deployment (May 2016) of sophisticated weapons, satellite imagery, and geographical information system into the security apparatus to checkmate pipeline vandalism. The four sub-groups are sub-group A (one-year before deployment), sub-group B (the year of deployment), sub-group C (one-year after deployment), and sub-group D (two-years after deployment). The dates span for each sub-group is May 2015-April 2016, May 2016-April 2017, May 2017-April 2018, and May 2018-April 2019 respectively. After the deployment of GIS devices in May 2016, the accumulated national number of pipeline vandalism cases declined from 400 cases in January 2016 to 293 in February 2016, and 259 cases in March 2016 as opposed to 60, 49, and 94 cases in the same months in 2017; but over the years, 2017 to 2021 these methods have proved less effective, and cases of pipeline vandalism have risen once more. Similar changes in the number of cases and patterns were observed during the COVID-19 movement restrictions. From the dataset, it can be seen that COVID-19 influenced incidences of pipeline vandalism.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: Rehabilitation of bilateral below-knee and partial-hand amputations in a developing country [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Limb ischemia is a complication of peripheral artery disease (PAD)which can lead to amputation. Amputation occurs in approximately 3-4% of PAD patients. In Indonesia, post-amputation patients are only hospitalized for the acute phase and the post-amputation rehabilitation programs must be done as an outpatient. This could be a barrier to the continuity of rehabilitation programs. A solution is the application of home-based rehabilitation programs. A 57-year-old female was referred from the Cardiothoracic Surgery Outpatient Clinic post-amputation with bilateral below-knees and partial-hands amputation after being diagnosed with PAD. On initial examination, all her elbows, wrists, thumbs, hips, and knees showed weakness. The patient received neuromuscular electrical stimulations (NMES) as well as a home-based rehabilitation programs. On the second examination, after considering the data from the clinical finding and supporting examination, the patient received bilateral below-knee prostheses and bilateral functional partial-hand prostheses, created using 3D printing technology with polylactic acid material. After a few months, she was able to do most of her activities of daily living (ADLs) independently, work as a shopkeeper in her store, and feel more confident interacting with others. A comprehensive rehabilitation programs, patient adherence to exercise, and caregiver support are critical to improving functional capacity and the quality of life in a patient with bilateral below-knee and bilateral partial-hand amputation caused by PAD.

                Lyu et al. show that complete activation of the peribronchial niche involves removal of an inhibitory Shh signal and initiation of an activating Wnt7b signal after airway injury. Communication between niches is required to synchronize airway epithelial regeneration and to restore quiescence in niche and progenitor cells during injury resolution.

                Terker et al. demonstrate that dietary K+ deficiency causes kidney-specific injury and inflammation. Effects are mediated by the proximal tubule basolateral K+ channel Kir4.2, which promotes ammoniagenesis in response to reduced blood K+ levels. Deletion of this channel or the enzyme glutaminase protect animals from low-K+-mediated kidney injury.

Cells expressing non-myristoylated AMPK β1-G2A have increased basal AMPK activity despite reduced stability of the β1 subunit. High-fat diet-fed AMPK β1-G2A mice have reduced liver lipid accumulation and improved insulin sensitivity.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Opposite polarity programs regulate asymmetric subsidiary cell divisions in grasses</a></h4>

              
                Grass stomata recruit lateral subsidiary cells (SCs), which are key to the unique stomatal morphology and the efficient plant-atmosphere gas exchange in grasses. Subsidiary mother cells (SMCs) strongly polarise before an asymmetric division forms a SC. Yet apart from a proximal polarity module that includes PANGLOSS1 (PAN1) and guides nuclear migration, little is known regarding the developmental processes that form SCs. Here, we used comparative transcriptomics of developing wild-type and SC-less <i>bdmute</i> leaves in the genetic model grass <i>Brachypodium distachyon</i> to identify novel factors involved in SC formation. This approach revealed BdPOLAR, which forms a novel, distal polarity domain in SMCs that is opposite to the proximal PAN1 domain. Both polarity domains are required for the formative SC division yet exhibit various roles in guiding pre-mitotic nuclear migration and SMC division plane orientation, respectively. Nonetheless, the domains are linked as the proximal domain controls polarisation of the distal domain. In summary, we identified two opposing polarity domains that coordinate the SC division, a process crucial for grass stomatal physiology.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Cross-talk between red blood cells and plasma influences blood flow and omics phenotypes in severe COVID-19</a></h4>

              
                Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and can affect multiple organs, among which is the circulatory system. Inflammation and mortality risk markers were previously detected in COVID-19 plasma and red blood cells (RBCs) metabolic and proteomic profiles. Additionally, biophysical properties, such as deformability, were found to be changed during the infection. Based on such data, we aim to better characterize RBC functions in COVID-19. We evaluate the flow properties of RBCs in severe COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit by using microfluidic techniques and automated methods, including artificial neural networks, for an unbiased RBC analysis. We find strong flow and RBC shape impairment in COVID-19 samples and demonstrate that such changes are reversible upon suspension of COVID-19 RBCs in healthy plasma. Vice versa, healthy RBCs resemble COVID-19 RBCs when suspended in COVID-19 plasma. Proteomics and metabolomics analyses allow us to detect the effect of plasma exchanges on both plasma and RBCs and demonstrate a new role of RBCs in maintaining plasma equilibria at the expense of their flow properties. Our findings provide a framework for further investigations of clinical relevance for therapies against COVID-19 and possibly other infectious diseases.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Neurovascular anatomy of dwarf dinosaur implies precociality in sauropods</a></h4>

              
                Macronaria, a group of mostly colossal sauropod dinosaurs, comprised the largest terrestrial vertebrates of Earth’s history. However, some of the smallest sauropods belong to this group as well. The Late Jurassic macronarian island dwarf <i>Europasaurus holgeri</i> is one of the most peculiar and best-studied sauropods worldwide. So far, the braincase material of this taxon from Germany pended greater attention. With the aid of micro-computed tomography (microCT), we report on the neuroanatomy of the nearly complete braincase of an adult individual, as well as the inner ears (endosseous labyrinths) of one other adult and several juveniles (the latter also containing novel vascular cavities). The presence of large and morphologically adult inner ears in juvenile material suggests precociality. Our findings add to the diversity of neurovascular anatomy in sauropod braincases and buttress the perception of sauropods as fast-growing and autonomous giants with manifold facets of reproductive and social behaviour. This suggests that – apart from sheer size – little separated <i>Europasaurus</i> from its large-bodied relatives.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Modeling the spatiotemporal spread of beneficial alleles using ancient genomes</a></h4>

              
                Ancient genome sequencing technologies now provide the opportunity to study natural selection in unprecedented detail. Rather than making inferences from indirect footprints left by selection in present-day genomes, we can directly observe whether a given allele was present or absent in a particular region of the world at almost any period of human history within the last 10,000 years. Methods for studying selection using ancient genomes often rely on partitioning individuals into discrete time periods or regions of the world. However, a complete understanding of natural selection requires more nuanced statistical methods which can explicitly model allele frequency changes in a continuum across space and time. Here we introduce a method for inferring the spread of a beneficial allele across a landscape using two-dimensional partial differential equations. Unlike previous approaches, our framework can handle time-stamped ancient samples, as well as genotype likelihoods and pseudohaploid sequences from low-coverage genomes. We apply the method to a panel of published ancient West Eurasian genomes to produce dynamic maps showcasing the inferred spread of candidate beneficial alleles over time and space. We also provide estimates for the strength of selection and diffusion rate for each of these alleles. Finally, we highlight possible avenues of improvement for accurately tracing the spread of beneficial alleles in more complex scenarios.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Thalamocortical contribution to cognitive task activity</a></h4>

              
                Thalamocortical interaction is a ubiquitous functional motif in the mammalian brain. Previously (Hwang et al., 2021), we reported that lesions to network hubs in the human thalamus are associated with multi-domain behavioral impairments in language, memory, and executive functions. Here we show how task-evoked thalamic activity are organized to support these broad cognitive abilities. We analyzed functional MRI data from human subjects that performed 127 tasks encompassing a broad range of cognitive representations. We first investigated the spatial organization of task-evoked activity and found a basis set of activity patterns evoked to support processing needs of each task. Specifically, the anterior, medial, and posterior-medial thalamus exhibit hub-like activity profiles that are suggestive of broad functional participation. These thalamic task hubs overlapped with network hubs interlinking cortical systems. To further determine the cognitive relevance of thalamic activity and thalamocortical functional connectivity, we built a data-driven thalamocortical model to test whether thalamic activity can be used to predict cortical task activity. The thalamocortical model predicted task-specific cortical activity patterns, and outperformed comparison models built on cortical, hippocampal, and striatal regions. Simulated lesions to low-dimensional, multi-task thalamic hub regions impaired task activity prediction. This simulation result was further supported by profiles of neuropsychological impairments in human patients with focal thalamic lesions. In summary, our results suggest a general organizational principle of how the human thalamocortical system supports cognitive task activity.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The mini-IDLE 3D biomimetic culture assay enables interrogation of mechanisms governing muscle stem cell quiescence and niche repopulation</a></h4>

              
                Adult skeletal muscle harbors a population of muscle stem cells (MuSCs) that are required to repair or reform multinucleated myofibers after tissue injury. In youth, MuSCs return to a reversible state of cell cycle arrest termed 'quiescence' after injury resolution. By contrast, a proportion of MuSCs in aged muscle remain in a semi-activated state, causing a premature response to subsequent injury cues that results in incomplete tissue repair and eventual stem cell depletion. Regulation of the balance between MuSC quiescence and activation in youth and in age may hold the key to restoring tissue homeostasis with age, but is incompletely understood. To fill this gap, we developed a simple and tractable <i>in vitro</i> method, with a 96-well footprint, to rapidly inactivate MuSCs freshly isolated from young murine skeletal muscle tissue, and return them to a quiescent-like state for at least one-week, which we name mini-IDLE (Inactivation and Dormancy LEveraged <i>in vitro</i>). This was achieved by introducing MuSCs into a three-dimensional (3D) bioartificial niche comprised of a thin sheet of multinucleated mouse myotubes, which we iterate, and analyze temporally, to show that these <i>in vivo</i> niche features provide the minimal cues necessary to inactivate MuSCs and induce quiescence. By seeding the 3D myotube sheets with different starting numbers of MuSCs, the assay revealed cellular heterogeneity and population-level adaptation activities that converged on a common steady-state niche repopulation density; behaviors previously observed only <i>in vivo</i>. Quiescence-associated hallmarks included a Pax7<sup>+</sup>CalcR<sup>+</sup>DDX6<sup>+</sup>MyoD<sup>-</sup>c-FOS<sup>-</sup> molecular signature, <i>in vivo</i> quiescent-like morphologies including oval-shaped nuclei and long cytoplasmic projections with N-cadherin<sup>+</sup> tips, as well as the acquisition of polarized niche markers. Leveraging high-content imaging and bespoke CellProfiler<sup>TM</sup>-based image analysis pipelines, we demonstrate a relationship between morphology and cell fate signatures opening up the possibility of real-time morphology-based screening. When MuSCs from aged muscle were introduced into the assay, they displayed aberrant proliferative activities, delayed inactivation kinetics, persistence of activation-associated morphologies, and population depletion; quiescence-associated defects that we show are rescued by wortmannin treatment. Thus, the miniaturized assay offers an unprecedented opportunity to systematically investigate long-standing queries in areas such as regulation of adult stem cell pool size and functional heterogeneity within the MuSC population, and to uncover regulators of quiescence in youth and in age.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Vocal communication is tied to interpersonal arousal coupling in caregiver-infant dyads</a></h4>

              
                It has been argued that a necessary condition for the emergence of speech in humans is the ability to vocalize irrespectively of underlying affective states, but when and how this happens during development remains unclear. To examine this, we used wearable microphones and autonomic sensors to collect multimodal naturalistic datasets from 12-month-olds and their caregivers. We observed that, across the day, clusters of vocalisations occur during elevated infant and caregiver arousal. This relationship is stronger in infants than caregivers: caregivers vocalizations show greater decoupling with their own states of arousal, and their vocal production is more influenced by the infant's arousal than their own. Different types of vocalisation elicit different patterns of change across the dyad. Cries occur following reduced infant arousal stability and lead to increased child-caregiver arousal coupling, and decreased infant arousal. Speech-like vocalisations also occur at elevated arousal, but lead to longer-lasting increases in arousal, and elicit more parental verbal responses. Our results suggest that: 12-month-old infants' vocalisations are strongly contingent on their arousal state (for both cries and speech-like vocalisations), whereas adults' vocalisations are more flexibly tied to their own arousal; that cries and speech-like vocalisations alter the intra-dyadic dynamics of arousal in different ways, which may be an important factor driving speech development; and that this selection mechanism which drives vocal development is anchored in our stress physiology.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Shifting the focus of zebrafish toward a model of the tumor microenvironment</a></h4>

              
                Cancer cells exist in a complex ecosystem with numerous other cell types in the tumor microenvironment (TME). The composition of this tumor/TME ecosystem will vary at each anatomic site and affects phenotypes such as initiation, metastasis, and drug resistance. A mechanistic understanding of the large number of cell-cell interactions between tumor and TME requires models that allow us to both characterize as well as genetically perturb this complexity. Zebrafish are a model system optimized for this problem, because of the large number of existing cell-type-specific drivers that can label nearly any cell in the TME. These include stromal cells, immune cells, and tissue resident normal cells. These cell-type-specific promoters/enhancers can be used to drive fluorophores to facilitate imaging and also CRISPR cassettes to facilitate perturbations. A major advantage of the zebrafish is the ease by which large numbers of TME cell types can be studied at once, within the same animal. While these features make the zebrafish well suited to investigate the TME, the model has important limitations, which we also discuss. In this review, we describe the existing toolset for studying the TME using zebrafish models of cancer and highlight unique biological insights that can be gained by leveraging this powerful resource.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Desmosomal connectomics of all somatic muscles in an annelid larva</a></h4>

              
                Cells form networks in animal tissues through synaptic, chemical and adhesive links. Invertebrate muscle cells often connect to other cells through desmosomes, adhesive junctions anchored by intermediate filaments. To study desmosomal networks, we skeletonised 853 muscle cells and their desmosomal partners in volume electron microscopy data covering an entire larva of the annelid <i>Platynereis</i>. Muscle cells adhere to each other, to epithelial, glial, ciliated, and bristle-producing cells and to the basal lamina, forming a desmosomal connectome of over 2,000 cells. The aciculae - chitin rods that form an endoskeleton in the segmental appendages - are highly connected hubs in this network. This agrees with the many degrees of freedom of their movement, as revealed by video microscopy. Mapping motoneuron synapses to the desmosomal connectome allowed us to infer the extent of tissue influenced by motoneurons. Our work shows how cellular-level maps of synaptic and adherent force networks can elucidate body mechanics.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural distinctiveness and discriminability in core network representations support associative unitization</a></h4>

              
                Previous work has suggested unitized pairs behave as a single unit and more critically, are processed neurally different than those of associative memories. The current works examines the neural differences between unitization and associative memory using fMRI and multivoxel analyses. Specifically, we examined the differences across face-occupation pairings as a function of whether the pairing was viewed as a person performing the given job (unitized binding) or a person saying they knew someone who had a particular job (associative binding). The results show that at encoding, the angular gyrus can discriminate between unitized and associative target trials. Additionally, during encoding, the medial temporal lobe (hippocampus and perirhinal cortex), frontal parietal regions (angular gyrus and medial frontal gyrus) and visual regions (middle occipital cortex) exhibit distinct neural patterns to recollected unitized and associative targets. Furthermore, the medial frontal gyrus and middle occipital cortex show greater neural similarity for recollected unitized trials than those of recollected associative trials. We conclude that visually unitized pairs may enhance unitization in older adults due to greater similarity of trials within the same condition during the encoding process.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Walking bumblebees see faster</a></h4>

              
                The behavioral state of an animal has profound effects on neuronal information processing. Locomotion changes the response properties of visual interneurons in the insect brain, but it is still unknown if it also alters the response properties of photoreceptors. Photoreceptor responses become faster at higher temperatures. It has therefore been suggested that thermoregulation in bees and other insects could improve temporal resolution in vision, but direct evidence for this idea has so far been missing. Here we compared electroretinograms (ERGs) from the compound eyes of tethered bumblebees that were either sitting still or were walking on an air supported ball. We found that the visual processing speed strongly increased when the bumblebees were walking. By monitoring the bumblebees' eye temperature during our recordings, we saw that the increase in response speed was in synchrony with a rise of the eye temperature. By artificially heating the bee's head, we show that the walking induced temperature increase of the visual system is sufficient to explain the rise in processing speed. We also show that walking accelerates the visual system to the equivalent of a 14-fold increase in light intensity. We conclude that the walking-induced rise in temperature accelerates the processing of visual information in bumblebees, which is an ideal strategy to process the increased information flow during locomotion.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Switching between external and internal attention in hippocampal networks</a></h4>

              
                Everyday experience requires processing external signals from the world around us and internal information retrieved from memory. To do both, the brain must fluctuate between states that are optimized for external vs. internal attention. Here, we focus on the hippocampus as a region that may serve at the interface between these forms of attention, and ask how it switches between prioritizing sensory signals from the external world vs. internal signals related to memories and thoughts. Pharmacological, computational, and animal studies have identified input from the cholinergic basal forebrain as important for biasing the hippocampus towards processing external information, whereas complementary research has suggested the dorsal attention network (DAN) may aid in allocating attentional resources towards accessing internal information. We therefore tested the hypothesis that the basal forebrain and DAN drive the hippocampus towards external and internal attention, respectively. We used data from 29 human participants (17 female) who completed 2 attention tasks during fMRI. One task primarily required external attention ("explicitly instructed" task); the other required switching between external and internal attention ("memory-guided" task). We discovered that background connectivity between the basal forebrain and hippocampus was stronger during the explicitly instructed vs. memory-guided task. In contrast, DAN-hippocampus background connectivity was stronger during the memory-guided vs. explicitly instructed task. Finally, the strength of DAN-hippocampus connectivity correlated with performance on the memory-guided but not explicitly instructed task. Together, these results provide evidence that the hippocampus may switch between external and internal states by preferentially communicating with the basal forebrain and DAN.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Shared neural codes of recognition memory</a></h4>

              
                Research on recognition memory has identified several electrophysiological indicators of successful memory retrieval, known as old-new effects. These effects have been observed in different sensory domains using various stimulus types, but little attention has been given to their similarity or distinctiveness and the underlying processes they share. Dual process theories of memory retrieval have linked the early mid-frontal effect to familiarity and the late parietal component to recollection. Here, a data-driven approach was taken to investigate the temporal evolution of shared information content between different memory conditions using openly available EEG data from healthy human participants of both sexes, taken from six experiments. A test dataset involving personally highly familiar and unfamiliar faces was used. The results show that neural familiarity signals for face stimuli were highly generalized starting from around 200 ms following stimulus onset. When training was performed on non-face datasets, an early (around 200-300 ms) to late (post-400 ms) differentiation was observed over most regions of interest. Successful cross-classification for non-face stimuli (music and object/scene associations) was most pronounced in late period. Additionally, a striking dissociation was observed between familiar and remembered objects, with shared signals present only in the late window for correctly remembered objects, while cross-classification for familiar objects was successful in the early period as well. These findings suggest that late neural signals of memory retrieval generalize across sensory modalities and stimulus types, and the dissociation between familiar and remembered objects may provide insight into the underlying processes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Metabolism is correlative not causative for age-related auditory decline in an insect model</a></h4>

              
                Aging is due to a complex decline of multiple biological processes. Some of the causes include oxidative damage, mitochondrial and proteostatic dysfunction and DNA damage. This results in deterioration as biological systems age. This age-related decline is well quantified, and experienced, for human hearing and is presumed to be due to a decrease in the ears metabolism; specifically a decrease in ability to maintain an electrochemical gradient, the endocochlear potential. However, direct measurements of metabolism across a lifespan in an auditory system are lacking. Even if metabolism does decrease with age is it a cause of age-related auditory decline or simply correlative? All auditory systems across the animal kingdom share functional principles including ion pumping cells, auditory receptors, spiking auditory nerves and multiple supporting cells. Therefore, we used an insect, the desert locust, Schistocerca gregaria, as a physiologically versatile model to understand how cellular metabolism correlates with age and impacts on age-related auditory decline. We found that although metabolism correlates with age-related auditory decline it is not causative.

                Ample evidence shows that humans violate fundamental economic axioms. Yet, the neural mechanism underlying inconsistent (or irrational) choices remains obscure. Here, we aim to show that inconsistent choices could rise either due to value miscalculations or due to motor errors during task execution. We report the results from two independent behavioral and neuroimaging studies. Subjects completed a risky-choice task to test their inconsistency levels, followed by two novel tasks, designed to solely examine motor output. We recorded mouse trajectories during task execution and designed 34 features to analyze choice dynamics. We show that choice dynamics predict inconsistency levels, even when motor output was absent any valuation elements. In the neuroimaging study, we show that inconsistency is tied to noisy value computations in reward circuits, but at the same time, is also related to noisy neural motor dynamics. These findings suggest that (at least) two neural sources of noise contribute to inconsistent choice behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Quantitative modeling of the emergence of macroscopic grid-like representations</a></h4>

              
                Grid cells are neurons in the entorhinal cortex that play a key role in spatial navigation. When subjects navigate through spatial environments, grid cells exhibit firing fields that are arranged in a triangular grid pattern. As direct recordings of grid cells from the human brain are only rarely possible, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies proposed and described an indirect measure of entorhinal grid-cell activity, which is quantified as a hexadirectional modulation of fMRI activity as a function of the subject's movement direction. However, it still remains unclear how the activity of single grid cells is related to the sum activity of a population of grid cells, which may exhibit hexadirectional modulation and thus provide the basis for the hexadirectional modulation of entorhinal cortex activity measured with fMRI. Here, we thus performed numerical simulations and analytical calculations to better understand how the aggregated activity of many grid cells may be hexadirectionally modulated. Our simulations implemented three different hypotheses proposing that the hexadirectional modulation occurs because grid cells show head-direction tuning aligned with the grid axes; are subjected to repetition suppression; or exhibit a bias towards a particular grid phase offset. Our simulations demonstrate that all three hypotheses can, in principle, lead to a hexadirectional modulation of sum grid-cell activity. However, the magnitude of the hexadirectional modulation appears to depend considerably on the subject's navigation pattern and the exact biological properties of grid cells. Our results thus indicate that future fMRI studies could be designed to test which of the three hypotheses most likely accounts for the fMRI measure of grid cells. These findings also underline the importance of quantifying the biological properties of single grid cells in humans to further elucidate how hexadirectional modulations of fMRI activity may emerge.

                After a Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), the neural network activates a reparative response seeking to restore homeostasis. Astrocyte reactivation is an essential component of this response. The injury creates a temporal microenvironment where neurogenic signaling molecules regulate cell fate decisions of neocortical neural progenitors. Likewise, astrocyte reactivation triggers a transcriptional-proliferative program where neurogenic signaling molecules play crucial roles. However, precise molecular mechanisms are context-specific and are not fully understood. Here we studied cellular and molecular aspects of reactive astrocytes response after Notch-Wnt neurogenic signaling modulation. Our results provide new evidence of cortical Notch-Wnt signaling activation after TBI. Reactive astrocytes in the core of Notch signaling showed a differential aggregated distribution. In vitro, Notch inhibition promoted a neural precursor profile and might increase the number of cells committed in a proliferative response. Finally, we found an indirect co-regulation of Wnt-Shh signaling in BHLH-Notch target genes and a Notch-supportive effect in Wnt-Shh signaling activation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The hippocampus binds movements to their temporal position in a motor sequence</a></h4>

              
                A plethora of daily motor tasks consist of sequences of movements or steps that need to be performed in a specific order. Yet, it remains unclear how the brain represents sequential motor actions in a way that preserves their temporal order. Here, we used multivoxel pattern similarity analysis of functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data acquired during motor sequence practice to investigate whether the hippocampus, a brain region known to support temporal order in the non-motor memory domain, represents information about the temporal order of sequential motor actions. We also examined such representation in other regions of the motor network (i.e., the premotor cortex (PMC), supplementary motor area (SMA), anterior superior parietal lobule (aSPL) and striatum) known for their critical role in motor sequence learning. Our results show that hippocampal activation patterns carried information about movements in their learned temporal position in the sequence, but not about movements or positions in random movement patterns. A similar pattern of results was observed in the striatum. Our data also indicate that multivoxel patterns in M1, SMA and aSPL carried movement-based information while the PMC represented both movement- and position-based information. Altogether, our findings provide novel insight into the role of the hippocampus in the motor memory domain and point to its capacity to bind movements to their temporal position in a motor sequence. Our results also deepen our understanding of how striatal and cortical regions contribute to motor sequence learning via position and movement coding.

                pH-sensitive fluorescent proteins are widely used to study synaptic vesicle (SV) fusion and recycling. When targeted to the lumen of SVs, fluorescence of these proteins is quenched by the acidic pH. Following SV fusion, they are exposed to extracellular neutral pH, resulting in a fluorescence increase. SV fusion, recycling and acidification can thus be tracked by tagging integral SV proteins with pHsensitive proteins. Neurotransmission is generally stimulated by electrophysiology, which is not feasible in small, intact animals, thus limiting the approach to cell culture regimes. Previous in vivo approaches depended on distinct (sensory) stimuli, thus limiting the addressable neuron types. To overcome these limitations, we established an all-optical approach to stimulate and visualize SV fusion and recycling. We combined distinct pH-sensitive fluorescent proteins (inserted into the SV protein synaptogyrin) and light-gated channelrhodopsins (ChRs) for optical stimulation, overcoming optical crosstalk and thus enabling an all-optical approach. We generated two different variants of the pHsensitive optogenetic reporter of vesicle recycling (pOpsicle) and tested them in cholinergic neurons of intact Caenorhabditis elegans nematodes. First, we combined the red fluorescent protein pHuji with the blue-light gated ChR2(H134R), and second, the green fluorescent pHluorin combined with the novel red-shifted ChR ChrimsonSA. In both cases, fluorescence increases were observed after optical stimulation. Increase and subsequent decline of fluorescence was affected by mutations of proteins involved in SV fusion and endocytosis. These results establish pOpsicle as a non-invasive, all-optical approach to investigate different steps of the SV cycle.

                The study of brain dynamics under normal or pathological conditions has proven to be a difficult task, there is no unified consensus on how it should be studied. In this article we present a methodology based on Transfer Entropy to characterize the information flow between different brain hemispheres in eyes-open (EO) and eyes-closed (EC) resting states in healthy subjects, with an experimental setup that resembles the technical conditions found in a clinical setting. We have estimated the Transfer Entropy between the Hilbert phases of bandpass filtered EEG channels. We have designed a methodology to analyze the interhemispheric and intrahemispheric information flow in both conditions. Our results suggest an increased information transfer in the EC condition for the alpha, beta1 and beta2 frequency bands. Furthermore, we do not observe a preferred direction of interhemispheric information movement in both conditions. In conclusion, there is evidence of a significant difference in the brain's information transfer dynamics between EO and EC resting states.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural, physiological and behavioral correlates of empathy for pain in Tourette syndrome</a></h4>

              
                Persons with Tourette syndrome (TS) show altered social behaviors, such as echophenomena and increased personal distress in emotional situations. These symptoms may reflect an overactive mirror neuron system (MNS), causing both increased automatic imitation and a stronger tendency to share others' emotions. To test this, we measured the individual level of echophenomena with a video protocol and experimentally induced empathy for pain in 25 participants with TS and 25 matched controls. In the empathy for pain paradigm, pictures of hands and feet in painful or neutral situations were presented, while we measured participants' EEG and skin conductance response (SCR). Changes in somatosensory mu suppression during the observation of the pictures, as well as pain ratings and SCR were compared between groups and correlated with the occurrence of echophenomena, self-reported empathy and clinical measures. Our TS sample showed significantly more echophenomena than controls, but the groups showed no behavioral differences in empathic abilities. However, controls, but not patients with TS, showed the predicted increased mu suppression when watching painful compared to neutral actions. While echophenomena were present in all persons with TS, the hypothesis of an overactive MNS in TS could not be substantiated. On the contrary, the TS group showed a noticeable lack of mu attenuation in response to pain stimuli, questioning the normal functioning of the MNS in empathy for pain situations. In conclusion, the MNS remains an important area of study for TS, but overactivity of the system could not explain echophenomena and social symptoms of TS.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Meningioma microstructure assessed by diffusion MRI: an investigation of the source of mean diffusivity and fractional anisotropy by quantitative histology</a></h4>

              
                Background: Mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA) obtained with diffusion MRI (dMRI) have been associated with cell density and tissue anisotropy across tumors, but it is unknown whether these associations persist at the microscopic level. Purpose: To quantify the degree to which cell density (CD) and structure anisotropy (SA), as determined from histology, account for the intra-tumor variability of MD and FA in meningioma tumors. Furthermore, to clarify whether histological features other than cell density account for additional intra-tumor variability of MD. Materials and Methods: We performed ex-vivo dMRI at 200 m isotropic resolution and histological imaging on 16 excised meningioma tumor samples. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was used to map MD and FA, as well as the in-plane FA (FAIP). Histology images were analyzed in terms of cell nuclei density and structure anisotropy (obtained from structure tensor analysis) and were used separately in a regression analysis to predict MD and FAIP, respectively. A convolutional neural network (CNN) was also trained to predict the dMRI maps from histology patches. The association between MRI and histology was analyzed in terms of coefficient of determination (R2). Regions showing unexplained variance (large residuals) were analyzed to identify features apart from cell density and structure anisotropy that could influence MD and FAIP. Results: Cell density assessed by histology poorly explained intra-tumor variability at the mesoscopic level (200 m) in MD (median R2 = 0.06, interquartile range 0.01 - 0.29) or FAIP (median R2 = 0.19, 0.09 - 0.29). Samples with low R2 for FAIP exhibited low variations throughout the samples and thus low explainable variability, however, this was not the case for MD. Across tumors, cell density and structure anisotropy were associated with MD (R2 = 0.58) and FAIP (R2 = 0.82), respectively. In 37% of the samples (6 out of 16), cell density did not explain intra-tumor variability of MD when compared to the degree explained by the CNN. Tumor vascularization, psammoma bodies, microcysts, and tissue cohesivity were associated with bias in MD prediction when solely CD was considered. Our results support that FAIP is high in the presence of elongated and aligned cell structures, but low otherwise. Conclusion: Cell density and structure anisotropy account for variability in MD and FAIP across tumors but cell density does not explain MD variations within the tumor, which means that low or high values of MD locally may not always reflect high or low tumor cell density. Features beyond cell density need to be considered when interpreting MD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Automated segmentation of fetal intracranial volume in 3D ultrasound using deep learning: identifying sex differences in prenatal brain development</a></h4>

              
                The human brain undergoes major developmental changes during pregnancy. Three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound images allow for the opportunity to investigate typical prenatal brain development on a large scale. Here, we developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) model for automated segmentation of fetal intracranial volume (ICV) from 3D ultrasound, and we applied the trained model in a large independent sample (N = 9795 ultrasounds; N=1763 participants) from the YOUth Baby and Child cohort measured at 20- and 30-week of gestational age to investigate sex differences in fetal ICV and ICV growth. 168 3D ultrasound images with ICV annotations were included to develop a 3D CNN model for automated fetal ICV segmentation. A data augmentation strategy provided physical variation and additional data to train the network. K-fold cross-validation and Bayesian optimization were used for network selection and the ensemble-based system combined multiple networks to form the final ensemble network. The final ensemble network produced consistent and high-quality segmentations of ICV. Our trained model successfully predicted ICV and ICV growth in a large independent longitudinal data set. Boys had significantly larger ICV at 20- (B=2.83; p=1.4e-13) and 30-weeks of pregnancy (B=12.01; p=2.0e-28), and more pronounced ICV growth than girls (t=-4.395; p=1.3e-5). Our approach provides us with the opportunity to investigate fetal brain development on a much larger scale and to answer fundamental questions related to prenatal brain development.

                A wealth of correlational evidence suggests that Broca's area (the left inferior frontal gyrus) plays a role in second language acquisition. With the use of highly focal non-invasive brain stimulation, evidence for a targeted brain region's causal role in some cognitive behavior can be assessed. Over three sessions, each one week apart, we used online anodal high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) over Broca's area during a novel foreign grammar training session. During training, participants who were naive to Spanish were tasked with acquiring present tense conjugation rules for the three Spanish verb endings. In Session 1, we observed significant improvement in performance in two linguistic (reception and production) tasks but not in a non-linguistic (working memory) task. Sessions 2 and 3 were subject to a ceiling effect, which obscured any potentially long-lasting effects of the stimulation. We interpret these results as support for the idea that Broca's area has languagelike specificity that is not limited to receptive or productive processes and as evidence that Broca's area plays a causal role in foreign grammar acquisition.

                Previous research has focused on the role of the extrastriate body area (EBA) in categoryspecific body representation, but the specific features that are represented in this area are not well understood. This study used ultra-high field fMRI and banded ridge regression to investigate the coding of body images by comparing the performance of three encoding models in predicting brain activity in ventral visual cortex and specifically the EBA. Our results suggest that EBA represents body stimuli based on a combination of low-level visual features and postural features.

                Neural decoding is a powerful method to analyze neural activity. However, the code needed to run a decoding analysis can be complex, which can present a barrier to using the method. In this paper we introduce a package that makes it easy to perform decoding analyses in the R programing language. We describe how the package is designed in a modular fashion which allows researchers to easily implement a range of different analyses. We also discuss how to format data to be able to use the package, and we give two examples of how to use the package to analyze real data. We believe that this package, combined with the rich data analysis ecosystem in R, will make it significantly easier for researchers to create reproducible decoding analyses, which should help increase the pace of neuroscience discoveries.

                As we move toward population-level developmental neuroscience, understanding intra- and interindividual variability in brain maturation and sources of neurodevelopmental heterogeneity becomes paramount. Large-scale, longitudinal neuroimaging studies have uncovered group-level neurodevelopmental trajectories, and while recent work has begun to untangle intra- and interindividual differences, they remain largely unclear. Here, we aim to quantify both intra- and inter-individual variability across facets of neurodevelopment from late childhood to early adolescence in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study, and examine the contributions of age, sex, puberty, sociodemographic factors, and MRI scanner manufacturer to inter-individual variability. Our results provide novel insight into differences in microstructure development between cortical and subcortical gray matter. We found that an individual's starting point is related to how their brain changes, across all brain outcomes. Although both sex and pubertal status contributed to inter-individual variability, we found limited support for hypotheses regarding greater male-than-female variability and increases in inter-individual variability throughout puberty. Finally, we uncovered enmeshed contributions of sociodemographics and MRI scanner manufacturers to inter-individual variability in this dataset, due in part to sociodemographic differences in participants scanned on Siemens, GE, and Philips MRIs. This work highlights pockets of individual variability for future investigation, describes a promising approach for quantifying deviations from normative development, and urges caution in covariate choice for investigators using ABCD Study data.

                Clinical and neuroscientific studies suggest a link between psychological stress and reduced brain health - in healthy humans and patients with neurological disorders. However, it is unclear which neural pathways mediate between stress and brain health and whether these pathways are similar in health and disease. Here, we applied an Arterial-Spin-Labeling MRI stress task in 42 healthy persons and 56 with multiple sclerosis. We tested whether brain-predicted age differences ("brain-PAD"), a highly sensitive structural brain health biomarker derived from machine learning, mirror functional connectivity between stress-responsive regions. We found that regional neural stress responsivity did not differ between groups. Although elevated brain-PAD indicated worse brain health in patients, anterior insula-occipital functional connectivity correlated with brain-PAD in both groups. Grey matter variations contributed similarly to brain-PAD in both groups. These findings suggest a generic connection between stress and brain health whose impact is amplified in multiple sclerosis by disease-specific vulnerability factors.

In this study, we plan to clarify the convergence and divergence of spontaneous brain activity across humans and marmosets. We investigated the spontaneous brain dynamics of marmosets, and compared its convergence and divergence with human neuroimaging results. We identified seven representative FC patterns (FC states) in the resting-state activity of marmosets. The most prevalent two FC patterns (VC1 and VC2) corresponds to a state of BOLD coherence of primary visual and auditory processing regions. Our results suggested that the spontaneous activity does reflect the inherent properties of the brain of marmosets.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Off the shelf: Investigating transfer of learning using commercially available virtual reality equipment</a></h4>

              
                The evolution of virtual reality (VR) has created the opportunity for a relatively low-cost and accessible method to practice motor skills. Previous studies have demonstrated how motor skill practice in non-immersive virtual environments transfers to physical environments. Though minimal research has investigated motor learning and transfer within immersive VR, multiple experiments provide empirical evidence of positive transfer effects. To enhance the similarities between virtual and physical environments, most studies have used software engines and modified hardware. However, many learners and practitioners are currently using commercially available VR with the goal of enhancing real-world performance, though there is very little evidence to support the notion of positive transfer for these systems. Therefore, the purpose of this experiment was to investigate how motor skill practice using a commercially available VR system improved real-world performance and how that compared to physical practice. Participants (n = 68) were randomly selected into one of two groups: virtual reality (VR) practice (n = 33) or real-world (RW) practice (n = 35). The experiment took place over two consecutive days with a pretest, posttest, and practice phase occurring on both days. The pre- and post- testing phases were identical for both groups and consisted of putting a golf ball 10 times on a carpeted surface towards the center of a target. The practice phases consisted of 60 total putts per day in the respective environment (VR or RW). Participants continuously alternated golf putting holes from three different distances until they accrued 60 total putts. Participants in the RW group performed golf putts to three targets. Participants in the VR group also performed golf putts on three different miniature golf putting holes, using the commercially available Oculus Rift and the Cloudlands VR Minigolf game. The VR putting targets were designed to replicate the putting holes in the physical environment. Separate 2 (condition) x 4 (test phase) repeated measures ANOVAs were used to assess accuracy and club head kinematics. The results revealed a significant main effect for test phase, but not for condition. Post hoc analyses revealed both groups significantly improved their putting accuracy and club head kinematics at similar rates. The results from this study indicate that the transfer of learning that occurred from the commercially available VR practice was equally effective when compared to RW practice.

                Grouping sets of sounds into relevant categories is an important cognitive ability that facilitates the association of stimuli with appropriate goal-directed behavioral responses. In perceptual tasks, a prominent role of primary auditory cortex (A1) is to multiplex the encoding of sound sensory features and task variables. Here we investigated the involvement of A1 in initiating sound categorization. We trained ferrets to discriminate click trains of different rates in a Go/No-Go delayed categorization task and recorded neural activity during both active behavior and passive exposure to the same sounds. Purely categorical response components were extracted and analyzed separately from sensory responses to reveal their contributions to the overall population response throughout the trials. We found that population-level representation of Go/No-Go behavioral categories emerged during sound presentation and was present in both active behavioral and passive states. However, upon task engagement, categorical responses to the No-Go category became suppressed, leading to an asymmetrical representation of the Go stimuli relative to the No-Go sounds and prestimulus baseline. At stimulus offset, the population code changed abruptly but categorical representation was maintained during the delay period. Categorical responses extracted from the stimulus period correlated with the ones found in the delay epoch, suggesting an early contribution of A1 to stimulus categorization.

                The role of reactive astrocytes in perinatal white matter injury (WMI) is unclear. In a mouse model of WMI, we provide evidence that impairing the formation of a C3-expressing neuroinflammatory reactive astrocyte sub-state rescues myelination and behavioral deficits. We further demonstrate the presence of C3-expressing reactive astrocytes in human WMI. Our data point to these cells as putative drivers of myelination failure in WMI and a potentially promising therapeutic target.

                The complex symbiotic relationship between the mammalian body and gut microbiome plays a critical role in the health outcomes of offspring later in life. The gut microbiome modulates virtually all physiological functions through direct or indirect interactions to maintain physiological homeostasis. Previous studies indicate a link between maternal/early-life gut microbiome, brain development, and behavioral outcomes relating to social cognition. Here we present direct evidence of the role of the gut microbiome in brain development. Through magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), we investigated the impact of the gut microbiome on brain organization and structure using germ-free (GF) mice and conventionalized mice, with the gut microbiome reintroduced after weaning. We found broad changes in brain volume in GF mice that persist despite the reintroduction of gut microbes at weaning. These data suggest a direct link between the maternal gut or early-postnatal microbe and their impact on brain developmental programming.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">MTL neurons phase-lock to human hippocampal theta</a></h4>

              
                Memory formation depends on neural activity across a network of regions, including the hippocampus and broader medial temporal lobe (MTL). Interactions between these regions have been studied indirectly using functional MRI, but the bases for inter-regional communication at a cellular level remain poorly understood. Here we evaluate the hypothesis that oscillatory currents in the hippocampus synchronize the firing of neurons both within and outside the hippocampus. We recorded extracellular spikes from 1,854 single- and multi-units simultaneously with hippocampal local field potentials (LFPs) in 28 neurosurgical patients who completed virtual navigation experiments. A majority of hippocampal neurons phase-locked to oscillations in the slow (2-4Hz) or fast (6-10Hz) theta bands, with a significant subset exhibiting nested slow theta x beta frequency (13-20Hz) phase-locking. Outside of the hippocampus, phase-locking to hippocampal oscillations occurred only at theta frequencies and primarily among neurons in the entorhinal cortex and amygdala. Extrahippocampal neurons phase-locked to hippocampal theta even when theta did not appear locally. These results indicate that spike-time synchronization with hippocampal theta is a defining feature of neuronal activity in the hippocampus and structurally-connected MTL regions. Theta phase-locking could mediate flexible communication with the hippocampus to influence the content and quality of memories.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis on the Transcriptomic Signatures in Alcohol Use Disorder- a Translational Approach</a></h4>

              
                Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) is a complex mental disease with a large treatment need. However, the clinically available therapeutic approaches are limited and thus new treatment targets are warranted. One approach to discover new treatment targets is transcriptomic profiling of key brain regions of the addiction neurocircuitry in animal models of AUD and/or in post-mortem brain tissue from deceased AUD patients. Unfortunately, those studies suffer from large heterogeneity and low sample sizes. Here we used a cross-species meta-analysis that integrates the entire literature on this topic to make more robust conclusions on transcriptomic changes in AUD. Here, we report on differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in 108 rat brain and 380 human brain samples, respectively in one of the key regions of AUD- the prefrontal cortex. We found 50 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in rat brain, which were mainly associated with pro-oncogenic molecules, signal transduction as well as oxidative stress and inflammation. When we compared these findings with the meta-analytic results in human post-mortem PFC, we found that across species Hsd11b1 is significantly down-regulated. This finding is also confirmed by our cross-species data integrational approach. In summary, our data suggests that down-regulation of Hsd11b1 enzyme and stress-related pathways is a conserved mechanism for the alcohol dependent phenotype across different species, which might explain increased cortisol levels in AUD and therefore serves as a new treatment target.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Applying Unet for extraction of vascular metrics from T1-weighted and T2-weighted MRI</a></h4>

              
                We apply deep learning to the problem of segmenting the arterial system from T1w and T2w images. We use the freely available 7-Tesla 'forrest' dataset from OpenNeuro, (which contains TOF, T1w, and T2w) and use supervised learning with T1w or T2w as input, and TOF segmentation as ground truth, to train a Unet architecture capable of segmenting arteries and quantifying arterial diameters from T1w or T2w images alone. We demonstrate arterial segmentations from both T1w and T2w images, and show that T2w images have sufficient vessel contrast to estimate arterial diameters comparable to those estimated from TOF. We then apply our Unet to T2w images from a separate dataset (IXI) and show our model generalizes to images acquired at different field strength. We consider this work proof-of concept that arterial segmentations can be derived from MRI sequences with poor contrast between arteries and surrounding tissue (T1w and T2w), due to the ability of deep convolutional networks to extract complex features based on local image intensity. Future work will focus on improving the generalizability of the network to non forrest datasets, with the eventual goal of leveraging the entire pre-existing corpus of neuroimaging data for study of human cerebrovasculature.

                Heterozygous mutation of Ambra1, known as a positive autophagy regulator, produces autism-like behavior in mice and autistic phenotypes in humans in a female-specific manner. However, the substantial roles of the Ambra1 mutation in neurons are still unknown. We find that Ambra1 heterozygotes display a moderate decrease in excitatory synaptic release in-vitro and ex-vivo exclusively in females without autophagy activity, resulting in significant alterations in {gamma}-oscillation power and seizure susceptibility by excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) imbalance. Specifically, Ambra1 deficiency has no effect on neurogenesis and morphogenesis, but selectively decreases excitatory synaptic activity without changes in synapse number, quantal size, synaptic release probability, and synaptic plasticity. Therefore, the limited excitatory synaptopathy by Ambra1 expression levels ultimately determines E/I imbalance in global neural networks leading to the female-specific ASD.

                In the early visual system, corticothalamic feedback projections greatly outnumber thalamocortical feedforward projections. Extensive experimental and modeling work has been devoted to the functional impact of the feedforward pathway, but the role of its denser feedback counterpart remains elusive. Here, we propose a novel unifying framework where thalamic recurrent interactions and corticothalamic feedback act in a closed-loop fashion to attune multiple stimulus representations. At each position of the visual field, the loop puts into competition local representations of the stimulus in thalamus and cortex through direct excitation of narrow topologically-aligned portions of the thalamus, accompanied with peri-geniculate nucleus mediated broad inhibition suppressing the topological surround. We built a detailed conductance-based spiking model incorporating retinal input, lateral geniculate nucleus, peri-geniculate nucleus, primary visual cortex, and all the relevant intra-areal and feedback pathways. For the first time we perform comparative analyses between model configurations with completely or locally inactivated cortico-thalamic feedback, as in the experimental preparations. The model mechanistically explains (i) the existence of intra-thalamic surround suppression, (ii) the sensitivity of thalamic neurons to orientation tuning, (iii) the cortex-dependent center-surround opponency in thalamic cells, (iv) the cortical increase of size and orientation selectivity, (v) the cortically enhanced competition between cross-oriented domains within the hypercolumn, and (vi) the selective suppression of cortical functional connectivity. Our results integrate decades of experimental and theoretical research, supporting the hypothesis that cortico-thalamic loop exerts competitive influence between neighboring regions in the thalamus and cortex, complementing the lateral intra-V1 interactions in center-surround contextual modulation.

	<p>We developed and evaluated an interpersonal model of depression in employees, where passion and perseverance affect occupational stress and perceived control, which in turn affect risk of depression. The participants were employees of 18 private companies and local government organizations in Korea aged 19 to 65 years. A total of 11,422 participants completed questionnaires including the Korean version of the Grit scale, the occupational stress scale, the perceived control subscale in the perceived stress scale, and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. Mediation analysis was performed to determine relationships among trait-level passion and perseverance, work-related stress, perceived control, and depression. Passion and perseverance preceded depression in employees. Higher occupational stress and lower perceived control mediated the association between passion and depression, and between perseverance and depression. Passion and perseverance exert preventive effects on depression by decreasing workplace stress and elevating perceived control. Future studies should investigate the effects of psychological characteristics on the development of depression in employees.</p>

	<p>Resting-state fMRIs (rs-fMRIs) have been widely used for investigation of diverse brain functions, including brain cognition. The rs-fMRI has easily elucidated rs-fMRI metrics, such as the fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF), regional homogeneity (ReHo), voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity (VMHC), and degree centrality (DC). To increase the applicability of these metrics, higher reliability is required by reducing confounders that are not related to the functional connectivity signal. Many previous studies already demonstrated the effects of physiological artifact removal from rs-fMRI data, but few have evaluated the effect on rs-fMRI metrics. In this study, we examined the effect of physiological noise correction on the most common rs-fMRI metrics. We calculated the intraclass correlation coefficient of repeated measurements on parcellated brain areas by applying physiological noise correction based on the RETROICOR method. Then, we evaluated the correction effect for five rs-fMRI metrics for the whole brain: FC, fALFF, ReHo, VMHC, and DC. The correction effect depended not only on the brain region, but also on the metric. Among the five metrics, the reliability in terms of the mean value of all ROIs was significantly improved for FC, but it deteriorated for fALFF, with no significant differences for ReHo, VMHC, and DC. Therefore, the decision on whether to perform the physiological correction should be based on the type of metric used.</p>

	<p>Dysfunction of the lenticular nucleus is thought to contribute to neurological symptoms in Wilson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (WD). However, very little is known about whether and how the lenticular nucleus influences dystonia by interacting with the cerebral cortex and cerebellum. To solve this problem, we recruited 37 WD patients (20 men; age, 23.95 &amp;amp;plusmn; 6.95 years; age range, 12&amp;amp;ndash;37 years) and 37 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HCs) (25 men; age, 25.19 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1.88 years; age range, 20&amp;amp;ndash;30 years), and each subject underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI) scans. The muscle biomechanical parameters and Unified Wilson Disease Rating Scale (UWDRS) were used to evaluate the level of dystonia and clinical representations, respectively. The lenticular nucleus, including the putamen and globus pallidus, was divided into 12 subregions according to dorsal, ventral, anterior and posterior localization and seed-based functional connectivity (FC) was calculated for each subregion. The relationships between FC changes in the lenticular nucleus with muscle tension levels and clinical representations were further investigated by correlation analysis. Dystonia was diagnosed by comparing all WD muscle biomechanical parameters with healthy controls (HCs). Compared with HCs, FC decreased from all subregions in the putamen except the right ventral posterior part to the middle cingulate cortex (MCC) and decreased FC of all subregions in the putamen except the left ventral anterior part to the cerebellum was observed in patients with WD. Patients with WD also showed decreased FC of the left globus pallidus primarily distributed in the MCC and cerebellum and illustrated decreased FC from the right globus pallidus to the cerebellum. FC from the putamen to the MCC was significantly correlated with psychiatric symptoms. FC from the putamen to the cerebellum was significantly correlated with muscle tension and neurological symptoms. Additionally, the FC from the globus pallidus to the cerebellum was also associated with muscle tension. Together, these findings highlight that lenticular nucleus&amp;amp;ndash;cerebellum circuits may serve as neural biomarkers of dystonia and provide implications for the neural mechanisms underlying dystonia in WD.</p>

	<p>The relationship between brain areal activity and the entire brain&amp;amp;rsquo;s activity is unknown, and understanding this relationship is imperative for understanding the neural mechanisms of human brain function at systems level. The complex activity of human brains varies from area to area and from time to time across the whole brain. BOLD-fMRI measures this spatiotemporal activity at a large-scale systems level. The BOLD time signal of an area reflects a collective neuronal activity of over one million neurons under that area, and the temporal correlation of this time signal with that of every point in the brain yields a full spatial map that characterizes the entire brain&amp;amp;rsquo;s functional co-activity (FC) relative to that area&amp;amp;rsquo;s activity. Here we show a quantitative relationship between brain areal activity and the activity of the entire brain. The temporal correlation coefficient r of the signal time courses of two areas quantifies the degree of co-activity between the two areas, and the spatial correlation coefficient R of their corresponding two FC maps quantifies the co-activity between these two maps. We found that a modified sigmoid function quantified this R with r, i.e., Rr=1+ra&amp;amp;minus;1&amp;amp;minus;ra1+ra+1&amp;amp;minus;ra, revealing a relationship between the activity of brain areas and that of the entire brain. The parameter a in this equation was found to be associated with the mean degree of the temporal co-activity among all brain areas, and its value was brain functional state dependent too. Our study demonstrated a novel approach for analyzing fMRI data to holistically characterize the entire brain&amp;amp;rsquo;s activity quantitatively for any brain functional state in individual humans.</p>
