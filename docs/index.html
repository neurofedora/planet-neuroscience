	<p>The paper presents a study on the changes in cognitive functioning in patients undergoing chemotherapy with diagnosed multiple myeloma (MM). The aim of the study was to answer the following two main research questions: Does the treatment stage differentiate the functioning of cognitive processes in patients with diagnosed MM and to what extent? Is it possible to treat biological factors (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-10, and BDNF) as predictors of patients’ cognitive functioning? The patients were examined twice, before the treatment and after 4–6 cycles of chemotherapy. Selected neuropsychological research methods as well as experimental and clinical trials were employed to diagnose the patients’ general cognitive state, attention, memory, and executive functions. The level of biological factors was assessed with the ELISA test. The results show that the patients’ cognitive functioning was worse before the treatment than during the cytostatic therapy. It was also possible to predict the cognitive state of patients suffering from multiple myeloma based on a selected biological parameter (neurotrophin BDNF).</p>

                Background: The prevention of Clostridium tetani bacterial infection through the administration of the tetanus toxoid (TT) vaccine in women is important. The purpose of this study was to determine the regional disparities and factors associated with TT vaccine coverage in women aged 15–49 years in Indonesia. Methods: The Indonesian Demographic Health Survey (IDHS) 2017 data was used in this study. A total of 36,028 women, aged 15–49 years were recruited using the two-stage stratified cluster sampling technique. The questionnaire used was based on the DHS Questionnaire Phase 7. Chi-squared and binary logistic regression were used in this study as part of the analysis. Results: We found that the TT vaccine coverage was 75.32% and that the majority were spread across several provinces. The provinces of Bali and Nusa Tenggara, the richer respondents, living in a rural area, visiting the health facility, having health insurance, and those currently working were factors making it more likely that the women would receive the TT vaccine. The respondents aged 15–24 years with a primary education level and the respondents who were divorced were less likely to receive the TT vaccine. Conclusion: The coverage of the TT vaccine among women can be increased by considering the regional disparities in Indonesia and the socio-economic demographic details of the respondents. Strengthening the policies from the central government in the local governments can improve the screening process and vaccine delivery outcomes. In addition, the importance of giving the TT vaccine to women needs to be relayed through health education in collaboration between health workers and the public.

                Background: Driving-induced lower back pain (DLBP) is associated with long driving times and awkward postures. Nonetheless, its actual causes and solutions remain unclear due to intervening causes from activities of daily living and traumatic injuries. This study investigated the causes and recommendations for DLBP using the theory of inventive problem solving (TRIZ). Methods: A cause-and-effect chain analysis (CECA) was conducted based on discussions with 19 ergonomics experts from Malaysia. Engineering contradictions were formulated according to the causes and associated with the parameters of the TRIZ system. These parameters were then intersected in the contradiction matrix to extract the inventive principles. Finally, recommendations were made based on these principles. Results: CECA uncovered the design- and posture-related causes of DLBP. It was implied that missing seat adjustment controls might cause drivers to sit with their knees positioned higher than their hips. This issue causes an excessive posterior pelvic tilt, resulting in DLBP. To address this issue, an inert atmosphere involving the addition of inflatable bubble wraps to elevate the posterior position was recommended. Conclusion: While there have been studies on DLBP, the present study demonstrated originality by using TRIZ to preliminarily but systematically investigate and resolve DLBP. Further triangulations, prototyping, experimentations, and verifications were not possible due to time and budgetary constraints. Nevertheless, this research uncovered the TRIZ-integrated perspectives on ergonomic solutions to DLBP that are more cost-effective than medical treatments or design overhauls.

                Genome biology shows substantial progress in its analytical and computational part in the last decades. Differential gene expression is one of many computationally intense areas; it is largely developed under R programming language. Here we explain possible reasons for such dominance of R in gene expression data. Next, we discuss the prospects for Python to become competitive in this area of research in coming years. We indicate that Python can be used already in a field of a single cell differential gene expression. We pinpoint still missing parts in Python and possibilities for improvement.

                Background: Accurate viral load (VL) determination is paramount to determine the efficacy of anti-HIV-1 therapy. The conventional method used, fit-point (FP), assumes an equal efficiency in the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) among samples that might not hold for low-input templates. An alternative approach, maxRatio, was introduced to compensate for inhibition in PCR. Methods: Herein, we assessed whether maxRatio could improve VL quantification using 2,544 QIAgen artus HI virus-1 RT-PCR reactions. The assay’s standard dilutions were used to build external standard curves with either FP or maxRatio that re-calculated the VLs. Results: FP and maxRatio were highly comparable (Pearson’s ρ=0.994, Cohen’s  κ=0.885), and the combination of the two methods identified samples (n=41) with aberrant amplification profiles. Conclusions: The combination of maxRatio and FP could improve the predictive value of the assay.

                Background: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a hematopoietic malignancy characterized by genetic and epigenetic aberrations that alter the differentiation capacity of myeloid progenitor cells. The transcription factor CEBPα is frequently mutated in AML patients leading to an increase in DNA methylation in many genomic locations. Previously, it has been shown that ecCEBPα (extra coding CEBPα) - a lncRNA transcribed in the same direction as CEBPα gene - regulates DNA methylation of CEBPα promoter in cis. Here, we hypothesize that ecCEBPα could participate in the regulation of DNA methylation in trans. Method: First, we retrieved the methylation profile of AML patients with mutated CEBPα locus from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We then predicted the ecCEBPα secondary structure in order to check the potential of ecCEBPα to form triplexes around CpG loci and checked if triplex formation influenced CpG methylation, genome-wide. Results: Using DNA methylation profiles of AML patients with a mutated CEBPα locus, we show that ecCEBPα could interact with DNA by forming DNA:RNA triple helices and protect regions near its binding sites from global DNA methylation. Further analysis revealed that triplex-forming oligonucleotides in ecCEBPα are structurally unpaired supporting the DNA-binding potential of these regions. ecCEBPα triplexes supported with the RNA-chromatin co-localization data are located in the promoters of leukemia-linked transcriptional factors such as MLF2. Discussion: Overall, these results suggest a novel regulatory mechanism for ecCEBPα as a genome-wide epigenetic modulator through triple-helix formation which may provide a foundation for sequence-specific engineering of RNA for regulating methylation of specific genes.

                Introduction: Fungal rhinosinusitis (FRS) remains a rare disease. The noninvasive forms are hard to diagnose. The management protocols remain controversial. We aim to describe the clinical, radiological and pathological features of noninvasive FRS and present our management protocol and follow-up results. Patients and methods: This descriptive study was conducted in the ear-nose-throat department of the university hospital, Taher Sfar in Mahdia, Tunisia. All patients who responded to the definition of noninvasive FRS (fungal balls and allergic fungal sinusitis) were included. The study was conducted over a three year period (May 2017 – April 2021). Results: Eleven patients were included in this study: four cases of fungal balls and seven cases of allergic fungal sinusitis. Patients presented with symptoms of chronic recurrent rhinosinusitis with no response to conventional treatments. Computed tomodensitometry scan showed opacification of the paranasal sinuses in all patients. Other signs were heterogeneous opacities, local calcifications and thinning of the bony walls of the sinuses. Histopathological findings were inflammatory polyps in all cases of allergic FRS with the presence of fungal hyphae in 42.8% of the cases. All patients underwent surgery after a median delay of 12 [6–24] months of the symptom’s onset. The used procedures were endoscopic middle meatal antrostomy for all patients, ethmoidectomy (81.8%) and sphenoidotomy (36.4%). None received systemic antifungals or corticosteroids with a favorable outcome in all cases. Conclusion: Symptoms of noninvasive FRS are nonspecific. The scan images contribute to the diagnosis, but the perioperative findings and the histopathological results remain crucial.  The management is mainly surgical.

                <p>by Zhonghe Shao, Ting Wang, Meng Zhang, Zhou Jiang, Shuiping Huang, Ping Zeng</p>

Effective and powerful survival mediation models are currently lacking. To partly fill such knowledge gap, we particularly focus on the mediation analysis that includes multiple DNA methylations acting as exposures, one gene expression as the mediator and one survival time as the outcome. We proposed IUSMMT (intersection-union survival mixture-adjusted mediation test) to effectively examine the existence of mediation effect by fitting an empirical three-component mixture null distribution. With extensive simulation studies, we demonstrated the advantage of IUSMMT over existing methods. We applied IUSMMT to ten TCGA cancers and identified multiple genes that exhibited mediating effects. We further revealed that most of the identified regions, in which genes behaved as active mediators, were cancer type-specific and exhibited a full mediation from DNA methylation CpG sites to the survival risk of various types of cancers. Overall, IUSMMT represents an effective and powerful alternative for survival mediation analysis; our results also provide new insights into the functional role of DNA methylation and gene expression in cancer progression/prognosis and demonstrate potential therapeutic targets for future clinical practice.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Psychological and clinical-epidemiological profile of poisoning in Nepal: an institutional experience [version 2; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background  Poisoning has become a major public health problem, with the intent in most cases being self-harm and commit suicide. This study highlights the psychological and clinical-epidemiological profile of patients visiting Scheer Memorial Adventist Hospital after poisoning.  Methods  This retrospective record-based study was done among poisoning patients of a hospital in Nepal from 1st January 2018 to 31st December 2020. Data were analyzed using STATA version-15.  Results  Out of 134 total poisoning cases, 71 had consumed organophosphate compounds. The majority of the cases were female (59.2% in organophosphate groups, 69.8% in non-organophosphate groups). The circumstances of poisoning were mostly suicidal (95.8% in organophosphate groups, 90.5% in non-organophosphate groups) and the reasons for this being mostly family disputes. Organophosphate groups had 8.41 times higher odds of having complications when compared to non-organophosphorus compounds.   Conclusions  The majority of the poisoning cases were suicidal in nature and family disputes being the major reason for the intake of a poisonous substance. This demands that more attention be given to psychological and family counseling to resolve any disputes, as well as psychological management of poisoning cases after medical management. Also, a strong regulatory mechanism should be imposed to control the easy access to poisonous substances.

                We define a new concept of ‘active milieu’ that unifies all components of nervous tissue (neuronal and glial compartments, extracellular space, extracellular matrix, and vasculature) into a dynamic information processing system. Within this framework, we focus on the role of astrocytic processes, classified into organelle-containing branches and organelle-free leaflets. We argue that astrocytic branches with emanating leaflets are homologous to dendritic shafts with spines. Within the active milieu, astrocytic processes are engaged in reciprocal interactions with neuronal compartments and communication with other cellular and non-cellular elements of the nervous tissue.

JunB, through p16 upregulation and IGF-1 downregulation, causes fibroblasts senescence, which disrupts the skin stem cell niche and enforces depletion of stem cells pools and skin tissue decline.

                FAN1 modifies Huntington’s disease pathogenesis, but the mechanism has remained elusive. Goold et al. demonstrate that FAN1 binds MLH1 through residues 126SPYF129, competing with MSH3, and sequesters MLH1 from the mismatch repair pathway. In turn, this reduces mismatch repair activity and suppresses expansion of the pathogenic HTT CAG trinucleotide repeat.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">IL-17 triggers the onset of cognitive and synaptic deficits in early stages of Alzheimer’s disease</a></h4>

              
                Using a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease, Brigas et al. demonstrate that the onset of cognitive decline associates with an accumulation of IL-17-producing cells in the brain and the meninges. Targeting IL-17 into the ventricle prevents short-term memory and neuronal synaptic plasticity deficits at early stages of disease.

                McCaul et al. show that the late folding step of N and C termini integration triggers post-translational signal-peptide cleavage of HIV-1 gp120. During folding, a signal-peptide cysteine destabilizes the nearest disulfide bond, providing intramolecular disulfide isomerase activity to gp120. Signal-peptide cleavage removes the driver of isomerization, stabilizing gp120’s final conformation.

                Nasrallah et al. present cryo-EM structures of thermostabilized mGlu5 dimer bound to inhibitors and activators as well as an X-ray structure of mGlu5 7TM-bound photoswitchable ligand alloswitch-1. The structural and functional analyses reveal different modes of mGLu5 receptor activation and provide a structural basis for mGlu receptor activation mechanism.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Correction of amblyopia in cats and mice after the critical period</a></h4>

              
                Monocular deprivation early in development causes amblyopia, a severe visual impairment. Prognosis is poor if therapy is initiated after an early critical period. However, clinical observations have shown that recovery from amblyopia can occur later in life when the non-deprived (fellow) eye is removed. The traditional interpretation of this finding is that vision is improved simply by the elimination of interocular suppression in primary visual cortex, revealing responses to previously subthreshold input. However, an alternative explanation is that silencing activity in the fellow eye establishes conditions in visual cortex that enable the weak connections from the amblyopic eye to gain strength, in which case the recovery would persist even if vision is restored in the fellow eye. Consistent with this idea, we show here in cats and mice that temporary inactivation of the fellow eye is sufficient to promote a full and enduring recovery from amblyopia at ages when conventional treatments fail. Thus, connections serving the amblyopic eye are capable of substantial plasticity beyond the critical period, and this potential is unleashed by reversibly silencing the fellow eye.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Thrombopoietin from hepatocytes promotes hematopoietic stem cell regeneration after myeloablation</a></h4>

              
                The bone marrow niche plays a critical role in hematopoietic recovery and hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) regeneration after myeloablative stress. However, it is not clear whether systemic factors beyond the local niche are required for these essential processes <i>in vivo</i>. Thrombopoietin (THPO) is a critical cytokine promoting hematopoietic rebound after myeloablation and its transcripts are expressed by multiple cellular sources. The upregulation of bone marrow-derived THPO has been proposed to be crucial for hematopoietic recovery and HSC regeneration after stress. Nonetheless, the cellular source of THPO in myeloablative stress has never been investigated genetically. We assessed the functional sources of THPO following two common myeloablative perturbations: 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) administration and irradiation. Using a <i>Thpo</i> translational reporter, we found that the liver but not the bone marrow is the major source of THPO protein after myeloablation. Mice with conditional <i>Thpo</i> deletion from osteoblasts and/or bone marrow stromal cells showed normal recovery of HSCs and hematopoiesis after myeloablation. In contrast, mice with conditional <i>Thpo</i> deletion from hepatocytes showed significant defects in HSC regeneration and hematopoietic rebound after myeloablation. Thus, systemic THPO from the liver is necessary for HSC regeneration and hematopoietic recovery in myeloablative stress conditions.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Sterically confined rearrangements of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein control cell invasion</a></h4>

              
                Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is highly contagious, and transmission involves a series of processes that may be targeted by vaccines and therapeutics. During transmission, host cell invasion is controlled by a large-scale (200–300 Å) conformational change of the Spike protein. This conformational rearrangement leads to membrane fusion, which creates transmembrane pores through which the viral genome is passed to the host. During Spike-protein-mediated fusion, the fusion peptides must be released from the core of the protein and associate with the host membrane. While infection relies on this transition between the prefusion and postfusion conformations, there has yet to be a biophysical characterization reported for this rearrangement. That is, structures are available for the endpoints, though the intermediate conformational processes have not been described. Interestingly, the Spike protein possesses many post-translational modifications, in the form of branched glycans that flank the surface of the assembly. With the current lack of data on the pre-to-post transition, the precise role of glycans during cell invasion has also remained unclear. To provide an initial mechanistic description of the pre-to-post rearrangement, an all-atom model with simplified energetics was used to perform thousands of simulations in which the protein transitions between the prefusion and postfusion conformations. These simulations indicate that the steric composition of the glycans can induce a pause during the Spike protein conformational change. We additionally show that this glycan-induced delay provides a critical opportunity for the fusion peptides to capture the host cell. In contrast, in the absence of glycans, the viral particle would likely fail to enter the host. This analysis reveals how the glycosylation state can regulate infectivity, while providing a much-needed structural framework for studying the dynamics of this pervasive pathogen.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The mechanism of MICU-dependent gating of the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter</a></h4>

              
                Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry into mitochondria is through the mitochondrial calcium uniporter complex (MCU<sub>cx</sub>), a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-selective channel composed of five subunit types. Two MCU<sub>cx</sub> subunits (MCU and EMRE) span the inner mitochondrial membrane, while three Ca<sup>2+</sup>-regulatory subunits (MICU1, MICU2 and MICU3) reside in the intermembrane space. Here we provide rigorous analysis of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> fluxes via MCU<sub>cx</sub> in intact isolated mitochondria to understand the function of MICU subunits. We also perform direct patch clamp recordings of macroscopic and single MCU<sub>cx</sub> currents to gain further mechanistic insight. This comprehensive analysis shows that the MCU<sub>cx</sub> pore, composed of the EMRE and MCU subunits, is not occluded nor plugged by MICUs during the absence or presence of extramitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> as has been widely reported. Instead, MICUs potentiate activity of MCU<sub>cx</sub> as extramitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> is elevated. MICUs achieve this by modifying the gating properties of MCU<sub>cx</sub> allowing it to spend more time in the open state.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Studying evolution of the primary body axis in vivo and in vitro</a></h4>

              
                The metazoan body plan is established during early embryogenesis via collective cell rearrangements and evolutionarily conserved gene networks, as part of a process commonly referred to as gastrulation. While substantial progress has been achieved in terms of characterizing the embryonic development of several model organisms, underlying principles of many early patterning processes nevertheless remain enigmatic. Despite the diversity of (pre-)gastrulating embryo and adult body shapes across the animal kingdom, the body axes, which are arguably the most fundamental features, generally remain identical between phyla. Recently there has been a renewed appreciation of ex vivo and in vitro embryo-like systems to model early embryonic patterning events. Here, we briefly review key examples and propose that similarities in morphogenesis and associated gene expression dynamics may reveal an evolutionarily conserved developmental mode as well as provide further insights into the role of external or extraembryonic cues in shaping the early embryo. In summary, we argue that embryo-like systems can be employed to inform previously uncharted aspects of animal body plan evolution as well as associated patterning rules.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">YAP and TAZ are transcriptional co-activators of AP-1 proteins and STAT3 during breast cellular transformation</a></h4>

              
                The YAP and TAZ paralogs are transcriptional co-activators recruited to target sites by TEAD proteins. Here, we show that YAP and TAZ are also recruited by JUNB (a member of the AP-1 family) and STAT3, key transcription factors that mediate an epigenetic switch linking inflammation to cellular transformation. YAP and TAZ directly interact with JUNB and STAT3 via a WW domain important for transformation, and they stimulate transcriptional activation by AP-1 proteins. JUNB, STAT3, and TEAD co-localize at virtually all YAP/TAZ target sites, yet many target sites only contain individual AP-1, TEAD, or STAT3 motifs. This observation and differences in relative crosslinking efficiencies of JUNB, TEAD, and STAT3 at YAP/TAZ target sites suggest that YAP/TAZ is recruited by different forms of an AP-1/STAT3/TEAD complex depending on the recruiting motif. The different classes of YAP/TAZ target sites are associated with largely non-overlapping genes with distinct functions. A small minority of target sites are YAP- or TAZ-specific, and they are associated with different sequence motifs and gene classes from shared YAP/TAZ target sites. Genes containing either the AP-1 or TEAD class of YAP/TAZ sites are associated with poor survival of breast cancer patients with the triple-negative form of the disease.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Mutational sources of trans-regulatory variation affecting gene expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae</a></h4>

              
                Heritable variation in a gene’s expression arises from mutations impacting <i>cis</i>- and <i>trans</i>-acting components of its regulatory network. Here, we investigate how <i>trans</i>-regulatory mutations are distributed within the genome and within a gene regulatory network by identifying and characterizing 69 mutations with <i>trans</i>-regulatory effects on expression of the same focal gene in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>. Relative to 1766 mutations without effects on expression of this focal gene, we found that these <i>trans</i>-regulatory mutations were enriched in coding sequences of transcription factors previously predicted to regulate expression of the focal gene. However, over 90% of the <i>trans</i>-regulatory mutations identified mapped to other types of genes involved in diverse biological processes including chromatin state, metabolism, and signal transduction. These data show how genetic changes in diverse types of genes can impact a gene’s expression in <i>trans</i>, revealing properties of <i>trans</i>-regulatory mutations that provide the raw material for <i>trans</i>-regulatory variation segregating within natural populations.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Edge-strand of BepA interacts with immature LptD on the β-barrel assembly machine to direct it to on- and off-pathways</a></h4>

              
                The outer membrane (OM) of gram-negative bacteria functions as a selective permeability barrier. <i>Escherichia coli</i> periplasmic Zn-metallopeptidase BepA contributes to the maintenance of OM integrity through its involvement in the biogenesis and degradation of LptD, a β-barrel protein component of the lipopolysaccharide translocon. BepA either promotes the maturation of LptD when it is on the normal assembly pathway (on-pathway) or degrades it when its assembly is compromised (off-pathway). BepA performs these functions probably on the β‐barrel assembly machinery (BAM) complex. However, how BepA recognizes and directs an immature LptD to different pathways remains unclear. Here, we explored the interactions among BepA, LptD, and the BAM complex. We found that the interaction of the BepA edge-strand located adjacent to the active site with LptD was crucial not only for proteolysis but also, unexpectedly, for assembly promotion of LptD. Site-directed crosslinking analyses indicated that the unstructured N-terminal half of the β-barrel-forming domain of an immature LptD contacts with the BepA edge-strand. Furthermore, the C-terminal region of the β-barrel-forming domain of the BepA-bound LptD intermediate interacted with a 'seam' strand of BamA, suggesting that BepA recognized LptD assembling on the BAM complex. Our findings provide important insights into the functional mechanism of BepA.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Spectral signature and behavioral consequence of spontaneous shifts of pupil-linked arousal in human</a></h4>

              
                Arousal levels perpetually rise and fall spontaneously. How markers of arousal - pupil size and frequency content of brain activity - relate to each other and influence behavior in humans is poorly understood. We simultaneously monitored magnetoencephalography and pupil in healthy volunteers at rest and during a visual perceptual decision-making task. Spontaneously varying pupil size correlates with power of brain activity in most frequency bands across large-scale resting-state cortical networks. Pupil size recorded at prestimulus baseline correlates with subsequent shifts in detection bias (c) and sensitivity (d'). When dissociated from pupil-linked state, prestimulus spectral power of resting state networks still predicts perceptual behavior. Fast spontaneous pupil constriction and dilation correlate with large-scale brain activity as well but not perceptual behavior. Our results illuminate the relation between central and peripheral arousal markers and their respective roles in human perceptual decision-making.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">TGFβ signalling is required to maintain pluripotency of human naïve pluripotent stem cells</a></h4>

              
                The signalling pathways that maintain primed human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) have been well characterised, revealing a critical role for TGFβ/Activin/Nodal signalling. In contrast, the signalling requirements of naive human pluripotency have not been fully established. Here, we demonstrate that TGFβ signalling is required to maintain naive hPSCs. The downstream effector proteins – SMAD2/3 – bind common sites in naive and primed hPSCs, including shared pluripotency genes. In naive hPSCs, SMAD2/3 additionally bind to active regulatory regions near to naive pluripotency genes. Inhibiting TGFβ signalling in naive hPSCs causes the downregulation of SMAD2/3-target genes and pluripotency exit. Single-cell analyses reveal that naive and primed hPSCs follow different transcriptional trajectories after inhibition of TGFβ signalling. Primed hPSCs differentiate into neuroectoderm cells, whereas naive hPSCs transition into trophectoderm. These results establish that there is a continuum for TGFβ pathway function in human pluripotency spanning a developmental window from naive to primed states.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Leveraging the mendelian disorders of the epigenetic machinery to systematically map functional epigenetic variation</a></h4>

              
                Although each Mendelian Disorder of the Epigenetic Machinery (MDEM) has a different causative gene, there are shared disease manifestations. We hypothesize that this phenotypic convergence is a consequence of shared epigenetic alterations. To identify such shared alterations we interrogate chromatin (ATAC-Seq) and expression (RNA-Seq) states in B cells from three MDEM mouse models (Kabuki (KS) types 1&2 and Rubinstein-Taybi (RT1) syndromes). We develop a new approach for the overlap analysis and find extensive overlap primarily localized in gene promoters. We show that disruption of chromatin accessibility at promoters often disrupts downstream gene expression, and identify 587 loci and 264 genes with shared disruption across all three MDEMs. Subtle expression alterations of multiple, IgA-relevant genes, collectively contribute to IgA deficiency in KS1 and RT1, but not in KS2. We propose that the joint study of MDEMs offers a principled approach for systematically mapping functional epigenetic variation in mammals.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Decoding the brain state-dependent relationship between pupil dynamics and resting state fMRI signal fluctuation</a></h4>

              
                Pupil dynamics serve as a physiological indicator of cognitive processes and arousal states of the brain across a diverse range of behavioral experiments. Pupil diameter changes reflect brain state fluctuations driven by neuromodulatory systems. Resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) has been used to identify global patterns of neuronal correlation with pupil diameter changes, however, the linkage between distinct brain state-dependent activation patterns of neuromodulatory nuclei with pupil dynamics remains to be explored. Here, we identified four clusters of trials with unique activity patterns related to pupil diameter changes in anesthetized rat brains. Going beyond the typical rs-fMRI correlation analysis with pupil dynamics, we decomposed spatiotemporal patterns of rs-fMRI with principal components analysis (PCA) and characterized the cluster-specific pupil-fMRI relationships by optimizing the PCA component weighting via decoding methods. This work shows that pupil dynamics are tightly coupled with different neuromodulatory centers in different trials, presenting a novel PCA-based decoding method to study the brain state-dependent pupil-fMRI relationship.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Inducible and reversible inhibition of miRNA-mediated gene repression in vivo</a></h4>

              
                Although virtually all gene networks are predicted to be controlled by miRNAs, the contribution of this important layer of gene regulation to tissue homeostasis in adult animals remains unclear. Gain and loss of function experiments have provided key insights into the specific function of individual miRNAs, but effective genetic tools to study the functional consequences of global inhibition of miRNA activity <i>in vivo</i> are lacking. Here we report the generation and characterization of a genetically engineered mouse strain in which miRNA-mediated gene repression can be reversibly inhibited without affecting miRNA biogenesis or abundance. We demonstrate the usefulness of this strategy by investigating the consequences of acute inhibition of miRNA function in adult animals. We find that different tissues and organs respond differently to global loss of miRNA function. While miRNA-mediated gene repression is essential for the homeostasis of the heart and the skeletal muscle, it is largely dispensable in the majority of other organs. Even in tissues where it is not required for homeostasis, such as the intestine and hematopoietic system, miRNA activity can become essential during regeneration following acute injury. These data support a model where many metazoan tissues primarily rely on miRNA function to respond to potentially pathogenic events.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Single-Cell transcriptional changes in hypothalamic CRH-expressing neurons after early-life adversity inform enduring alterations in responses to stress</a></h4>

              
                Mental and cognitive health, as well as vulnerability to neuropsychiatric disorders, involve the interplay of genes with the environment, particularly during sensitive developmental periods. Early-life stress / adversity (ELA) promotes vulnerabilities to stress-related affective disorders, yet it is unknown how a transient ELA dictates life-long neuroendocrine and behavioral reactions to stress. The population of hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH)-expressing neurons that regulate stress-responses is a promising candidate to mediate the enduring influences of ELA on stress-related behavioral and hormonal responses via enduring transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms. Capitalizing on a well-characterized model of ELA, we examined here the ELA-induced changes in gene expression profiles of stress-sensitive CRH-neurons in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of male mice. Given the known heterogeneity of these neuronal populations, we employed single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) approaches. The use of single-cell transcriptomics identified distinct CRH-expressing neuronal populations characterized by both their gene expression repertoire and their neurotransmitter profiles. Expression changes provoked by ELA clustered around genes involved in neuronal differentiation, synapse formation, altered energy metabolism and the cellular responses to stress and injury. Notably, the ELA-induced transcriptional changes took place primarily in subpopulations of glutamatergic CRH cells. Finally, ELA-induced transcriptional reprogramming of hypothalamic CRH-expressing neurons heralded significant, enduring disruptions of both hormonal and behavioral responses to stress throughout life.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Frontal cortex activity underlying the production of diverse vocal signals during social communication in marmoset monkeys</a></h4>

              
                Vocal communication is essential for social behaviors in humans and many non-human primates. While the frontal cortex has been shown to play a crucial role in human speech production, its role in vocal production in non-human primates has long been questioned. Recent studies have shown activation in single neurons in the monkey frontal cortex during vocal production in relatively isolated environment. However, little is known about how the frontal cortex is engaged in vocal production in ethologically relevant social context, where different types of vocal signals are produced for various communication purposes. Here we studied single neuron activities and local field potentials (LFP) and in the frontal cortex of marmoset monkeys while the animal engaged in vocal exchanges with other conspecifics in a social environment. Marmosets most frequently produced four types of vocalizations with distinct acoustic structures, three of which were typically not produced in isolation. We found that both single neuron activities and LFP were modulated by the production of each of the four call types. Moreover, the neural modulations in the frontal cortex showed distinct patterns for different call types, suggesting a representation of vocal signal features. In addition, we found that theta-band LFP oscillations were phase-locked to the phrases of twitter calls, which indicates the coordination of temporal structures of vocalizations. Our results suggested important functions of the marmoset frontal cortex in supporting the production of diverse vocalizations in vocal communication.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Effective and Efficient Neural Networks for Spike Inference from In Vivo Calcium Imaging</a></h4>

              
                Calcium imaging technique provides irreplaceable advantages in monitoring large population of neuronal activities simultaneously. However, due to the generally low signal to noise ratio (SNR) of the calcium signal and variability in dye properties, it is still challenging to faithfully infer neuronal spikes from these calcium signals, especially from in vivo experiments. In this study, we tackled the problem of both spike-rate and spike-event predictions using a data-driven approach, based on a public pool of dataset with simultaneously recorded calcium and electrophysiological signals using different dyes and recorded from different brain regions. We proposed the ENS2 (effective and efficient neural networks for spike inference from calcium signals) system using raw calcium inputs and it consistently outperforms state-of-the-arts algorithms in both spike-rate and spike-event predictions with reduced computational load. We have also demonstrated that factors such as sampling rates, smoothing window sizes and parametric evaluation metrics could readily bias the interpretation of inference performance. We concluded that optimizing our system for spike-event prediction could produce a more versatile inference system for real neuroscience studies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The Retrieval-related Anterior shift is Moderated by Age and Correlates with Memory Performance</a></h4>

              
                Recent research suggests that episodic memory is associated with systematic differences in the localization of neural activity observed during memory encoding and retrieval. The retrieval-related anterior shift is a phenomenon whereby the retrieval of a stimulus event (e.g., a scene image) is associated with a peak neural response which is localized more anteriorly than the response elicited when the stimulus is experienced directly. Here, we examine whether the magnitude of the anterior shift, i.e., the distance between encoding- and retrieval-related response peaks, is moderated by age, and also whether the shift is associated with memory performance. Younger and older human subjects of both sexes underwent fMRI as they completed encoding and retrieval tasks on word-face and word-scene pairs. We localized peak scene- and face-selectivity for each individual participant within the face-selective precuneus (PCU) and in three scene-selective (parahippocampal place area [PPA], medial place area [MPA], occipital place area [OPA]) regions of interest (ROIs). In line with recent findings, we identified an anterior shift in PPA and OPA in both age groups and, in older adults only, in MPA and PCU also. Of importance, the magnitude of the anterior shift was larger in older than in younger adults. The shift within the PPA exhibited an age-invariant across-participant negative correlation with source memory performance, such that a smaller displacement between encoding- and retrieval-related neural activity was associated with better performance. These findings provide novel insights into the functional significance of the anterior shift, especially in relation to memory decline in older age.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Physiological basis underlying antidepressant-induced activation of TrkB receptors</a></h4>

              
                We show that both pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments of depression activate TrkB receptors - a well-established target of antidepressants - by inducing a physiological response coupled to sedation. Several rapid-acting antidepressants trigger TrkB signaling by evoking a state associated with electroencephalographic slow-wave activity, behavioral immobility, reduced cerebral glucose utilization, and lowered body temperature. Remarkably, antidepressant-induced TrkB signaling was not compromised in animals exhibiting reduced activity-dependent release of BDNF but was diminished by maintaining animals in warm ambient temperature. Most importantly, prevention of the hypothermic response attenuated the behavioral effects produced by rapid-acting antidepressant nitrous oxide. Our results suggest that the phenomenon underlying TrkB transactivation - changes in energy expenditure and thermoregulation - is essential, but not sufficient, for antidepressant responses. Indeed, regardless of differential clinical and pharmacodynamic properties, all drugs that disrupt energy metabolism and induce hypothermia activated TrkB. This study challenges pharmacology-centric hypotheses regarding antidepressant effects and highlight the role of complex changes in bioenergetics and thermoregulation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Critical period for vision-dependent modulation of postnatal retinal neurogenesis</a></h4>

              
                It is generally accepted that retinal neurogenesis in mammals ceases shortly after birth and that stem/progenitor cells found in the postnatal eyes of mice and humans are in the quiescent state. In the present study, we have investigated postnatal retinal neurogenesis and its modulation by visual experience in the mouse model. Four age groups (P26, P45, P72, and P94) of transgenic mice expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) in the retinal progenitor cells under the control of nestin regulatory elements were examined for the presence of nestin-GFP-positive proliferating progenitor cells in the retina. Contrary to the previously held belief, we found a significant number of proliferating progenitors at the retinal periphery in all age groups examined. The majority of these cells gave rise to photoreceptors as revealed by the genetic cell fate mapping experiments. The intensity of neurogenesis was declining with age, and strongly correlated with eye growth. Visual form deprivation resulted in a significant increase in the intensity of peripheral neurogenesis, which correlated strongly with the induced ocular growth. The susceptibility to both form-deprivation-induced increase in the peripheral neurogenesis and form-deprivation-induced increase in the ocular growth declined with age ceasing completely around P70, which marked the end of the critical period for the vision-dependent modulation of both ocular growth and postnatal retinal neurogenesis. Thus, neurogenesis in the peripheral retina of young mice is modulated by visual input, but only during a critical period in postnatal development.

                Formation and consolidation of memories for highly stressful (traumatic) events is a complex process that involves interplay between multiple memory systems and has implications for etiology and treatment of stress- and trauma-related disorders. Here we study effects of sleep/wake state and high intra-hippocampal corticosterone on consolidation of aversive contextual memories as well as consolidation of association between simple trauma-related cues and fear response in rats. Animals were implanted with EEG and EMG electrodes for sleep assessment and cannulas for intra-hippocampal corticosterone application. They were familiarized to a safe box and then trained in fear conditioning paradigm in a distinct shock box with a prominent simple auditory cue serving as a phasic background cue. Immediately after conditioning, animals received bilateral intra-hippocampal saline or corticosterone injection and were either allowed to sleep or were kept awake for a following two-hour consolidation period. Memory test twenty-four hours later revealed that the saline-injected animals with sleep during consolidation had significantly stronger freezing response in the shock box compared to the safe box as well as increased freezing in response to the tone. Lack of post-learning sleep in saline injected animals led to generalization of fear response to the safe context, while association between simple cue and fear response was preserved. High intra-hippocampal corticosterone level during memory consolidation led to generalization of fear response to the safe context, regardless of sleep/wake state, while enhancement of response to single stimulus was not observed. Our results show how manipulation of conditions during consolidation can lead to greatly variable complex memories for a traumatic episode and distinct behavioral outcomes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">On co-activation pattern analysis and non- stationarity of resting brain activity</a></h4>

              
                The non-stationarity of resting-state brain activity has received increasing attention in recent years. Functional connectivity (FC) analysis with short sliding windows and coactivation pattern (CAP) analysis are two widely used methods for assessing the non- stationary characteristics of brain activity observed with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). However, whether these techniques adequately capture non-stationarity needs to be verified. In this study, we found that the results of CAP analysis were similar for real fMRI data and simulated stationary data with matching covariance structures and spectral contents. We also found that, for both the real and simulated data, CAPs were clustered into spatially heterogeneous modules. Moreover, for each of the modules in the real data, a spatially similar module was found in the simulated data. The present results suggest that care needs to be taken when interpreting observations drawn from CAP analysis as it does not necessarily reflect non-stationarity or a mixture of states in resting brain activity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Microstructural Properties of Human Brain Revealed by Fractional Anisotropy can Predict the After-effect of Intermittent Theta Burst Stimulation</a></h4>

              
                Intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) delivered by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) produces a long term potentiation (LTP)-like after-effect useful for investigations of cortical function and of potential therapeutic value. However, the iTBS-evoked after-effect over the primary motor cortex (M1) as measured by changes in motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitude exhibits a largely unexplained variability across individuals. Here, we present evidence that individual differences in white and grey matter microstructural properties revealed by fractional anisotropy (FA) predict the magnitude of the iTBS-induced after-effect over M1. The MEP amplitude change in the early phase (5-10 min) post-iTBS was associated with FA values in white matter tracts such as right superior longitudinal fasciculus and corpus callosum. In contrast, the MEP amplitude change in the late phase (15-30 min) post-iTBS was associated with FA in grey matter, primarily in right frontal cortex. These results suggest that the microstructural properties of regions connected directly or indirectly to the target region (M1) are crucial determinants of the iTBS after-effect. FA values indicative of these microstructural differences can predict the potential effectiveness of rTMS for both investigational use and clinical application.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Input zone-selective dysrhythmia in motor thalamus after dopamine depletion</a></h4>

              
                The cerebral cortex, basal ganglia and motor thalamus form circuits important for purposeful movement. In Parkinsonism, basal ganglia neurons often exhibit dysrhythmic activity during, and with respect to, the slow (~1 Hz) and beta-band (15-30 Hz) oscillations that emerge in cortex in a brain state-dependent manner. There remains, however, a pressing need to elucidate the extent to which motor thalamus activity becomes similarly dysrhythmic after dopamine depletion relevant to Parkinsonism. To address this, we recorded single-neuron and ensemble outputs in the 'basal ganglia-recipient zone' (BZ) and 'cerebellar-recipient zone' (CZ) of motor thalamus in anesthetized male dopamine-intact rats and 6-OHDA-lesioned rats during two brain states, respectively defined by cortical slow-wave activity and activation. Two forms of thalamic input zone-selective dysrhythmia manifested after dopamine depletion: First, BZ neurons, but not CZ neurons, exhibited abnormal phase-shifted firing with respect to cortical slow oscillations prevalent during slow-wave activity; secondly, BZ neurons, but not CZ neurons, inappropriately synchronized their firing and engaged with the exaggerated cortical beta oscillations arising in activated states. These dysrhythmias were not accompanied by the thalamic hypoactivity predicted by canonical firing rate-based models of circuit organization in Parkinsonism. Complementary recordings of neurons in substantia nigra pars reticulata suggested their altered activity dynamics could underpin the BZ dysrhythmias. Finally, pharmacological perturbations demonstrated that ongoing activity in the motor thalamus bolsters exaggerated beta oscillations in motor cortex. We conclude that BZ neurons are selectively primed to mediate the detrimental influences of abnormal slow and beta-band rhythms on circuit information processing in Parkinsonism.

                While the brain regions involved in action observation are relatively well documented in humans and primates, how these regions communicate to help understand and predict actions remains poorly understood. Traditional views emphasized a feed-forward architecture in which visual features are organized into increasingly complex representations that feed onto motor programs in parietal and then premotor cortices where the matching of observed actions upon the observer's own motor programs contributes to action understanding. Predictive coding models place less emphasis on feed-forward connections and propose that feed-back connections from premotor regions back to parietal and visual neurons represent predictions about upcoming actions that can supersede visual inputs when actions become predictable, with visual input then merely representing prediction errors. Here we leverage the notion that feed-back connections target deeper cortical layers than feed-forward connections to help adjudicate across these views. Specifically, we test whether observing sequences of hand actions in their natural order, which permits participants to predict upcoming actions, triggers more feed-back input to parietal regions than seeing the same actions in a scrambled sequence that hinders making predictions. Using submillimeter fMRI acquisition at 7T, we find that watching predictable sequences triggers more action-related activity (as measured using intersubject functional correlation) in deep layers of the parietal cortical area PFt than watching the exact same actions in scrambled and hence unpredictable sequence. In addition, functional connectivity analysis performed using intersubject functional connectivity confirms that this deep, action-related signals in PFt could originate from ventral premotor region BA44. This data showcases the utility of intersubject functional correlation in combination with 7T MRI to explore the architecture of social cognition under more naturalistic conditions, and provides evidence for models that emphasize the importance of feed-back connections in action prediction.

                Early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease (AD) is marked by an aggressive buildup of amyloid beta (AB) proteins, yet the neural circuit operations impacted during the initial stages of AB pathogenesis remain elusive. Here, we report a coding impairment of the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) grid cell network in a transgenic mouse model of familial AD that over-expresses AB throughout the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex. Grid cells showed reduced spatial periodicity, spatial stability, and synchrony with interneurons and head-direction cells. In contrast, the spatial coding of non-grid cells within the MEC, and place cells within the hippocampus, remained intact. Grid cell deficits emerged at the earliest incidence of AB fibril deposition and coincided with impaired spatial memory performance in a path integration task. These results demonstrate that widespread AB-mediated damage to the entorhinal-hippocampal circuit results in an early impairment of the entorhinal grid cell network.

                Evaluating choices in multi-step tasks is thought to involve mentally simulating trajectories. Recent theories propose that the brain simplifies these laborious computations using temporal abstraction: storing actions' consequences, collapsed over multiple timesteps (the Successor Representation; SR). Although predictive neural representations and, separately, behavioral errors ("slips of action") consistent with this mechanism have been reported, it is unknown whether these neural representations support choices in a manner consistent with the SR. We addressed this question by using fMRI to measure predictive representations in a setting where the SR implies specific errors in multi-step expectancies and corresponding behavioral errors. By decoding measures of state predictions from sensory cortex during choice evaluation, we identified evidence that behavioral errors predicted by the SR are accompanied by predictive representations of upcoming task states reflecting SR predicted erroneous multi-step expectancies. These results provide neural evidence for the SR in choice evaluation and contribute toward a mechanistic understanding of flexible and inflexible decision making.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dissecting errors of the exogenously-driven and endogenously-driven saccadic tasks in the common marmoset</a></h4>

              
                Various saccadic tasks traditionally used in oculomotor research, including both exogenously-driven and endogenously-driven saccades, have been proposed as clinical diagnostic for human movement disorders. Recently, common marmosets have been proven to be a good primate model for these movement disorders. However, whether similar saccadic measurements can be used for marmosets was not tested. Here, we trained three marmosets on the gap task, an exogenously-driven saccadic task, and the oculomotor delayed response (ODR) task, an endogenously-driven saccadic task. We demonstrated that with long-term training, they were able to learn and switch between the two tasks. The marmosets showed undershooting tendency in the gap and both under- and overshooting tendency in the ODR task when they made saccades to the target. We also categorized the error trails into distractive, impulsive, and visuomotor errors, depending on when a false saccade happened in relation to the task progression and interpreted possible causes of errors based on the saccade response time and the task history. Each error category may indicate specific failures in a particular aspect of cognitive or sensory-motor processes. Finally, and critically, we found that saccades from successful trials exhibited the highest saccade peak velocity and the shortest saccade duration comparing to the same saccade amplitude from error trials. Taken together, we showed the potential of training the same marmosets on conflicting oculomotor tasks simultaneously. We documented the baseline performance and compared successful and error trials in both gap and ODR tasks from the same animals. We propose that analyzing the error trials in sync with successful trials could provide a further understanding of the cognitive and sensorimotor processes of the marmosets, in both healthy and disease conditions.

                Successful teamwork is fundamental for optimally functioning societies. However, little is known regarding the neural basis of real-world teamwork. Here, we recruited forty individuals paired as twenty dyads and recorded dual-EEG at rest and during realistic training scenarios of increasing complexity using virtual simulation systems. We estimated markers of intrinsic brain activity (i.e., individual alpha frequency and aperiodic activity), as well as task-related theta and alpha oscillations. Using nonlinear modelling and machine learning techniques, we found that resting-state EEG predicts performance and can also reliably differentiate between members within a dyad. Task-related theta and alpha activity during easy training tasks predicted later performance on complex training to a greater extent than prior behaviour. These findings complement laboratory-based research on both oscillatory and aperiodic activity in higher-order cognition and provide evidence that theta and alpha activity play a critical role in complex task performance in team environments.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Novel System to Monitor In Vivo Neural Graft Activity After Spinal Cord Injury</a></h4>

              
                Expectations for neural stem/progenitor cell (NS/PC) transplantation as a treatment for spinal cord injury (SCI) are increasing. However, whether and how grafted cells are incorporated into the host neural circuit and contribute to motor function recovery remain unknown. The aim of this project was to establish a novel non-invasive in vivo imaging system to visualize the activity of neural grafts by which we can simultaneously demonstrate the circuit-level integration between the graft and host, and the contribution of graft neuronal activity to host behaviour. We introduced Akaluc, a newly engineered luciferase, under control of a potent neuronal activity-dependent synthetic promoter, E-SARE, into NS/PCs and engrafted the cells into SCI model mice. Through the use of this system, we reveal that the activity of grafted cells was integrated with host behaviour and driven by host neural circuit inputs. This non-invasive system is expected to help elucidate the therapeutic mechanism of cell transplantation treatment for SCI and determine better therapy techniques that maximize the function of cells in the host circuit.

                Despite the rapid progress and interest in brain-machine interfaces that restore motor function, the performance of prosthetic fingers and limbs has yet to mimic native function. The algorithm that converts brain signals to a control signal for the prosthetic device is one of the limitations in achieving rapid and realistic finger movements. To achieve more realistic finger movements, we developed a shallow feed-forward neural network, loosely inspired by the biological neural pathway, to decode real-time two-degree-of-freedom finger movements. Using a two-step training method, a recalibrated feedback intention-trained (ReFIT) neural network achieved a higher throughput with higher finger velocities and more natural appearing finger movements than the ReFIT Kalman filter, which represents the current standard. The neural network decoders introduced herein are the first to demonstrate real-time decoding of continuous movements at a level superior to the current state-of-the-art and could provide a starting point to using neural networks for the development of more naturalistic brain-controlled prostheses.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Does learning to read change the perception of speech? Evidence from perceptual recalibration of speech sounds in adult illiterates, semi-literates, and literates of Tamil</a></h4>

              
                How do different levels of representation interact in the mind? Key evidence for answering this question comes from experimental work that investigates the influence of knowledge of written language on spoken language processing. Here we tested whether learning orthographic representations (through reading) influences pre-lexical phonological representations in spoken-word recognition using a perceptual learning paradigm. Perceptual learning is well suited to reveal differences in pre-lexical representations that might be caused by learning to read because it requires the functional use of pre-lexical representations in order to generalize a learning experience. In a large-scale behavioural study in Chennai, India, 97 native speakers of Tamil with varying reading experience (from completely illiterate to highly literate) participated. In marked contrast to their performance in other cognitive tasks, even completely illiterate participants showed a perceptual learning effect that was not moderated by reading experience. This finding suggests that pre-lexical phonological representations are not substantially changed by learning to read and thus poses important constraints for the debate about the degree of interactivity between different levels of representations during human information processing.

                Sleep manifests itself by the spontaneous emergence of characteristic oscillatory rhythms, which often time-lock and are implicated in the memory formation. Here, we analyze a neural mass model of the thalamo-cortical loop of which the cortical node can generate slow oscillations (approx. 1 Hz) while its thalamic component can generate sleep spindles of {sigma}-band activity (12-15 Hz). We study the dynamics for different coupling strengths between the thalamic and cortical nodes, for different conductance values of the thalamic node's potassium leak and anomalous rectifying currents, and for different parameter regimes of the cortical node. The latter are: (1) a low activity (DOWN) state with noise-induced, transient excursions into a high activity (UP) state, (2) an adaptation induced slow oscillation limit cycle with alternating UP and DOWN states, and (3) a high activity (UP) state with noise-induced, transient excursions into the low activity (DOWN) state. During UP states, thalamic spindling is abolished or reduced. During DOWN states, the thalamic node generates sleep spindles, which in turn can cause DOWN to UP transitions in the cortical node. Consequently, this leads to spindle-induced UP state transitions in parameter regime (1), thalamic spindles induced in some but not all DOWN states in regime (2), and thalamic spindles following UP to DOWN transitions in regime (3). The spindle-induced {sigma}-band activity in the cortical node, however, is typically strongest during the UP state, which follows a DOWN state "window of opportunity" for spindling. When the cortical node is parametrized in regime (3), the model well explains the interactions between slow oscillations and sleep spindles observed experimentally during Non-Rapid Eye Movement sleep. The model is computationally efficient and can be integrated into large-scale modeling frameworks to study spatial aspects like sleep wave propagation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Songbird subthalamic neurons signal song timing and error and project to dopaminergic midbrain</a></h4>

              
                Skill learning requires motor output to be evaluated against internal performance benchmarks. In songbirds, ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine neurons (DA) signal performance errors important for learning, but it remains unclear which brain regions project VTA and how these inputs may implement the sensorimotor comparisons necessary for error computation. Here we find that the songbird subthalamic nucleus (STN) projects to VTA and that STN microstimulation can excite VTA neurons. We also discover that STN receives inputs from auditory cortical and ventral pallidal brain regions previously implicated in song evaluation. In the first neural recordings from songbird STN, we discover that the activity of most STN neurons is associated with body movements and not singing, but a small fraction of neurons exhibits precise song timing and performance error signals consistent with performance evaluation. Together our results implicate the STN-VTA projection as an evolutionarily conserved pathway important for motor learning and expand the territories of songbird brain associated with song learning.

	<p>Background: Subjective memory impairment (SMI) is associated with negative health outcomes including mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease. However, ethnic differences in SMI and disparities in risk factors associated with SMI among minority populations are understudied. The study examined the ethnic differences in SMI, whether SMI was associated with depressive symptoms, sleep, and physical activity (PA), and whether the associations vary across racial/ethnic groups. Methods: Participants included 243 African and Asian Americans (including Chinese, Vietnamese, and Korean Americans) aged 50 or older. Demographic information, SMI, depressive symptoms, daily sleeping hours, and PA levels were assessed. Results: Vietnamese Americans reported the highest SMI score. Depressive symptoms, sleeping hours, and PA levels were significantly associated with SMI. Depressive symptoms were the only significant factor across all ethnic groups. Significant interaction effects were found between ethnicity and health behaviors in predicting SMI. In particular, Vietnamese American participants with greater depressive symptoms and physical inactivity were significantly more likely to experience SMI compared to other ethnic groups Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate ethnic differences in SMI and its association with depressive symptoms, sleep, and PA, which highlight the importance of considering the unique cultural and historical backgrounds across different racial/ethnic groups when examining cognitive functioning in elderly.</p>

	<p>The aim of the study was to examine potential cognitive, mood (depression and anxiety) and behavioral changes that may be related to the quarantine and the lockdown applied during the COVID-19 pandemic in Greek older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD dementia in mild and moderate stages. Method: 407 older adults, diagnosed either with MCI or AD dementia (ADD), were recruited from the Day Centers of the Greek Association of Alzheimer Disease and Related Disorders (GAADRD). Neuropsychological assessment was performed at baseline (at the time of diagnosis) between May and July of 2018, as well as for two consecutive follow-up assessments, identical in period, in 2019 and 2020. The majority of participants had participated in non-pharmacological interventions during 2018 as well as 2019, whereas all of them continued their participation online in 2020. Results: Mixed measures analysis of variance showed that participants’ ‘deterioration difference—D’ by means of their performance difference in neuropsychological assessments between 2018–2019 (D1) and 2019–2020 (D2) did not change, except for the FUCAS, RAVLT, and phonemic fluency tests, since both groups resulted in a larger deterioration difference (D2) in these tests. Additionally, three path models examining the direct relationships between performance in tests measuring mood, as well as everyday functioning and cognitive measures, showed that participants’ worsened performance in the 2019 and 2020 assessments was strongly affected by NPI performance, in sharp contrast to the 2018 assessment. Discussion: During the lockdown period, MCI and ADD patients’ neuropsychological performance did not change, except from the tests measuring verbal memory, learning, and phonemic fluency, as well as everyday functioning. However, the natural progression of the MCI as well as ADD condition is the main reason for participants’ deterioration. Mood performance became increasingly closely related to cognition and everyday functioning. Hence, the role of quarantine and AD progression are discussed as potential factors associated with impairments.</p>

	<p>Futile recanalization remains a significant challenge for endovascular treatment (EVT) of acute ischemic stroke (AIS). The inflammatory response that occurs after cerebral infarct plays a central role in stroke pathobiology that can influence the outcome of a recanalization procedure. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between the systemic inflammatory response index (SIRI) and futile recanalization in patients with AIS. We retrospectively identified consecutive patients with ischemic stroke due to proximal arterial occlusion in the anterior circulation, who were treated with EVT and achieved near-complete or complete recanalization. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC), absolute monocyte count (AMC), and absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) were collected from admission blood work to calculate SIRI as ANC × AMC/ALC. The study outcome was futile recanalization, defined as poor functional status [modified Rankin scale (mRS) score ≥ 3] at 3 months despite complete or near-complete recanalization. A total of 184 patients were included. Futile recanalization was observed in 110 (59.8%) patients. Older patients (odds ratio (OR) = 1.07, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.04–1.10, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), higher admission National Institutes of Health stroke scale score (OR = 1.10, 95% CI: 1.02–1.19, p = 0.013), and higher admission SIRI (OR = 1.08, 95% CI: 1.01–1.17, p = 0.028) increased the risk of the poor outcome at 3 months despite complete or near-complete recanalization.</p>

	<p>Binge-eating refers to episodes of uncontrolled eating accompanied by a perceived loss of control, which can be common in the general population. Given the profound negative consequences of persistent binge-eating such as weight and eating disorders, it is vital to determine what makes someone more vulnerable than others to engage in such a conduct. A total of 42 normal-weight individuals (21 with binge-eating episodes and 21 without binge-eating episodes) underwent a structural magnetic resonance imaging measurement and Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) was used to assess between-group differences in terms of gray matter volume (GMV), together with self-report impulsivity and binge-eating measures. The results showed binge-eating individuals as characterized by higher trait impulsivity and greater regional GMV in the left middle frontal gyrus: however, the GMV in this region appeared to be positively correlated only with measures of binge-eating but not with trait impulsivity measures. These findings provide novel insights on the neurobiological roots of BE in normal-weight individuals and highlight how this behavior can be associated with brain morphometric changes within prefrontal regions also in a non-clinical population. Overall, this study provides a further characterization of the neural correlates of binge-eating and novel insights into the treatment of its more severe pathological forms.</p>

	<p>Children with unilateral spastic cerebral palsy (USCP) have impairments in motor planning, impacting their ability to grasp objects. We examined the planning of digit position and force and the flexibility of the motor system in covarying these during object manipulation. Eleven children with a left hemisphere lesion (LHL), nine children with a right hemisphere lesion (RHL) and nine typically developing children (controls) participated in the study. Participants were instructed to use a precision grip with their dominant/less affected hand to lift and keep an object level, with either a left, centered or right center of mass (COM) location. Digit positions, forces, compensatory torque and object roll where measured. Although children with USCP generated a compensatory torque and modulated digit placement by lift-off, their index finger was either collinear or higher than the thumb, regardless of COM location, leading to larger rolls after lift-off especially for the RHL group. The findings suggest that while the kinetics of grasp control is intact, the kinematics of grasp control is impaired. This study adds to the understanding of the underlying mechanisms of anticipatory planning and control of grasp in children with USCP and may provide insights on how to improve hand function in children with USCP.</p>

	<p>Prior to this study, the prevalence of obstructive sleep apnoea/hypopnoea syndrome (OSAHS) in adults with Down syndrome was unknown. We hypothesized that unrecognised OSAHS could have an additional deleterious impact on mood and behavioural disturbances in this group of people. Aims: To assess the prevalence of OSAHS in adults with Down syndrome in the United Kingdom, subjectively and objectively, and ascertain its association with diurnal behavioural disturbances. Method: Cross-sectional questionnaire study with home sleep apnoea testing (HSAT) during 2011–2015 across the four nations of the United Kingdom. Participants were adults aged ≥16 years with Down syndrome. Main outcome measures were: self- or caregiver-completed questionnaire data, including the Pictorial Epworth Sleepiness Scale (pESS), selected domains of the Developmental Behavioural Checklist for Adults (DBC-A), anthropometric measures, and symptoms of OSAHS. Objective prevalence was undertaken in a sample of responders using HSAT. Results: Responses were received from 1321/5270 participants (25%), with 1105 valid responses (21%). Eighty-one participants (7%) reported a prior diagnosis of OSA, of whom 38 were receiving therapy. Using validated algorithms, a diagnosis of OSAHS was probable in 366 participants (35%), who were younger, with higher BMI and higher mean total pESS (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001). A total of 23% of participants had a pESS &amp;amp;gt; 10. OSAHS was a strong marker for behavioural disturbances on the DBC-A depression, disruption and anti-social subscales (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Of 149 individuals who underwent HSAT, 42% were diagnosed with OSAHS. Conclusions: Untreated OSAHS in Down syndrome is common and associated with behavioural and mood disturbances. Improving awareness of OSAHS amongst adults with Down syndrome, their families and healthcare professionals is essential.</p>

	<p>Visceral adipose tissue accumulation is an important determinant of metabolic risk and can be estimated by the visceral adiposity index (VAI). Visceral adiposity may impact brain regions involved in eating behavior. We aimed to examine the association between adiposity measurements, binge eating behavior, and grey matter density. In 20 men and 59 women with severe obesity, Grey matter density was measured by voxel-based morphometry for six regions of interest associated with reward, emotion, or self-regulation: insula, orbitofrontal cortex, caudal and rostral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Binge eating behavior, depression and impulsivity was assessed by the Binge Eating Scale, Beck Depression Inventory and UPPS Impulsive Behavior Scale, respectively. Men and women were distinctively divided into two subgroups (low-VAI and high-VAI) based on the mean VAI score. Women with high-VAI were characterized by metabolic alterations, higher binge eating score and lower grey matter density in the caudal ACC compared to women with low-VAI. Men with high-VAI were characterized by a higher score for the sensation-seeking subscale of the UPPS–Impulsive Behavior Scale compared to men with low-VAI. Using a moderation–mediation analysis, we found that grey matter density in the caudal ACC mediates the association between VAI and binge eating score. In conclusion, visceral adiposity is associated with higher binge eating severity in women. Decreased grey matter density in the caudal ACC, a region involved in cognition and emotion regulation, may influence this relationship.</p>

	<p>Co-rumination has consistently been shown to be maladaptive in the context of emotional well-being. However, not much is known about factors that predict one’s tendency to co-ruminate. The current study investigated temperament, attachment, and gender as predictors of co-rumination trajectories in a sample of 1549 early and middle adolescents from fifth to ninth grade (53.4% girls; Mage = 12.93). Analyses were performed on four waves of data with one-year intervals using multi-level modeling. First, girls were found to be more likely to co-ruminate. Second, high positive affectivity in boys and girls and high effortful control in boys was related to higher co-rumination. Third, high attachment anxiety and high general trust in the availability and support of a mother were predictive of higher co-rumination levels. High attachment avoidance was negatively related to co-rumination in boys. High positive affectivity in boys and girls and high trust in boys predicted decreases in reported co-rumination levels over time. Results highlight differences between boys and girls in factors that predict the tendency to co-ruminate. The current study adds to the literature by helping to identify factors associated with the development of co-rumination, which is a well-established risk factor of internalizing symptoms. Monitoring youth affected with these vulnerabilities may be recommended for prevention efforts.</p>

	<p>Event-related mu-rhythm activity has become a common tool for the investigation of different socio-cognitive processes in pediatric populations. The estimation of the mu-rhythm desynchronization/synchronization (mu-ERD/ERS) in a specific task is usually computed in relation to a baseline condition. In the present study, we investigated the effect that different types of baseline might have on toddler mu-ERD/ERS related to an action observation (AO) and action execution (AE) task. Specifically, we compared mu-ERD/ERS values computed using as a baseline: (1) the observation of a static image (BL1) and (2) a period of stillness (BL2). Our results showed that the majority of the subjects suppressed the mu-rhythm in response to the task and presented a greater mu-ERD for one of the two baselines. In some cases, one of the two baselines was not even able to produce a significant mu-ERD, and the preferred baseline varied among subjects even if most of them were more sensitive to the BL1, thus suggesting that this could be a good baseline to elicit mu-rhythm modulations in toddlers. These results recommended some considerations for the design and analysis of mu-rhythm studies involving pediatric subjects: in particular, the importance of verifying the mu-rhythm activity during baseline, the relevance of single-subject analysis, the possibility of including more than one baseline condition, and caution in the choice of the baseline and in the interpretation of the results of studies investigating mu-rhythm activity in pediatric populations.</p>

	<p>Cognitive impairment has been linked to reduced self-reporting of pain. However, it is unclear whether the various cognitive functions are similarly and/or independently associated with such pain report measures. In the present study, we explored how executive functioning (EF), memory, and global cognition relate to self-reported pain and investigated whether underlying neuropathology partially accounts for these results. We used Lasso categorical regression to analyze data from 179 individuals visiting a memory clinic. The data included the self-reported pain occurrence, intensity, severity and frequency, clinical diagnoses, neuropsychological scores, white matter hyperintensities, medial temporal lobe atrophy, depressive symptoms, and demographics. Our results showed that worse memory and EF performance predicted a lower pain occurrence. In those individuals who did report pain, worse memory predicted lower pain intensity, severity, and frequency levels, but for EF reversed effects were found, with worse EF predicting higher pain scores. These relationships were only partially explained by reductions in white matter and medial temporal lobe integrity. Similar effects were found for depressive symptoms. Our findings highlight the distinct associations of EF and memory with self-reported pain. A similar pattern of relationships found for both self-reported pain and depressive symptoms may reflect shared latent affective components.</p>

                <p>Pain is a under-recognized association of leucine-rich glioma-inactivated 1 (LGI1) and contactin-associated protein-like 2 (CASPR2) antibodies. Of 147 patients with these autoantibodies, pain was experienced by 17 of 33 (52%) with CASPR2- versus 20 of 108 (19%) with LGI1 antibodies (<i>p</i> = 0.0005), and identified as neuropathic in 89% versus 58% of these, respectively. Typically, in both cohorts, normal nerve conduction studies and reduced intraepidermal nerve fiber densities were observed in the sampled patient subsets. In LGI1 antibody patients, pain responded to immunotherapy (<i>p</i> = 0.008), often rapidly, with greater residual patient-rated impairment observed in CASPR2 antibody patients (<i>p</i> = 0.019). Serum CASPR2 antibodies, but not LGI1 antibodies, bound in vitro to unmyelinated human sensory neurons and rodent dorsal root ganglia, suggesting pathophysiological differences that may underlie our clinical observations.

Learning, salient experiences, and stimulation of neuronal activity induce new myelin formation in rodents, and in animal models of demyelination, remyelination can be enhanced via experience- and activity-dependent mechanisms. Furthermore, preliminary studies in MS patients support the use of neuromodulation and rehabilitation exercises for symptomatic improvement, suggesting that these interventions may represent nonpharmacological strategies for promoting remyelination.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Targeted pandemic containment through identifying local contact network bottlenecks</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Shenghao Yang, Priyabrata Senapati, Di Wang, Chris T. Bauch, Kimon Fountoulakis</p>

Decision-making about pandemic mitigation often relies upon simulation modelling. Models of disease transmission through networks of contacts–between individuals or between population centres–are increasingly used for these purposes. Real-world contact networks are rich in structural features that influence infection transmission, such as tightly-knit local communities that are weakly connected to one another. In this paper, we propose a new flow-based edge-betweenness centrality method for detecting bottleneck edges that connect nodes in contact networks. In particular, we utilize convex optimization formulations based on the idea of diffusion with p-norm network flow. Using simulation models of COVID-19 transmission through real network data at both individual and county levels, we demonstrate that targeting bottleneck edges identified by the proposed method reduces the number of infected cases by up to 10% more than state-of-the-art edge-betweenness methods. Furthermore, the proposed method is orders of magnitude faster than existing methods.

                <p>by Tyler Cassidy, Daniel Nichol, Mark Robertson-Tessi, Morgan Craig, Alexander R. A. Anderson</p>

Intra-tumour heterogeneity is a leading cause of treatment failure and disease progression in cancer. While genetic mutations have long been accepted as a primary mechanism of generating this heterogeneity, the role of phenotypic plasticity is becoming increasingly apparent as a driver of intra-tumour heterogeneity. Consequently, understanding the role of this plasticity in treatment resistance and failure is a key component of improving cancer therapy. We develop a mathematical model of stochastic phenotype switching that tracks the evolution of drug-sensitive and drug-tolerant subpopulations to clarify the role of phenotype switching on population growth rates and tumour persistence. By including cytotoxic therapy in the model, we show that, depending on the strategy of the drug-tolerant subpopulation, stochastic phenotype switching can lead to either transient or permanent drug resistance. We study the role of phenotypic heterogeneity in a drug-resistant, genetically homogeneous population of non-small cell lung cancer cells to derive a rational treatment schedule that drives population extinction and avoids competitive release of the drug-tolerant sub-population. This model-informed therapeutic schedule results in increased treatment efficacy when compared against periodic therapy, and, most importantly, sustained tumour decay without the development of resistance.

The identification of subnetworks of interest—or active modules—by integrating biological networks with molecular profiles is a key resource to inform on the processes perturbed in different cellular conditions. We here propose MOGAMUN, a Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm to identify active modules in MUltiplex biological Networks. MOGAMUN optimizes both the density of interactions and the scores of the nodes (e.g., their differential expression). We compare MOGAMUN with state-of-the-art methods, representative of different algorithms dedicated to the identification of active modules in single networks. MOGAMUN identifies dense and high-scoring modules that are also easier to interpret. In addition, to our knowledge, MOGAMUN is the first method able to use multiplex networks. Multiplex networks are composed of different layers of physical and functional relationships between genes and proteins. Each layer is associated to its own meaning, topology, and biases; the multiplex framework allows exploiting this diversity of biological networks. We applied MOGAMUN to identify cellular processes perturbed in Facio-Scapulo-Humeral muscular Dystrophy, by integrating RNA-seq expression data with a multiplex biological network. We identified different active modules of interest, thereby providing new angles for investigating the pathomechanisms of this disease.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Critical behaviour of the stochastic Wilson-Cowan model</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Antonio de Candia, Alessandro Sarracino, Ilenia Apicella, Lucilla de Arcangelis</p>

Spontaneous brain activity is characterized by bursts and avalanche-like dynamics, with scale-free features typical of critical behaviour. The stochastic version of the celebrated Wilson-Cowan model has been widely studied as a system of spiking neurons reproducing non-trivial features of the neural activity, from avalanche dynamics to oscillatory behaviours. However, to what extent such phenomena are related to the presence of a genuine critical point remains elusive. Here we address this central issue, providing analytical results in the linear approximation and extensive numerical analysis. In particular, we present results supporting the existence of a bona fide critical point, where a second-order-like phase transition occurs, characterized by scale-free avalanche dynamics, scaling with the system size and a diverging relaxation time-scale. Moreover, our study shows that the observed critical behaviour falls within the universality class of the mean-field branching process, where the exponents of the avalanche size and duration distributions are, respectively, 3/2 and 2. We also provide an accurate analysis of the system behaviour as a function of the total number of neurons, focusing on the time correlation functions of the firing rate in a wide range of the parameter space.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Conjunctive spatial and self-motion codes are topographically organized in the GABAergic cells of the lateral septum</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Suzanne van der Veldt, Guillaume Etter, Coralie-Anne Mosser, Frédéric Manseau, Sylvain Williams</p>

The hippocampal spatial code’s relevance for downstream neuronal populations—particularly its major subcortical output the lateral septum (LS)—is still poorly understood. Here, using calcium imaging combined with unbiased analytical methods, we functionally characterized and compared the spatial tuning of LS GABAergic cells to those of dorsal CA3 and CA1 cells. We identified a significant number of LS cells that are modulated by place, speed, acceleration, and direction, as well as conjunctions of these properties, directly comparable to hippocampal CA1 and CA3 spatially modulated cells. Interestingly, Bayesian decoding of position based on LS spatial cells reflected the animal’s location as accurately as decoding using the activity of hippocampal pyramidal cells. A portion of LS cells showed stable spatial codes over the course of multiple days, potentially reflecting long-term episodic memory. The distributions of cells exhibiting these properties formed gradients along the anterior–posterior and dorsal–ventral axes of the LS, directly reflecting the topographical organization of hippocampal inputs to the LS. Finally, we show using transsynaptic tracing that LS neurons receiving CA3 and CA1 excitatory input send projections to the hypothalamus and medial septum, regions that are not targeted directly by principal cells of the dorsal hippocampus. Together, our findings demonstrate that the LS accurately and robustly represents spatial, directional as well as self-motion information and is uniquely positioned to relay this information from the hippocampus to its downstream regions, thus occupying a key position within a distributed spatial memory network.

<p>Cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) is an uncommon form of stroke affecting mostly young individuals. Although genetic factors are thought to play a role in this cerebrovascular condition, its genetic etiology is not well understood.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Genome-wide association study performed to identify genetic variants influencing susceptibility to CVT. A two-stage genome-wide study was undertaken in 882 Europeans diagnosed with CVT and 1205 ethnicity-matched control subjects divided into discovery and independent replication datasets.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In the overall case–control cohort, we identified highly significant associations with 37 SNPs within 9q34.2 region. The strongest association was with rs8176645 (combined <i>P</i> = 9.15 × 10<sup>−24</sup>; OR = 2.01, 95%CI: 1.76–2.31). The discovery set findings were validated across an independent European cohort. Genetic risk score for this 9q34.2 region increases CVT risk by a pooled estimate OR = 2.65 (95%CI: 2.21–3.20, <i>P</i> = 2.00 × 10<sup>−16</sup>). SNPs within this region were in strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) with coding regions of the <i>ABO</i> gene. <i>ABO</i> blood group was determined using allele combination of SNPs rs8176746 and rs8176645. Blood groups A, B or AB, were at 2.85 times (95%CI: 2.32–3.52, <i>P</i> = 2.00 × 10<sup>−16</sup>) increased risk of CVT compared with individuals with blood group-O.</p>


<h2>Interpretation.</h2>
<p>We present the first chromosomal region to robustly associate with a genetic susceptibility to CVT. This region more than doubles the likelihood of CVT, a risk greater than any previously identified thrombophilia genetic risk marker. That the identified variant is in strong LD with the coding region of the <i>ABO</i> gene with differences in blood group prevalence provides important new insights into the pathophysiology of CVT.</p>

                Excitation and inhibition are balanced or cancel out in cerebral cortex. Ahmadian and Miller distinguish tight versus loose balance, according to the size of the residual after cancellation. They show this critically affects cortical dynamics, and summarize evidence strongly supporting loose balance.

                The molecular mechanisms underlying the stability of mature neurons and neural circuits are poorly understood. Here we explore this problem and discover that the Hox genes are a component of the genetic programme that maintains normal neural function in adult Drosophila. We show that post-developmental downregulation of the Hox gene Ultrabithorax (Ubx) in adult neurons leads to substantial anomalies in flight. Mapping the cellular basis of these effects reveals that Ubx is required within a subset of dopaminergic neurons, and cell circuitry analyses and optogenetics allow us to link these dopaminergic neurons to flight control. Functional imaging experiments show that Ubx is necessary for normal dopaminergic activity, and neuron-specific RNA-sequencing defines two previously uncharacterised ion channel-encoding genes as potential mediators of Ubx behavioural roles. Our study thus reveals a novel role of the Hox system in controlling adult behaviour and neural function.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Simple Model for Encoding Natural Images by Retinal Ganglion Cells with Nonlinear Spatial Integration</a></h4>

              
                A central goal in sensory neuroscience is to understand the neuronal signal processing involved in the encoding of natural stimuli. A critical step towards this goal is the development of successful computational models of this encoding. For ganglion cells in the vertebrate retina, the development of satisfactory models for responses to natural visual scenes is an ongoing challenge. Standard models typically apply linear integration of visual stimuli over space, yet many ganglion cells are known to show nonlinear spatial integration in natural stimulus contexts. We here study the encoding of natural images by retinal ganglion cells, using multielectrode-array recordings from isolated salamander retinas. We assess how responses to natural and blurred images depend on first- and second-order statistics of spatial patterns inside the receptive field. This leads us to a simple extension of current standard ganglion cell models, which are based on linear spatial integration. We show that taking not only the weighted average of light intensity inside the receptive field into account but also its variance over space yields substantially improved response predictions of responses to novel images. Finally, we demonstrate how this model framework can be used to assess the spatial scale of nonlinear spatial integration. Our results underscore the importance of nonlinear spatial stimulus integration in the retina in responses to natural images. Furthermore, the introduced model framework provides a simple, yet powerful extension of standard models and may serve as a benchmark for the development of more detailed models of the nonlinear structure of receptive fields.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Resting-state network topology characterizing callous-unemotional traits in adolescence</a></h4>

              
                Background: Callous-unemotional (CU) traits, a youth antisocial phenotype, are hypothesized to associate with aberrant connectivity (dis-integration) across the salience (SAL), default mode (DMN), and frontoparietal (FPN) networks. However, CU traits have a heterogeneous presentation and previous research has not modeled individual heterogeneity in resting-state connectivity amongst adolescents with CU traits. The present study models individual-specific network maps and examines topological features of individual and subgroup maps in relation to CU traits. Methods: Participants aged 13-17 completed resting-state functional connectivity and the inventory of callous-unemotional traits as part of the Nathan Klein Rockland study. A sparse network approach (GIMME) was used to derive individual-level and subgroup maps of all participants. We then examined heterogeneous network features associated with CU traits. Results: Higher rates of CU traits increased probability of inclusion in one subgroup, which had the highest mean level of CU traits. Analysis of network features reveals less density within the FPN and greater density between DMN-FPN associated with CU traits. Discussion: Findings indicate heterogenous person-specific connections and some subgroup connections amongst adolescents associate with CU traits. Higher CU traits associate with lower density in the FPN, which has been associated with attention and inhibition, and higher density between the DMN-FPN, which have been linked with cognitive control, social working memory, and empathy. Our findings suggest less efficiency in FPN function which, when considered mechanistically, could result in difficulty suppressing DMN when task-positive networks are engaged. This is an area for further exploration but could explain cognitive and socio-affective impairments in CU traits.

                Handedness influences differences in lateralization of language areas as well as dominance of motor and somatosensory cortices. However, differences in whole brain functional organization due to handedness have been relatively understudied beyond pre-specified networks of interest. Functional connectivity offers the ability to unravel differences in the functional organization of the whole brain. Here, we compared connectivity profiles of left- and right-handed individuals using data-driven parcellations of the whole brain. We explored differences in connectivity profiles of previously established regions of interest, and showed functional organization differences between primarily left- and primarily right-handed individuals in the motor, somatosensory, and language areas using functional connectivity. We then proceeded to investigate these differences in the whole brain and found that the functional organization of left- and right-handed individuals are not specific to regions of interest. In particular, we found that connections between and within-hemispheres and the cerebellum show distinct patterns of connectivity. Together these results shed light on regions of the brain beyond those traditionally explored that contribute to differences in the functional organization of left- and right-handed individuals.

	<p>The current study examines neural responses to satiety- and fasting-related volatiles and their effect on the processing of body shapes. Axillary sweat was sampled with cotton pads from 10 individuals after 12 h of fasting, and after having consumed a standard breakfast. Pure cotton pads served as the control. The chemosensory stimuli were presented to 20 participants (via a constant-flow olfactometer) exclusively, and additionally as context to images of overweight and underweight avatars. EEG was recorded (61 electrodes), and chemosensory (CSERPs; P1, N1, P2, P3) and visual event-related potentials (VERPs; N1, P2, P3a, P3b) were analyzed. The amplitudes of all positive CSERP components differed more strongly from cotton in response to chemosensory satiety cues as compared to fasting cues (P1: p = 0.023, P2: p = 0.083, P3: p = 0.031), paralleled by activity within the middle frontal and temporal gyrus. Overweight compared to underweight body shapes tended to elicit larger VERP P2 amplitudes (p = 0.068), and chemosensory satiety cues amplified the VERP amplitudes in response to any body shape (P2, P3a, P3b; all ps ≤ 0.017) as compared to the cotton control. The results indicate that chemosensory satiety cues transmit complex social information, overriding the processing of analogous visual input.</p>

	<p>The purpose of this study was to explore the association of cognition with hazardous drinking and alcohol-related disorder in persons with bipolar disorder (BD). The study population included 1268 persons from Finland with bipolar disorder. Alcohol use was assessed through hazardous drinking and alcohol-related disorder including alcohol use disorder (AUD). Hazardous drinking was screened with the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test for Consumption (AUDIT-C) screening tool. Alcohol-related disorder diagnoses were obtained from the national registrar data. Participants performed two computerized tasks from the Cambridge Automated Neuropsychological Test Battery (CANTAB) on A tablet computer: the 5-choice serial reaction time task, or reaction time (RT) test and the Paired Associative Learning (PAL) test. Depressive symptoms were assessed with the Mental Health Inventory with five items (MHI-5). However, no assessment of current manic symptoms was available. Association between RT-test and alcohol use was analyzed with log-linear regression, and eβ with 95% confidence intervals (CI) are reported. PAL first trial memory score was analyzed with linear regression, and β with 95% CI are reported. PAL total errors adjusted was analyzed with logistic regression and odds ratios (OR) with 95% CI are reported. After adjustment of age, education, housing status and depression, hazardous drinking was associated with lower median and less variable RT in females while AUD was associated with a poorer PAL test performance in terms of the total errors adjusted scores in females. Our findings of positive associations between alcohol use and cognition in persons with bipolar disorder are difficult to explain because of the methodological flaw of not being able to separately assess only participants in euthymic phase.</p>

	<p>Background: Attachment and emotion regulation play a decisive role in the developmental pathways of adaptation or maladaptation. This study tested concurrent and longitudinal associations between the attachment to mother and father, sadness regulation, and depressive symptoms. Methods: A total of 1110 participants from middle childhood to adolescence completed measures of attachment, emotion regulation, and depressive symptomatology. In total, 307 of them participated in the longitudinal assessment. Results: Results revealed attachment affects emotion regulation strategies and depressive symptoms. Furthermore, we found linear effects of the cumulative number of secure attachment relationships on adaptive and maladaptive deactivating sadness regulation, as well as on depressive symptoms. Longitudinal analysis showed the significant mediating role of sadness regulation in the relationship between attachment and depressive symptoms. Conclusions: Adaptive and maladaptive deactivating sadness regulation explain the longitudinal effects of attachment on depressive symptoms. Insecurely attached children and adolescents use maladaptive and adaptive sadness regulation strategies, but differ in their hierarchy of strategy use.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Deep brain stimulation in the subthalamic nucleus for Parkinson's disease can restore dynamics of striatal networks</a></h4>

              
                Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is highly effective in alleviating movement disability in patients with Parkinsons disease (PD). However, its therapeutic mechanism of action is unknown. The healthy striatum exhibits rich dynamics resulting from an interaction of beta, gamma and theta oscillations. These rhythms are at the heart of selection, initiation and execution of motor programs, and their loss or exaggeration due to dopamine (DA) depletion in PD is a major source of the behavioral deficits observed in PD patients. Interrupting abnormal rhythms and restoring the interaction of rhythms as observed in the healthy striatum may then be instrumental in the therapeutic action of DBS. We develop a biophysical networked model of a BG pathway to study how abnormal beta oscillations can emerge throughout the BG in PD, and how DBS can restore normal beta, gamma and theta striatal rhythms. Our model incorporates STN projections to the striatum, long known but understudied, that were recently shown to preferentially target fast spiking interneurons (FSI) in the striatum. We find that DBS in STN is able to normalize striatal medium spiny neuron (MSN) activity by recruiting FSI dynamics, and restoring the inhibitory potency of FSIs observed in normal condition. We also find that DBS allows the re-expression of gamma and theta rhythms, thought to be dependent on high DA levels and thus lost in PD, through cortical noise control. Our study shows how BG connectivity can amplify beta oscillations, and delineates the role of DBS in disrupting beta oscillations and providing corrective input to STN efferents to restore healthy striatal dynamics. It also suggests how gamma oscillations can be leveraged to enhance or supplement DBS treatment and improve its effectiveness.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Grid-cell modules remain coordinated when neural activity is dissociated from external sensory cues</a></h4>

              
                The representation of an animals position in the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) is distributed across several modules of grid cells, each characterized by a distinct spatial scale. The population activity within each module is tightly coordinated and preserved across environments and behavioral states. Little is known, however, about the coordination of activity patterns across modules. We analyzed the joint activity patterns of hundreds of grid cells simultaneously recorded in animals that were foraging either in the light, when sensory cues could stabilize the representation, or in darkness, when such stabilization was disrupted. We found that the states of different grid modules are tightly coordinated, even in darkness, when the internal representation of position within the MEC deviates substantially from the true position of the animal. These findings suggest that internal brain mechanisms dynamically coordinate the representation of position in different modules, to ensure that grid cells jointly encode a coherent and smooth trajectory of the animal.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cholinergic interneurons mediate cocaine extinction through similar plasticity across medium spiny neuron subtypes</a></h4>

              
                Cholinergic interneurons (ChINs) in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) have been implicated in the acquisition and extinction of drug associations, as well as related plasticity in medium spiny neurons (MSNs). However, since most previous work has relied on artificial manipulations, if and how endogenous patterns of cholinergic signaling relate to drug associations is unknown. Moreover, despite great interest in the opposing effects of dopamine on MSN subtypes, whether ChIN-mediated effects are similar or different across MSN subtypes is also unknown. Here, we find that endogenous acetylcholine event frequency during extinction negatively correlates with the strength and persistence of cocaine-context associations across individuals, consistent with effects of artificial manipulation of ChIN activity during extinction. Moreover, ChIN activation during extinction produces a reduction in excitatory synaptic strength on both MSN subtypes, similar to the effect of multiple extinction sessions in the absence of ChIN manipulations. Together, our findings indicate that natural variation in NAc acetylcholine may contribute to individual differences in drug-context extinction by modulating glutamatergic presynaptic strength similarly at both D1R and D2R MSN subtypes.

	<p>Memory for odors is believed to be longer-lasting than memory for visual stimuli, as is evidenced by flat forgetting curves. However, performance on memory tasks is typically weaker in olfaction than vision. Studies of odor memory that use forced-choice methods confound responses that are a result of a trace memory and responses that can be obtained through process of elimination. Moreover, odor memory is typically measured with common stimuli, which are more familiar and responses may be confounded by verbal memory, and measure memory in intentional learning conditions, which are ecologically questionable. Here we demonstrate the value of using tests of memory in which hit rate and correct rejection rate are evaluated separately (i.e., not using forced-choice methods) and uncommon stimuli are used. This study compared memory for common and uncommon odors and pictures that were learned either intentionally (Exp. 1) or incidentally (Exp. 2) and tested with either a forced-choice or a one-stimulus-at-a-time (“monadic”) recognition task after delays of 15 min, 48 h or 1 week. As expected, memory declined with delay in most conditions, but depended upon the particular measure of memory and was better for pictures than odors and for common than uncommon stimuli. For common odors, hit rates decreased with delay but correct rejection rates remained constant with delay. For common pictures, we found the opposite result, constant hit rates and decreased correct rejection rates. Our results support the ‘misfit theory of conscious olfactory perception’, which highlights the importance of the detection of novelty in olfactory memory and suggests that olfactory memory should be studied using more ecologically valid methods.</p>

	<p>It is widely acknowledged that obesity is a growing public clinical issue involving both physical and psychological well-being. Nevertheless, the relationship between psychological features and weight gain is still unclear. Although emotional eating (EE) and personality traits are considered significant predictors of eating disorders, their role in obesity without eating disorders (OB-wed) is far from proven. The present study aimed at investigating the cumulative effect of EE and personality traits on overeating behavior in a sample of 266 university students (169 female; mean age = 21.85, SD = 2.39) stratified based on their body mass index (BMI; normal weight, overweight, obese). They were enrolled during free screening days promoted by the Human Dietetic and Sport Service of a Southern Italian university. The results show a psychological pattern of increasing overeating behavior and lower Self-Directedness combined with higher Sadness and Anger. However, OB-wed subjects overate regardless of this emotional/personological configuration.</p>

	<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is characterised by widespread damage of the central nervous system that includes alterations in normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) and demyelinating white matter (WM) lesions. Neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) has been proposed to provide a precise characterisation of WM microstructures. NODDI maps can be calculated for the Neurite Density Index (NDI) and Orientation Dispersion Index (ODI), which estimate orientation dispersion and neurite density. Although NODDI has not been widely applied in MS, this technique is promising in investigating the complexity of MS pathology, as it is more specific than diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in capturing microstructural alterations. We conducted a meta-analysis of studies using NODDI metrics to assess brain microstructural changes and neuroaxonal pathology in WM lesions and NAWM in patients with MS. Three reviewers conducted a literature search of four electronic databases. We performed a random-effect meta-analysis and the extent of between-study heterogeneity was assessed with the I2 statistic. Funnel plots and Egger’s tests were used to assess publication bias. We identified seven studies analysing 374 participants (202 MS and 172 controls). The NDI in WM lesions and NAWM were significantly reduced compared to healthy WM and the standardised mean difference of each was −3.08 (95%CI −4.22 to (−1.95), p ≤ 0.00001, I2 = 88%) and −0.70 (95%CI −0.99 to (−0.40), p ≤ 0.00001, I2 = 35%), respectively. There was no statistically significant difference of the ODI in MS WM lesions and NAWM compared to healthy controls. This systematic review and meta-analysis confirmed that the NDI is significantly reduced in MS lesions and NAWM than in WM from healthy participants, corresponding to reduced intracellular signal fraction, which may reflect underlying damage or loss of neurites.</p>

	<p>Nance-Horan syndrome (NHS) is a rare X-linked developmental disorder caused mainly by loss of function variants in the NHS gene. NHS is characterized by congenital cataracts, dental anomalies, and distinctive facial features, and a proportion of the affected individuals also present intellectual disability and congenital cardiopathies. Despite identification of at least 40 distinct hemizygous variants leading to NHS, genotype-phenotype correlations remain largely elusive. In this study, we describe a Sicilian family affected with congenital cataracts and dental anomalies and diagnosed with NHS by whole-exome sequencing (WES). The affected boy from this family presented a late regression of cognitive, motor, language, and adaptive skills, as well as broad behavioral anomalies. Furthermore, brain imaging showed corpus callosum anomalies and periventricular leukoencephalopathy. We expand the phenotypic and mutational NHS spectrum and review potential disease mechanisms underlying the central neurological anomalies and the potential neurodevelopmental features associated with NHS.</p>

	<p>Alcohol dependence is associated with adverse consequences of alcohol (ethanol) use and is evident in most severe cases of alcohol use disorder (AUD). The central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) plays a critical role in the development of alcohol dependence and escalation of alcohol consumption in dependent subjects. Molecular mechanisms underlying the CeA-driven behavioral changes are not well understood. Here, we examined the effects of alcohol on global gene expression in the CeA using a chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) vapor model in rats and RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq). The CIE procedure resulted in robust changes in CeA gene expression during intoxication, as the number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was significantly greater than those expected by chance. Over-representation analysis of cell types, functional groups and molecular pathways revealed biological categories potentially important for the development of alcohol dependence in our model. Genes specific for astrocytes, myelinating oligodendrocytes, and endothelial cells were over-represented in the DEG category, suggesting that these cell types were particularly affected by the CIE procedure. The majority of the over-represented functional groups and molecular pathways were directly related to the functions of glial and endothelial cells, including extracellular matrix (ECM) organization, myelination, and the regulation of innate immune response. A coordinated regulation of several ECM metalloproteinases (e.g., Mmp2; Mmp14), their substrates (e.g., multiple collagen genes and myelin basic protein; Mbp), and a metalloproteinase inhibitor, Reck, suggests a specific mechanism for ECM re-organization in response to chronic alcohol, which may modulate neuronal activity and result in behavioral changes, such as an escalation of alcohol drinking. Our results highlight the importance of glial and endothelial cells in the effects of chronic alcohol exposure on the CeA, and demonstrate further insight into the molecular mechanisms of alcohol dependence in rats. These molecular targets may be used in future studies to develop therapeutics to treat AUD.</p>

	<p>Exposure to acute stress elicit physiological and psychological responses that can impact decision-making, often expressed as an increased tendency to act in an impulsive manner following stress. Delay discounting (DD) task has emerged as a reliable measure of impulsive behavior in the form of choice impulsivity (CI). Interestingly, studies that examined the effect of acute stress on DD performance reported mixed results. To address this, we conducted a within-subject examination of the impact of acute stress on CI, focusing on individual differences in response patterns. One hundred and fifty healthy female participants completed the DD task twice, before and after undergoing an acute laboratory stress induction procedure. Saliva samples and self-report mood and affect measures were collected at four time points throughout the session. Fifty-nine matched healthy control participants completed only the DD task twice, with no stress in between. Results indicate that the acute stress procedure elicited the expected effects of increased cortisol release and increased negative mood and affect, at the group level. With respect to DD, stress indeed increased CI at the group level, yet participants differed in the magnitude and direction of this effect. Interestingly, regression analysis revealed quadratic relations between stress-induced changes in CI and cortisol release. Indeed, dividing the sample into three sub-groups based on the impact of stress on CI revealed that, compared to participants that exhibited no substantial change in their CI following stress, participants that exhibited either stress-induced increase or decrease in their CI also exhibited more stress-induced cortisol release, as well as more negative affect. Taken together, these findings suggest that elevated physiological and psychological responses to stress are associated with either increased or decreased choice impulsivity, thus depicting quadratic relations between stress and impulsivity.</p>

	<p>There is a large body of literature reporting the prognostic factors for a positive outcome of neurorehabilitation performed in the subacute phase of stroke. Despite the recent development of algorithms based on neural networks or cluster analysis for the identification of these prognostic factors, the literature lacks a rigorous comparison among classical regression, neural network, and cluster analysis. Moreover, the three methods have rarely been tested on a sample independent from that in which prognostic factors have been identified. This study aims at providing this comparison on a wide sample of data (1522 patients) and testing the results on an independent sample (1000 patients) using 30 variables. The accuracy was similar among regression, neural network, and cluster analyses on the analyzed sample (76.6%, 74%, and 76.1%, respectively), but on the test sample, the accuracy of neural network decreased (70.1%). The three models agreed in identifying older age, severe impairment, unilateral spatial neglect, and total anterior circulation infarcts as important prognostic factors. The binary regression analysis also provided solid results in the test sample, especially in terms of specificity (81.8%). Cluster analysis also showed a high sensitivity in the test sample (82.6%) and allowed a meaningful easy-to-use classification tree to be obtained.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A functional network target for tic reduction during thalamic stimulation for Tourette Syndrome</a></h4>

              
                Background: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the medial thalamus is an evolving therapy for severe, treatment-refractory Tourette syndrome (TS). It remains unanswered which functionally connected networks need to be modulated to obtain optimal treatment results. Methods: We assessed treatment response of 15 patients with TS untergoing thalamic DBS six and twelve months postoperatively using the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS) tic score. For each time point, functional connectivity maps seeding from stimulation sites were calculated based on a normative functional connectome derived from 1000 healthy subjects. Resulting maps were analyzed in a voxel-wise mixed model for repeated measurements to identify patterns of connectivity associated with tic reduction. Results: Connectivity of stimulation to the medial frontal cortex, bilateral insulae and sensorimotor cortex was associated with tic reduction. Connectivity with the temporal lobe, cerebellum, ventral striatum and orbitofrontal cortex was negatively associated. The overall connectivity pattern was robust to leave-one-out cross-validation, explaining 25 % of outcome variance (R = 0.500; p = 0.005). Conclusions: We delineated a functional connectivity profile seeding from stimulation sites associated with TS-DBS outcome. This pattern comprised areas linked to the processing of premonitory urges and tic execution, thereby extending our current understanding of effective neuromodulation for TS.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The brain tunes to unfamiliar voices during sleeping</a></h4>

              
                The brain continues to respond selectively to environmental stimuli even during sleep. However, the functional role of such responses, and whether they reflect information processing or rather sensory inhibition is not fully understood. Here, we presented 17 human sleepers (14 females) with their own name and two unfamiliar first names, spoken by either a familiar voice (FV) or an unfamiliar voice (UFV), while recording polysomnography during a full night of sleep. We detected K-complexes, sleep spindles, and micro-arousals, and then assessed event-related potentials, oscillatory power as well as inter-trial phase synchronization in response to the different stimuli presented during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. We show that UFVs evoke more K-complexes and micro-arousals than FVs. When both stimuli evoke a K-complex, we observed larger evoked potentials, higher oscillatory power in the high beta (>16Hz) frequency range, and stronger time-locking in the delta band (1-4 Hz) in response to UFVs relative to FVs. Crucially, these differences in brain responses disappear when no K-complexes are evoked by the auditory stimuli. Our findings highlight discrepancies in brain responses to auditory stimuli based on their relevance to the sleeper and propose a key role for K-complexes in the modulation of sensory processing during sleep. We argue that such content-specific, dynamic reactivity to external sensory information enables the brain to enter a sentinel processing mode in which it engages in the many important processes that are ongoing during sleep while still maintaining the ability to process vital information in the surrounding.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dissociating the Neural Correlates of Planning and Executing Hierarchical Task Sets</a></h4>

              
                Task processing and task representation, two facets of cognitive control, are both supported by lateral frontal cortex (LFC). However, processing and representation have largely been investigated separately, so it is unknown if they are distinguishable aspects of control or if they are complementary descriptions of the same mechanism. Here, we explored this by combining a hierarchical task mapping with a pre-cueing procedure. Participants made match/non-match judgments on features of pairs of stimuli. Cues presented at the start of each trial indicated the judgment domain (spatial/non-spatial), the response hand, both, or neither, giving variable amounts of information to the subject at each time point in the trial. Our results demonstrated that regions throughout LFC supported task processing, indicated by an influence of time point on their BOLD activity levels. A subset of regions in left caudal LFC also supported task representation, indicated by an interaction between time point and cue information; we termed this subgroup the "CuexTime" group. This interaction effect was not seen in the remaining LFC regions, which only showed a main effect of time consistent with involvement in task processing; we termed this subgroup the "Time" group. These results suggest that task representation is one component of task processing, confined to the "CuexTime group" in left caudal LFC, while other regions in our task support other aspects of task processing. We further conducted an exploratory investigation of connectivity between regions in the "CuexTime" and "Time" groups and their potential relationship to networks that support distinct cognitive control functions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A Large-Scale Investigation of White Matter Microstructural Associations with Reading Ability</a></h4>

              
                Reading involves the functioning of a widely distributed brain network, and white matter tracts are responsible for sending information between constituent network nodes. Several studies have analyzed fiber bundle microstructural properties to shed insights into the neural basis of reading abilities and disabilities. Findings have been inconsistent, potentially due to small sample sizes and varying methodology. To address this, we analyzed a large data set of 690 children ages 5-18 using state-of-the-art neuroimaging acquisitions and processing techniques. We searched for associations between fractional anisotropy (FA) and single-word and nonword reading skills in both typical and poor readers across multiple tracts previously thought to contribute to reading. Consistent with prior studies, FA increased with age across all tracts. There were significant correlations between better reading skills and higher FA in several fiber bundles among poor readers, but fewer and occasionally negative associations among proficient readers. The left superior longitudinal fasciculus and arcuate fasciculus unexpectedly exhibited higher FA within those diagnosed with reading disabilities compared to those without a diagnosis, while their right-hemisphere homologs exhibited higher FA in those with higher reading scores, regardless of diagnostic status. These results suggest a different relation between white matter pathways in children with typical reading ability versus those with reading disabilities.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Goal-Dependent Hippocampal Representations Facilitate Self-Control</a></h4>

              
                Mnemonic influences on decision-making processes are important for linking past experiences and simulations of the future with current goals. The ways in which mnemonic information is represented may be especially critical in situations where one needs to overcome past rewarding experiences and exert self-control. We propose that self-control success or failure may depend on how information is retrieved from memory and how effectively this memory retrieval process can be modified to achieve a specific goal. We test our hypothesis using representational similarity analyses of human neuroimaging data during a dietary self-control task in which individuals must overcome taste temptations to choose healthy foods. We find that self-control is indeed associated with the way individuals represent taste information in the brain and how taste representations adapt to align with different goals. These results provide new insights into the processes leading to self-control success and indicate the need to update the classical view of self-control to continue to advance our understanding of its behavioral and neural underpinnings.
