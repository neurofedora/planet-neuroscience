              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Reversing chemorefraction in colorectal cancer cells by controlling mucin secretion</a></h4>

              
                15% of colorectal cancers (CRC) cells exhibit a mucin hypersecretory phenotype, which is suggested to provide resistance to immune surveillance and chemotherapy. We now formally show that colorectal cancer cells build a barrier to chemotherapeutics by increasing mucins' secretion. We show that low levels of KChIP3, a negative regulator of mucin secretion (Cantero-Recasens <i>et al.</i>, 2018), is a risk factor for CRC patients' relapse in subset of untreated tumours. Our results also reveal that cells depleted of KChIP3 are four times more resistant (measured as cell viability and DNA damage) to chemotherapeutics 5-Fluorouracil plus Irinotecan (5-FU+iri.) compared to control cells, whereas KChIP3 overexpressing cells are 10 times more sensitive to killing by chemotherapeutics. Similar increase in tumour cell death is observed upon chemical inhibition of mucin secretion by the sodium/calcium exchanger (NCX) blockers (Mitrovic <i>et al.</i>, 2013). Finally, sensitivity of CRC patient-derived organoids to 5-FU+iri increases 40-fold upon mucin secretion inhibition. Reducing mucin secretion thus provides a means to control chemoresistance of mucinous colorectal cancer cells and other mucinous tumours.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Protein-lipid interaction at low pH induces oligomerization of the MakA cytotoxin from Vibrio cholerae</a></h4>

              
                The α-pore-forming toxins (α-PFTs) from pathogenic bacteria damage host cell membranes by pore formation. We demonstrate a remarkable, hitherto unknown mechanism by an α-PFT protein from <i>Vibrio cholerae</i>. As part of the MakA/B/E tripartite toxin, MakA is involved in membrane pore formation similar to other α-PFTs. In contrast, MakA in isolation induces tube-like structures in acidic endosomal compartments of epithelial cells in vitro. The present study unravels the dynamics of tubular growth, which occurs in a pH-, lipid-, and concentration-dependent manner. Within acidified organelle lumens or when incubated with cells in acidic media, MakA forms oligomers and remodels membranes into high-curvature tubes leading to loss of membrane integrity. A 3.7 Å cryo-electron microscopy structure of MakA filaments reveals a unique protein-lipid superstructure. MakA forms a pinecone-like spiral with a central cavity and a thin annular lipid bilayer embedded between the MakA transmembrane helices in its active α-PFT conformation. Our study provides insights into a novel tubulation mechanism of an α-PFT protein and a new mode of action by a secreted bacterial toxin.

                Background: Simultaneous multiple intra-cerebral hemorrhages (SMICHs) and its occurrences in different territories of arterial disposition has been viewed as uncommon clinical occurrences, since the pathophysiological and predisposing factors as mechanisms aren’t vividly defined. This research primarily aims for demographic stratification and dichotomization pertaining to risk factors, etiological classifications, anatomical distributions and outcome analysis by focusing on management strategies and pertinent stroke care. Methods: 40 patients presenting to the College of Medical Sciences, Chitwan, Nepal in the last two years were included in the study. The patients with two-or-more SMICHs with affected arterial territories with similar tomographic density based profiling were chosen as samples. Regression analysis was chosen to test three hypotheses. Results: Among our study cohorts, cortical and cortical territory (60%) was the major anatomical patterns of involvement. A conservative approach was undertaken in nine patients (22.5%), whereas surgical intervention was needed in five others (12.5%). A total of 14(35%) patients leaving against medical advice and a further seven (17.5%) patients were referred for adjuvant oncologic care. Mortality was observed among five (12.5%) patients. Hypertension was seen as a significant variable in its pathogenesis. Male patients were more affected. Age groups comprising of 36-45years and 56-65 years were involved in 32.5% and 30% cases respectively. Conclusion: This study proves the need for a national stroke data bank pertaining to SMICH. This will help foster effective patient education during preoperative counselling; as well as formatting a management algorithm combating them.

                Background: Human Givens (HG) Rewind is a relatively unknown trauma-focussed treatment. This paper aimed to provide preliminary evidence of the effectiveness of Rewind to treat posttraumatic stress (PTS) in a variety of clinical settings in Great Britain. Methods: An observational prospective design was used in each of the four studies. Standardised questionnaires were administered in every session. Pre- and post-treatment means and effect sizes were calculated for each study, as were ‘recovery rates’ and ‘reliable change’ rates. Results: Across four studies, a total of 274 clients completed treatment and had complete data. The data capture rate ranged from 80-100%. The mean pre-treatment scores were in the severe range. The pre-post treatment effects sizes ranged from 1.90-2.68. The percentage of clients who were below the clinical cut-off after treatment ranged from 46-56% for the more conservative lower cut-offs, and ranged between 71-82% for the higher clinical cut-offs as used by Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT). Across the four studies, 83-96% of clients had ‘reliably improved’ (88-94% on trauma-specific questionnaires), with 4-17% having no reliable change on those questionnaires. The mean number of HG treatment sessions ranged from 5-6.5 sessions (range 1–24 sessions), with between 73% and 84% of participants completing treatment in six sessions or less. Conclusions: These preliminary results indicate that HG Rewind appears to be a promising trauma treatment in a variety of settings. A randomised controlled trial is now required to determine the efficacy of this treatment.

                Green-building rating systems (GBRSs) are critical for implementing climate change (CC) mitigation strategies because they can help reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the building sector. From the Indian policy perspective, the ClimateSMART Cities Assessment Framework (CSCAF) provides cities a roadmap toward mitigating CC while planning/implementing their actions and facilitates realising energy efficiency and green buildings through GBRS adoption and incentivisation. Green Rating for Integrated Habitat Assessment (GRIHA) is a comprehensive GBRS aligned with CSCAF and India’s climate goals, facilitating the implementation of Government of India’s relevant policies and climate-adaptation measures within a building project’s different phases. This paper examines existing institutional mechanisms for incentivising GRIHA-rated projects and provides recommendations for municipal bodies, regional developmental authorities, and state governments for strengthening resource efficiency in the built environment through GRIHA. Residential buildings are considered because their contribution to GHG emissions is the greatest among buildings. Data were collected through literature review, reviewing smart-city proposals and latest state annual action plans, Right to Information queries, and structured interviews of stakeholders. Feedback from green-building certification agencies, project proponents, and government officials revealed a need for local-level information dissemination and guidance on institutional mechanisms for incentivising green-rated projects. Further, to understand the implementation mechanisms for GRIHA-linked incentives, residential projects under some local-government agencies were documented as case studies, providing useful insights into prevalent mechanisms for availing incentives while facilitating GRIHA compliance. The information provided herein can be useful for local governments in other developing countries for guiding the building sector toward mitigating climate change.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Testosterone level correlates significantly with luteinizing hormone to follicle-stimulating hormone ratio among women with polycystic ovary syndrome: A cross sectional study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), an endocrinological problem among women in the reproductive age, is characterized by chronic ovulatory dysfunction, hyperandrogenism, and elevated luteinizing hormone: follicle stimulating hormone (LH-FSH) ratio. The goal of this study was to examine if the blood LH-FSH ratio and total testosterone (TT) levels in Sudanese women with PCOS were linked. Methods: This cross-sectional study included 300 women with confirmed PCOS based on Rotterdam criteria.  PCOS women mean (standard deviation): age 29.1(5.8) years; body mass index (BMI) 27.9±4.6 kg/m2. Each participant underwent a clinical history, physical examination, and ovaries ultrasonogram.  ASYS Expert Plus Microplate was used to quantify serum LH, FSH, and TT levels in fasting blood specimen drawn during the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle of women with PCOS. Results: More than two-thirds of the participants (71.0%) had an aberrant LH-FSH ratio (cut-off>1.0), and 58.3% had hyperandrogenemia (TT>109.5 ng/dL). Hyperandrogenemic women had significantly increased LH-FSH ratio (P= 0.000). The LH-FSH ratio and serum TT were significantly positive correlated (r= 0.329, P= 0.000). Overall, 52.0% of women with PCOS exhibited menstrual cycle irregularity, and 59.0 % had a positive family history of PCOS. On logistic regression analysis, the LH-FSH ratio (odds ratio (OR) (95% confidence interval (CI)): 2.308 (1.698- 3.139, P= 0.000) was found to be positively related to hyperandrogenemia independently. Furthermore, when the LH-FSH ratio is greater than one, hyperandrogenemia can be distinguished from normoandrogenemia, area under the curve (AUC) = 0.726, P= 0.000, 95% CI: (0.668-0.785) with a serum TT threshold of 109.5 ng/dL (sensitivity 70.0%, specificity 77.1%). Conclusions: In women with PCOS, the serum LH-FSH ratio and TT have a strong relationship. Furthermore, LH-FSH ratio of greater than one can be used to distinguish between hyperandrogenic and non-hyperandrogenic PCOS women.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Concomitant chronic subdural hematomas and arachnoid cysts in young adults [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the correlation between arachnoid cysts and chronic subdural hematomas in young adults. Methods: This retrospective study evaluated ten patients having concomitant chronic subdural hematomas and arachnoid cysts. Patients were evaluated with the data of age and gender, location of hematoma and arachnoid cyst, trauma history, symptoms at admission, maximum hematoma diameter, contiguity between arachnoid cyst and hematoma, and treatment  methods. Results: We treated 285 patients who were diagnosed with cSDH between January 2013 and December 2019. 22 patients were under the age of 40 years. Ten of them had both cSDH and arachnoid cysts. The mean age of patients was 24.8±3.9 years. Patients with only chronic subdural hematoma had higher mean age than the patients with arachnoid cyst-related chronic subdural hematoma. In four patients, the onset of chronic subdural hematoma was reported after arachnoid cyst diagnosis. Four of the patients did not have causative trauma history, and two patients suffered minor sports-related traumas. All patients had headache, and only two patients had hemiparesis. The location of arachnoid cysts were in the middle fossa in eight patients. All patients had chronic subdural hematomas on the ipsilateral side of arachnoid cyst. Four patients who had smaller than 10 mm maximal cSDH diameter underwent conservative management. They were followed by serial neuroimaging studies and it was noted that the hematoma disappered and the size of the arachnoid cysts decreased over time without any neurological complication. In six cases, craniotomy was required, and all recovered completely. cSDH did not recur during 5–60 months of follow-up period (median 12 months). Conclusions: It seems that presence of an arachnoid cyst in young adults is a predisposing factor for the formation of chronic subdural hematoma. Coincidentally diagnosed arachnoid cyst patients may be followed up with periodical clinical examinations and neuroimaging studies.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Patients and family members perspectives on the use of bedside whiteboards and its implication to treatment outcomes and patient satisfaction: A pilot survey in general and tertiary hospitals in Makkah, Saudi Arabia [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer </a></h4>

              
                Background: Effective communication between the members of the healthcare team and the patient and families are essential components for patient-centered care. It improves patient outcomes. Likewise, poor communication between healthcare team members and the patient and families is associated with poor patient outcomes. Due to several communication challenges, the use of visual tools such as bedside whiteboards to enhance communication has been widely implemented; however, the exact benefit of its use from the patient perspective is still understudied. Thus, this study aims to determine the impact of bedside whiteboard use in facilitating patient’s involvement in achieving the day’s goal, adherence to pain medication schedule and use, tests, and procedures schedule, patients and family engagement with the healthcare team, and discharge planning. Methods: This study is a descriptive cross-sectional study conducted among 335 patients and/or family members admitted in six hospitals in Makkah city: Al Noor hospital, Hera hospital, King Abdul-Aziz hospital, King Abdullah Medical City, King Faisal specialist hospital, and Maternity and Children hospital. The survey questionnaire used was adapted from previous studies and revalidated to ensure its suitability to the study subjects. Data collection was performed from August 1 to 31, 2020, and data analysis was done with SPSS software. Results: Of the 335 participants, the majority were satisfied with bedside whiteboards for their use (4.36), and they recommended it to be used in hospitals because they perceived that through this medium of communication, their connection with the healthcare team would be easier (4.35). In regression analysis, the day’s goal and patient and/or family engagement are found to be significant predictors of patient satisfaction. Conclusions: Whiteboards are a valuable tool to help patients achieve their daily goals and improve their engagement with the healthcare team, impacting patient satisfaction.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Connectivity and dynamics in the olfactory bulb</a></h4>

              
                <p>by David E. Chen Kersen, Gaia Tavoni, Vijay Balasubramanian</p>

Dendrodendritic interactions between excitatory mitral cells and inhibitory granule cells in the olfactory bulb create a dense interaction network, reorganizing sensory representations of odors and, consequently, perception. Large-scale computational models are needed for revealing how the collective behavior of this network emerges from its global architecture. We propose an approach where we summarize anatomical information through dendritic geometry and density distributions which we use to calculate the connection probability between mitral and granule cells, while capturing activity patterns of each cell type in the neural dynamical systems theory of Izhikevich. In this way, we generate an efficient, anatomically and physiologically realistic large-scale model of the olfactory bulb network. Our model reproduces known connectivity between sister vs. non-sister mitral cells; measured patterns of lateral inhibition; and theta, beta, and gamma oscillations. The model in turn predicts testable relationships between network structure and several functional properties, including lateral inhibition, odor pattern decorrelation, and LFP oscillation frequency. We use the model to explore the influence of cortex on the olfactory bulb, demonstrating possible mechanisms by which cortical feedback to mitral cells or granule cells can influence bulbar activity, as well as how neurogenesis can improve bulbar decorrelation without requiring cell death. Our methodology provides a tractable tool for other researchers.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Evaluating supervised and unsupervised background noise correction in human gut microbiome data</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Leah Briscoe, Brunilda Balliu, Sriram Sankararaman, Eran Halperin, Nandita R. Garud</p>

The ability to predict human phenotypes and identify biomarkers of disease from metagenomic data is crucial for the development of therapeutics for microbiome-associated diseases. However, metagenomic data is commonly affected by technical variables unrelated to the phenotype of interest, such as sequencing protocol, which can make it difficult to predict phenotype and find biomarkers of disease. Supervised methods to correct for background noise, originally designed for gene expression and RNA-seq data, are commonly applied to microbiome data but may be limited because they cannot account for unmeasured sources of variation. Unsupervised approaches address this issue, but current methods are limited because they are ill-equipped to deal with the unique aspects of microbiome data, which is compositional, highly skewed, and sparse. We perform a comparative analysis of the ability of different denoising transformations in combination with supervised correction methods as well as an unsupervised principal component correction approach that is presently used in other domains but has not been applied to microbiome data to date. We find that the unsupervised principal component correction approach has comparable ability in reducing false discovery of biomarkers as the supervised approaches, with the added benefit of not needing to know the sources of variation apriori. However, in prediction tasks, it appears to only improve prediction when technical variables contribute to the majority of variance in the data. As new and larger metagenomic datasets become increasingly available, background noise correction will become essential for generating reproducible microbiome analyses.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Quantifying cumulative phenotypic and genomic evidence for procedural generation of metabolic network reconstructions</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Thomas J. Moutinho Jr., Benjamin C. Neubert, Matthew L. Jenior, Jason A. Papin</p>

Genome-scale metabolic network reconstructions (GENREs) are valuable tools for understanding microbial metabolism. The process of automatically generating GENREs includes identifying metabolic reactions supported by sufficient genomic evidence to generate a draft metabolic network. The draft GENRE is then gapfilled with additional reactions in order to recapitulate specific growth phenotypes as indicated with associated experimental data. Previous methods have implemented absolute mapping thresholds for the reactions automatically included in draft GENREs; however, there is growing evidence that integrating annotation evidence in a continuous form can improve model accuracy. There is a need for flexibility in the structure of GENREs to better account for uncertainty in biological data, unknown regulatory mechanisms, and context-specificity associated with data inputs. To address this issue, we present a novel method that provides a framework for quantifying combined genomic, biochemical, and phenotypic evidence for each biochemical reaction during automated GENRE construction. Our method, Constraint-based Analysis Yielding reaction Usage across metabolic Networks (CANYUNs), generates accurate GENREs with a quantitative metric for the cumulative evidence for each reaction included in the network. The structuring of CANYUNs allows for the simultaneous integration of three data inputs while maintaining all supporting evidence for biochemical reactions that may be active in an organism. CANYUNs is designed to maximize the utility of experimental and annotation datasets and to ultimately assist in the curation of the reference datasets used for the automatic construction of metabolic networks. We validated CANYUNs by generating an <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> K-12 model and compared it to the manually curated reconstruction iML1515. Finally, we demonstrated the use of CANYUNs to build a model by generating an <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> Nissle CANYUNs model using novel phenotypic data that we collected. This method may address key challenges for the procedural construction of metabolic networks by leveraging uncertainty and redundancy in biological data.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">INTEGRATE: Model-based multi-omics data integration to characterize multi-level metabolic regulation</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Marzia Di Filippo, Dario Pescini, Bruno Giovanni Galuzzi, Marcella Bonanomi, Daniela Gaglio, Eleonora Mangano, Clarissa Consolandi, Lilia Alberghina, Marco Vanoni, Chiara Damiani</p>

Metabolism is directly and indirectly fine-tuned by a complex web of interacting regulatory mechanisms that fall into two major classes. On the one hand, the expression level of the catalyzing enzyme sets the maximal theoretical flux level (i.e., the net rate of the reaction) for each enzyme-controlled reaction. On the other hand, metabolic regulation controls the metabolic flux through the interactions of metabolites (substrates, cofactors, allosteric modulators) with the responsible enzyme. High-throughput data, such as metabolomics and transcriptomics data, if analyzed separately, do not accurately characterize the hierarchical regulation of metabolism outlined above. They must be integrated to disassemble the interdependence between different regulatory layers controlling metabolism. To this aim, we propose INTEGRATE, a computational pipeline that integrates metabolomics and transcriptomics data, using constraint-based stoichiometric metabolic models as a scaffold. We compute differential reaction expression from transcriptomics data and use constraint-based modeling to predict if the differential expression of metabolic enzymes directly originates differences in metabolic fluxes. In parallel, we use metabolomics to predict how differences in substrate availability translate into differences in metabolic fluxes. We discriminate fluxes regulated at the metabolic and/or gene expression level by intersecting these two output datasets. We demonstrate the pipeline using a set of immortalized normal and cancer breast cell lines. In a clinical setting, knowing the regulatory level at which a given metabolic reaction is controlled will be valuable to inform targeted, truly personalized therapies in cancer patients.

                Background: The objective of this study was to identify the factors associated with caregivers’ knowledge of kitchen hygiene in San Juan de Lurigancho (SJL). Methods: This was a cross-sectional study. We surveyed 250 mothers at comedores populares (a sort of community kitchens which are very popular in Lima) and who were part of mothers' clubs in the areas of Huascar V and San Pablo, in SJL in Lima. The sample was selected through non-probability convenience sampling. A questionnaire with three dimensions (cleanliness, storage and contamination of children) was administered. Results: On average, in Huascar and San Pablo, most caregivers were the children’s mothers (93.2%); most of the caregivers were between 21 and 30 years old (54%); they had secondary level of education (70.4%); they were living in free union with their partners (69.2%); they were mainly housewives (80.4%); their houses were constructed with materials different from brick and cement (68.4%); and their houses had a bare floor (70.0%). They did not have drinking water in the kitchen (88.4%); they did not use a gas stove (88.4%), a refrigerator (50.0%), a radio (82.0%), or a microwave (16.4%). A good level of knowledge of food hygiene was found in 63.2% of caregivers. No predictive capacity of the assessed sociodemographic characteristics on the level of knowledge of kitchen hygiene was identified. Conclusions: This study determined that the assessed sociodemographic variables were not significantly associated with the level of knowledge about kitchen hygiene. It is necessary to improve mothers' knowledge about the handling and consumption of spoiled food and their effect on children's health.

                Background: Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) are allelic disorders caused by mutations in the DMD gene. The full mutation spectrum of the DMD gene in Indonesian patients is currently unknown. Mutation-specific therapies are currently being developed, such as exon skipping or stop codon read-through therapy.  This study was conducted with the aim of identifying the mutation spectrum of the DMD gene in Indonesia to guide future development and application of feasible therapeutic strategies.   Methods: This study is a cross sectional study that enrolled 43 male patients with a clinical suspicion of DMD or BMD. Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) reaction was performed to screen for the common mutations in the DMD gene.   Results: Out of 43 subjects, deletions accounted for 69.77% (n=30) cases, while duplications were found in 11.63% (n=5) cases. One novel duplication spanning exons 2 to 62 was identified. Deletion mutations clustered around the distal (66.67%) and proximal (26.67%) hot spot regions of the DMD gene while duplication mutations were observed solely at the proximal region. Two false positive cases of single exon deletion detected through MLPA were attributed to sequence mutations affecting primer ligation sites, confirming the need to validate all single exon deletions when using this screening method. Analysis of available maternal DNA samples showed that the rate of de novo mutations (48.15%) appears higher than expected in this population. Out of 31 patients who were classified as DMD based on clinical and genotype characterizations, 60.47% (n=26) of cases were suitable for exon skipping therapy.   Conclusion: This is the first comprehensive study showing the feasibility of implementing the MLPA method for routine screening of DMD patients in Indonesia.  This is also the first study showing the potential applicability of exon skipping therapy in the majority of DMD cases in the country.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Academic entrepreneurial engagement for frugal innovation in higher education institutions: a systematic literature review [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Higher education institutions (HEI) are faced with increasing challenges related to shrinking resources, high operation costs, the COVID-19 pandemic, decreasing student enrolment rates, and pressure to contribute to regional development and economic growth. To overcome such challenges, academics must move beyond their traditional functions of research and teaching and engage in entrepreneurial activities. Through engagement in entrepreneurial activities, academics can contribute to frugal innovation (FI) in private HEI (PHEI). The literature in this context emphasizes that academic entrepreneurial engagement (AEE) will lead to innovation, the identification of opportunities for new business ventures, financial rewards for institutions and academics, an impact on the economy, and the enhancement of social welfare. This study presents a systematic review of the literature and adopts the Transfield five-phase strategy to review the literature on AEE from the past two decades (2000–2020). A total of 1,067 papers on FI are obtained, only five of which focus on AEE. Moreover, papers related to AEE for FI are few. The study presents the research gaps, challenges, and potential factors for further research in this context. We conclude that FI for AEE in PHEI can be a game-changer for future sustainability. Moreover, we believe that the outcome of this review warrants further research.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/neuron/inpress.rss">The different autophagy degradation pathways and neurodegeneration</a></h4>

              
                The term autophagy encompasses different pathways enabling lysosomal degradation of cytoplasmic material, such as macroautophagy, chaperone-mediated autophagy, and microautophagy. Fleming et al. review how different autophagic pathways protect against neurodegeneration and consider recently described therapeutic strategies exploiting autophagic upregulation.

                Chatterjee et al. report that extending the interval between doses in naïve individuals leads to better recognition and neutralization of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron spike than in those receiving a four-week interval. Vaccinated convalescent individuals present higher responses than naïve vaccinated individuals.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Extensive age-dependent loss of antibody diversity in naturally short-lived turquoise killifish</a></h4>

              
                Aging individuals exhibit a pervasive decline in adaptive immune function, with important implications for health and lifespan. Previous studies have found a pervasive loss of immune-repertoire diversity in human peripheral blood during aging; however, little is known about repertoire aging in other immune compartments, or in species other than humans. Here, we perform the first study of immune-repertoire aging in an emerging model of vertebrate aging, the African turquoise killifish (<i>Nothobranchius furzeri</i>). Despite their extremely short lifespans, these killifish exhibit complex and individualized heavy-chain repertoires, with a generative process capable of producing millions of distinct productive sequences. Whole-body killifish repertoires decline rapidly in within-individual diversity with age, while between-individual variability increases. Large, expanded B-cell clones exhibit far greater diversity loss with age than small clones, suggesting important differences in how age affects different B cell populations. The immune repertoires of isolated intestinal samples exhibit especially dramatic age-related diversity loss, related to an elevated prevalence of expanded clones. Lower intestinal repertoire diversity was also associated with transcriptomic signatures of reduced B-cell activity, supporting a functional role for diversity changes in killifish immunosenescence. Our results highlight important differences in systemic vs. organ-specific aging dynamics in the adaptive immune system.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Rapid odor processing by layer 2 subcircuits in lateral entorhinal cortex</a></h4>

              
                Olfactory information is encoded in lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) by two classes of layer 2 (L2) principal neurons: fan and pyramidal cells. However, the functional properties of L2 cells and how they contribute to odor coding are unclear. Here, we show in awake mice that L2 cells respond to odors early during single sniffs and that LEC is essential for rapid discrimination of both odor identity and intensity. Population analyses of L2 ensembles reveals that rate coding distinguishes odor identity, but firing rates are only weakly concentration-dependent and changes in spike timing can represent odor intensity. L2 principal cells differ in afferent olfactory input and connectivity with inhibitory circuits and the relative timing of pyramidal and fan cell spikes provides a temporal code for odor intensity. Downstream, intensity is encoded purely by spike timing in hippocampal CA1. Together, these results reveal the unique processing of odor information by LEC subcircuits and highlight the importance of temporal coding in higher olfactory areas.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Mg2+-dependent conformational equilibria in CorA and an integrated view on transport regulation</a></h4>

              
                The CorA family of proteins regulates the homeostasis of divalent metal ions in many bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotic mitochondria, making it an important target in the investigation of the mechanisms of transport and its functional regulation. Although numerous structures of open and closed channels are now available for the CorA family, the mechanism of the transport regulation remains elusive. Here, we investigated the conformational distribution and associated dynamic behaviour of the pentameric Mg<sup>2+</sup> channel CorA at room temperature using small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) in combination with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR). We find that neither the Mg<sup>2+</sup>-bound closed structure nor the Mg<sup>2+</sup>-free open forms are sufficient to explain the average conformation of CorA. Our data support the presence of conformational equilibria between multiple states, and we further find a variation in the behaviour of the backbone dynamics with and without Mg<sup>2+</sup>. We propose that CorA must be in a dynamic equilibrium between different non-conducting states, both symmetric and asymmetric, regardless of bound Mg<sup>2+</sup> but that conducting states become more populated in Mg<sup>2+</sup>-free conditions. These properties are regulated by backbone dynamics and are key to understanding the functional regulation of CorA.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">SWI/SNF senses carbon starvation with a pH-sensitive low complexity sequence</a></h4>

              
                It is increasingly appreciated that intracellular pH changes are important biological signals. This motivates the elucidation of molecular mechanisms of pH-sensing. We determined that a nucleocytoplasmic pH oscillation was required for the transcriptional response to carbon starvation in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>. The SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex is a key mediator of this transcriptional response. A glutamine-rich low complexity domain (QLC) in the <i>SNF5 </i>subunit of this complex, and histidines within this sequence, were required for efficient transcriptional reprogramming. Furthermore, the <i>SNF5</i> QLC mediated pH-dependent recruitment <i>of SWI/SNF to an acidic transcription factor in a reconstituted nucleosome remodeling assay</i><i>. </i>Simulations showed that protonation of histidines within the <i>SNF5 </i>QLC lead to conformational expansion, providing a potential biophysical mechanism for regulation of these interactions. Together, our results indicate that that pH changes are a second messenger for transcriptional reprogramming during carbon starvation, and that the <i>SNF5</i> QLC acts as a pH-sensor.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The Cl--channel TMEM16A is involved in the generation of cochlear Ca2+ waves and promotes the refinement of auditory brainstem networks in mice</a></h4>

              
                Before hearing onset (postnatal day 12 in mice), inner hair cells (IHC) spontaneously fire action potentials thereby driving pre-sensory activity in the ascending auditory pathway. The rate of IHC action potential bursts is modulated by inner supporting cells (ISC) of Kölliker's organ through the activity of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> activated Cl<sup>-</sup> channel TMEM16A (ANO1). Here we show that conditional deletion of <i>Ano1</i> (<i>Tmem16a)</i> in mice disrupts Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves within Kölliker's organ, reduces the burst firing activity and the frequency-selectivity of auditory brainstem neurons in the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB), and also impairs the functional refinement of MNTB projections to the lateral superior olive (LSO). These results reveal the importance of the activity of Kölliker's organ for the refinement of central auditory connectivity. In addition, our study suggests involvement of TMEM16A in the propagation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves, which may also apply to other tissues expressing TMEM16A.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Telomere length regulation by Rif1 protein from Hansenula polymorpha</a></h4>

              
                Rif1 is a large multifaceted protein involved in various processes of DNA metabolism – from telomere length regulation and replication to double-strand break repair. The mechanistic details of its action, however, are often poorly understood. Here, we report functional characterization of the Rif1 homologue from methylotrophic thermotolerant budding yeast <i>Hansenula polymorpha</i> DL-1. We show that, similar to other yeast species, <i>H. polymorpha</i> Rif1 suppresses telomerase-dependent telomere elongation. We uncover two novel modes of Rif1 recruitment at <i>H. polymorpha</i> telomeres: via direct DNA binding and through the association with the Ku heterodimer. Both of these modes (at least partially) require the intrinsically disordered N-terminal extension – a region of the protein present exclusively in yeast species. We also demonstrate that Rif1 binds Stn1 and promotes its accumulation at telomeres in <i>H. polymorpha</i>.

                Objective:  To investigate the association between disease progression and OCTA vessel density and other indices in patients with diabetic retinopathy. Methods:  Participants were selected with the following criteria: 63 patients (100 eyes) diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus, which included 44 patients (72 eyes) with diabetic retinopathy and 19 patients (28 eyes) with type 2 diabetes mellitus and non-diabetic retinopathy (NDR), who were seen at the Eye Hospital China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences from September 2020 to July 2021. All patients underwent OCTA examination, and FAZ, PERIM, AI, FD, SVD, DVD and other indices were counted. Results:  (1) The correlation coefficients of SVD, paracentric SVD, DVD, paracentric DVD and DR processes were: -0.525, -0.586, -0.323, and -0.424 ( P < 0.05), respectively, and all were moderately negatively correlated. (2) The correlation coefficients of FAZ and PERIM with DR process were: -0.031, 0.084 ( P >0.05 ), respectively, and not correlated. The correlation coefficients of AI and FD with DR process were: 0.307, -0.459 ( P <0.05), and with moderate positive and negative correlations, respectively. (3) The correlation coefficients of FAZ, PERIM, AI and FD with age were: -0.124, -0.052, 0.113, -0.170 ( P >0.05), and no correlation, respectively. Conclusion:  The disease progression of DR was moderately correlated with OCTA superficial vessel density and deep vessel density; and moderately correlated with AI and FD. OCTA could assist in the assessment of DR disease progression.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Theta band-power shapes amyloid-driven longitudinal EEG changes in pre-clinical Alzheimer's Disease</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer's Disease (AD) includes progressive symptoms spread along a continuum of pre-clinical (pre-AD) and clinical stages. Pre-AD refers to cognitively healthy individuals with presence of positive pathophysiological biomarkers of AD (i.e., markers of amyloidopathy and tauopathy). Although numerous studies uncovered the neuro-cognitive changes of AD, very little is known on the natural history of brain lesions and modifications of brain networks of pre-AD. To address this issue, we analysed resting-state EEG data of 318 cognitively healthy individuals with subjective memory complains from the INSIGHT-preAD cohort at the time of their first visit (M0) and two-years later (M24). Using 18F-florbetapir PET-scanner, subjects were stratified between amyloid positive (A-; n=230) and amyloid negative (A+; n=88) groups. Differences between A+ and A- individuals were estimated at source level in each band of the EEG power spectrum. At M0, we found an increase of theta-band power in the mid-frontal cortex in A+ compared to A-. No significant association was found between mid-frontal theta power and the individuals' cognitive performance. While the very same effect was not replicated at M24, theta-band power increased in A+ relative to A- individuals in the posterior cingulate cortex and the pre-cuneus. Furthermore, alpha band revealed a peculiar decremental trend in posterior brain regions in the A+ relative to the A- group only at M24. These results provide the first source-level longitudinal evidence on the impact of brain amyloidosis on the EEG dynamics of a large-scale, monocentric cohort of pre-AD. Theta-band power increase over the mid-frontal and mid-posterior cortices suggests an hypoactivation of the default-mode network in individuals at-risk of AD and a non-linear longitudinal progression of the AD-spectrum.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Novel cerebello-amygdala connections provide missing link between cerebellum and limbic system</a></h4>

              
                The cerebellum is emerging as a powerful regulator of cognitive and affective processing and memory in both humans and animals and has been implicated in affective disorders. How the cerebellum supports affective function remains poorly understood. The short-latency (just a few ms) functional connections that were identified between the cerebellum and amygdala -a structure crucial for the processing of emotion and valence- more than 4 decades ago raise the exciting, yet untested, possibility that a cerebellum-amygdala pathway communicates information important for emotion. The major hurdle in rigorously testing this possibility is the lack of knowledge about the anatomy and functional connectivity of this pathway. Our initial anatomical tracing studies in mice excluded the existence of a direct monosynaptic pathway between cerebellum and amygdala. Using transsynaptic tracing techniques, we have identified a novel disynaptic pathway that connects the cerebellar output nuclei to the basolateral amygdala. This pathway recruits the understudied intralaminar thalamus as a node. Using ex vivo optophysiology and super-resolution microscopy, we provide the first evidence for the functionality of the pathway, thus offering a missing mechanistic link between the cerebellum and amygdala. This discovery provides a connectivity blueprint between the cerebellum and a key structure of the limbic system. As such, it is the requisite first step toward obtaining new knowledge about cerebellar function in emotion, thus fundamentally advancing understanding of the neurobiology of emotion, which is perturbed in mental and autism spectrum disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Rhythmic interactions between the mediodorsal thalamus and prefrontal cortex precede human visual perception</a></h4>

              
                The thalamus is much more than a simple sensory relay. High-order thalamic nuclei, such as the mediodorsal thalamus, exert a profound influence over animal cognition. However, given the difficulty of directly recording from the thalamus in humans, next-to-nothing is known about thalamic and thalamocortical contributions to human cognition. To address this, we analysed simultaneously-recorded thalamic iEEG and whole-head MEG in six patients (four female, two male; plus MEG recordings from twelve healthy controls) as they completed a visual detection task. We observed that the phase of both ongoing mediodorsal thalamic and prefrontal low-frequency activity was predictive of perceptual performance. Critically however, mediodorsal thalamic activity mediated prefrontal contributions to perceptual performance. These results suggest that it is thalamocortical interactions, rather than cortical activity alone, that is predictive of upcoming perceptual performance and, more generally, highlights the importance of accounting for the thalamus when theorising about cortical contributions to human cognition.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dynamical management of potential threats regulated by dopamine and direct- and indirect-pathway neurons in the tail of the striatum</a></h4>

              
                Avoiding potential threats before experiencing an actual outcome is critical to prevent a disaster. Here we examined roles of the tail of the striatum (TS) and its dopamine input in threat management. Mice were presented with a potential threat (a moving object) while pursuing rewards. Mice initially failed to obtain rewards, but gradually successfully obtained rewards in later trials. We show that the initial failures depended on dopamine and direct-pathway neurons in TS, and variability in failure rate across trials and individuals was positively correlated with the activity of these neurons. In contrast, indirect-pathway neurons in TS were critical for eventual improvement in reward acquisition, and their activity was positively correlated with successful reward acquisition. These results demonstrate that direct- and indirect-pathway TS neurons promote and suppress threat avoidance, respectively, at different stages, providing a mechanism for overcoming a potential threat while maintaining the threat estimates.

	<p>Adding relaxation techniques during nap or auditory stimulation of EEG slow oscillation (SO) during nighttime sleep may limit cognitive impairments in sleep-deprived subjects, potentially through alleviating stress-releasing effects. We compared daytime sleepiness, cognitive performances, and salivary stress biomarker responses in 11 volunteers (aged 18&amp;amp;ndash;36) who underwent 5 days of sleep restriction (SR, 3 h per night, with 30 min of daily nap) under three successive conditions: control (SR-CT), relaxation techniques added to daily nap (SR-RT), and auditory stimulation of sleep slow oscillations (SO) during nighttime sleep (SR-NS). Test evaluation was performed at baseline (BASE), the fifth day of chronic SR (SR5), and the third and fifth days after sleep recovery (REC3, REC5, respectively). At SR5, less degradation was observed for percentage of commission errors in the executive Go&amp;amp;ndash;noGo inhibition task in SR-RT condition compared to SR-CT, and for sleepiness score in SR-NS condition compared both to SR-CT and SR-RT. Beneficial effects of SR-RT and SR-NS were additionally observed on these two parameters and on salivary &amp;amp;alpha;-amylase (sAA) at REC3 and REC5. Adding relaxation techniques to naps may help performance in inhibition response, and adding nocturnal auditory stimulation of SO sleep may benefit daytime sleepiness during sleep restriction with persistent effects during recovery. The two strategies activated the autonomic nervous system, as shown by the sAA response.</p>

	<p>Brain neural activity decoding is an important branch of neuroscience research and a key technology for the brain&amp;amp;ndash;computer interface (BCI). Researchers initially developed simple linear models and machine learning algorithms to classify and recognize brain activities. With the great success of deep learning on image recognition and generation, deep neural networks (DNN) have been engaged in reconstructing visual stimuli from human brain activity via functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). In this paper, we reviewed the brain activity decoding models based on machine learning and deep learning algorithms. Specifically, we focused on current brain activity decoding models with high attention: variational auto-encoder (VAE), generative confrontation network (GAN), and the graph convolutional network (GCN). Furthermore, brain neural-activity-decoding-enabled fMRI-based BCI applications in mental and psychological disease treatment are presented to illustrate the positive correlation between brain decoding and BCI. Finally, existing challenges and future research directions are addressed.</p>

	<p>Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cardinal motor symptoms and other non-motor symptoms. Studies have investigated various brain areas in PD by detecting white matter alterations using diffusion magnetic resonance imaging processing techniques, which can produce diffusion metrics such as fractional anisotropy and quantitative anisotropy. In this study, we compared the quantitative anisotropy of whole brain regions throughout the subcortical and cortical areas between newly diagnosed PD patients and healthy controls. Additionally, we evaluated the correlations between the quantitative anisotropy of each region and respective neuropsychological test scores to identify the areas most affected by each neuropsychological dysfunction in PD. We found significant quantitative anisotropy differences in several subcortical structures such as the basal ganglia, limbic system, and brain stem as well as in cortical structures such as the temporal lobe, occipital lobe, and insular lobe. Additionally, we found that quantitative anisotropy of some subcortical structures such as the basal ganglia, cerebellum, and brain stem showed the highest correlations with motor dysfunction, whereas cortical structures such as the temporal lobe and occipital lobe showed the highest correlations with olfactory dysfunction in PD. Our study also showed evidence regarding potential neural compensation by revealing higher diffusion metric values in early-stage PD than in healthy controls. We anticipate that our results will improve our understanding of PD&amp;amp;rsquo;s pathophysiology.</p>

	<p>We previously suggested that stochastic processes are fundamental in the development of sporadic adult onset neurodegenerative disorders. In this study, we develop a theoretical framework to explain stochastic processes at the protein, DNA and RNA levels. We propose that probability determines random sequencing changes, some of which favor neurodegeneration in particular anatomical spaces, and that more than one protein may be affected simultaneously. The stochastic protein changes happen in three-dimensional space and can be considered to be vectors in a space-time continuum, their trajectories and kinetics modified by physiological variables in the manifold of intra- and extra-cellular space. The molecular velocity of these degenerative proteins must obey the second law of thermodynamics, in which entropy is the driver of the inexorable progression of neurodegeneration in the context of the N-body problem of interacting proteins, time-space manifold of protein-protein interactions in phase space, and compounded by the intrinsic disorder of protein-protein networks. This model helps to elucidate the existence of multiple misfolded proteinopathies in adult sporadic neurodegenerative disorders.</p>

                Dysregulation of Tau in Alzheimer disease affects multiple cellular compartments and functions. Tau interacts directly with and translocates through the plasma membrane, a potential site of Tau fibril and membrane pore formation, but its physiological state and behavior in this compartment are unknown. Using quantitative single-molecule imaging in live cells, we observed that Tau exhibits both confined and free diffusion near the plasma membrane. Preventing Tau/microtubule interactions either pharmacologically or biochemically increased Tau mobility; however, the heterogeneous mobility pattern persisted. Tau formed transient hot spots of ~70 nm in radius, displaying stationary and mobile phases. Compared to the ~40 ms dwell time of Tau on microtubules, the hot spots were long-lasting (tens of seconds), and resistant to microtubule perturbations and cholesterol depletion. We suggest that the mobile pool acts as a reservoir supplying Tau to functional sites, with the hot spots serving as assembly sites for the physiological and pathological functions of Tau.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Ventral pallidum GABA neurons bidirectionally control opioid relapse across rat behavioral models</a></h4>

              
                Opioid addiction is a chronic, relapsing disorder. Whether addicted individuals are forced to abstain or they decide themselves to quit using drugs, relapse rates are high--especially upon encountering contexts and stimuli associated with prior opioid use. Rodents similarly show context- and cue-induced reinstatement of drug seeking following abstinence, and intriguingly, the neural circuits underlying these relapse-like behaviors differ when abstinence is involuntarily imposed, versus when animals decide themselves to cease taking drug. Here, we employ two complementary rat behavioral models of relapse-like behavior for the highly reinforcing opioid drug remifentanil, and asked whether GABAergic neurons in the ventral pallidum (VPGABA) control opioid seeking under these behavioral conditions. Specifically, we asked how chemogenetically stimulating VPGABA neurons with clozapine-N-oxide (CNO) influences the ability of contextual or discrete remifentanil-paired cues to reinstate drug seeking following either voluntary (punishment-induced; GroupPunish), or experimenter-imposed (extinction training; GroupExt) abstinence. In GroupPunish rats, we also chemogenetically inhibited VPGABA neurons, and examined spontaneous VP activity (Fos) during cued-reinstatement. In both GroupPunish and GroupExt rats, stimulating Gq-signaling in VPGABA neurons augmented remifentanil reinstatement in a cue- and context-dependent manner. Conversely, engaging inhibitory Gi-signaling in VPGABA neurons in GroupPunish suppressed cue-induced reinstatement, and additionally cue-triggered seeking was correlated with Fos in rostral, but not caudal VP. In contrast, neither stimulating nor inhibiting VPGABA neurons influenced unpunished remifentanil self-administration. We conclude that VPGABA neurons bidirectionally control opioid seeking regardless of the specific relapse model employed, highlighting their fundamental role in opioid relapse-like behavior across behavioral models, and potentially across species.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Human Cerebral Spheroids Undergo Activity Dependent Changes In Cellular Composition And MicroRNA Expression</a></h4>

              
                Activity-induced neurogenesis has been extensively studied in rodents but the lack of ante mortem accessibility to human brain at the cellular and molecular levels limits studies of the process in humans. Using cerebral spheroids derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), we investigated the effects of increased neuronal activity on neurogenesis. Our studies demonstrate that increasing neuronal activity with 4-aminopyridine in 3-month-old cerebral spheroids is associated with increases in the numbers of new neurons and decreases in the population of new glial cells. We also observed a significant decrease in the expression of miR-135a, which has previously been shown to be decreased in exercise-induced neurogenesis. Predicted targets of miR-135a include key participants in the SMAD2/3 and BDNF pathways. Together, our results suggest that iPSC-derived cerebral spheroids are an attractive model to study some aspects of activity-induced neurogenesis.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dopamine transporter and synaptic vesicle sorting defects initiate auxilin-linked Parkinson's disease</a></h4>

              
                Auxilin participates in the uncoating of clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs), thereby facilitating synaptic vesicle (SV) regeneration at presynaptic sites. Auxilin (DNAJC6/PARK19) loss-of-function mutations cause early-onset Parkinson's disease (PD). Here, we utilized auxilin-knockout (KO) mice to elucidate the mechanisms through which auxilin deficiency and clathrin-uncoating deficits lead to PD. We demonstrate that auxilin KO mice display the cardinal features of PD, including progressive motor deficits, -synuclein pathology, nigral dopaminergic loss, and neuroinflammation. Through unbiased proteomic and neurochemical analyses, we demonstrate that dopamine homeostasis is disrupted in auxilin KO brains, including via slower dopamine reuptake kinetics in vivo, an effect associated with dopamine transporter misrouting into axonal membrane deformities in the dorsal striatum. We also show that elevated macroautophagy and defective SV protein sorting contribute to ineffective dopamine sequestration and homeostasis, ultimately leading to neurodegeneration. This study advances our knowledge of how presynaptic endocytosis deficits lead to dopaminergic vulnerability and pathogenesis of PD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Abnormal brain state distribution and network connectivity in a SYNGAP1 rat model</a></h4>

              
                Mutations in the SYNGAP1 gene are one of the common predictors of neurodevelopmental disorders, commonly resulting in individuals developing autism, intellectual disability, epilepsy, and sleep deficits. EEG recordings in neurodevelopmental disorders show potential to identify clinically translatable biomarkers to both diagnose and track the progress of novel therapeutic strategies, as well as providing insight into underlying pathological mechanisms. In a rat model of SYNGAP1 haploinsufficiency in which the exons encoding the calcium/lipid binding and GTPase activating protein (GAP) domains have been deleted (Syngap+/{Delta}-GAP) we analysed the duration and occurrence of wake, non rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) brain states during 6 hour multi-electrode EEG recordings. We find that although Syngap+/{Delta}-GAP animals spend an equivalent percent time in wake and sleep states, they have an abnormal brain state distribution as the number of wake and NREM bouts are reduced and there is an increase in the average duration of both wake and NREM epochs. We perform connectivity analysis by calculating the average imaginary coherence between electrode pairs at varying distance thresholds during these states. In group averages from pairs of electrodes at short distances from each other, a clear reduction in connectivity during NREM is present between 11.5 Hz and 29.5 Hz, a frequency range that overlaps with sleep spindles, oscillatory phenomena thought to be important for normal brain function and memory consolidation. Sleep spindles occurrence, amplitude, power and spread across multiple electrodes were not reduced in Syngap+/{Delta}-GAP rats, with only a small decrease in duration detected. Nonetheless, by analysing the dynamic imaginary coherence during sleep spindles, we found a reduction in high connectivity instances between short-distance electrode pairs. Finally, by comparing the dynamic imaginary coherence during sleep spindles between individual electrode pairs, we identified a group of channels over the right somatosensory, association and visual cortices that have a significant reduction in connectivity during sleep spindles in mutant animals. These data suggest that Syngap+/{Delta}-GAP rats have altered brain state dynamics and EEG connectivity, which may have clinical relevance for SYNGAP haploinsufficiency in humans.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Speech understanding oppositely affectsacoustic and linguistic neural tracking in aspeech rate manipulation paradigm.</a></h4>

              
                When listening to continuous speech, the human brain can track features of the presented speech signal. It has been shown that neural tracking of acoustic features is a prerequisite for speech understanding and can predict speech understanding in controlled circumstances. However, the brain also tracks linguistic features of speech, which may be more directly related to speech understanding. We investigated acoustic and linguistic speech processing as a function of varying speech understanding by manipulating the speech rate. In this paradigm, acoustic and linguistic speech processing are affected simultaneously but in opposite directions: When the speech rate increases, more acoustic information per second is present. In contrast, linguistic information decreases as speech becomes less intelligible at higher speech rates. We measured the EEG of 18 participants who listened to speech at various speech rates. As expected and confirmed by the behavioral results, speech understanding decreased with increasing speech rate. Accordingly, linguistic neural tracking decreased with increasing speech rate, but acoustic neural tracking increased. This indicates that neural tracking of linguistic representations can capture the gradual effect of decreasing speech understanding. In addition, increased acoustic neural tracking does not necessarily imply better speech understanding. This suggests that, although more challenging to measure due to the low signal-to-noise ratio, linguistic neural tracking may be a more direct predictor of speech understanding.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sensitisation of colonic nociceptors by TNFα is dependent on TNFR1 expression and p38 MAPK activity</a></h4>

              
                Visceral pain is a leading cause of morbidity in gastrointestinal diseases, which is exacerbated by the gut related side-effects of many analgesics. New treatments are needed and further understanding of the mediators and mechanisms underpinning visceral nociception in disease states is required to facilitate this. The pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF is linked to pain in patients with inflammatory bowel disease or irritable bowel syndrome and has been shown to sensitise colonic sensory neurons. Somatic, TNF-triggered thermal and mechanical hypersensitivity is mediated by TRPV1 signalling and p38 MAPK activity respectively, downstream of TNFR1 receptor activation. We therefore hypothesised that TNFR1-evoked p38 MAPK activity may also be responsible for TNF sensitisation of colonic afferent responses to the TRPV1 agonist capsaicin, and noxious distension of the bowel. Using Ca2+ imaging of dorsal root ganglia sensory neurons, we observed TNF-mediated increases in intracellular [Ca2+] and sensitisation of capsaicin responses. The sensitising effects of TNF were dependent on TNFR1 expression and attenuated by TRPV1 and p38 MAPK inhibition. Consistent with these findings, ex vivo colonic afferent fibre recordings demonstrated enhanced response to noxious ramp distention of the bowel and bath application of capsaicin following TNF pre-treatment. Responses were reversed by p38 MAPK inhibition and absent in tissue from TNFR1 knockout mice. Our findings demonstrate a contribution of TNFR1, p38 MAPK and TRPV1 to TNF-induced sensitisation of colonic afferents, highlighting the potential utility of these drug targets for the treatment of visceral pain in GI disease.

                Background: The sensory experience of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) evokes cortical responses measured in EEG that confound interpretation of TMS-evoked potentials (TEPs). Methods for sensory masking have been proposed to minimize sensory contributions to the TEP, but the most effective combination for suprathreshold TMS to dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) is unknown. Objective: We applied sensory suppression techniques and quantified electrophysiology and perception from suprathreshold dlPFC TMS to identify the best combination to minimize the sensory TEP. Methods: In 21 healthy adults, we applied single pulse TMS at 120% resting motor threshold (rMT) to the left dlPFC and compared EEG vertex N100-P200 and perception. Conditions included three protocols: No masking (no auditory masking, no foam, jittered inter-stimulus interval (ISI)), Standard masking (auditory noise, foam, jittered ISI), and our ATTENUATE protocol (auditory noise, foam, over-the-ear protection, unjittered ISI). Results: ATTENUATE reduced vertex N100-P200 by 56%, "click" loudness perception by 50%, and scalp sensation by 36%. We show that sensory prediction, induced with predictable ISI, has a suppressive effect on vertex N100-P200, and that combining standard suppression protocols with sensory prediction provides the best N100-P200 suppression. ATTENUATE was more effective than Standard masking, which only reduced vertex N100-P200 by 22%, loudness by 27%, and scalp sensation by 24%. Conclusions: We introduce a sensory suppression protocol superior to Standard masking and demonstrate that using an unjittered ISI can contribute to minimizing sensory confounds. ATTENUATE provides superior sensory suppression to increase TEP signal-to-noise and contributes to a growing understanding of TMS-EEG sensory neuroscience.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Abnormal molecular signatures of inflammation, energy metabolism and vesicle biology in human Huntington disease peripheral tissues</a></h4>

              
                Background: A major challenge in neurodegenerative diseases concerns identifying biological disease signatures that track with disease progression or respond to an intervention. Several clinical trials in Huntington disease (HD), an inherited, progressive neurodegenerative disease, are currently ongoing. Therefore, we examined whether peripheral tissues can serve as a source of readily accessible biological signatures at the RNA and protein level in HD patients. Results: We generated large, high-quality human datasets from skeletal muscle, skin and adipose tissue to probe molecular changes in human premanifest and early manifest HD patients - those most likely involved in clinical trials. In-depth single nucleotide polymorphism data across the HTT gene will facilitate the use of the generated primary- and iPSC cell lines in allele-specific targeting approaches. The analysis of the transcriptomics and proteomics data shows robust, stage-dependent dysregulation. Gene ontology analysis confirmed the involvement of inflammation and energy metabolism in peripheral HD pathogenesis. Furthermore, we observed changes in the homeostasis of extracellular vesicles, where we found consistent changes of genes and proteins involved in this process. Conclusions: Our 'omics data document the involvement of inflammation, energy metabolism and extracellular vesicle homeostasis. This demonstrates the potential to identify biological signatures from peripheral tissues in HD suitable as biomarkers in clinical trials. Together with the primary cell lines established from peripheral tissues and a large panel of iPSC lines that can serve as human models of HD, the generated data are a valuable and unique resource to advance the current understanding of molecular mechanisms driving HD pathogenesis.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Large-scale biophysically detailed model of somatosensory thalamocortical circuits in NetPyNE</a></h4>

              
                The primary somatosensory cortex (S1) of mammals is critically important in the perception of touch and related sensorimotor behaviors. In 2015 the Blue Brain Project developed a groundbreaking rat S1 microcircuit simulation with over 31,000 neurons with 207 morpho-electrical neuron types, and 37 million synapses, incorporating anatomical and physiological information from a wide range of experimental studies. We have implemented this highly-detailed and complex model S1 model in NetPyNE, using the data available in the Neocortical Microcircuit Collaboration Portal. NetPyNE provides a Python high-level interface to NEURON and allows defining complicated multiscale models using an intuitive declarative standardized language. It also facilitates running parallel simulations, automates the optimization and exploration of parameters using supercomputers, and provides a wide range of built-in analysis functions. This will make the S1 model more accessible and simpler to scale, modify and extend in order to explore research questions or interconnect to other existing models. Despite some implementation differences, the NetPyNE model closely reproduced the original cell morphologies, electrophysiological responses, spatial distribution for all 207 cell types; and the connectivity properties of the 1941 pathways, including synaptic dynamics and short-term plasticity (STP). The NetPyNE S1 simulations produced reasonable physiological rates and activity patterns across all populations, and, when STP was included, produced a 1 Hz oscillation comparable to that of the original model. We also extended the model by adding thalamic circuits, including 6 distinct thalamic populations with intrathalamic, thalamocortical and corticothalamic connectivity derived from experimental data. Overall, our work provides a widely accessible, data-driven and biophysically-detailed model of the somatosensory thalamocortical circuits that can be utilized as a community tool for researchers to study neural dynamics, function and disease.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Recurrent circuits amplify corticofugal signals and drive feed-forward inhibition in the inferior colliculus</a></h4>

              
                The inferior colliculus (IC) is a midbrain hub critical for perceiving complex, time-varying sounds such as speech. In addition to processing ascending inputs from most auditory brainstem nuclei, the IC receives descending inputs from auditory cortex that control IC neuron feature selectivity, plasticity, and certain forms of perceptual learning. Although these corticofugal synapses primarily release the excitatory transmitter glutamate, many physiology studies show that auditory cortical activity has a net inhibitory effect on IC neuron spiking. Perplexingly, anatomy studies indicate that corticofugal axons primarily target glutamatergic IC neurons while only sparsely innervating IC GABA neurons, thereby suggesting that corticofugal inhibition of the IC occurs largely independently of feedforward activation of local GABA neurons. We shed light on this paradox using in vitro electrophysiology and optogenetics in acute IC slices from fluorescent reporter mice. We find that corticofugal synaptic strength is indeed stronger onto IC glutamate compared to GABA neurons. Nevertheless, two mechanisms enable reliable corticofugal activation of local GABA neurons. 1) Many IC GABA neurons fire tonically at rest, such that sparse and weak excitation suffices to significantly increase their spike rates. 2) Corticofugal activity triggers barrages of large amplitude, polysynaptic EPSPs in IC GABA neurons, owing to a dense intra-collicular connectivity from local axon collaterals of IC glutamate neurons. Consequently, repetitive activity in corticofugal fibers drives spikes in IC GABA neurons and generates substantial recurrent inhibition. Thus, descending signals trigger intra-collicular inhibition despite apparent constraints of monosynaptic connectivity between auditory cortex and IC GABA neurons.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Data-driven multiscale model of macaque auditory thalamocortical circuits reproduces in vivo dynamics</a></h4>

              
                We developed a biophysically-detailed model of the macaque auditory thalamocortical circuits, including primary auditory cortex (A1), medial geniculate body (MGB) and thalamic reticular nuclei (TRN), using the NEURON simulator and NetPyNE multiscale modeling tool. We simulated A1 as a cortical column with a depth of 2000 m and 200 m diameter, containing over 12k neurons and 30M synapses. Neuron densities, laminar locations, classes, morphology and biophysics, and connectivity at the long-range, local and dendritic scale were derived from published experimental data. The A1 model included 6 cortical layers and multiple populations of neurons consisting of 4 excitatory and 4 inhibitory types, and was reciprocally connected to the thalamus (MGB and TRN) mimicking anatomical connectivity. MGB included core and matrix thalamocortical neurons with layer-specific projection patterns to A1, and thalamic interneurons projecting locally. Auditory stimulus related inputs were simulated using phenomenological models of the cochlear auditory nerve and the inferior colliculus, which served as input to MGB. The model generated cell type and layer-specific firing rates consistent with overall ranges observed experimentally, and accurately simulated the corresponding local field potentials (LFPs), current source density (CSD), and electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. Laminar CSD patterns during spontaneous activity and responses to speech input were similar to those recorded experimentally. Physiological oscillations emerged spontaneously across frequency bands without external rhythmic inputs and were comparable to those recorded in vivo. We used the model to unravel the contributions from distinct cell type and layer-specific neuronal populations to oscillation events detected in CSD, and explore how these relate to the population firing patterns. Overall, the computational model provides a quantitative theoretical framework to integrate and interpret a wide range of experimental data in auditory circuits. It also constitutes a powerful tool to evaluate hypotheses and make predictions about the cellular and network mechanisms underlying common experimental measurements, including MUA, LFP and EEG signals.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Multiplex imaging of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons with CO-Detection by indEXing (CODEX) technology</a></h4>

              
                Background: Human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) models have been hailed as a breakthrough for understanding disease and developing new therapeutics. The major advantage of iPSC-derived neurons is that they carry the genetic background of the donor, and as such could be more predictive for clinical translation. However, the development of these cell models is time-consuming and expensive and it is thus critical to maximize biomarker readout from every model that is developed. One option is to use a highly multiplexed biomarker imaging assay, like CO-Detection by indEXing (CODEX), which allows detection of 50+ targets in situ at single-cell resolution. New Method: This paper describes the development of CODEX in neuronal cell cultures derived from human iPSCs. Results: We differentiated human iPSCs into mixed neuronal and glial cultures on glass coverslips. We then developed and optimized a panel of 21 antibodies to phenotype iPSC-derived neuronal subtypes of cortical, dopaminergic, and striatal neurons, as well as astrocytes, and pre-and postsynaptic proteins. Comparison with existing methods: Compared to standard immunocytochemistry, CODEX oligo-conjugated fluorophores circumvent antibody host interactions and allow for highly customized multiplexing. Conclusion: We show that CODEX can be applied to iPSC neuronal cultures and developed fixation and staining protocols for the neurons to sustain the multiple wash-stain cycles of the technology. Furthermore, we demonstrate both cellular and subcellular resolution imaging of multiplexed biomarkers in the same samples. CODEX is a powerful technique that complements other single-cell omics technologies for in-depth phenotype analysis.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Tau seeding without tauopathy</a></h4>

              
                Neurodegenerative tauopathies such as Alzheimer disease (AD) are caused by brain accumulation of tau assemblies. Evidence suggests tau functions as a prion, and cells and animals efficiently propagate unique tau assemblies. This suggests a dedicated cellular replication machinery, with normal physiologic function for tau seeds. Consequently, we hypothesized that healthy control brains would have seeding activity. We recently developed a novel monoclonal antibody (MD3.1) specific for tau seeds. We used this antibody to immunopurify tau from the parietal and cerebellar cortices of 19 healthy subjects ranging 19-65 years. We detected seeding in the parietal cortex, but not in the cerebellum, or in wild-type or human tau knockin mice, suggesting that cellular/genetic context dictates development of seed-competent tau. Seeding did not correlate with subject age or brain tau levels. Dot blot analyses revealed no AT8 immunoreactivity above background levels in parietal and cerebellar extracts and <1/100 of that present in AD. Based on binding to a panel of antibodies, the conformational characteristics of control seeds differed from AD, suggesting a unique underlying assembly, or structural ensemble. The ability of tau to adopt self-replicating conformations under non-pathogenic conditions may reflect normal function that goes awry in disease states.

                Understanding cortical function requires studying its multiple scales: molecular, cellular, circuit and behavior. We developed a biophysically detailed multiscale model of mouse primary motor cortex (M1) with over 10,000 neurons, 30 million synapses. Neuron types, densities, spatial distributions, morphologies, biophysics, connectivity and dendritic synapse locations were derived from experimental data. The model includes long-range inputs from 7 thalamic and cortical regions, and noradrenergic inputs from locus coeruleus. Connectivity depended on cell class and cortical depth at sublaminar resolution. The model reproduced and predicted in vivo layer- and cell type-specific responses (firing rates and LFP) associated with behavioral states (quiet and movement) and experimental manipulations (noradrenaline receptor blocking and thalamus inactivation), and enabled us to evaluate different hypotheses of the circuitry and mechanisms involved. This quantitative theoretical framework can be used to integrate and interpret M1 experimental data and sheds light on the M1 cell type-specific multiscale dynamics associated with a range of experimental conditions and behaviors.

                Stem cells show intrinsic interferon signaling, which protects them from viral infections. In the brain, type I interferon signaling increases in stem cells as they age and reduces their ability to become activated for repair. Whether interferons impact stem cell activity only in aging, how, and if it is coupled to the intrinsic immune function remains elusive. Our study shows that interferon-{beta} arrested stem cells in G0 of the cell cycle and transiently increased their TOR signaling before switching it off. This bimodal regulation of TOR is needed to repress translation of Sox2. Single-cell transcriptomics reveals that in the absence of interferon receptors, interferon signaling levels change and its increase with age disappears. Mathematical simulations indicate that interferons are beneficial in the young and harmful in the old brain. Our study identifies interferons as genuine regulators of stem cell homeostasis and potential therapeutic target to repair the aging brain.

                Kleefstra syndrome in humans is characterized by general delay in development, intellectual disability and autistic features. The mouse model of this disease (Ehmt1+/-) expresses anxiety, autistic-like traits, and aberrant social interactions with non-cagemates. To investigate how Ehmt1+/- mice behave with unfamiliar conspecifics, we allowed adult, male animals to freely interact for 10 minutes in a neutral, novel environment within a host-visitor setting. In 17 out of 74 trials there were defensive and offensive behaviors. Our key finding was that Ehmt1+/- mice displayed defensive postures, attacking and biting; in contrast, wild-type (WT) interacting with other WT did not enact such behaviors. Further, if there was a fight between an Ehmt1+/- and a WT mouse, it was always the Ehmt1+/- who initiated these behaviors.

                Objective: Cervical transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation (tSCS) is a promising technology that can support motor function recovery of upper-limbs after spinal cord injury. Its efficacy may depend on the ability to recruit sensory afferents and convey excitatory inputs onto motoneurons. Therefore, understanding its physiological mechanisms is critical to accelerate its development towards clinical applications. In this study, we used an anatomically realistic computational model of the cervical spine to compare -motor, A-sensory, and A{beta}-sensory fiber activation thresholds and activation sites. Approach: We developed a tridimensional geometry of the cervical body and tSCS electrodes with a cathode centred at the C7 spinous process and an anode placed over the anterior neck. The geometrical model was used to estimate the electric potential distributions along motor and sensory fiber trajectories at the C7 spinal level using a finite element method. We implemented dedicated motor and sensory fiber models to simulate the -motor and A-sensory fibers using 12, 16, and 20 {micro}m diameter fibers, and A{beta}-sensory fibers using 6, 9, and 12 {micro}m diameter fibers. We estimated nerve fiber activation thresholds and sites for a 2 ms monophasic stimulating pulse and compared them across the fiber groups. Main results: Our results showed lower activation thresholds of A- and A{beta}-sensory fibers compared with -motor fibers, suggesting preferential sensory fiber activation. We also found no differences between activation thresholds of A-sensory and large A{beta}-sensory fibers, implying they were co-activated. The activation sites were located at the dorsal and ventral root levels. Significance: Using a realistic computational model, we demonstrated preferential activation of dorsal root A- and A{beta}-sensory fibers compared with ventral root -motor fibers during cervical tSCS. These findings suggest high proprioceptive and cutaneous contributions to neural activations during cervical tSCS, which inform the underlying mechanisms of upper-limb functional motor recovery.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Hindbrain catecholaminergic inputs to the paraventricular thalamus scale feeding and metabolic efficiency in stress-related contexts</a></h4>

              
                Aim: The regulation of food intake and energy balance relies on the integration of exteroceptive and interoceptive signals monitoring nutritional, metabolic and emotional states. This study aims at unraveling the role of catecholaminergic (CA) inputs to the paraventricular thalamus (PVT) in scaling feeding and metabolic efficiency. Methods: To tackle this question, a region-specific retrograde disruption of PVT CA inputs was performed. Behavioral tests and in vivo calorimetric technologies were mobilized to study the adaptive strategies underlying feeding, metabolic efficiency and nutrient partitioning. Moreover, immunofluorescence investigations were conducted to identify the sources of TH-neurons projecting to the PVT and to reveal the molecular pattern of neuronal activation (cFos) in the PVT as well as in homeostasis-related regions of the hypothalamus. Results: First, we show that PVT CA inputs mainly arise from the hindbrain, notably the locus coeruleus (LC) and the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS). Second, we reveal that PVT CA inputs contribute to feeding strategies and metabolic efficiency in environmental, behavioral, physiological and metabolic stress-like contexts. Third, we show that PVT CA inputs contribute in modulating the activity of PVT as well as lateral (LH) and dorsomedial (DMH) hypothalamic neurons. Conclusion: This study, by assessing the key role of PVT CA inputs in scaling homeostatic and allostatic regulations of feeding patterns, reveals the integrative and converging hindbrain[-&gt;]PVT paths that contribute to whole-body metabolic adaptations in stress-like contexts.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Traveling waves in the monkey frontoparietal network predict recent reward memory</a></h4>

              
                Brain function depends on neural communication, but the mechanisms of this communication are not well understood. Recent studies suggest that one form of neural communication is through traveling waves (TWs)-patterns of neural oscillations that propagate within and between areas. We show that TWs appear robustly in microarray recordings in monkey frontal and parietal cortex and encode memory for recent rewards. While making saccades to obtain probabilistic rewards, monkeys were sensitive to the (statistically irrelevant) prior reward, which is consistent with behavioral biases produced by reward history. TWs in frontal and parietal areas were stronger in trials following a prior reward versus a lack of reward and, in the frontal lobe, correlated with the monkeys' sensitivity to the prior reward. The findings suggest that neural communication across fronto-parietal areas, reflected by TWs, maintains default reward memories, while communication within the frontal lobe mediates the read out of the memories for prospective expectations.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Reading instruction causes changes in category-selective visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                Education sculpts specialized neural circuits for skills like reading that are critical to success in modern society but were not anticipated by the selective pressures of evolution. Does the emergence of brain regions that selectively process novel visual stimuli like words occur at the expense of cortical representations of other stimulus categories like faces and objects? To answer this question we designed a randomized controlled trial where pre-literate children (five years of age) were randomly assigned to intervention programs that either taught reading skills (Letter Intervention) or oral language comprehension skills (Language Intervention). Magnetoencephalography (MEG) data collected before and after the interventions revealed that being assigned to the Letter versus Language Intervention induced different patterns of changes in category selective responses in high-level visual cortex. We found moderate support for the notion that words compete with other objects for cortical territory as children become attuned to this new class of visual stimuli. How these changes play out over a longer timescale is still unclear but, based on these data, we can surmise that high-level visual cortex undergoes rapid changes as children enter school and begin establishing new skills like literacy.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Brain aging is faithfully modelled in organotypic brain slices and accelerated by prions</a></h4>

              
                Mammalian models are essential for brain aging research. However, the long lifespan and limited amenability to genetic and pharmacological perturbations have hindered the use of mammals for dissecting aging-regulatory molecular networks and discovering new anti-aging interventions. To circumvent these limitations, we developed an ex vivo model system that faithfully mimics the aging process of the mammalian brain using cultured mouse brain slices. Genome-wide gene expression analyses showed that brain slices spontaneously upregulated senescence-associated genes over time and reproduced many of the transcriptional characteristics of aged brains. Treatment with rapamycin, a classical anti-aging compound, largely abolished the time-dependent transcriptional changes in brain slices. Using this model system, we discovered that prions drastically accelerated the development of age-related molecular signatures and the pace of brain aging. We confirmed this finding in mouse models and human victims of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. These data establish a novel, eminently tractable mammalian model of brain aging, and uncover a surprising acceleration of brain aging in prion diseases.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Chronic Alcohol Consumption Alters Home-Cage Behaviors and Responses to Ethologically Relevant Predator Tasks in Mice</a></h4>

              
                Alcohol use disorders (AUD) are the most prevalent substance use disorders worldwide. Considering recent reports indicating an increase in alcohol use particularly in females, it is vital to understand how alcohol history impacts behavior. Animal model research on withdrawal-associated affective states tends to focus on males, forced alcohol paradigms, and a few traditional anxiety/stress tests. While this has been essential, heavy alcohol use triggers adverse withdrawal-related affective states that can influence how people respond to a large variety of life events and stressors. To this end, we show that behaviors in the home-cage, open field, looming disc, and robogator predator threat task, which vary in task demand and intensity, are altered in mice with a history of voluntary alcohol consumption. In alcohol-exposed males, behaviors in the home cage, a low anxiety baseline environment, suggest increased vigilance/exploration. However, in the open field and robogator task, which induce heightened arousal and task demands, a more hesitant/avoidant phenotype is seen. Female alcohol mice show no behavioral alterations in the home cage and open field test, however, in the looming disc task, which mimics an overhead advancing predator and forces a behavioral choice, we see greater escape responses compared to water controls, indicative of active stress coping behaviors. This suggests females may begin to show alcohol-induced alterations as task demands increase. To date, few drugs have advanced past clinical trials for the treatment of AUD, and those that have are predominately used in life-threatening situations only. No treatments exist for ameliorating negative withdrawal related states, which could aid in harm reduction related to heavy alcohol use. Understanding how withdrawal alters a variety of behavioral responses that are linked to stress coping can widen our understanding of alcohol abuse and lead us closer to better therapeutics to help individuals with AUD.

	<p>Heinrich Wilhelm Gottfried von Waldeyer-Harz is regarded as a significant anatomist who helped the entire medical world to discover and develop new techniques in order to improve patient treatment as well as decrease death rates. He discovered fascia propria recti in 1899, which is important in total mesorectal excision which improves cancer treatment as well as outcomes. He played an important role in developing the neuron theory which states that the nervous system consists of multiple individual cells, called neurons, which currently stands as the basis of the impulse transmission of neurons. Waldeyer was also interested in cytology, where he made a substantial contribution, being the first who adopted the name &amp;amp;ldquo;Chromosome&amp;amp;rdquo;. Therefore, he accelerated the progress of what it is now known as Genetics. In conclusion, starting from the Fascia propria recti and continuing with great discoveries in cytology and neuron theory, Wilhelm von Waldeyer represents a key person in what we today call medicine.</p>

	<p>Language ability is strongly related to important child developmental outcomes. Family-level socioeconomic status influences child language ability; it is unclear if, and through which mechanisms, neighborhood-level factors impact child language. The current study investigated the association between neighborhood factors (deprivation and disorder) assessed before birth and child language outcomes at age 5, with sleep duration as a potential underlying pathway. Secondary analysis was conducted on data collected between 2008 and 2018 on a subsample of 2444 participants from the All Our Families cohort study (Calgary, Canada) for whom neighborhood information from pregnancy could be geocoded. Neighborhood deprivation was determined using the Vancouver Area Neighborhood Deprivation Index (VANDIX), and disorder was assessed using crime reports. Mothers reported on their children&amp;amp;rsquo;s sleep duration and language ability. Multilevel modeling indicated that greater neighborhood deprivation and disorder during pregnancy were predictive of lower scores on the Child Communication Checklist&amp;amp;ndash;2 (CCC&amp;amp;ndash;2) at 5 years. Path analyses revealed an indirect effect of neighborhood disorder on language through child sleep duration at 12 months. These results add to growing evidence that child development should be considered within the context of multiple systems. Sleep duration as an underlying link between environmental factors and child language ability warrants further study as a potential target for intervention.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Pharmacogenetic and whole-brain activity analyses uncover integration of distinct molecular and circuit programs that drive learning</a></h4>

              
                Habituation is a foundational learning process critical for animals to adapt their behavior to changes in their sensory environment. Although habituation is considered a simple form of learning, the identification of a multitude of molecular pathways including several neurotransmitter systems that regulate this process suggests an unexpected level of complexity. How the vertebrate brain integrates these various pathways to accomplish habituation learning, whether they act independently or intersect with one another, and whether they act via divergent or overlapping neural circuits has remained unclear. To address these questions, we combined pharmacogenetic pathway analysis with unbiased whole-brain activity mapping using the larval zebrafish. This approach revealed five distinct molecular and circuit modules that regulate habituation learning and identified a set of molecularly defined brain regions associated with four of the five modules. Moreover, we find that in module 1 the palmitoyltransferase Hip14 cooperates with dopamine and NMDA signaling to drive plasticity, while in module 3 the adaptor protein complex subunit Ap2s1 drives habituation by antagonizing dopamine signaling, revealing two distinct and opposing roles for dopaminergic neuromodulation in the regulation of learning. Combined, our results define a core set of distinct modules that act in concert to regulate learning-associated plasticity, and provide compelling evidence that even seemingly simple learning behaviors in a compact vertebrate brain are regulated by a complex and overlapping set of molecular and circuit mechanisms.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Multiple mechanisms mediate the suppression of motion vision during escape maneuvers in flying Drosophila.</a></h4>

              
                Animals must be able to discriminate self-generated (reafferent) from external (exafferent) sensory input. Otherwise, the former could interfere with perception and behavioral actions. The way this can be achieved is through an efference copy, which suppresses reafferent sensory input. An example for this is the optomotor response of the fly. With the optomotor response, flies stabilize a straight flight path by correcting for unintended deviations, which they sense as visual motion of their surrounding or optic flow. HS cells of the fly are tuned to rotational optic flow and are thought to mediate optomotor responses to horizontal motion. It has been shown that during spontaneous turns, an efference copy influences the membrane potential of HS cells. Here we investigate the influence of an efference copy during looming-elicited evasive turns combined with a subsequent optomotor stimulus in Drosophila. We show that looming stimuli themselves can influence the processing of preferred-direction motion in HS cells. In addition, an efference copy can influence visual processing during saccades in both directions, but only in a subset of cells. Our study supports the notion that processing of sensory information is finely tuned and dependent on both stimulus history and behavioral context.

                Basal forebrain cholinergic neurons are thought to modulate how organisms process and respond to environmental stimuli through impacts on arousal, attention, memory, and motivated behavior. We questioned whether basal forebrain cholinergic neurons are directly involved in conditioned behavior, independent of ancillary roles in stimulus processing. We found that cholinergic neurons are active during behavioral responding for a reward - even in the absence of reward or discrete stimuli. Photostimulation of cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain or their terminals in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) selectively drove conditioned responding (licking), but not unconditioned licking nor innate motor outputs. In vivo electrophysiological recordings revealed reward-contingency-dependent-gating of cholinergic suppression of BLA neural activity during cholinergic photostimulation, but not dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC). Finally, cholinergic terminals suppressed BLA projection neuron activity via monosynaptic muscarinic receptor signaling and facilitation of firing in GABAergic interneurons. Taken together, we show that cholinergic effects are modulated by reward contingency in a target-specific manner to promote conditioned responding. Given that the effects cholinergic photostimulation were modulated by rewards, our results constrain clinical goals of augmenting cholinergic function to improve neuropsychiatric symptoms.

                In adulthood, sleep-wake rhythms are one of the most prominent behaviors under circadian control. However, during early life, sleep is spread across the 24-hour day. The mechanism through which sleep rhythms emerge, and the consequent advantage conferred to a juvenile animal, are unknown. In 2nd instar Drosophila larvae (L2), like human infants, sleep is not under circadian control. Here, we identify the precise developmental timepoint when the circadian clock begins to regulate sleep in Drosophila, leading to the emergence of sleep rhythms at the early 3rd instar stage (L3). At this stage, a cellular connection forms between DN1a clock neurons and arousal-promoting Dh44 neurons, bringing arousal under clock control to drive the emergence of circadian sleep. Finally, we demonstrate that L3 but not L2 larvae exhibit long-term memory (LTM) of an aversive cue, and that this LTM depends upon deep sleep generated once sleep rhythms begin. We propose that the developmental emergence of circadian sleep enables more complex cognitive processes, including the onset of enduring memories.

                Microcircuits in the neocortex are functionally organized along layers and columns, which are the fundamental modules of cortical information processing. While the function of cortical microcircuits has focused on neuronal elements, much less is known about the functional organization of astrocytes and their bidirectional interaction with neurons. Here we show that CB1R-mediated astrocyte activation by neuron-released endocannabinoids elevate astrocyte Ca2+ levels, stimulate ATP/adenosine release as gliotransmitters, and transiently depress synaptic transmission in layer 5 pyramidal neurons at relatively distant synapses (20 um) from the stimulated neuron. This astrocyte-mediated heteroneuronal synaptic depression occurred between pyramidal neurons within a cortical column and was absent in neurons belonging to adjacent cortical columns. Moreover, this form of heteroneuronal synaptic depression occurs between neurons located in particular layers, following a specific connectivity pattern that depends on a layer-specific neuron-to-astrocyte signaling. These results unravel the existence of astrocyte-mediated non-synaptic communication between cortical neurons, and that this communication is column- and layer-specific, which adds further complexity to the intercellular signaling processes in the cortex.

                Parkinson's disease (PD) patients possess circulating T cells that recognize specific -synuclein- (-syn)-derived epitopes. One epitope, -syn32-46, interacts strongly with the HLA-DRB1*15:01 allele implicated in multiple autoimmune diseases. Whether this interaction and -syn-specific T cells play roles in PD pathogenesis remains unknown. We report that -syn32-46 immunization of a humanized mouse that expresses HLA-DRB1*15:01 triggers intestinal inflammation. This enteric pathology is characterized by activation of innate and adaptive immune responses and type I interferon signaling as well as loss of enteric dopaminergic neurons in the submucosal plexus, and results in constipation and weight loss. Depletion of CD4+, but not CD8+, T cells partially rescues enteric neurodegeneration. Thus, an interaction between -syn32-46 and HLA-DRB1*15:01 induces gut inflammation and CD4+ T cell-mediated loss of enteric dopaminergic neurons in the humanized mice. These findings suggest a mechanism for the prodromal enteric features of PD and indicate future directions for disease screening and treatment.

                The hippocampal CA2 region, an area important for social memory, has been suspected to play a role in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) because of its resistance to the degeneration observed in neighboring CA1 and CA3 regions in both human and rodent models of TLE. However, little is known about whether alterations in CA2 properties serve to promote seizure generation or propagation. Here we have used the pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (PILO-SE) model of TLE to explore the role of CA2. Ex vivo electrophysiological recordings from acute hippocampal slices revealed a set of coordinated changes that enhance CA2 intrinsic excitability, reduce CA2 local inhibitory input, and increase CA2 excitatory output to its major CA1 synaptic target. Moreover, selective silencing of CA2 pyramidal cells using a chemogenetic approach caused a significant decrease in the frequency of spontaneous seizures. These findings provide the first evidence that CA2 actively contributes to TLE seizure activity and may thus be a promising therapeutic target.

                Nucleus accumbens (NAc) is an important part of basal ganglia and receives major transsynaptic inputs from medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), basolateral amygdala nucleus (BL) and hippocampus (HPC). The neural circuits formed by mPFC, BL, HPC with NAc are closely related to diverse brain functions such as decision-making, social behavior, reward seeking behavior and aggressive behavior. However, a lack of information about network structure of NAc top-down afference has limited our understanding of mechanisms of these functions. Here, we systematically analyzed whole brain patterns of inputs to mPFC/HPC/BL-NAc projectors via using (TRIO) labeling strategy. We found that the upstream input patterns between mPFC-core and mPFC-shell projections, BL-core and BL-shell projections, HPC-core and HPC-shell projections were similar. The projections from mPFC and BL to NAc receive a wide range of inputs, while the projections from HPC to NAc receive convergent inputs. Furthermore, all of mPFC/HPC/BL-NAc projectors receive considerable inputs from respective local regions. This study lays a foundation for further analysis of complex NAc functional mechanisms.

                That sensory neurons alone transduce mechanical stimuli was challenged by the discovery of nociceptive Schwann cells that can initiate pain. Consistent with the existence of inherently mechanosensitive sensory Schwann cells, we found that mechanosensory function of almost all nociceptors, including those signaling fast pain were critically dependent on sensory Schwann cells. Furthermore, in polymodal nociceptors, sensory Schwann cells signal mechanical, but not cold or heat pain. Terminal Schwann cells also surround mechanoreceptor nerve-endings forming Meissners corpuscles that signal vibrotactile touch, raising the possibility that touch sensation is also dependent on such cells. Using optogenetics we show that Meissner`s corpuscle Schwann cells are necessary for the detection and perception of vibrotactile stimuli. Our results show that sensory Schwann cells within diverse glio-neural mechanosensory end-organs are sensors for mechanical pain as well as touch perception. These results place specialized sensory Schwann cells at the center of somatic sensation to all types of mechanical stimuli.

                Understanding changes in information processing between different brain states is a major challenge for contemporary neuroscience. On the circuit level, the encoding capability is quantified by the spectrally resolved dynamic gain function. Its shape, in particular its bandwidth, is important for behavioral performance and possibly even mental capabilities. It has been presumed to be under evolutionary pressure, yet its underlying physiological determinants remain unclear. A systematic characterization had so far been precluded by the computational complexity of realistic neurons. Here we develop a general analysis framework applicable to neuron models as well as experiments on real neurons. We decompose the dynamic gain function by breaking down the physical signal transformation into subthreshold processes, namely current-to-voltage filtering and AP pattern formation, and suprathreshold action potential initiation. Applying this decomposition, we show that: 1. Ultrafast population encoding can be realized by a type II neuron with Hodgkin-Huxley type potassium and sodium channels. 2. Adding a big dendrite improves high bandwidth encoding, primarily by attenuating low-frequency signal representation in the subthreshold region. 3. The initiation dynamics limits the 300-400 Hz bandwidth of real neurons, but not the 100 Hz bandwidth of the model. Our dynamic gain analysis can be universally applied to understand how (patho-) physiological modulation or mutagenesis changes a population's encoding capability.

	<p>Cognitive impairment is frequently reported among anti-phospholipid syndrome (APS) patients as well as anti-phospholipid antibody (aPL) carriers, but it is less studied than other manifestations of this condition. Moreover, the exact prevalence of cognitive impairment in these patients has not been accurately determined, mainly due to inconsistency in the tools used to identify impairment, small sample sizes, and variability in the anti-phospholipid antibodies measured and positivity cutoffs. The notion of a direct pathogenic effect is supported by the observation that the higher the number of aPLs present and the higher the load of the specific antibody, the greater the risk of cognitive impairment. There is some evidence to suggest that besides the thrombotic process, inflammation-related pathways play a role in the pathogenesis of cognitive impairment in APS. The cornerstone treatments of APS are anti-coagulant and anti-thrombotic medications. These treatments have shown some favorable effects in reversing cognitive impairment, but solid evidence for the efficacy and safety of these treatments in the context of cognitive impairment is still lacking. In this article, we review the current knowledge regarding the epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical associations, and treatment of cognitive impairment associated with APS and aPL positivity.</p>

	<p>For more than a decade, NMDAR autoimmune encephalitis has been studied and treated as a neurological condition, and good results have been achieve through immune therapies. Apart from being well represented in the CNS, NMDA receptors are currently known of and being studied in multiple non-neuronal cells with potential clinical significance. The association of NMDAR autoimmune encephalitis with pregnancy is rare, and hypokalemia is not mentioned. Methods: We present the case of a 30-year-old woman with NMDAR autoimmune encephalitis in her 17th week of pregnancy associated with persistent hypokalemia that had no apparent cause and resisted Kalium chloride supplementation. A diagnostic work-up including clinical, laboratory, and imagistic examinations, was performed. The case was monitored between May and September 2016 at Neurology, SCJUT. Results: Severe hypokalemia with normal serum sodium levels persisted throughout the course of clinical manifestation of anti-NMDAR autoimmune encephalitis. Conclusions: NMDAR autoimmune encephalitis is under-diagnosed in its atypical clinical variants, and this disease&amp;amp;rsquo;s association with hypokalemia is not mentioned in the literature. Still, it is of clinical importance because it attests to the implications of other organs/systems in the general autoimmune process of NMDAR encephalitis, and it might change the way we address certain psychiatric disorders by searching underlying organic conditions.</p>

	<p>The prevalence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has starkly increased, instigating research into risk factors for ASD. This research has identified immune risk factors for ASD, along with evidence of immune dysfunction and excess inflammation frequently experienced by autistic individuals. Increased innate inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-6, are seen repeatedly in ASD; however, the origin of excess IL-6 in ASD has not been identified. Here we explore specific responses of circulating monocytes from autistic children. We isolated CD14+ monocytes from whole blood and stimulated them for 24 h under three conditions: media alone, lipoteichoic acid to activate TLR2, and lipopolysaccharide to activate TLR4. We then measured secreted cytokine concentrations in cellular supernatant using a human multiplex bead immunoassay. We found that after TLR4 activation, CD14+ monocytes from autistic children produce increased IL-6 compared to monocytes from children with typical development. IL-6 concentration also correlated with worsening restrictive and repetitive behaviors. These findings suggest dysfunctional activation of myeloid cells, and may indicate that other cells of this lineage, including macrophages, and microglia in the brain, might have a similar dysfunction. Further research on myeloid cells in ASD is warranted.</p>

	<p>Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) patients using dopamine agonists can develop withdrawal symptoms, referred to as dopamine agonist withdrawal syndrome (DAWS), under dose tapering or discontinuation of these drugs. DAWS includes a severe stereotypical cluster of psychiatric and psychological symptoms encompassing severe mood and anxiety disturbances, autonomic symptoms, as well as generalized pain and drug cravings. However, symptoms of withdrawal of dopamine replacement therapies (DRT) are not simply limited to dopamine agonists tapering, as observed in PD patients on deep brain stimulation after dopaminergic drugs withdrawal related to surgery. To date, no DRT-related withdrawal syndrome has been described in PD patients who discontinue rasagiline, an irreversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B). Here we report three PD patients who developed a severe withdrawal syndrome after rasagiline suspension. The syndrome was mainly characterized by prominent psychiatric disorders (depression, anxiety with panic attacks, dysphoria, and agitation) associated with fatigue, generalized pain, and autonomic manifestations (closely resembling symptoms of DAWS). In our opinion, this report suggests the importance of closely monitoring PD patients undergoing rasagiline suspension for withdrawal symptoms and provides interesting points of reflection on the role of rasagiline and other MAO-B inhibitors in mood disorders.</p>

	<p>Emerging studies have reported that functional brain networks change with increasing age. Graph theory is applied to understand the age-related differences in brain behavior and function, and functional connectivity between the regions is examined using electroencephalography (EEG). The effect of normal aging on functional networks and inter-regional synchronization during the working memory (WM) state is not well known. In this study, we applied graph theory to investigate the effect of aging on network topology in a resting state and during performing a visual WM task to classify aging EEG signals. We recorded EEGs from 20 healthy middle-aged and 20 healthy elderly subjects with their eyes open, eyes closed, and during a visual WM task. EEG signals were used to construct the functional network; nodes are represented by EEG electrodes; and edges denote the functional connectivity. Graph theory matrices including global efficiency, local efficiency, clustering coefficient, characteristic path length, node strength, node betweenness centrality, and assortativity were calculated to analyze the networks. We applied the three classifiers of K-nearest neighbor (KNN), a support vector machine (SVM), and random forest (RF) to classify both groups. The analyses showed the significantly reduced network topology features in the elderly group. Local efficiency, global efficiency, and clustering coefficient were significantly lower in the elderly group with the eyes-open, eyes-closed, and visual WM task states. KNN achieved its highest accuracy of 98.89% during the visual WM task and depicted better classification performance than other classifiers. Our analysis of functional network connectivity and topological characteristics can be used as an appropriate technique to explore normal age-related changes in the human brain.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Patient perspectives on home-based rehabilitation exercise and general physical activity after total hip arthroplasty: A qualitative study (PHETHAS-2) [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Home-based rehabilitation exercise following Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA) shows similar outcomes compared to supervised outpatient rehabilitation exercise. Little is known about patients' experiences with home-based rehabilitation, and this study aimed to investigate how patients perceived home-based rehabilitation exercise and general physical activity after THA, focusing on facilitators and barriers. Methods: Semi-structured interviews of qualitative design were conducted with 22 patients who had undergone THA and who had performed home-based rehabilitation exercise. The study took place in a regional hospital in Denmark between January 2018 and May 2019. Data were analyzed using an interpretive thematic analysis approach, with theoretical underpinning from the concept ‘conduct of everyday life’. The study is embedded within the Pragmatic Home-Based Exercise Therapy after Total Hip Arthroplasty-Silkeborg trial (PHETHAS-1). Results: The main theme, ‘wishing to return to the well-known everyday life’, and the subtheme ‘general physical activity versus rehabilitation exercise’ were identified. Generally, participants found the home-based rehabilitation exercise boring but were motivated by the goal of returning to their well-known everyday life and performing their usual general physical activities. Participants enrolled in the PHETHAS-1 study used the enrollment as part of their motivation for doing the exercises.  Both pain and the absence of pain were identified as barriers for doing home-based rehabilitation exercise. Pain could cause insecurity about possible medical complications, while the absence of pain could lead to the rehabilitation exercise being perceived as pointless. Conclusions: The overall goal of returning to the well-known everyday life served as a facilitator for undertaking home-based rehabilitation exercise after THA along with the flexibility regarding time and place for performing exercises. Boring exercises as well as both pain and no pain were identified as barriers to the performance of home-based rehabilitation exercise. Participants were motivated towards performing general physical activities which were part of their everyday life.

                Background: Due to the absence of an effective vaccine for dengue, community-led vector control strategy could be a sustainable approach for dengue prevention. Therefore, this study aimed to assess people’s knowledge of dengue vectors and the practice of preventive measures to avoid vector mosquitoes by means of a structured questionnaire. Methods: A telephone-based survey was conducted between July 2019 to December 2019 from confirmed dengue patients and general people without dengue fever living in Chattogram, Bangladesh. Patients’ contact information was collected from two tertiary care hospitals. The level of knowledge and preventive practice were determined through the scoring of each participant against their responses. The association of individuals’ knowledge and practice scores with demographic variables was measured through chi-square and binary logistic analyses.    Results: Overall, 61.9% of participants (72% case and 51.7% non-case) had good knowledge, whereas only 10.6% of them (12.7% case and 8.7% non-case) strongly practiced the mosquito prevention methods. However, significant variation in the level of knowledge was found between the two groups. Urban residents had 2.20 times higher knowledge compared to semi urban. Students and government officials had 3.39 times and 3.17 times better knowledge than general workers respectively. Permanent residents had 2.01 times better knowledge in comparison to the people living in temporary housing. In terms of mosquito preventive measures, semi-urban people showed 3.19 times (CI=0.97-10.52) stronger practice compared to rural people. Conclusions: This study suggests that dengue control strategies should focus on the effective practice of mosquito prevention by engaging community people.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">The SAMBA tool uses long reads to improve the contiguity of genome assemblies</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Aleksey V. Zimin, Steven L. Salzberg</p>

Third-generation sequencing technologies can generate very long reads with relatively high error rates. The lengths of the reads, which sometimes exceed one million bases, make them invaluable for resolving complex repeats that cannot be assembled using shorter reads. Many high-quality genome assemblies have already been produced, curated, and annotated using the previous generation of sequencing data, and full re-assembly of these genomes with long reads is not always practical or cost-effective. One strategy to upgrade existing assemblies is to generate additional coverage using long-read data, and add that to the previously assembled contigs. SAMBA is a tool that is designed to scaffold and gap-fill existing genome assemblies with additional long-read data, resulting in substantially greater contiguity. SAMBA is the only tool of its kind that also computes and fills in the sequence for all spanned gaps in the scaffolds, yielding much longer contigs. Here we compare SAMBA to several similar tools capable of re-scaffolding assemblies using long-read data, and we show that SAMBA yields better contiguity and introduces fewer errors than competing methods. SAMBA is open-source software that is distributed at https://github.com/alekseyzimin/masurca.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">The properties of human disease mutations at protein interfaces</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Benjamin J. Livesey, Joseph A. Marsh</p>

The assembly of proteins into complexes and their interactions with other biomolecules are often vital for their biological function. While it is known that mutations at protein interfaces have a high potential to be damaging and cause human genetic disease, there has been relatively little consideration for how this varies between different types of interfaces. Here we investigate the properties of human pathogenic and putatively benign missense variants at homomeric (isologous and heterologous), heteromeric, DNA, RNA and other ligand interfaces, and at different regions in proteins with respect to those interfaces. We find that different types of interfaces vary greatly in their propensity to be associated with pathogenic mutations, with homomeric heterologous and DNA interfaces being particularly enriched in disease. We also find that residues that do not directly participate in an interface, but are close in three-dimensional space, show a significant disease enrichment. Finally, we observe that mutations at different types of interfaces tend to have distinct property changes when undergoing amino acid substitutions associated with disease, and that this is linked to substantial variability in their identification by computational variant effect predictors.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Estimating the glutamate transporter surface density in distinct sub-cellular compartments of mouse hippocampal astrocytes</a></h4>

Glutamate transporters preserve the spatial specificity of synaptic transmission by limiting glutamate diffusion away from the synaptic cleft, and prevent excitotoxicity by keeping the extracellular concentration of glutamate at low nanomolar levels. Glutamate transporters are abundantly expressed in astrocytes, and previous estimates have been obtained about their surface expression in astrocytes of the rat hippocampus and cerebellum. Analogous estimates for the mouse hippocampus are currently not available. In this work, we derive the surface density of astrocytic glutamate transporters in mice of different ages via quantitative dot blot. We find that the surface density of glial glutamate transporters is similar in 7-8 week old mice and rats. In mice, the levels of glutamate transporters increase until about 6 months of age and then begin to decline slowly. Our data, obtained from a combination of experimental and modeling approaches, point to the existence of stark differences in the density of expression of glutamate transporters across different sub-cellular compartments, indicating that the extent to which astrocytes limit extrasynaptic glutamate diffusion depends not only on their level of synaptic coverage, but also on the identity of the astrocyte compartment in contact with the synapse. Together, these findings provide information on how heterogeneity in the spatial distribution of glutamate transporters in the plasma membrane of hippocampal astrocytes my alter glutamate receptor activation out of the synaptic cleft.

                <p>by Daniel Kaiser, Arthur M. Jacobs, Radoslaw M. Cichy</p>

Abstract conceptual representations are critical for human cognition. Despite their importance, key properties of these representations remain poorly understood. Here, we used computational models of distributional semantics to predict multivariate fMRI activity patterns during the activation and contextualization of abstract concepts. We devised a task in which participants had to embed abstract nouns into a story that they developed around a given background context. We found that representations in inferior parietal cortex were predicted by concept similarities emerging in models of distributional semantics. By constructing different model families, we reveal the models’ learning trajectories and delineate how abstract and concrete training materials contribute to the formation of brain-like representations. These results inform theories about the format and emergence of abstract conceptual representations in the human brain.

Classical mathematical models of tumor growth have shaped our understanding of cancer and have broad practical implications for treatment scheduling and dosage. However, even the simplest textbook models have been barely validated in real world-data of human patients. In this study, we fitted a range of differential equation models to tumor volume measurements of patients undergoing chemotherapy or cancer immunotherapy for solid tumors. We used a large dataset of 1472 patients with three or more measurements per target lesion, of which 652 patients had six or more data points. We show that the early treatment response shows only moderate correlation with the final treatment response, demonstrating the need for nuanced models. We then perform a head-to-head comparison of six classical models which are widely used in the field: the Exponential, Logistic, Classic Bertalanffy, General Bertalanffy, Classic Gompertz and General Gompertz model. Several models provide a good fit to tumor volume measurements, with the Gompertz model providing the best balance between goodness of fit and number of parameters. Similarly, when fitting to early treatment data, the general Bertalanffy and Gompertz models yield the lowest mean absolute error to forecasted data, indicating that these models could potentially be effective at predicting treatment outcome. In summary, we provide a quantitative benchmark for classical textbook models and state-of-the art models of human tumor growth. We publicly release an anonymized version of our original data, providing the first benchmark set of human tumor growth data for evaluation of mathematical models.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Impact on carbon emissions of online study for a cohort of overseas students: A retrospective cohort study [version 4; peer review: 2 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: One of the benefits of online education is the potential reduction in carbon emissions through the decrease in travel to attend a university in person. We estimated the savings in CO2 emissions of an international cohort of master’s students who studied fully online from their home countries, rather than travelling to the UK and living there while attending university. Methods: The city and country of residence of a cohort of students who first enrolled in the fully online Peoples-uni/Manchester Metropolitan University Master of Public Health programme between the second semester of 2011 and the first semester 2013 were recorded. Total difference in emissions was calculated by adding the estimated aviation emissions between Manchester, UK and the cities where students resided, to the difference in per capita emissions between the country of origin and the UK for the time that the student would have spent in Manchester, based on the semester in which they first enrolled. Results: 128 students enrolled from 55 cities in 31 countries. 93 students were from a range of African countries and 18 from the Indian sub-continent. Flights to and from Manchester were estimated to have accounted for 114,553kg of CO2 and living in Manchester for the duration of their course compared with staying in the home country would have been equivalent to 854,904kg of CO2. The combined net savings was 969,457kg of CO2. Conclusions: A small cohort of overseas students, largely from Africa and India, studied online rather than attending university in the UK. The likely saving by this small cohort of nearly a million kg of CO 2 emissions offers an indication of the potential environmental benefits of offering university education online to overseas students.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Situations of work-related diseases and injuries among agriculturists in the upper northeast regions of Thailand [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Agriculturists exposed to health hazards are affected by increased occupational disease. This retrospective study aimed to investigate situations of work-related diseases and injuries among agriculturists in upper northeast Thailand. Methods: The secondary data of international classification of diseases 10th revision (ICD-10) case reports of occupational disease among farmers for 2014-2016, from the database of the Health Data Center (HDC), were used. We collected the number of registered farmers from the agricultural office and secondary data of ICD-10 from the hospital information system (HIS) of healthcare services in Udon Thani and Roi-Et provinces. The annual morbidity rate of occupational diseases was analyzed and presented at a rate per 100,000 farmers of the studied area. Results: Among farmers who visited healthcare service providers, lung disease, which was not reported as occupational disease of the HDC database, was the highest ranking of all diseases, followed by work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs), noise- and heat-related diseases, and pesticide toxicity, respectively, while the injury rate was as high as that of WMSDs. The morbidity rate of Udon Thani was higher than that of Roi-Et province, whose rate was closer to the national rate. The number of farmers from the HDC database was not reflective of numbers of registered farmers, even though the case reports of the HDC was lower than that of the HIS with occupational ICD-10 codes, which might explain the underestimation of the morbidity rate of occupational disease. Conclusions: The morbidity rate of lung disease, noise- and heat-related diseases, and pesticide toxicity increased every year (2014-2016) and reflects the health problems among agriculturists in Thailand. The underestimation in the reported disease rate is explained from big data analysis by the rare recording of work-related cases among those agriculturists. Therefore, Thai agriculturists should be supported in registration with occupational diseases surveillance as holistic healthcare.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/neuron/inpress.rss">A binocular synaptic network supports interocular response alignment in visual cortical neurons</a></h4>

              
                Scholl, Tepohl, et al. investigate how signals from the two eyes are combined within synaptic populations of individual neurons to shape a coherent representation. Rather than a convergence of monocular streams, they find that intracortical binocular networks are key to shaping alignment in cortical layer 2/3.
