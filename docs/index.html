	<p>The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is a paracrine RAS within the central nervous system (CNS) and is closely related to Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The endogenous hexapeptide angiotensin IV (Ang IV), an important component of the brain RAS, was found to rescue cognitive impairment and recover memory in previous studies. In our study, we used different doses of Dihexa, which can be orally administered and cross the BBB in APP/PS1 mice. We found that the amount of AngIV in mouse tissue increased after the administration of Dihexa compared to that in the WT group. Meanwhile, Dihexa restored spatial learning and cognitive functions in the Morris water maze test. Dihexa increased the neuronal cells and the expression of SYP protein in APP/PS1 mice in Nissl staining. Furthermore, Dihexa decreased the activation of astrocytes and microglia, markedly reduced levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and TNF-α and increased the levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. Dihexa activated the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, while PI3K inhibitor wortmannin significantly reversed the anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects of APP/PS1 mice. These findings highlight the brain AngIV/PI3K/AKT axis as a potential target for the treatment of AD.</p>

<p>The lateral geniculate nucleus exhibits daily and circadian rhythms in clock gene expression. In detail, its intergeniculate leaflet and ventrolateral geniculate nucleus sustain autonomous or semi-autonomous rhythmicity, with a nocturnal rise in their spontaneous neuronal activity.

<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Circadian rhythmicity in mammals is sustained by the central brain clock—the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus (SCN), entrained to the ambient light–dark conditions through a dense retinal input. However, recent discoveries of autonomous clock gene expression cast doubt on the supremacy of the SCN and suggest circadian timekeeping mechanisms devolve to local brain clocks. Here, we use a combination of molecular, electrophysiological, and optogenetic tools to evaluate intrinsic clock properties of the main retinorecipient thalamic center—the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) in male rats and mice. We identify the dorsolateral geniculate nucleus as a slave oscillator, which exhibits core clock gene expression exclusively <i>in vivo</i>. Additionally, we provide compelling evidence for intrinsic clock gene expression accompanied by circadian variation in neuronal activity in the intergeniculate leaflet and ventrolateral geniculate nucleus (VLG). Finally, our optogenetic experiments propose the VLG as a light-entrainable oscillator, whose phase may be advanced by retinal input at the beginning of the projected night. Altogether, this study for the first time demonstrates autonomous timekeeping mechanisms shaping circadian physiology of the LGN.</p>

                Background: Nowadays, we are facing a disease caused by SARS-CoV- 2, known globally as COVID-19, which is considered a threat to global health due to its high contagiousness and rapid spread. Methods: Analytical cross-sectional study in 302 health professionals. An online questionnaire consisting of questions about knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) towards COVID-19 was applied. Socio- demographic, occupational and comorbidities factors were explored. Simple and multiple logistic regression models were used to identify factors associated with KAP. Results: Of the total, 25.2%, 31.5% and 37.4% had high levels of knowledge, preventive practices and risk perception attitudes respectively. Being married aOR=6.75 CI(1.46-31.2) p=0.014, having a master's degree aOR=0.4, CI(0.21-0.80) p=0.009, having a working day with less than ten hours ORa=0.49 CI(0.25-0.95) p=0.036 and obesity aOR=0.38 CI (0.15-0.95) p=0.039 were associated with a low level of knowledge of COVID-19. The variables associated with preventive practices were being over the age of 50 aOR=0.52 CI(0.27-0.98) p=0.007, working in the hospitalization area aOR=1.86 CI(1.08-3.18) p= 0.018 and having comorbidities such as arterial hypertension aOR=0.28 CI(0.081-0.99) p=0.02 and obesity aOR=0.35 CI(0.14-0.83) p=0.019. In relation to negative attitudes towards COVID-19, it was found that physical contact with patients with a confirmed diagnosis aOR=1.84 CI (1.14-2.97) p=0.006 and having asthma aOR=2.13 CI(1.081-4.22) p=0.029 were associated with these attitudes. Conclusion: Our study revealed that health professionals have an insufficient level of knowledge of COVID-19. This is why we recommend implementing strategies such as health literacy programs among health care workers. Thus, they can help develop positive

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Silent Synapses in Cocaine-Associated Memory and Beyond</a></h4>

              
                <p>Glutamatergic synapses are key cellular sites where cocaine experience creates memory traces that subsequently promote cocaine craving and seeking. In addition to making across-the-board synaptic adaptations, cocaine experience also generates a discrete population of new synapses that selectively encode cocaine memories. These new synapses are glutamatergic synapses that lack functionally stable AMPARs, often referred to as AMPAR-silent synapses or, simply, silent synapses. They are generated <I>de novo</I> in the NAc by cocaine experience. After drug withdrawal, some of these synapses mature by recruiting AMPARs, contributing to the consolidation of cocaine-associated memory. After cue-induced retrieval of cocaine memories, matured silent synapses alternate between two dynamic states (AMPAR-absent vs AMPAR-containing) that correspond with the behavioral manifestations of destabilization and reconsolidation of these memories. Here, we review the molecular mechanisms underlying silent synapse dynamics during behavior, discuss their contributions to circuit remodeling, and analyze their role in cocaine-memory-driven behaviors. We also propose several mechanisms through which silent synapses can form neuronal ensembles as well as cross-region circuit engrams for cocaine-specific behaviors. These perspectives lead to our hypothesis that cocaine-generated silent synapses stand as a distinct set of synaptic substrates encoding key aspects of cocaine memory that drive cocaine relapse.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">DNA Repair Inhibition Leads to Active Export of Repetitive Sequences to the Cytoplasm Triggering an Inflammatory Response</a></h4>

              
                <p>Adult-onset neurodegenerative diseases are often accompanied by evidence of a chronic inflammation that includes activation of microglial cells and altered levels of brain cytokines. Aspects of this response are likely secondary reactions to neurodegeneration, but for many illnesses the inflammation may itself be an early and even causative disease event. In such cases, the inflammation is referred to as "sterile" as it occurs in the absence of an actual bacterial or viral pathogen. A potent trigger of sterile inflammation in CNS microglia has been shown to be the presence of DNA in the cytoplasm (cytoDNA) induced either by direct DNA damage or by inhibited DNA repair. We have shown that cytoDNA comes from the cell nucleus as a result of insufficient DNA damage repair. Using wild-type and <I>Atm</I><sup>-/-</sup> mouse microglia, we extend these observations here by showing that its genomic origins are not random, but rather are heavily biased toward transcriptionally inactive, intergenic regions, in particular repetitive elements and AT-rich sequences. Once released from the genome, in both males and females, we show that cytoDNA is actively exported to the cytoplasm by a CRM1-dependent mechanism. In the cytoplasm, it is degraded either by a cytosolic exonuclease, Trex1, or an autophagy pathway that ends with degradation in the lysosome. Blocking the accumulation of cytoDNA prevents the emergence of the sterile inflammation reaction. These findings offer new insights into the emergence of sterile inflammation and offer novel approaches that may be of use in combatting a wide range of neurodegenerative conditions.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Sterile inflammation describes a state where the defenses of the immune system are activated in the absence of a true pathogen. A potent trigger of this unorthodox response is the presence of DNA in the cytoplasm, which immune cells interpret as an invading virus or pathogen. We show that when DNA damage increases, fragments of the cell's own genome are actively exported to the cytoplasm where they are normally degraded. If this degradation is incomplete an immune reaction is triggered. Both age and stress increase DNA damage, and as age-related neurodegenerative diseases are frequently accompanied by a chronic low-level inflammation, strategies that reduce the induction of cytoplasmic DNA or speed its clearance become attractive therapeutic targets.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Developmental Shifts in Amygdala Activity during a High Social Drive State</a></h4>

              
                <p>Amygdala abnormalities characterize several psychiatric disorders with prominent social deficits and often emerge during adolescence. The basolateral amygdala (BLA) bidirectionally modulates social behavior and has increased sensitivity during adolescence. We tested how an environmentally-driven social state is regulated by the BLA in adults and adolescent male rats. We found that a high social drive state caused by brief social isolation increases age-specific social behaviors and increased BLA neuronal activity. Chemogenetic inactivation of BLA decreased the effect of high social drive on social engagement. High social drive preferentially enhanced BLA activity during social engagement; however, the effect of social opportunity on BLA activity was greater during adolescence. While this identifies a substrate underlying age differences in social drive, we then determined that high social drive increased BLA NMDA GluN2B expression and sensitivity to antagonism increased with age. Further, the effect of a high social drive state on BLA activity during social engagement was diminished by GluN2B blockade in an age-dependent manner. These results demonstrate the necessity of the BLA for environmentally driven social behavior, its sensitivity to social opportunity, and uncover a maturing role for BLA and its GluN2B receptors in social engagement.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Social engagement during adolescence is a key component of healthy development. Social drive provides the impetus for social engagement and abnormalities underlie social symptoms of depression and anxiety. While adolescence is characterized by transitions in social drive and social environment sensitivity, little is known about the neural basis for these changes. We found that amygdala activity is uniquely sensitive to social environment during adolescence compared with adulthood, and is required for expression of heightened social drive. In addition, the neural substrates shift toward NMDA dependence in adulthood. These results are the first to demonstrate a unique neural signature of higher social drive and begin to uncover the underlying factors that heighten social engagement during adolescence.</p>

To understand how the PV<sup>+</sup> interneuron connectivity underlying these functional properties is established during development, we used array tomography to map pairs of synaptically connected PV<sup>+</sup> interneurons and postsynaptic neurons from the neocortex of mice of both sexes. We focused on the axon-myelin unit of the PV<sup>+</sup> interneuron and quantified the number of synapses onto the postsynaptic neuron, length of connecting axonal paths, and their myelination at different time points between 2 weeks and 7 months of age. We find that myelination of the proximal axon occurs very rapidly during the third and, to a lesser extent, fourth postnatal weeks. The number of synaptic contacts made by the PV<sup>+</sup> interneuron on its postsynaptic partner meanwhile is significantly reduced to about one-third by the end of the first postnatal month. The number of autapses, the synapses that PV<sup>+</sup> interneurons form on themselves, however, remains constant throughout the examined period. Axon reorganizations continue beyond postnatal month 2, with the postsynaptic targets of PV<sup>+</sup> interneurons gradually shifting to more proximal locations, and the length of axonal paths and their myelin becoming conspicuously uniform per connection. These continued microcircuit refinements likely provide the structural substrate for the robust inhibitory effects and fine temporal precision of adult PV<sup>+</sup> basket cells.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The axon of adult parvalbumin-containing (PV<sup>+</sup>) interneurons is highly specialized for fast and reliable neurotransmission. It is myelinated and forms synapses mostly onto the cell bodies and proximal dendrites of postsynaptic neurons for maximal impact. In this study, we follow the development of the PV<sup>+</sup> interneuron axon, its myelination and synapse formation, revealing a rapid sequence of axonal reorganization, myelination of the PV<sup>+</sup> interneuron proximal axon, and pruning of almost two-thirds of the synapses in an individual connection. This is followed by a prolonged period of axon refinement and additional myelination leading to a remarkable precision of connections in the adult mouse cortex, consistent with the temporal precision and fidelity of PV<sup>+</sup> interneuron action.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Single-Unit Recordings Reveal the Selectivity of a Human Face Area</a></h4>

              
                <p>The exquisite capacity of primates to detect and recognize faces is crucial for social interactions. Although disentangling the neural basis of human face recognition remains a key goal in neuroscience, direct evidence at the single-neuron level is limited. We recorded from face-selective neurons in human visual cortex in a region characterized by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activations for faces compared with objects. The majority of visually responsive neurons in this fMRI activation showed strong selectivity at short latencies for faces compared with objects. Feature-scrambled faces and face-like objects could also drive these neurons, suggesting that this region is not tightly tuned to the visual attributes that typically define whole human faces. These single-cell recordings within the human face processing system provide vital experimental evidence linking previous imaging studies in humans and invasive studies in animal models.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We present the first recordings of face-selective neurons in or near an fMRI-defined patch in human visual cortex. Our unbiased multielectrode array recordings (i.e., no selection of neurons based on a search strategy) confirmed the validity of the BOLD contrast (faces&ndash;objects) in humans, a finding with implications for all human imaging studies. By presenting faces, feature-scrambled faces, and face-pareidolia (perceiving faces in inanimate objects) stimuli, we demonstrate that neurons at this level of the visual hierarchy are broadly tuned to the features of a face, independent of spatial configuration and low-level visual attributes.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Dynamic Recovery: GABA Agonism Restores Neural Variability in Older, Poorer Performing Adults</a></h4>

              
                <p>Aging is associated with cognitive impairment, but there are large individual differences in these declines. One neural measure that is lower in older adults and predicts these individual differences is moment-to-moment brain signal variability. Testing the assumption that GABA should heighten neural variability, we examined whether reduced brain signal variability in older, poorer performing adults could be boosted by increasing GABA pharmacologically. Brain signal variability was estimated using fMRI in 20 young and 24 older healthy human adults during placebo and GABA agonist sessions. As expected, older adults exhibited lower signal variability at placebo, and, crucially, GABA agonism boosted older adults' variability to the levels of young adults. Furthermore, poorer performing older adults experienced a greater increase in variability on drug, suggesting that those with more to gain benefit the most from GABA system potentiation. GABA may thus serve as a core neurochemical target in future work on aging- and cognition-related human brain dynamics.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Prior research indicates that moment-to-moment brain signal variability is lower in older, poorer performing adults. We found that this reduced brain signal variability could be boosted through GABA agonism in older adults to the levels of young adults and that this boost was largest in the poorer performing older adults. These results provide the first evidence that brain signal variability can be restored by increasing GABAergic activity and suggest the promise of developing interventions targeting inhibitory systems to help slow cognitive declines in healthy aging.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Does Hemispheric Asymmetry Reduction in Older Adults in Motor Cortex Reflect Compensation?</a></h4>

              
                <p>Older adults tend to display greater brain activation in the nondominant hemisphere during even basic sensorimotor responses. It is debated whether this hemispheric asymmetry reduction in older adults (HAROLD) reflects a compensatory mechanism. Across two independent fMRI experiments involving adult life span human samples (<I>N</I> = 586 and <I>N</I> = 81, approximately half female) who performed right-hand finger responses, we distinguished between these hypotheses using behavioral and multivariate Bayes (MVB) decoding approaches. Standard univariate analyses replicated a HAROLD pattern in motor cortex, but in and out of scanner behavioral results both demonstrated evidence against a compensatory relationship in that reaction time measures of task performance in older adults did not relate to ipsilateral motor activity. Likewise, MVB showed that this increased ipsilateral activity in older adults did not carry additional information, and if anything, combining ipsilateral with contralateral activity patterns reduced action decoding in older adults (at least in experiment 1). These results contradict the hypothesis that HAROLD is compensatory and instead suggest that the age-related ipsilateral hyperactivation is nonspecific, consistent with alternative hypotheses about age-related reductions in neural efficiency/differentiation or interhemispheric inhibition.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> A key goal in the cognitive neuroscience of aging is to provide a mechanistic explanation of how brain&ndash;behavior relationships change with age. One interpretation of the common finding that task-based hemispheric activity becomes more symmetrical in older adults is that this shift reflects a compensatory mechanism, with the nondominant hemisphere needing to help out with computations normally performed by the dominant hemisphere. Contrary to this view, our behavioral and brain data indicate that the additional activity in ipsilateral motor cortex in older adults is not reflective of better task performance nor better neural representations of finger actions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Broadband Dynamics Rather than Frequency-Specific Rhythms Underlie Prediction Error in the Primate Auditory Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>Detection of statistical irregularities, measured as a prediction error response, is fundamental to the perceptual monitoring of the environment. We studied whether prediction error response is associated with neural oscillations or asynchronous broadband activity. Electrocorticography was conducted in three male monkeys, who passively listened to the auditory roving oddball stimuli. Local field potentials (LFPs) recorded over the auditory cortex underwent spectral principal component analysis, which decoupled broadband and rhythmic components of the LFP signal. We found that the broadband component captured the prediction error response, whereas none of the rhythmic components were associated with statistical irregularities of sounds. The broadband component displayed more stochastic, asymmetrical multifractal properties than the rhythmic components, which revealed more self-similar dynamics. We thus conclude that the prediction error response is captured by neuronal populations generating asynchronous broadband activity, defined by irregular dynamic states, which, unlike oscillatory rhythms, appear to enable the neural representation of auditory prediction error response.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> This study aimed to examine the contribution of oscillatory and asynchronous components of auditory local field potentials in the generation of prediction error responses to sensory irregularities, as this has not been directly addressed in the previous studies. Here, we show that mismatch negativity&mdash;an auditory prediction error response&mdash;is driven by the asynchronous broadband component of potentials recorded in the auditory cortex. This finding highlights the importance of nonoscillatory neural processes in the predictive monitoring of the environment. At a more general level, the study demonstrates that stochastic neural processes, which are often disregarded as neural noise, do have a functional role in the processing of sensory information.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Disrupting Short-Term Memory Maintenance in Premotor Cortex Affects Serial Dependence in Visuomotor Integration</a></h4>

              
                <p>Human behavior is biased by past experience. For example, when intercepting a moving target, the speed of previous targets will bias responses in future trials. Neural mechanisms underlying this so-called serial dependence are still under debate. Here, we tested the hypothesis that the previous trial leaves a neural trace in brain regions associated with encoding task-relevant information in visual and/or motor regions. We reasoned that injecting noise by means of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over premotor and visual areas would degrade such memory traces and hence reduce serial dependence. To test this hypothesis, we applied bursts of TMS pulses to right visual motion processing region hV5/MT+ and to left dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) during intertrial intervals of a coincident timing task performed by twenty healthy human participants (15 female). Without TMS, participants presented a bias toward the speed of the previous trial when intercepting moving targets. TMS over PMd decreased serial dependence in comparison to the control Vertex stimulation, whereas TMS applied over hV5/MT+ did not. In addition, TMS seems to have specifically affected the memory trace that leads to serial dependence, as we found no evidence that participants' behavior worsened after applying TMS. These results provide causal evidence that an implicit short-term memory mechanism in premotor cortex keeps information from one trial to the next, and that this information is blended with current trial information so that it biases behavior in a visuomotor integration task with moving objects.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Human perception and action are biased by the recent past. The origin of such serial bias is still not fully understood, but a few components seem to be fundamental for its emergence: the brain needs to keep previous trial information in short-term memory and blend it with incoming information. Here, we present evidence that a premotor area has a potential role in storing previous trial information in short-term memory in a visuomotor task and that this information is responsible for biasing ongoing behavior. These results corroborate the perspective that areas associated with processing information of a stimulus or task also participate in maintaining that information in short-term memory even when this information is no longer relevant for current behavior.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Mechanosensory Stimulation via Nanchung Expressing Neurons Can Induce Daytime Sleep in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                <p>The neuronal and genetic bases of sleep, a phenomenon considered crucial for well-being of organisms, has been under investigation using the model organism <I>Drosophila melanogaster</I>. Although sleep is a state where sensory threshold for arousal is greater, it is known that certain kinds of repetitive sensory stimuli, such as rocking, can indeed promote sleep in humans. Here we report that orbital motion-aided mechanosensory stimulation promotes sleep of male and female <I>Drosophila</I>, independent of the circadian clock, but controlled by the homeostatic system. Mechanosensory receptor <I>nanchung</I> (<I>Nan</I>)-expressing neurons in the chordotonal organs mediate this sleep induction: flies in which these neurons are either silenced or ablated display significantly reduced sleep induction on mechanosensory stimulation. Transient activation of the <I>Nan</I>-expressing neurons also enhances sleep levels, confirming the role of these neurons in sleep induction. We also reveal that certain regions of the antennal mechanosensory and motor center in the brain are involved in conveying information from the mechanosensory structures to the sleep centers. Thus, we show, for the first time, that a circadian clock-independent pathway originating from peripherally distributed mechanosensors can promote daytime sleep of flies <I>Drosophila melanogaster</I>.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Our tendency to fall asleep in moving vehicles or the practice of rocking infants to sleep suggests that slow rhythmic movement can induce sleep, although we do not understand the mechanistic basis of this phenomenon. We find that gentle orbital motion can induce behavioral quiescence even in flies, a highly genetically tractable system for sleep studies. We demonstrate that this is indeed true sleep based on its rapid reversibility by sensory stimulation, enhanced arousal threshold, and homeostatic control. Furthermore, we demonstrate that mechanosensory neurons expressing a TRPV channel <I>nanchung</I>, located in the antennae and chordotonal organs, mediate orbital motion-induced sleep by communicating with antennal mechanosensory motor centers, which in turn may project to sleep centers in the brain.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Adolescent Dopamine Neurons Represent Reward Differently during Action and State Guided Learning</a></h4>

              
                <p>Neuronal underpinning of learning cause-and-effect associations in the adolescent brain remains poorly understood. Two fundamental forms of associative learning are Pavlovian (classical) conditioning, where a stimulus is followed by an outcome, and operant (instrumental) conditioning, where outcome is contingent on action execution. Both forms of learning, when associated with a rewarding outcome, rely on midbrain dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra (SN). We find that, in adolescent male rats, reward-guided associative learning is encoded differently by midbrain dopamine neurons in each conditioning paradigm. Whereas simultaneously recorded VTA and SN adult neurons have a similar phasic response to reward delivery during both forms of conditioning, adolescent neurons display a muted reward response during operant but a profoundly larger reward response during Pavlovian conditioning. These results suggest that adolescent neurons assign a different value to reward when it is not gated by action. The learning rate of adolescents and adults during both forms of conditioning was similar, supporting the notion that differences in reward response in each paradigm may be because of differences in motivation and independent of state versus action value learning. Static characteristics of dopamine neurons, such as dopamine cell number and size, were similar in the VTA and SN of both ages, but there were age-related differences in stimulated dopamine release and correlated spike activity, suggesting that differences in reward responsiveness by adolescent dopamine neurons are not because of differences in intrinsic properties of these neurons but engagement of different dopaminergic networks.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Reckless behavior and impulsive decision-making by adolescents suggest that motivated behavioral states are encoded differently by the adolescent brain. Motivated behavior, which is dependent on the function of the dopamine system, follows learning of cause-and-effect associations in the environment. We find that dopamine neurons in adolescents encode reward differently depending on the cause-and-effect relationship of the means to receive that reward. Compared with adults, reward contingent on action led to a muted response, whereas reward that followed a cue but was not gated by action produced an augmented phasic response. These data demonstrate an age-related difference in dopamine neuron response to reward that is not uniform and is guided by processes that differentiate between state and action values.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Frontotemporal Lobar Dementia Mutant Tau Impairs Axonal Transport through a Protein Phosphatase 1{gamma}-Dependent Mechanism</a></h4>

              
                <p>Pathologic tau modifications are characteristic of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias, but mechanisms of tau toxicity continue to be debated. Inherited mutations in tau cause early onset frontotemporal lobar dementias (FTLD-tau) and are commonly used to model mechanisms of tau toxicity in tauopathies. Previous work in the isolated squid axoplasm model demonstrated that several pathogenic forms of tau inhibit axonal transport through a mechanism involving activation of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1). Here, we determined that P301L and R5L FTLD mutant tau proteins elicit a toxic effect on axonal transport as monomeric proteins. We evaluated interactions of wild-type or mutant tau with specific PP1 isoforms (&alpha;, &beta;, and ) to examine how the interaction contributes to this toxic effect using primary rat hippocampal neurons from both sexes. Pull-down and bioluminescence resonance energy transfer experiments revealed selective interactions of wild-type tau with PP1&alpha; and PP1 isoforms, but not PP1&beta;, which were significantly increased by the P301L tau mutation. The results from proximity ligation assays confirmed the interaction in primary hippocampal neurons. Moreover, expression of FTLD-linked mutant tau in these neurons enhanced levels of active PP1, also increasing the pausing frequency of fluorescently labeled vesicles in both anterograde and retrograde directions. Knockdown of PP1, but not PP1&alpha;, rescued the cargo-pausing effects of P301L and R5L tau, a result replicated by deleting a phosphatase-activating domain in the amino terminus of P301L tau. These findings support a model of tau toxicity involving aberrant activation of a specific PP1-dependent pathway that disrupts axonal transport in neurons.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Tau pathology is closely associated with neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease and other tauopathies, but the toxic mechanisms remain a debated topic. We previously proposed that pathologic tau forms induce dysfunction and degeneration through aberrant activation of a PP1-dependent pathway that disrupts axonal transport. Here, we show that tau directly interacts with specific PP1 isoforms, increasing levels of active PP1. Pathogenic tau mutations enhance this interaction, further increasing active PP1 levels and impairing axonal transport in isolated squid axoplasm and primary hippocampal neurons. Mutant-tau-mediated impairment of axonal transport was mediated by PP1 and a phosphatase-activating domain located at the amino terminus of tau. This work has important implications for understanding and potentially mitigating tau-mediated neurotoxicity in tauopathies.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Disrupting Epileptiform Activity by Preventing Parvalbumin Interneuron Depolarization Block</a></h4>

              
                <p>Inhibitory synaptic mechanisms oppose epileptic network activity in the brain. The breakdown in this inhibitory restraint and propagation of seizure activity has been linked to the overwhelming of feedforward inhibition, which is provided in large part by parvalbumin-expressing (PV) interneurons in the cortex. The underlying cellular processes therefore represent potential targets for understanding and preventing the propagation of seizure activity. Here we use an optogenetic strategy to test the hypothesis that depolarization block in PV interneurons is a significant factor during the loss of inhibitory restraint. Depolarization block results from the inactivation of voltage-gated sodium channels and leads to impaired action potential firing. We used focal NMDA stimulation to elicit reproducible epileptiform discharges in hippocampal organotypic brain slices from male and female mice and combined this with targeted recordings from defined neuronal populations. Simultaneous patch-clamp recordings from PV interneurons and pyramidal neurons revealed epileptiform activity that was associated with an overwhelming of inhibitory synaptic mechanisms and the emergence of a partial, and then complete, depolarization block in PV interneurons. To counteract this depolarization block, we developed protocols for eliciting pulsed membrane hyperpolarization via the inhibitory opsin, archaerhodopsin. This optical approach was effective in counteracting cumulative inactivation of voltage-gated channels, maintaining PV interneuron action potential firing properties during the inhibitory restraint period, and reducing the probability of initiating epileptiform activity. These experiments support the idea that depolarization block is a point of weakness in feedforward inhibitory synaptic mechanisms and represents a target for preventing the initiation and spread of seizure activity.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> GABA<SUB>A</SUB> receptor-mediated synaptic transmission opposes seizure activity by establishing an inhibitory restraint against spreading excitation. Parvalbumin-expressing (PV) interneurons contribute significantly to this inhibitory restraint, but it has been suggested that these cells are overwhelmed as they enter a state of "depolarization block." Here we test the importance of this process by devising an optogenetic strategy to selectively relieve depolarization block in PV interneurons. By inducing brief membrane hyperpolarization, we show that it is possible to reduce depolarization block in PV interneurons, maintain their action potential firing in the face of strong excitation, and disrupt epileptiform activity in an <I>in vitro</I> model. This represents a proof of principle that targeting rate-limiting processes can strengthen the inhibitory restraint of epileptiform activity.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Schizophrenia-Linked Protein tSNARE1 Regulates Endosomal Trafficking in Cortical Neurons</a></h4>

              
                <p><I>TSNARE1</I>, which encodes the protein tSNARE1, is a high-confidence gene candidate for schizophrenia risk, but nothing is known about its cellular or physiological function. We identified the major gene products of <I>TSNARE1</I> and their cytoplasmic localization and function in endosomal trafficking in cortical neurons. We validated three primary isoforms of <I>TSNARE1</I> expressed in human brain, all of which encode a syntaxin-like Qa SNARE domain. RNA-sequencing data from adult and fetal human brain suggested that the majority of tSNARE1 lacks a transmembrane domain that is thought to be necessary for membrane fusion. Biochemical data demonstrate that tSNARE1 can compete with Stx12 for incorporation into an endosomal SNARE complex, supporting its possible role as an inhibitory SNARE. Live-cell imaging in cortical neurons from mice of both sexes demonstrated that brain tSNARE1 isoforms localized to the endosomal network. The most abundant brain isoform, tSNARE1c, localized most frequently to Rab7<sup>+</sup> late endosomes, and endogenous tSNARE1 displayed a similar localization in human neural progenitor cells and neuroblastoma cells. In mature rat neurons from both sexes, tSNARE1 localized to the dendritic shaft and dendritic spines, supporting a role for tSNARE1 at the postsynapse. Expression of either tSNARE1b or tSNARE1c, which differ only in their inclusion or exclusion of an Myb-like domain, delayed the trafficking of the dendritic endosomal cargo Nsg1 into late endosomal and lysosomal compartments. These data suggest that tSNARE1 regulates endosomal trafficking in cortical neurons, likely by negatively regulating early endosomal to late endosomal trafficking.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Schizophrenia is a severe and polygenic neuropsychiatric disorder. Understanding the functions of high-confidence candidate genes is critical toward understanding how their dysfunction contributes to schizophrenia pathogenesis. <I>TSNARE1</I> is one of the high-confidence candidate genes for schizophrenia risk, yet nothing was known about its cellular or physiological function. Here we describe the major isoforms of <I>TSNARE1</I> and their cytoplasmic localization and function in the endosomal network in cortical neurons. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that the majority of brain tSNARE1 acts as a negative regulator to endolysosomal trafficking.</p>

                This study has investigated the solvent extraction of cadmium and lead ions from an aqueous solution in nitrate medium using aminooctyldiphosphonic acid (AODPA) as extractant in chloroform. In order to establish spectrophotometrically the concentration of metal ion in the aqueous phase before and after extraction, the Arsenazo III method was used. The effects of several extraction parameters on the extraction of these metals ions  including volume ratio between the aqueous and organic phases (1–5), extraction kinetic time (0–30 min), molar ratio Q (1–5), addition of HNO3 (pH =2–6), addition of KNO3 (0.01 – 1M), temperature (10–40°C) and the synergetic effect by adding TOPO (solvating agent) were evaluated. Thermodynamic parameters including the Gibbs free energy (ΔG0),enthalpy (ΔH0), and entropy (ΔS0) were calculated. Performed experiments showed that Pb (II) can be extracted till 73% when Cd (II) can be recovered completely after two cycles. The extraction of both metallic ions was spontaneous, endothermic and with a slight randomness.  Positive synergetic effect was observed at  a chelating agent/TOPO ratio of 3. It is a very encouraging result which can lead us to recover cadmium and lower the concentration of lead from wastewater.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">ΔFBA—Predicting metabolic flux alterations using genome-scale metabolic models and differential transcriptomic data</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Sudharshan Ravi, Rudiyanto Gunawan</p>

Genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) provide a powerful framework for simulating the entire set of biochemical reactions in a cell using a constraint-based modeling strategy called flux balance analysis (FBA). FBA relies on an assumed metabolic objective for generating metabolic fluxes using GEMs. But, the most appropriate metabolic objective is not always obvious for a given condition and is likely context-specific, which often complicate the estimation of metabolic flux alterations between conditions. Here, we propose a new method, called ΔFBA (deltaFBA), that integrates differential gene expression data to evaluate directly metabolic flux differences between two conditions. Notably, ΔFBA does not require specifying the cellular objective. Rather, ΔFBA seeks to maximize the consistency and minimize inconsistency between the predicted flux differences and differential gene expression. We showcased the performance of ΔFBA through several case studies involving the prediction of metabolic alterations caused by genetic and environmental perturbations in <i>Escherichia coli</i> and caused by Type-2 diabetes in human muscle. Importantly, in comparison to existing methods, ΔFBA gives a more accurate prediction of flux differences.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Cluster size distribution of cells disseminating from a primary tumor</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Mrinmoy Mukherjee, Herbert Levine</p>

The first stage of the metastatic cascade often involves motile cells emerging from a primary tumor either as single cells or as clusters. These cells enter the circulation, transit to other parts of the body and finally are responsible for growth of secondary tumors in distant organs. The mode of dissemination is believed to depend on the EMT nature (epithelial, hybrid or mesenchymal) of the cells. Here, we calculate the cluster size distribution of these migrating cells, using a mechanistic computational model, in presence of different degree of EMT-ness of the cells; EMT is treated as given rise to changes in their active motile forces (<i>μ</i>) and cell-medium surface tension (Γ). We find that, for (<i>μ</i> > <i>μ</i><sub>min</sub>, Γ > 1), when the cells are hybrid in nature, the mean cluster size, N ¯ ∼ Γ 2 . 0 / μ 2 . 8, where <i>μ</i><sub>min</sub> increases with increase in Γ. For Γ ≤ 0, N ¯ = 1, the cells behave as completely mesenchymal. In presence of spectrum of hybrid states with different degree of EMT-ness (motility) in primary tumor, the cells which are relatively more mesenchymal (higher <i>μ</i>) in nature, form larger clusters, whereas the smaller clusters are relatively more epithelial (lower <i>μ</i>). Moreover, the heterogeneity in <i>μ</i> is comparatively higher for smaller clusters with respect to that for larger clusters. We also observe that more extended cell shapes promote the formation of smaller clusters. Overall, this study establishes a framework which connects the nature and size of migrating clusters disseminating from a primary tumor with the phenotypic composition of the tumor, and can lead to the better understanding of metastasis.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">p38γ and p38δ regulate postnatal cardiac metabolism through glycogen synthase 1</a></h4>

Santamans, Valle Montalvo-Romeral, Alfonso Mora, Juan Antonio Lopez, Francisco González-Romero, Daniel Jimenez-Blasco, Elena Rodríguez, Aránzazu Pintor-Chocano, Cristina Casanueva-Benítez, Rebeca Acín-Pérez, Luis Leiva-Vega, Jordi Duran, Joan J.

During the first weeks of postnatal heart development, cardiomyocytes undergo a major adaptive metabolic shift from glycolytic energy production to fatty acid oxidation. This metabolic change is contemporaneous to the up-regulation and activation of the p38γ and p38δ stress-activated protein kinases in the heart. We demonstrate that p38γ/δ contribute to the early postnatal cardiac metabolic switch through inhibitory phosphorylation of glycogen synthase 1 (GYS1) and glycogen metabolism inactivation. Premature induction of p38γ/δ activation in cardiomyocytes of newborn mice results in an early GYS1 phosphorylation and inhibition of cardiac glycogen production, triggering an early metabolic shift that induces a deficit in cardiomyocyte fuel supply, leading to whole-body metabolic deregulation and maladaptive cardiac pathogenesis. Notably, the adverse effects of forced premature cardiac p38γ/δ activation in neonate mice are prevented by maternal diet supplementation of fatty acids during pregnancy and lactation. These results suggest that diet interventions have a potential for treating human cardiac genetic diseases that affect heart metabolism.

Cochlear supporting cells (SCs) are glia-like cells critical for hearing function. In the neonatal cochlea, the greater epithelial ridge (GER) is a mitotically quiescent and transient organ, which has been shown to nonmitotically regenerate SCs. Here, we ablated Lgr5<sup>+</sup> SCs using <i>Lgr5-DTR</i> mice and found mitotic regeneration of SCs by GER cells in vivo. With lineage tracing, we show that the GER houses progenitor cells that robustly divide and migrate into the organ of Corti to replenish ablated SCs. Regenerated SCs display coordinated calcium transients, markers of the SC subtype inner phalangeal cells, and survive in the mature cochlea. Via RiboTag, RNA-sequencing, and gene clustering algorithms, we reveal 11 distinct gene clusters comprising markers of the quiescent and damaged GER, and damage-responsive genes driving cell migration and mitotic regeneration. Together, our study characterizes GER cells as mitotic progenitors with regenerative potential and unveils their quiescent and damaged translatomes.

                Researchers use ChIP binding data to identify potential transcription factor binding sites. Similarly, they use gene expression data from sequencing or microarrays to quantify the effect of the factor overexpression or knockdown on its targets. Therefore, the integration of the binding and expression data can be used to improve the understanding of a transcription factor function. Here, we implemented the binding and expression target analysis (BETA) in an R/Bioconductor package. This algorithm ranks the targets based on the distances of their assigned peaks from the factor ChIP experiment and the signed statistics from gene expression profiling with factor perturbation. We further extend BETA to integrate two sets of data from two factors to predict their targets and their combined functions. In this article, we briefly describe the workings of the algorithm and provide a workflow with a real dataset for using it. The gene targets and the aggregate functions of transcription factors YY1 and YY2 in HeLa cells were identified. Using the same datasets, we identified the shared targets of the two factors, which were found to be, on average, more cooperatively regulated.

                Background: Plastic waste (PW) is becoming increasingly hazardous to the environment as a result of its massive production, causing significant damage to both the ecosystem and its inhabitants. Managing plastic waste is a global concern due to its non-biodegradable nature. However, it is important to handle PWs properly to curtail the environmental emissions associated with their incineration and dumping into landfills. This research investigates the possibility of producing tiles from polyethylene terephthalate (PET) waste bottles and fly ash. The mechanical properties, as well as the chemical resistance of the manufactured PET polymer tiles, are reported in this study. Methods: PET waste was used in varying proportions (from 30% to 100%) by sand weight. The shredded PET waste was heated at 230 oC before being suitably blended with fly ash. It was then poured into the designated mold, removed after one hour, and cooled for 24 hours before testing. Results: The assessment of the physical and mechanical properties of the materials revealed that the tiles produced with 30% PET content performed better in terms of material density and strength compared to the samples with higher PET content. The highest compressive strength being 6.88 MPa. Based on the results of the tests, the produced PET tiles have a low water absorption efficiency of 80% lower when compare to cement and ceramic tiles (the water absorption values are between 0.98% and 0.09%). Conclusions: The results from this study indicate that PET waste bottles can be used to produce long-lasting, durable, and extremely low water absorption eco-friendly tiles for both residential and commercial applications. This prospect of tile production using polyethylene terephthalate (PET) waste and fly ash would not only minimize the cost of building products but will also act as a waste diversion to mitigate environmental emissions caused by plastic waste disposal.

                Background: Exposing enamel to soft drinks and beverages causes changes in the microscopical morphology. Changes in the physical characteristics, like hardness and surface roughness, were studied with various parameters. Factors such as pH, exposed duration, and other content of the soft drinks have different effects on the enamel. Methods: Thirty-six human premolar teeth were randomly divided into three groups (n=12). Group 1 consisted of teeth which were immersed in artificial saliva (control), group 2 consisted of teeth which were immersed in Pepsi, and group 3 consisted of teeth which were immersed in Mirinda. After the preparation of samples and necessary measures, surface roughness was measured using the profilometer. Baseline measurements were taken. Reading two and reading three were taken after exposing the specimens for three days and 15 days, respectively. All of the collected data were compared statistically using SPSS and presented in tables and graphs. Results: At the baseline, the surface roughness value was the same for all three groups. On the 3rd day, the Mirinda group showed more surface roughness compared to that of the test and Pepsi groups, which was statistically significant. On the 15th day, both the Pepsi and Mirinda groups showed increased surface roughness compared to that of the control, which was statistically significant. Conclusions: Within the limitation of this study, it can be concluded that surface roughness increased when teeth were exposed to both soft drinks

                Background Central nervous system (CNS) lymphomas are a rare subset of lymphoma, which are associated with a poor outcome. The gold standard for CNS imaging is with gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); however, there are a number of limitations, including some patients with small persistent abnormalities from scarring due to focal haemorrhage or from a previous biopsy, which can be difficult to discern from residual tumour. [18F]Fluoromethylcholine positron emission tomography–computed tomography (FCH-PET/CT) uses an analogue of choline, which due to the upregulation of choline kinase in tumour cells, allows increased uptake of FCH. As there is minimal background grey matter uptake of FCH, FCH-PET/CT can be used in CNS imaging and provide a useful tool for response assessment. Methods This is a cohort study, where we identified 40 patients with a diagnosis of primary or secondary CNS lymphoma between 1st November 2011 and 10th October 2019. Results 26 of the 40 patients (65%) had concordant results. Of the discordant results, 11 out of 14 had partial response (PR) on MRI but showed a metabolic complete response (mCR) on FCH-PET. The overall response rates (ORR) were similar between the two modalities (90% for MRI versus 95% with FCT-PET/CT). Conclusion We conclude that FCH-PET/CT is a reasonable alternative mode of imaging to gadolinium-enhanced MRI brain imaging, providing a new tool for assessment of CNS lymphoma.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">EMI radiation of power transmission lines in Malaysia [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: There has been rising concern amongst the public regarding their home's proximity to high tension power transmission lines. The primary cause of fear is the impact of the electromagnetic interference (EMI) radiation on the nearby occupants' health. Despite the presence of national permissible limits of EMI radiation, there is still lack of information with regards to the EMI radiation of the types of power lines configuration in Malaysia. Methods: The electric and magnetic fields of several selected power transmission lines were simulated using the EMFACDC software program from the recommendation ITU-T K.90. Five types of power transmission lines available in Malaysia are considered. Results: It was found that the simulated electric and magnetic field levels at all the power lines' right of way (ROW) boundary complies with the prescribed exposure limit. However, the electromagnetic fields (EMF) level increases significantly as the separation distance is reduced from 30m. For a more conservative approach, the ROW can be set at 30m across all transmission voltage level and corridor area condition. Conclusion: It can be concluded that Malaysia's power transmission lines are within the prescribed exposure limits. To further minimize the electric and magnetic field level, it is recommended that the residential building should be built at least 30 meters away from the power transmission lines, especially for the 275kV double circuit, 275/132kV quadruple circuit, and 500kV double circuit lines.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The Ideal Diet for Humans to Sustainably Feed The Growing Population – Review, Meta-Analyses, and Policies for Change [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: As of now, no study has combined research from different sciences to determine the most suitable diet for humans. This issue is urgent due to the predicted population growth, the effect of this on the environment, and the deterioration of human health and associated costs. Methods: A literature review determined whether an optimal diet for humans exists and what such a diet is, followed by six meta-analyses. The standard criteria for conducting meta-analyses of observational studies were followed. A review of literature reporting Hazard Ratios with a 95% confidence interval for red meat intake, dairy intake, plant-based diet, fiber intake, and serum IGF-1 levels were extracted to calculate effect sizes. Results: Results calculated using NCSS software show that high meat consumption increases mortality probability by 18% on average and increases diabetes risk by 50%. Plant-based and high-fiber diets decrease mortality by 15% and 20% respectively (p < .001). Plant-based diets decreased diabetes risk by 27%, and dairy consumption (measured by increased IGF-1 levels) increased cancer probability by 48% (p < 0.01). A vegetarian or Mediterranean diet was not found to decrease the probability of heart disease. A vegetarian diet can be healthy or not, depending on the foods consumed. A Mediterranean diet with high quantities of meat and dairy products will not produce the health effects desired. The main limitations of the study were that observational studies were heterogeneous and limited by potential confounders. Discussion: The literature and meta-analyses point to an optimal diet for humans that has followed our species from the beginnings of humankind. The optimal diet is a whole food, high fiber, low-fat, 90+% plant-based diet. This diet allowed humans to become the most developed species on Earth. To ensure people’s nutritional needs are met healthily and sustainably, governmental dietary interventions are necessary.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Effects of sociodemographic and socioeconomic factors on stroke development in Lebanese patients with atrial fibrillation: a cross-sectional study [version 2; peer review: 3 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Non-communicable diseases, the major cause of death and disability, are susceptible to modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors. Atrial fibrillation (AF) increases the risk of stroke by 4 to 5 times and can lead to cardiovascular mortality. This study was conducted to assess the effects of different sociodemographic and socioeconomic factors on stroke development in patients with AF. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted between January and June 2018 on patients recruited from Lebanese community pharmacies. The CHA2DS2-VASc scoring system is utilized as a stroke risk stratification tool in AF patients. Participants with a previous physician diagnosis of AF, documented on medical records, were included in this study. Data was collected through a survey that was distributed to all eligible patients. Results: A total of 524 patients were enrolled in the study with a mean age (± SD) of 58.75 ± 13.59 years with hypertension (78.4%) being the most predominant disease. The results showed that obesity (Beta=0.61, p-value =0.011), retirement and unemployment compared to employment (Beta=1.44 and 1.44, p-value=0.001 respectively), divorced/widow compared to married (Beta=1.38, p-value =0.001) were significantly associated with higher CHA2DS2-VASc scores whereas high versus low socio-economic status (Beta=-1.03, p=0.009) and high school education versus primary education level (Beta=-0.49, p-value=0.025) were significantly associated with lower CHA2DS2-VASc scores. Conclusions: The study highlights that the CHA2DS2-VASc score is affected by the presence of various sociodemographic and socioeconomic characteristics in patients with AF. Thus, screening for those factors may predict the progression of cardiovascular disease and may provide an optimal intervention.

                Scar tissue presents a barrier to regeneration in the central nervous system (CNS). Although the glial scar has been extensively studied, recent evidence suggests that non-glial components are also involved. In a recent paper, Dias, Kalkitsas, and colleagues uncovered a subset of pericytes as a contributor to fibrotic scarring that is conserved across diverse CNS lesions.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Modeling the ACVR1R206H mutation in human skeletal muscle stem cells</a></h4>

              
                Abnormalities in skeletal muscle repair can lead to poor function and complications such as scarring or heterotopic ossification (HO). Here, we use fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP), a disease of progressive HO caused by ACVR1<sup>R206H</sup> (Activin receptor type-1 receptor) mutation, to elucidate how ACVR1 affects skeletal muscle repair. Rare and unique primary FOP human muscle stem cells (Hu-MuSCs) isolated from cadaveric skeletal muscle demonstrated increased ECM marker expression, showed skeletal muscle-specific impaired engraftment and regeneration ability. Human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived muscle stem/progenitor cells (iMPCs) single cell transcriptome analyses from FOP also revealed unusually increased ECM and osteogenic marker expression compared to control iMPCs. These results show that iMPCs can recapitulate many aspects of Hu-MuSCs for detailed <i>in vitro</i> study, that ACVR1 is a key regulator of Hu-MuSC function and skeletal muscle repair; and that ACVR1 activation in iMPCs or Hu-MuSCs may contribute to HO by changing the local tissue environment.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Circuits for integrating learned and innate valences in the insect brain</a></h4>

              
                Animal behavior is shaped both by evolution and by individual experience. Parallel brain pathways encode innate and learned valences of cues, but the way in which they are integrated during action-selection is not well understood. We used electron microscopy to comprehensively map with synaptic resolution all neurons downstream of all Mushroom Body output neurons (encoding learned valences) and characterized their patterns of interaction with Lateral Horn neurons (encoding innate valences) in <i>Drosophila</i> larva. The connectome revealed multiple <i>convergence neuron</i> types that receive convergent Mushroom Body and Lateral Horn inputs. A subset of these receives excitatory input from positive-valence MB and LH pathways and inhibitory input from negative-valence MB pathways. We confirmed functional connectivity from LH and MB pathways and behavioral roles of two of these neurons. These neurons encode integrated odor value and bidirectionally regulate turning. Based on this we speculate that learning could potentially skew the balance of excitation and inhibition onto these neurons and thereby modulate turning. Together, our study provides insights into the circuits that integrate learned and innate to modify behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Mycobacterium tuberculosis canonical virulence factors interfere with a late component of the TLR2 response</a></h4>

              
                For many intracellular pathogens, the phagosome is the site of events and interactions that shape infection outcome. Phagosomal membrane damage, in particular, is proposed to benefit invading pathogens. To define the innate immune consequences of this damage, we profiled macrophage transcriptional responses to wild-type <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> (Mtb) and mutants that fail to damage the phagosomal membrane. We identified a set of genes with enhanced expression in response to the mutants. These genes represented a late component of the TLR2-dependent transcriptional response to Mtb, distinct from an earlier component that included <i>Tnf</i>. Expression of the later component was inherent to TLR2 activation, dependent upon endosomal uptake, and enhanced by phagosome acidification. Canonical Mtb virulence factors that contribute to phagosomal membrane damage blunted phagosome acidification and undermined the endosome-specific response. Profiling cell survival and bacterial growth in macrophages demonstrated that the attenuation of these mutants is partially dependent upon TLR2. Further, TLR2 contributed to the attenuated phenotype of one of these mutants in a murine model of infection. These results demonstrate two distinct components of the TLR2 response and identify a component dependent upon endosomal uptake as a point where pathogenic bacteria interfere with the generation of effective inflammation. This interference promotes TB pathogenesis in both macrophage and murine infection models.

                Cellular senescence is a highly complex and programmed cellular state with diverse and, at times, conflicting physiological and pathological roles across the lifespan of an organism. Initially considered a cell culture artifact, senescence evolved from an age-related circumstance to an intricate cellular defense mechanism in response to stress, implicated in a wide spectrum of biological processes like tissue remodelling, injury and cancer. The development of new tools to study senescence in vivo paved the way to uncover its functional roles in various frameworks, which are sometimes hard to reconcile. Here, we review the functional impact of senescent cells on different organismal contexts. We provide updated insights on the role of senescent cells in tissue repair and regeneration, in which they essentially modulate the levels of fibrosis and inflammation, discussing how “time” seems to be the key maestro of their effects. Finally, we overview the current clinical research landscape to target senescent cells and contemplate its repercussions on this fast-evolving field.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Individual variations in ‘brain age’ relate to early-life factors more than to longitudinal brain change</a></h4>

              
                <i>Brain age</i> is a widely used index for quantifying individuals’ brain health as deviation from a normative brain aging trajectory. Higher-than-expected <i>brain age</i> is thought partially to reflect above-average rate of brain aging. Here, we explicitly tested this assumption in two independent large test datasets (UK Biobank [main] and Lifebrain [replication]; longitudinal observations ≈ 2750 and 4200) by assessing the relationship between cross-sectional and longitudinal estimates of <i>brain age. Brain age</i> models were estimated in two different training datasets (n ≈ 38,000 [main] and 1800 individuals [replication]) based on brain structural features. The results showed no association between cross-sectional <i>brain age</i> and the rate of brain change measured longitudinally. Rather, <i>brain age</i> in adulthood was associated with the congenital factors of birth weight and polygenic scores of <i>brain age,</i> assumed to reflect a constant, lifelong influence on brain structure from early life. The results call for nuanced interpretations of cross-sectional indices of the aging brain and question their validity as markers of ongoing within-person changes of the aging brain. Longitudinal imaging data should be preferred whenever the goal is to understand individual change trajectories of brain and cognition in aging.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Wnt signaling mediates acquisition of blood-brain barrier properties in naïve endothelium derived from human pluripotent stem cells</a></h4>

              
                Endothelial cells (ECs) in the central nervous system (CNS) acquire their specialized blood-brain barrier (BBB) properties in response to extrinsic signals, with Wnt/β-catenin signaling coordinating multiple aspects of this process. Our knowledge of CNS EC development has been advanced largely by animal models, and human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) offer the opportunity to examine BBB development in an <i>in vitro</i> human system. Here we show that activation of Wnt signaling in hPSC-derived naïve endothelial progenitors, but not in matured ECs, leads to robust acquisition of canonical BBB phenotypes including expression of GLUT-1, increased claudin-5, decreased PLVAP and decreased permeability. RNA-seq revealed a transcriptome profile resembling ECs with CNS-like characteristics, including Wnt-upregulated expression of <i>LEF1</i>, <i>APCDD1</i>, and <i>ZIC3</i>. Together, our work defines effects of Wnt activation in naïve ECs and establishes an improved hPSC-based model for interrogation of CNS barriergenesis.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A novel histone deacetylase inhibitor-based approach to eliminate microglia and retain astrocyte properties in glial cell culture.</a></h4>

              
                The close association between astrocytes and microglia causes great difficulties to distinguish their individual roles in innate immune responses in central nervous system. Current chemical-based methods to eliminate microglia in glial cell culture introduce various molecular and functional alterations to astrocytes. Here, we describe a novel two-step approach to achieve a complete elimination of microglia without affecting the biological properties of co-cultured astrocytes by temporal treatment of histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA). We verify TSA as a potent inducer for microglial-specific cell death, which also causes comprehensive gene expression changes in astrocytes. However, withdrawal of TSA not only ensures no microglia repopulation, but also restores all the gene expression changes in terms of astrocyte functions, including neurotrophic factors, glutamate and potassium transporters, and reactive astrocyte subtypes. By contrast, withdrawal of PLX5622, the commonly used colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor inhibitor neither prevents microglia repopulation nor restores the gene expression changes mentioned above. Using this method, we are able to discriminate differential roles of microglia and astrocytes in the induced expression of antiviral and pro-inflammatory cytokines upon various pathological stimuli including the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. This simple and efficient method can be customized for the understanding of microglia-astrocyte interaction and the development of epigenetic therapies that target over-activated microglia in neuroinflammation-related diseases.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Individual differences in frontoparietal plasticity in humans</a></h4>

              
                Neuroplasticity, defined as the brain's ability to change in response to its environment, has been extensively studied at the cellular and molecular levels. Work in animal models suggests that stimulation to the ventral tegmental area (VTA) enhances plasticity, and that myelination constrains plasticity. Little is known, however, about whether proxy measures of these properties in the human brain are associated with learning. Here we investigated the plasticity of the frontoparietal system (FPS), which supports complex cognition. We asked whether VTA resting-state functional connectivity and myelin map (T1-w/T2-w ratio) values predicted learning after short-term training on a FPS-dependent task: the adaptive n-back (n = 46, ages 18-25). We found that stronger connectivity between VTA and lateral prefrontal cortex at baseline predicted greater improvements in accuracy. Lower myelin map values predicted improvement in response times, but not accuracy. Our findings suggest that proxy markers of neural plasticity can predict learning in humans.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Bedtime to the brain: How infants sleep habits intertwine with sleep neurophysiology</a></h4>

              
                Adequate sleep is critical for development and facilitates the maturation of the neurophysiological circuitries at the basis of cognitive and behavioral function. Observational research has associated sleep problems in early life with worse later cognitive, psychosocial, and somatic health outcomes. Yet, the extent to which day-to-day sleep habits in early life relate to neurophysiology - acutely and long-term - remains to be explored. Here, we report that sleep habits in 32 healthy 6-month-olds assessed with actimetry are linked to fundamental aspects of their neurophysiology measured with high-density electroencephalography (hdEEG). Our study reveals four key findings: First, daytime sleep habits are linked to EEG slow wave activity (SWA). Second, habits of nighttime movement and awakenings from sleep are connected with spindle density. Third, habitual sleep timing is linked to neurophysiological connectivity quantified as Delta-coherence. And lastly, Delta-coherence at age 6 months predicts nighttime sleep duration at age 12 months. These novel findings widen our understanding that infants' sleep habits are closely intertwined with three particular levels of neurophysiology: sleep pressure (determined by SWA), the maturation of the thalamocortical system (spindles), and the maturation of cortical connectivity (coherence). Our companion paper complements this insight in the perspective of later developmental outcomes: early thalamocortical connectivity (spindle density) at age 6 months predicts later behavioural status at 12 and 24 months. The crucial next step is to extend this concept to clinical groups to objectively characterize infants' sleep habits "at risk" that foster later neurodevelopmental problems.

                Biological brains possess an unparalleled ability to generalize adaptive behavioral responses from only a few examples. How neural processes enable this capacity to extrapolate is a fundamental open question. A prominent but underexplored hypothesis suggests that generalization is facilitated by a low-dimensional organization of collective neural activity. Here we tested this hypothesis in the framework of flexible timing tasks where dynamics play a key role. Examining trained recurrent neural networks we found that confining the dynamics to a low-dimensional subspace allowed tonic inputs to parametrically control the overall input-output transform and enabled smooth extrapolation to inputs well beyond the training range. Reverse-engineering and theoretical analyses demonstrated that this parametric control of extrapolation relies on a mechanism where tonic inputs modulate the dynamics along non-linear manifolds in activity space while preserving their geometry. Comparisons with neural data from behaving monkeys confirmed the geometric and dynamical signatures of this mechanism.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A biologically inspired architecture with switching units can learn to generalize across backgrounds</a></h4>

              
                Humans and other animals navigate different landscapes and environments with ease, a feat that requires the brain's ability to rapidly and accurately adapt to different visual domains, generalizing across contexts/backgrounds. Despite recent progress in deep learning applied to classification and detection in the presence of multiple confounds including contextual ones, there remain important challenges to address regarding how networks can perform context-dependent computations and how contextually-invariant visual concepts are formed. For instance, recent studies have shown artificial networks that repeatedly misclassified familiar objects set on new backgrounds, e.g. incorrectly labeling known animals when they appeared in a different setting. Here, we show how a bio-inspired network motif can explicitly address this issue. We do this using a novel dataset which can be used as a benchmark for future studies probing invariance to backgrounds. The dataset consists of MNIST digits of varying transparency, set on one of two backgrounds with different statistics: a Gaussian noise or a more naturalistic background from the CIFAR-10 dataset. We use this dataset to learn digit classification when contexts are shown sequentially, and find that both shallow and deep networks have sharply decreased performance when returning to the first background after experience learning the second -- the catastrophic forgetting phenomenon in continual learning. To overcome this, we propose an architecture with additional ``switching'' units that are activated in the presence of a new background. We find that the switching network can learn the new context even with very few switching units, while maintaining the performance in the previous context -- but that they must be recurrently connected to network layers. When the task is difficult due to high transparency, the switching network trained on both contexts outperforms networks without switching trained on only one context. The switching mechanism leads to sparser activation patterns, and we provide intuition for why this helps to solve the task. We compare our architecture with other prominent learning methods, and find that elastic weight consolidation is not successful in our setting, while progressive nets are more complex but less effective. Our study therefore shows how a bio-inspired architectural motif can contribute to task generalization across context.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cerebral perfusion imaging: Hypoxia-induced deoxyhemoglobin or gadolinium?</a></h4>

              
                Assessment of resting cerebrovascular perfusion measures (mean transit time, cerebral blood flow and cerebral blood volume) with magnetic resonance imaging currently requires the intravascular injection of the dynamic susceptibility contrast agent gadolinium. An initial comparison between hypoxia-induced deoxyhemoglobin and gadolinium was made for these measures in six healthy participants. A bolus of deoxyhemoglobin is generated in the lung via transient hypoxia induced by an available computer-controlled gas blender technology employing sequential gas delivery (RespirAct). We hypothesised and confirmed perfusion measures from both susceptibility contrast agents would yield similar spatial patterns of cerebrovascular perfusion measures. We conclude that hypoxia-induced deoxyhemoglobin, an endogenously, non-invasively generated, non-allergenic, non-toxic, recyclable, environmentally innocuous molecule, may be suitable to become the first new magnetic resonance imaging susceptibility contrast agent introduction since gadolinium.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Identifying Causal Subsequent Memory Effects</a></h4>

              
                Over 40 years of accumulated research has detailed associations between neuroimaging signals measured during a memory encoding task and later memory performance, across a variety of brain regions, measurement tools, statistical approaches and behavioral tasks. But the interpretation of these Subsequent Memory Effects (SMEs) remains unclear: if the identified signals reflect cognitive and neural mechanisms of memory encoding then the underlying neural activity must be causally related to future memory. However, almost all previous SME analyses do not control for potential confounders of this causal interpretation, such as serial position and item effects. We collect a large fMRI dataset and use a novel experimental design and analysis approach that allows us to statistically adjust for all exogenous confounding variables. We find that, using standard approaches without adjustment, we replicate several univariate and multivariate subsequent memory effects and are able to predict memory performance across people. However, we are unable to identify any signal that reliably predicts subsequent memory after adjusting for confounding variables, bringing into doubt the causal status of these effects. We apply the same approach to subjects' judgments of learning collected during an encoding period, and show that these behavioral measures of encoding quality do predict memory after adjustments, suggesting that it is possible to measure signals at the time of encoding that reflect causal mechanisms but that existing neuroimaging measures may not have the precision and specificity to do so.

                In real life, humans make decisions by taking into account multiple independent factors, such as delay and probability. Cognitive psychology suggests that cognitive control mechanisms play a key role when facing such complex task conditions. However, in value-based decision-making, it still remains unclear to what extent cognitive control mechanisms become essential when the task condition is complex. In this study, we investigated decision-making behaviors and underlying neural mechanisms using a multifactor gambling task where participants simultaneously considered probability and delay. Decision-making behavior in the multifactor task was modulated by both probability and delay. The behavioral effect of probability was stronger than delay, consistent with previous studies. Furthermore, in a subset of conditions that recruited fronto-parietal activations, reaction times were paradoxically elongated despite lower probabilistic uncertainty. Notably, such a reaction time elongation did not occur in control tasks involving single factors. Meta-analysis of brain activations suggested an association between the paradoxical increase of reaction time and strategy switching. Together, these results suggest a novel aspect of complex value-based decision-makings that is strongly influenced by fronto-parietal cognitive control.

                Resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) is being used to develop diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic biomarkers for critically ill patients with severe brain injuries. In studies of healthy volunteers and non-critically ill patients, prospective cardiorespiratory data are routinely collected to remove non-neuronal fluctuations in the rs-fMRI signal during analysis. However, the feasibility and utility of collecting cardiorespiratory data in critically ill patients on a clinical MRI scanner are unknown. We concurrently acquired rs-fMRI (TR=1250ms), cardiac and respiratory data in 23 critically ill patients with acute severe traumatic brain injury (TBI), and 12 healthy control subjects. We compared the functional connectivity results after denoising with cardiorespiratory data (i.e., RETROICOR) with the results obtained after standard bandpass filtering. Rs-fMRI data in 7 patients could not be analyzed due to imaging artifacts. In 6 of the remaining 16 patients (37.5%), cardiorespiratory data were either incomplete or corrupted. In both patients and control subjects, the functional connectivity corrected with RETROICOR did not significantly differ from that corrected with bandpass filtering of 0.008-0.125 Hz. Collectively, these findings suggest that there is a limited feasibility and utility to prospectively acquire high-quality cardiorespiratory data during rs-fMRI in critically ill patients with severe TBI for physiological correction.

                Objective: Diet-induced obesity (DIO) is associated with hypothalamic microglial activation and dysfunction of the melanocortin pathway, but the molecular mechanisms linking the two remain unclear. Previous studies have hypothesized that microglial inflammatory signaling is linked with impaired pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neuron function, but this mechanism has never been directly tested in vivo. We addressed this hypothesis using the specific microglial silencing molecule, CX3CL1 (fractalkine), to determine whether reducing hypothalamic microglial activation can restore POMC/melanocortin signaling in the brain to protect against DIO. Methods: We performed metabolic analyses in mice with targeted viral overexpression of CX3CL1 in the hypothalamus exposed to high fat diet (HFD). Electrophysiologic recording in hypothalamic slices from POMC-MAPT-GFP mice was used to determine the effects of HFD feeding and microglial silencing via minocycline or CX3CL1 on GFP-labeled POMC neurons. Finally, mice with hypothalamic overexpression of CX3CL1 received central treatment with the melanocortin receptor antagonist SHU-9119 to determine whether melanocortin signaling is required for the metabolic benefits of CX3CL1. Results: We found that targeted expression of both soluble and membrane-bound forms of CX3CL1 in the mediobasal hypothalamus potently reduced weight gain and increased leptin sensitivity in animals exposed to high fat diet. The protective effect of CX3CL1 rescued diet-induced changes in POMC neuron excitability and required intact melanocortin receptor signaling in vivo. Conclusion: Our results provide the first evidence that HFD-induced POMC neuron dysfunction involves microglial activation. Furthermore, our study suggests that the anti-obesity action of CX3CL1 is mediated through the restoration of POMC neuron excitability and melanocortin signaling.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Boundary extension is constrained by naturalistic image properties</a></h4>

              
                Boundary extension (BE) is a classical memory illusion in which observers remember more of a scene than was presented. According to predictive accounts, BE reflects the integration of visual input and expectations of what is beyond the boundaries of a scene. Alternatively, according to normalization accounts, BE reflects one end of a normalization process towards the typically-experienced viewing distance of a scene, such that BE and boundary contraction (BC) are equally common. Here, we show that BE and BC depend on depth-of-field (DOF), as determined by the aperture settings on a camera. Photographs with naturalistic DOF led to the strongest BE across a large stimulus set, while BC was primarily observed for unnaturalistic DOF. The relationship between DOF and BE was confirmed in three controlled experiments that isolated DOF from co-varying factors. In line with predictive accounts, we propose that BE is strongest for scene images that resemble day-to-day visual experience.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Intra-individual Physiomic Landscape of Pyramidal Neurons in the Human Neocortex</a></h4>

              
                Computation within cortical microcircuits is determined by functional properties of the neurons and their synaptic interactions. While heterogeneity of inhibitory interneurons is well established, the anatomical, physiological, and molecular differentiation of excitatory pyramidal neurons is not fully resolved. To identify functional subtypes within the pyramidal neuron population, we focused on human layer 2-3 cortex which greatly expanded during evolution. We performed multi-neuron patch-clamp recordings in brain slices from the temporal cortex of 22 epilepsy patients. We characterized the electrophysiological properties of up to 80 pyramidal neurons per patient, enabling us to assess inter- and intra-individual functional variability. Hierarchical clustering of the high-dimensional parameter space yielded functionally distinct clusters of pyramidal neurons which were present across individuals. This may represent a generic organizational principle converging with previously described transcriptomic heterogeneity. We further observed substantial heterogeneity in physiological parameters with intra-individual variability being severalfold larger than inter-individual variability. The phenotypic variability within and across pyramidal neuron subtypes has important implications for the computational capacity of the cortical microcircuit.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">State-dependent modulation of activity in distinct layer 6 corticothalamic neurons in barrel cortex of awake mice</a></h4>

              
                Layer 6 corticothalamic (L6 CT) neurons are in a strategic position to control sensory input to the neocortex, yet we understand very little about their functions. Apart from studying their anatomical, physiological and synaptic properties, most recent efforts have focused on the activity-dependent influences CT cells can exert on thalamic and cortical neurons through causal optogenetic manipulations. However, few studies have attempted to study them during behavior. In an attempt to address this gap, we performed juxtacellular recordings from optogenetically identified CT neurons in whisker-related primary somatosensory cortex (wS1) of awake, head-fixed mice (of either sex) free to rest quietly or self-initiate bouts of whisking and locomotion. We found a rich diversity of response profiles exhibited by CT cells. Broadly, their spiking patterns were either modulated by whisker-related behavior (~28%) or not (~72%). Whisker-related neurons exhibited both increases as well as decreases in firing rates. We also encountered cells with preceding modulations in firing rate before whisking onset. Overall, whisking better explained these changes in rates than overall changes in arousal. The CT cells that showed no whisker-related activity had low spontaneous firing rates (<0.5 Hz), with many all but silent. Remarkably, this relatively silent population preferentially spiked at the state transition point when pupil diameter constricted and the mouse entered quiet wakefulness. Thus, our results demonstrate that L6 CT neurons in wS1 show diverse spiking patterns, perhaps subserving distinct functional roles related to precisely timed responses during complex behaviors and transitions between discrete waking states.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Multi-parametric characterization of brain-wide hemodynamic and calcium responses to sensory stimulation in mice</a></h4>

              
                Modern optical neuroimaging approaches are expanding our ability to elucidate complex brain function. Diverse imaging contrasts enable direct observation of neural activity with functional sensors along with the induced hemodynamic responses. To date, decoupling the complex interplay of neurovascular coupling and dynamical physiological states has remained challenging when employing single-modality functional neuroimaging tools. We devised a hybrid fluorescence optoacoustic tomography (FLOT) platform combined with a custom data processing pipeline based on statistical parametric mapping, accomplishing the first simultaneous noninvasive observation of both direct and indirect brain-wide activation patterns with optical contrast. Correlated changes in the oxy- and deoxygenated hemoglobin, total hemoglobin, oxygen saturation and rapid GCaMP6f fluorescence signals were observed in response to peripheral sensory stimulation. While the concurrent epifluorescence served to corroborate and complement the functional optoacoustic observations, the latter further aided in decoupling the rapid calcium responses from the slowly varying background in the fluorescence recordings mediated by hemodynamic changes. The hybrid imaging platform expands the capabilities of conventional neuroimaging methods to provide more comprehensive functional readings for studying neurovascular and neurometabolic coupling mechanisms and related diseases.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sources of variation in the spectral slope of the sleep EEG</a></h4>

              
                Building on previous work linking changes in the electroencephalogram (EEG) spectral slope to arousal level, Lendner et al. (2021) reported that wake, non rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep exhibit progressively steeper 30-45 Hz slopes, interpreted in terms of increasing cortical inhibition. Here we sought to replicate Lendner et al.'s scalp EEG findings (based on 20 individuals) in a larger sample of 11,630 individuals from multiple cohorts in the National Sleep Research Resource (NSRR). In a final analytic sample of N = 10,255 distinct recordings, there was unambiguous statistical support for the hypothesis that, within individuals, the mean spectral slope grows steeper going from wake to NREM to REM sleep. We found that the choice of mastoid referencing scheme modulated the extent to which electromyogenic or electrocardiographic artifacts were likely to bias 30-45 Hz slope estimates, as well as other sources of technical, device-specific bias. Nonetheless, within individuals, slope estimates were relatively stable over time. Both cross-sectionally and longitudinal, slopes tended to become shallower with increasing age, particularly for REM sleep; males tended to show flatter slopes than females across all states. Although conceptually distinct, spectral slope did not predict sleep state substantially better than other summaries of the high frequency EEG power spectrum (>20 Hz, in this context) including beta band power, however. Finally, to more fully describe sources of variation in the spectral slope and its relationship to other sleep parameters, we quantified state-dependent differences in the variances (both within and between individuals) of spectral slope, power and interhemispheric coherence, as well as their covariances. In contrast to the common conception of the REM EEG as relatively wake-like (i.e. 'paradoxical' sleep), REM and wake were the most divergent states for multiple metrics, with NREM exhibiting intermediate profiles. Under a simplified modelling framework, changes in spectral slope could not, by themselves, fully account for the observed differences between states, if assuming a strict power law model. Although the spectral slope is an appealing, theoretically inspired parameterization of the sleep EEG, here we underscore some practical considerations that should be borne in mind when applying it in diverse datasets. Future work will be needed to fully characterize state-dependent changes in the aperiodic portions of the EEG power spectra, which appear to be consistent with, albeit not fully explained by, changes in the spectral slope.

                The study of the brain's dynamical activity is opening a valuable source of assistance for the clinical diagnosis of patients with disorders of consciousness (DOC). For example, dysfunctional spread of naturalistic and synthetic stimuli has proven useful to characterize hampered consciousness. However, understanding of the mechanisms behind loss of consciousness following brain injury is still missing. Here, we study the propagation of endogenous and in-silico exogenous perturbations in patients with DOC, based upon directed and causal interactions estimated from resting-state fMRI. We found that patients with DOC suffer decreased capacity for neural propagation and responsiveness to events. Particularly, that loss of consciousness is related to the malfunctioning of two neural circuits: the posterior cortical regions failing to convey information, in conjunction with reduced broadcasting of information from subcortical, temporal, parietal and frontal regions. These results seed light on the mechanisms behind DOC, thus opening new possibilities for clinical applications.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Gray Matter Differentiation Between Two Subordinate Personality Traits of Extraversion: Enthusiasm and Assertiveness</a></h4>

              
                Enthusiasm and assertiveness are two subordinate personality traits of extraversion. These traits reflect different aspects of extroversion and have distinct implications on mental health. Whereas enthusiasm predicts satisfaction in life and positive relationships, assertiveness predicts psychological distress and reduced social support. The neural basis of these subordinate traits is not well understood. To investigate brain regions where enthusiasm and assertiveness have diverging relationship with morphology, enthusiasm and assertiveness were regressed to gray matter volume (GMV) across the whole brain in a sample of 301 healthy individuals. A significant interaction was found between enthusiasm and assertiveness in the left angular gyrus (t(296) = 4.18, family wise error corrected, FWE p = .001 (cluster-level); Cluster size = 880 voxels). Larger GMV in this area was associated with more enthusiasm and less assertiveness. Our study emphasizes the value of separating extraversion into its subordinate traits when investigating associations to neuroanatomy.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Distinct replay signatures for planning and memory maintenance</a></h4>

              
                Theories of neural replay propose that it supports a range of different functions, most prominently planning and memory maintenance. Here, we test the hypothesis that distinct replay signatures relate to planning and memory maintenance. Our reward learning task required human participants to utilize structure knowledge for 'model-based' evaluation, while maintaining knowledge for two independent and randomly alternating task environments. Using magnetoencephalography (MEG) and multivariate analysis, we found neural evidence for compressed forward replay during planning and backward replay following reward feedback. Prospective replay strength was enhanced for the current environment when the benefits of a model-based planning strategy were higher. Following reward receipt, backward replay for the alternative, distal environment was enhanced as a function of decreasing recency of experience for that environment. Consistent with a memory maintenance role, stronger maintenance-related replay was associated with a modulation of subsequent choices. These findings identify distinct replay signatures consistent with key theoretical proposals on planning and memory maintenance functions, with their relative strength modulated by on-going computational and task demands.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Delineation of dynorphin and kappa opioid receptor circuit elements in alcohol consumption</a></h4>

              
                Alcohol use disorder is complex and multi-faceted, involving the coordination of multiple signaling systems across numerous brain region. Previous work has indicated that both the insular cortex and dynorphin (DYN)/Kappa opioid receptor (KOR) systems contribute to excessive alcohol use. More recently, we identified a microcircuit in the medial aspect of the insular cortex that signals through DYN/KOR. Here, we explored the role of insula DYN/KOR circuit elements on alcohol intake in a long-term intermittent access (IA) procedure. Using a combination of conditional knockout strategies and site-directed pharmacology, we discovered distinct and sex-specific roles for insula DYN and KOR systems in alcohol drinking and related behavior. Our findings show that insula DYN deletion blocked escalated consumption and decreased overall intake of and preference for alcohol in male and female mice. This effect was selective for alcohol in male mice, as DYN deletion did not impact their sucrose intake. In male mice, insula KOR antagonism reduced alcohol intake and preference during the early phase of IA only. Alcohol consumption as not affected by insula KOR knockout. In addition, we found that long-term IA decreased the intrinsic excitability of DYN and deep layer pyramidal neurons (DLPN) in the insula of male mice. Excitatory synaptic transmission was also impacted by IA, as it drove an increase in excitatory synaptic drive in both DYN neurons and DLPN. Combined, our findings suggest that there is a dynamic interplay between excessive alcohol consumption and insula DYN/KOR circuit elements.

	<p>The role of select pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators in driving microglial cell polarization into classically (M1), or alternatively, (M2) activated states, as well as the subsequent differential responses of these induced phenotypes, was examined. Expression of PD-L1, MHC-II, MHC-I, arginase 1 (Arg-1), and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) was assessed using multi-color flow cytometry. We observed that both pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators induced PD-L1 expression on non-polarized microglia. Moreover, IFN-γ stimulated significant MHC class I and II expression on these cells. Interestingly, we observed that only IL-4 treatment induced Arg-1 expression, indicating M2 polarization. These M2 cells were refractory to subsequent depolarization and maintained their alternatively activated state. Furthermore, PD-L1 expression was significantly induced on these M2-polarized microglia after treatment with pro-inflammatory mediators, but not anti-inflammatory cytokines. In addition, we observed that only LPS induced iNOS expression in microglial cells, indicating M1 polarization. Furthermore, IFN-γ significantly increased the percentage of M1-polarized microglia expressing iNOS. Surprisingly, when these M1-polarized microglia were treated with either IL-6 or other anti-inflammatory cytokines, they returned to their non-polarized state, as demonstrated by significantly reduced expression of iNOS. Taken together, these results demonstrate differential responses of microglial cells to mediators present in dissimilar microenvironments.</p>

	<p>Descriptions of the nuclear parcellation of the locus coeruleus complex have been provided in approximately 80 mammal species spanning the phylogenetic breadth of this class. Within the mammalian rostral hindbrain, noradrenergic neurons (revealed with tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine-ß-hydroxylase immunohistochemistry) have been observed within the periventricular grey matter (A4 and A6 nuclei) and parvicellular reticular nucleus (A5 and A7 nuclei), with the one exception to date being the tree pangolin, where no A4/A6 neurons are observed. The alphanumeric nomenclature system, developed in laboratory rodent brains, has been adapted to cover the variation observed across species. Cross-species homology is observed regarding the nuclear organization of noradrenergic neurons located in the parvicellular reticular nucleus (A5 and A7). In contrast, significant variations are observed in the organization of the A6 neurons of the locus coeruleus proper. In most mammals, the A6 is comprised of a moderate density of neurons, but in Murid rodents, primates, and megachiropteran bats, the A6 exhibits a very high density of neurons. In primates and megachiropterans, there is an additional moderate density of A6 neurons located rostromedial to the high-density portion. These variations are of importance in understanding the translation of findings in laboratory rodents to humans.</p>

	<p>The locus coeruleus is critical for selective information processing by modulating the brain’s connectivity configuration. Increasingly, studies have suggested that LC controls sensory inputs at the sensory gating stage. Furthermore, accumulating evidence has shown that young children and older adults are more prone to distraction and filter out irrelevant information less efficiently, possibly due to the unoptimized LC connectivity. However, the LC connectivity pattern across the life span is not fully examined yet, hampering our ability to understand the relationship between LC development and the distractibility. In this study, we examined the intrinsic network connectivity of the LC using a public fMRI dataset with wide-range age samples. Based on LC-seed functional connectivity maps, we examined the age-related variation in the LC connectivity with a quadratic model. The analyses revealed two connectivity patterns explicitly. The sensory-related brain regions showed a positive quadratic age effect (u-shape), and the frontal regions for the cognitive control showed a negative quadratic age effect (inverted u-shape). Our results imply that such age-related distractibility is possibly due to the impaired sensory gating by the LC and the insufficient top-down controls by the frontal regions. We discuss the underlying neural mechanisms and limitations of our study.</p>

	<p>Prior laboratory experiments among healthy samples found that training avoidance movements to angry faces may lower anger and aggression, especially people high in trait anger. To enrich this training and make it more suitable for clinical applications, the present researchers developed it into a Virtual Reality Game for Aggressive Impulse Management (VR-GAIME). The current study examined the effects of this training in a randomized controlled trial among forensic psychiatric outpatients with aggression regulation problems (N = 30). In addition to the aggression replacement training, patients played either the VR-GAIME or a control game. Aggressive behavior was measured pre-, half-way, and post-treatment via self-report and clinicians ratings. No difference was found between the VR-GAIME and the control game. However, the participants reported gaining more insight into their own behavior and that of others. Future VR intervention tools in clinical settings may capitalize more on their benefits for self-reflection within interpersonal settings.</p>

	<p>The importance of the role of affect in psychotherapy for major depressive disorder (MDD) is well established, but the common use of self-reported measures may limit our understanding of its underlying mechanisms. A promising predictor of patient affect is the stress hormone cortisol. To date, no studies have studied in-session changes in cortisol in psychotherapy for MDD. We investigated whether an increase in patient cortisol over the course of a session correlated with higher negative and lower positive affect. Given previous findings on healthy individuals on the contagious nature of stress, an additional aim was to examine whether these relationships are moderated by therapist cortisol. To this end, 40 dyads (including 6 therapists) provided saliva samples before and after four pre-specified sessions (616 samples). After each session, the patients provided retrospective reports of in-session affect. We found no association between patient cortisol and affect. However, increases in patient cortisol predicted negative affect when the therapists exhibited decreases in cortisol, and increases in patient cortisol predicted positive affect when the therapists showed increases. Our study provides initial evidence for the importance of the social context in the cortisol–affect relationship in MDD.</p>

                <p>In oscillatory circuits, some actions of neuromodulators depend on the oscillation frequency. However, the mechanisms are poorly understood. We explored this problem by characterizing neuromodulation of the lateral pyloric (LP) neuron of the crab stomatogastric ganglion (STG). Many peptide modulators, including proctolin, activate the same ionic current (<I>I</I><SUB>MI</SUB>) in STG neurons. Because <I>I</I><SUB>MI</SUB> is fast and non-inactivating, its peak level does not depend on the temporal properties of neuronal activity. We found, however, that the amplitude and peak time of the proctolin-activated current in LP is frequency dependent. Because frequency affects the rate of voltage change, we measured these currents with voltage ramps of different slopes and found that proctolin activated two kinetically distinct ionic currents: the known <I>I</I><SUB>MI</SUB>, whose amplitude is independent of ramp slope or direction, and an inactivating current (<I>I</I><SUB>MI-T</SUB>), which was only activated by positive ramps and whose amplitude increased with increasing ramp slope. Using a conductance-based model we found that <I>I</I><SUB>MI</SUB> and <I>I</I><SUB>MI-T</SUB> make distinct contributions to the bursting activity, with <I>I</I><SUB>MI</SUB> increasing the excitability, and <I>I</I><SUB>MI-T</SUB> regulating the burst onset by modifying the postinhibitory rebound in a frequency-dependent manner. The voltage dependence and partial calcium permeability of <I>I</I><SUB>MI-T</SUB> is similar to other characterized neuromodulator-activated currents in this system, suggesting that these are isoforms of the same channel. Our computational model suggests that calcium permeability may allow this current to also activate the large calcium-dependent potassium current in LP, providing an additional mechanism to regulate burst termination. These results demonstrate a mechanism for frequency-dependent actions of neuromodulators.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Molecular Detection of Sapovirus in Children Under Five Years with Acute Gastroenteritis in Mansoura, Egypt between January 2019 and February 2020 [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Sapovirus has emerged as a viral cause of acute gastroenteritis. However, there is limited data on sapovirus in Egypt. . The present study aimed to evaluate the presence of sapovirus in children with acute gastroenteritis <5 years in Mansoura, Egypt from January 2019 to February 2020 by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Methods: The cross-sectional study enrolled a 100 children <5 years who presented with acute gastroenteritis at an outpatient clinic in Mansoura, Egypt between January 2019 and February 2020. Clinical data, demographic data and a stool sample was collected from each child. Stools were screened by microscopy for parasites and culture methods for bacteria and excluded from the study if positive for either. Specimens were also screened for rotavirus by enzyme immune assays (EIA) and sapovirus by reverse transcription PCR. Results: The most frequently detected virus was rotavirus by ELISA 25% (25/100). RT-PCR detected sapovirus in 7% (7/100) of the stool samples. The children with sapovirus were all from rural regions and presented mainly during the winter season in Egypt 42.9% (3/7). The main presenting symptoms were fever 71.4% (5/7) and vomiting 57.1% (4/7). None of the children with sapovirus had dehydration. Rotavirus was significantly associated with sapovirus infections in  five samples (5/7) , 71.4%, P=0.01. Conclusion: The present study highlights the emergence of sapovirus as a frequent pathogen associated with acute gastroenteritis in children. There is a need for a national survey program for the study of sapovirus among other pathogens associated with acute gastroenteritis for better management of such infection.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Blood pressure and 10-year all-cause mortality: Findings from the PERU MIGRANT Study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background The long-term impact of elevated blood pressure on mortality outcomes has been recently revisited due to proposed changes in cut-offs for hypertension. This study aimed at assessing the association between high blood pressure levels and 10-year mortality using the Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC-7) and the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) 2017 blood pressure guidelines. Methods Data analysis of the PERU MIGRANT Study, a prospective ongoing cohort, was used. The outcome of interest was 10-year all-cause mortality, and exposures were blood pressure categories according to the JNC-7 and ACC/AHA 2017 guidelines. Log-rank test, Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression models were used to assess the associations of interest controlling for confounders. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were estimated. Results A total of 976 records, mean age of 60.4 (SD: 11.4), 513 (52.6%) women, were analyzed. Hypertension prevalence at baseline almost doubled from 16.0% (95% CI 13.7%–18.4%) to 31.3% (95% CI 28.4%–34.3%), using the JNC-7 and ACC/AHA 2017 definitions, respectively. Sixty three (6.4%) participants died during the 10-year follow-up, equating to a mortality rate of 3.6 (95% CI 2.4–4.7) per 1000 person-years. Using JNC-7, and compared to those with normal blood pressure, those with pre-hypertension and hypertension had 2.1-fold and 5.1-fold increased risk of death, respectively. Similar mortality effect sizes were estimated using ACC/AHA 2017 for stage-1 and stage-2 hypertension. Conclusions Blood pressure levels under two different definitions increased the risk of 10-year all-cause mortality. Hypertension prevalence doubled using ACC/AHA 2017 compared to JNC-7. The choice of blood pressure cut-offs to classify hypertension categories need to be balanced against the patients benefit and the capacities of the health system to adequately handle a large proportion of new patients.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Psychological distress and quality of life following provision of vascular imaging results of the coronary and carotid arteries to asymptomatic adults: a scoping review protocol [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Non-invasive screening for atherosclerosis or asymptomatic cardiovascular disease of the coronary and carotid arteries is commonly undertaken, and research has been focussed on how results from these screenings lead to behaviour change. However, no review has focused on the effects of these results on psychological distress and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). This protocol will outline how a scoping review will be conducted to map all available evidence on psychological distress and/or HRQoL outcomes following the provision of vascular imaging results of the coronary and carotid arteries. Methods: Arksey and O’Malley’s (2005) framework subsequently enhanced by Levac et al. (2010)  and Peters et al (2015, 2017) will guide the scoping review. Databases such as MEDLINE (Clarivate), APA PsychINFO, EMBASE, Social Work Abstracts, Psychology and Behavioural Sciences Collection, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) will be searched using MeSH terms  such as "Coronary stenosis", "Carotid Stenosis", "Psychological Distress" and "Quality of Life" and related terms. Two investigators will screen title and abstract and all articles meeting inclusion criteria will be extracted.  Data on authors, publication year, country of origin, aims/purpose, methodology, intervention, outcome measures as well as key findings that relate to the scoping review questions will be extracted for each included study. The findings will be presented using tables and thematic narrative synthesis. The scoping review will not produce a pooled estimate of the impact of vascular imaging results on psychological distress and HRQoL but will present information from the included studies related to psychological distress and HRQoL. Conclusion:  The review will highlight and address gaps in knowledge and provide direction for future investigations.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Implementation challenges from a prospective, interventional biopsy-based study of Environmental Enteropathy in rural Pakistan [version 2; peer review: 1 approved]</a></h4>

              
                The Study of Environmental Enteropathy (EE) and Malnutrition in Pakistan (SEEM) is a community intervention trial designed to understand the pathophysiology of EE and its associated clinical phenotypes in children less than two years of age. Undernutrition is the underlying cause of three million deaths worldwide annually, accounting for 45% of all deaths among children under five years of age. Linear growth stunting affects a further 165 million, especially in low- and middle-income countries. In Pakistan,  an estimated one in three children are underweight and nearly half are stunted. This manuscript summarizes the challenges faced by the field team and the solutions employed for achieving our research objectives at the rural Matiari field site. Our study design involved a longitudinal collection of field data and biological samples which required constant engagement of field staff with the participating families. Challenges faced in SEEM included: 1) quality assurance parameters of anthropometry data; 2) 24-hour food recall data collection; 3) clinical management of sick enrolled children; 4) obtaining informed consent for upper gastrointestinal (UGI)endoscopy (an invasive procedure); and 5) biological sample collection (blood, urine, stool) from enrolled children. We enrolled 350 malnourished children(Weight for Height Z (WHZ) score <-2) and 50 well-nourished children(WHZ score ≥ 0 and height-for-age Z (HAZ) score ≥ -1)   with more than 95% success rate of collecting blood, urine and stool specimens. We collected 72% microbiome stool samples within 30 minutes of the child passing stool. We conducted a UGI biopsy in 63 children.   Solutions to these challenges included good project governance, the establishment of credibility, and the development of a longitudinal bidirectional relationship embedded in trust and effective communication with the caretakers of the enrolled children.     Continuous monitoring, regular training of staff, and effective teamwork were key factors that led to the successful execution of our study.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Deciphering the molecular mechanism of the cancer formation by chromosome structural dynamics</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Xiakun Chu, Jin Wang</p>

Cancer reflects the dysregulation of the underlying gene network, which is strongly related to the 3D genome organization. Numerous efforts have been spent on experimental characterizations of the structural alterations in cancer genomes. However, there is still a lack of genomic structural-level understanding of the temporal dynamics for cancer initiation and progression. Here, we use a landscape-switching model to investigate the chromosome structural transition during the cancerization and reversion processes. We find that the chromosome undergoes a non-monotonic structural shape-changing pathway with initial expansion followed by compaction during both of these processes. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that the chromosome with a more expanding structure than those at both the normal and cancer cell during cancerization exhibits a sparse contact pattern, which shows significant structural similarity to the one at the embryonic stem cell in many aspects, including the trend of contact probability declining with the genomic distance, the global structural shape geometry and the spatial distribution of loci on the chromosome. In light of the intimate structure-function relationship at the chromosomal level, we further describe the cell state transition processes by the chromosome structural changes, suggesting an elevated cell stemness during the formation of the cancer cells. We show that cell cancerization and reversion are highly irreversible processes in terms of the chromosome structural transition pathways, spatial repositioning of chromosomal loci and hysteresis loop of contact evolution analysis. Our model draws a molecular-scale picture of cell cancerization from the chromosome structural perspective. The process contains initial reprogramming towards the stem cell followed by the differentiation towards the cancer cell, accompanied by an initial increase and subsequent decrease of the cell stemness.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Neural network features distinguish chemosensory stimuli in Caenorhabditis elegans</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Javier J. How, Saket Navlakha, Sreekanth H. Chalasani</p>

Nervous systems extract and process information from the environment to alter animal behavior and physiology. Despite progress in understanding how different stimuli are represented by changes in neuronal activity, less is known about how they affect broader neural network properties. We developed a framework for using graph-theoretic features of neural network activity to predict ecologically relevant stimulus properties, in particular stimulus identity. We used the transparent nematode, <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>, with its small nervous system to define neural network features associated with various chemosensory stimuli. We first immobilized animals using a microfluidic device and exposed their noses to chemical stimuli while monitoring changes in neural activity of more than 50 neurons in the head region. We found that graph-theoretic features, which capture patterns of interactions between neurons, are modulated by stimulus identity. Further, we show that a simple machine learning classifier trained using graph-theoretic features alone, or in combination with neural activity features, can accurately predict salt stimulus. Moreover, by focusing on putative causal interactions between neurons, the graph-theoretic features were almost twice as predictive as the neural activity features. These results reveal that stimulus identity modulates the broad, network-level organization of the nervous system, and that graph theory can be used to characterize these changes.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Repeated measures ASCA+ for analysis of longitudinal intervention studies with multivariate outcome data</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Torfinn S. Madssen, Guro F. Giskeødegård, Age K. Smilde, Johan A. Westerhuis</p>

Longitudinal intervention studies with repeated measurements over time are an important type of experimental design in biomedical research. Due to the advent of “omics”-sciences (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics), longitudinal studies generate increasingly multivariate outcome data. Analysis of such data must take both the longitudinal intervention structure and multivariate nature of the data into account. The ASCA+-framework combines general linear models with principal component analysis and can be used to separate and visualize the multivariate effect of different experimental factors. However, this methodology has not yet been developed for the more complex designs often found in longitudinal intervention studies, which may be unbalanced, involve randomized interventions, and have substantial missing data. Here we describe a new methodology, repeated measures ASCA+ (RM-ASCA+), and show how it can be used to model metabolic changes over time, and compare metabolic changes between groups, in both randomized and non-randomized intervention studies. Tools for both visualization and model validation are discussed. This approach can facilitate easier interpretation of data from longitudinal clinical trials with multivariate outcomes.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Neurocomputational mechanism of controllability inference under a multi-agent setting</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jaejoong Kim, Sang Wan Lee, Seokho Yoon, Haeorm Park, Bumseok Jeong</p>

Controllability perception significantly influences motivated behavior and emotion and requires an estimation of one’s influence on an environment. Previous studies have shown that an agent can infer controllability by observing contingency between one’s own action and outcome if there are no other outcome-relevant agents in an environment. However, if there are multiple agents who can influence the outcome, estimation of one’s genuine controllability requires exclusion of other agents’ possible influence. Here, we first investigated a computational and neural mechanism of controllability inference in a multi-agent setting. Our novel multi-agent Bayesian controllability inference model showed that other people’s action-outcome contingency information is integrated with one’s own action-outcome contingency to infer controllability, which can be explained as a Bayesian inference. Model-based functional MRI analyses showed that multi-agent Bayesian controllability inference recruits the temporoparietal junction (TPJ) and striatum. Then, this inferred controllability information was leveraged to increase motivated behavior in the vmPFC. These results generalize the previously known role of the striatum and vmPFC in single-agent controllability to multi-agent controllability, and this generalized role requires the TPJ in addition to the striatum of single-agent controllability to integrate both self- and other-related information. Finally, we identified an innate positive bias toward the self during the multi-agent controllability inference, which facilitated behavioral adaptation under volatile controllability. Furthermore, low positive bias and high negative bias were associated with increased daily feelings of guilt. Our results provide a mechanism of how our sense of controllability fluctuates due to other people in our lives, which might be related to social learned helplessness and depression.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Approximate distance correlation for selecting highly interrelated genes across datasets</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Qunlun Shen, Shihua Zhang</p>

With the rapid accumulation of biological omics datasets, decoding the underlying relationships of cross-dataset genes becomes an important issue. Previous studies have attempted to identify differentially expressed genes across datasets. However, it is hard for them to detect interrelated ones. Moreover, existing correlation-based algorithms can only measure the relationship between genes within a single dataset or two multi-modal datasets from the same samples. It is still unclear how to quantify the strength of association of the same gene across two biological datasets with different samples. To this end, we propose Approximate Distance Correlation (ADC) to select interrelated genes with statistical significance across two different biological datasets. ADC first obtains the <i>k</i> most correlated genes for each target gene as its approximate observations, and then calculates the distance correlation (DC) for the target gene across two datasets. ADC repeats this process for all genes and then performs the Benjamini-Hochberg adjustment to control the false discovery rate. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ADC with simulation data and four real applications to select highly interrelated genes across two datasets. These four applications including 21 cancer RNA-seq datasets of different tissues; six single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) datasets of mouse hematopoietic cells across six different cell types along the hematopoietic cell lineage; five scRNA-seq datasets of pancreatic islet cells across five different technologies; coupled single-cell ATAC-seq (scATAC-seq) and scRNA-seq data of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Extensive results demonstrate that ADC is a powerful tool to uncover interrelated genes with strong biological implications and is scalable to large-scale datasets. Moreover, the number of such genes can serve as a metric to measure the similarity between two datasets, which could characterize the relative difference of diverse cell types and technologies.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Identifying prognostic pairwise relationships among bacterial species in microbiome studies</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Sean M. Devlin, Axel Martin, Irina Ostrovnaya</p>

In recent literature, the human microbiome has been shown to have a major influence on human health. To investigate this impact, scientists study the composition and abundance of bacterial species, commonly using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, among patients with and without a disease or condition. Methods for such investigations to date have focused on the association between individual bacterium and an outcome, and higher-order pairwise relationships or interactions among bacteria are often avoided due to the substantial increase in dimension and the potential for spurious correlations. However, overlooking such relationships ignores the environment of the microbiome, where there is dynamic cooperation and competition among bacteria. We present a method for identifying and ranking pairs of bacteria that have a differential dichotomized relationship across outcomes. Our approach, implemented in an R package PairSeek, uses the stability selection framework with data-driven dichotomized forms of the pairwise relationships. We illustrate the properties of the proposed method using a published oral cancer data set and a simulation study.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Evolution of phenotypic fluctuation under host-parasite interactions</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Naoto Nishiura, Kunihiko Kaneko</p>

Robustness and plasticity are essential features that allow biological systems to cope with complex and variable environments. In a constant environment, robustness, i.e., insensitivity of phenotypes, is expected to increase, whereas plasticity, i.e., the changeability of phenotypes, tends to diminish. Under a variable environment, existence of plasticity will be relevant. The robustness and plasticity, on the other hand, are related to phenotypic variances. As phenotypic variances decrease with the increase in robustness to perturbations, they are expected to decrease through the evolution. However, in nature, phenotypic fluctuation is preserved to a certain degree. One possible cause for this is environmental variation, where one of the most important “environmental” factors will be inter-species interactions. As a first step toward investigating phenotypic fluctuation in response to an inter-species interaction, we present the study of a simple two-species system that comprises hosts and parasites. Hosts are expected to evolve to achieve a phenotype that optimizes fitness. Then, the robustness of the corresponding phenotype will be increased by reducing phenotypic fluctuations. Conversely, plasticity tends to evolve to avoid certain phenotypes that are attacked by parasites. By using a dynamic model of gene expression for the host, we investigate the evolution of the genotype-phenotype map and of phenotypic variances. If the host–parasite interaction is weak, the fittest phenotype of the host evolves to reduce phenotypic variances. In contrast, if there exists a sufficient degree of interaction, the phenotypic variances of hosts increase to escape parasite attacks. For the latter case, we found two strategies: if the noise in the stochastic gene expression is below a certain threshold, the phenotypic variance increases via genetic diversification, whereas above this threshold, it is increased mediated by noise-induced phenotypic fluctuation. We examine how the increase in the phenotypic variances caused by parasite interactions influences the growth rate of a single host, and observed a trade-off between the two. Our results help elucidate the roles played by noise and genetic mutations in the evolution of phenotypic fluctuation and robustness in response to host–parasite interactions.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Diversity, taxonomy, and evolution of archaeal viruses of the class Caudoviricetes</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Ying Liu, Tatiana A. Demina, Simon Roux, Pakorn Aiewsakun, Darius Kazlauskas, Peter Simmonds, David Prangishvili, Hanna M. Oksanen, Mart Krupovic</p>

The archaeal tailed viruses (arTV), evolutionarily related to tailed double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) bacteriophages of the class Caudoviricetes, represent the most common isolates infecting halophilic archaea. Only a handful of these viruses have been genomically characterized, limiting our appreciation of their ecological impacts and evolution. Here, we present 37 new genomes of haloarchaeal tailed virus isolates, more than doubling the current number of sequenced arTVs. Analysis of all 63 available complete genomes of arTVs, which we propose to classify into 14 new families and 3 orders, suggests ancient divergence of archaeal and bacterial tailed viruses and points to an extensive sharing of genes involved in DNA metabolism and counter defense mechanisms, illuminating common strategies of virus–host interactions with tailed bacteriophages. Coupling of the comparative genomics with the host range analysis on a broad panel of haloarchaeal species uncovered 4 distinct groups of viral tail fiber adhesins controlling the host range expansion. The survey of metagenomes using viral hallmark genes suggests that the global architecture of the arTV community is shaped through recurrent transfers between different biomes, including hypersaline, marine, and anoxic environments.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Exploring bacterial diversity via a curated and searchable snapshot of archived DNA sequences</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Grace A. Blackwell, Martin Hunt, Kerri M. Malone, Leandro Lima, Gal Horesh, Blaise T. F. Alako, Nicholas R. Thomson, Zamin Iqbal</p>

The open sharing of genomic data provides an incredibly rich resource for the study of bacterial evolution and function and even anthropogenic activities such as the widespread use of antimicrobials. However, these data consist of genomes assembled with different tools and levels of quality checking, and of large volumes of completely unprocessed raw sequence data. In both cases, considerable computational effort is required before biological questions can be addressed. Here, we assembled and characterised 661,405 bacterial genomes retrieved from the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) in November of 2018 using a uniform standardised approach. Of these, 311,006 did not previously have an assembly. We produced a searchable COmpact Bit-sliced Signature (COBS) index, facilitating the easy interrogation of the entire dataset for a specific sequence (e.g., gene, mutation, or plasmid). Additional MinHash and pp-sketch indices support genome-wide comparisons and estimations of genomic distance. Combined, this resource will allow data to be easily subset and searched, phylogenetic relationships between genomes to be quickly elucidated, and hypotheses rapidly generated and tested. We believe that this combination of uniform processing and variety of search/filter functionalities will make this a resource of very wide utility. In terms of diversity within the data, a breakdown of the 639,981 high-quality genomes emphasised the uneven species composition of the ENA/public databases, with just 20 of the total 2,336 species making up 90% of the genomes. The overrepresented species tend to be acute/common human pathogens, aligning with research priorities at different levels from individual interests to funding bodies and national and global public health agencies.

                Background - Data analytics can support the external auditors’ judgements. However, little is known about the external auditors’ data analytics competency. Likewise, role of religiosity in enhancing the external auditors’ performance is also inadequately investigated. This study examined: 1) the effects of data analytics competency on the external auditors’ performance, and 2) the moderating effects of religiosity on data analytics competency and external auditors’ performance relationship. Methods – Survey was conducted on 201 external auditors. Data analytics competency dimensions, namely, personal capabilities, professional expertise, technical skills, technologies and tools expertise were examined. Religiosity was measured by level and dimension (faith, virtue and optional). Results – Data analytics competency (personal capabilities) has a positive significant effect on the Muslim external auditors’ performance. However, data analytics competency does not affect the performance of non-Muslim external auditors. Level of religiosity has significant moderating effect on the relationship between data analytics competency (technologies and tools expertise) and Muslim external auditors’ performance. Nonetheless, level of religiosity does not moderate the relationship between data analytics competency and the performance of non-Muslim external auditors. Religiosity (virtue) has significant moderating effect on the relationship between data analytics competency (personal capabilities) and Muslim external auditors’ performance. Meanwhile, religiosity (faith) has significant moderating effect on the relationship between data analytics competency (technologies and tools expertise) and non-Muslim external auditors’ performance. Conclusion – This study demonstrates that data analytics competency and religiosity can influence the external auditors’ performance.

                The prevalence of Herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV2) is increasing at an alarming rate in the world. Most of the HSV2 cases are not diagnosed properly, although a range of molecular and serological diagnoses exist. Herein, we have reported a very rapid detection method specific for HSV2 using real-time PCR. The primers specific for HSV2 were designed using the Primer-BLAST tool and 120 base pairs of the polymerase gene were amplified using real-time PCR with SYBR Green dye. The designed primer pair was found highly efficient in detecting only HSV2 DNA, but not HSV1. The threshold cycle (Ct) value for HSV2 reactions by designed primers was found to be an average of 22.55 for a standard copy number of viral DNA that may denote the efficiency of the primers. The melting temperature (Tm) of the amplicon using designed primers (82.60C) was also higher than that using reference primers (about 780C), indicating the high GC content of the amplified template. The designed primer pair will help clinicians to detect the HSV2 DNA specifically and diagnose the associated disease rapidly.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">KnowMore: an automated knowledge discovery tool for the FAIR SPARC datasets [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: This manuscript provides the methods and outcomes of KnowMore, the Grand Prize winning automated knowledge discovery tool developed by our team during the 2021 NIH SPARC FAIR Data Codeathon. The National Institutes of Health Stimulating Peripheral Activity to Relieve Conditions (NIH SPARC) program generates rich datasets from neuromodulation researches, curated according to the Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) SPARC data standards. Currently, the process of simultaneously comparing and analyzing multiple SPARC datasets is tedious because it requires investigating each dataset of interest individually and downloading all of them to conduct cross-analyses. It is crucial to enhance this process to enable rapid discoveries across SPARC datasets. Methods: To fill this need, we created KnowMore, a tool integrated into the SPARC Portal that only requires the user to select their datasets of interest to launch an automated discovery process. KnowMore uses several SPARC resources (Pennsieve, o²S²PARC, SciCrunch, protocols.io, Biolucida), data science methods, and machine learning algorithms in the back end to generate various visualizations in the front end intended to help the user identify potential similarities, differences, and relations across the datasets. These visualizations can lead to a new discovery, new hypothesis, or simply guide the user to the next logical step in their discovery process. Results: The outcome of this project is a SPARC portal-ready code architecture that helps researchers to use SPARC datasets more efficiently and fully leverages their FAIR characteristics. The tool has been built and documented such that more data analysis methods and visualization items could be easily added. Conclusions: The potential for automated discoveries from SPARC datasets is huge given the unique SPARC data ecosystem promoting FAIR data practices, and KnowMore has only demonstrated a small highlight of what could be achieved to speed up discoveries from SPARC datasets.

     alt="Morphology of P2X3-immunoreactive basket-like afferent nerve endings surrounding serosal ganglia and close relationship with vesicular nucleotide transporter-immunoreactive nerve fibers in the rat gastric antrum"/>
<p>We discovered P2X3-immunoreactive basket-like nerve endings surrounding serosal ganglia in the rat antral lesser curvature by immunohistochemistry of whole-mount preparations with confocal scanning laser microscopy. The nerve endings were derived from large web-like structures of vagal subserosal mechanoreceptors, and wrapped around the whole serosal ganglia with pleomorphic terminal structures. The nerve endings may be specialized ending structures of vagal mechanoreceptors to increase the sensitivity during antral peristalsis.
</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>We previously reported P2X3 purinoceptor (P2X3)-expressing vagal afferent nerve endings with large web-like structures in the subserosal tissue of the antral lesser curvature, suggesting that these nerve endings were one of the vagal mechanoreceptors. The present study investigated the morphological relationship between P2X3-immunoreactive nerve endings and serosal ganglia in the rat gastric antrum by immunohistochemistry of whole-mount preparations using confocal scanning laser microscopy. P2X3-immunoreactive basket-like subserosal nerve endings with new morphology were distributed laterally to the gastric sling muscles in the distal antrum of the lesser curvature. Parent axons ramified into numerous nerve fibers with pleomorphic flattened structures to form basket-like nerve endings, and the parent axons were originated from large net-like structures of vagal afferent nerve endings. Basket-like nerve endings wrapped around the whole serosal ganglia, which were characterized by neurofilament 200 kDa-immunoreactive neurons with or without neuronal nitric oxide synthase immunoreactivity and S100B-immunoreactive glial cells. Furthermore, basket-like nerve endings were localized in close apposition to dopamine beta-hydroxylase-immunoreactive sympathetic nerve fibers immunoreactive for vesicular nucleotide transporter. These results suggest that P2X3-immunoreactive basket-like nerve endings associated with serosal ganglia are the specialized ending structures of vagal subserosal mechanoreceptors in order to increase the sensitivity during antral peristalsis, and are activated by ATP from sympathetic nerve fibers and/or serosal ganglia for the regulation of mechanoreceptor function.</p>

<p><i>Cataglyphis</i> desert ants show impressive navigation capabilities during foraging. The reproductive caste faces other orientation challenges. Here, we compare brain structures involved in spatial orientation of <i>Cataglyphis nodus</i> males (♂), gynes (♀), and foragers (☿) by quantifying relative neuropil volumes, synaptic architecture, and numbers and volumes of antennal lobe olfactory glomeruli. Adaptations at both the neuropil and synaptic levels clearly reflect differences in sex-specific and caste-specific demands for sensory processing and behavioral plasticity underlying spatial orientation.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p><i>Cataglyphis</i> desert ants are charismatic central place foragers. After long-ranging foraging trips, individual workers navigate back to their nest relying mostly on visual cues. The reproductive caste faces other orientation challenges, i.e. mate finding and colony foundation. Here we compare brain structures involved in spatial orientation of <i>Cataglyphis nodus</i> males, gynes, and foragers by quantifying relative neuropil volumes associated with two visual pathways, and numbers and volumes of antennal lobe (AL) olfactory glomeruli. Furthermore, we determined absolute numbers of synaptic complexes in visual and olfactory regions of the mushroom bodies (MB) and a major relay station of the sky-compass pathway to the central complex (CX). Both female castes possess enlarged brain centers for sensory integration, learning, and memory, reflected in voluminous MBs containing about twice the numbers of synaptic complexes compared with males. Overall, male brains are smaller compared with both female castes, but the relative volumes of the optic lobes and CX are enlarged indicating the importance of visual guidance during innate behaviors. Male ALs contain greatly enlarged glomeruli, presumably involved in sex-pheromone detection. Adaptations at both the neuropil and synaptic levels clearly reflect differences in sex-specific and caste-specific demands for sensory processing and behavioral plasticity underlying spatial orientation.</p>

<p>The authors reconstructed 26 single lumbar spinocerebellar axons in mice and mapped axon terminals with zebrin pattern of the cerebellar cortex. The lumbar spinocerebellar axons showed high variations in the pathway patterns (contralateral vs. ipsilateral, dorsal vs. ventral in the spinal cord, medullary vs. pontine in the cerebellar entry), branching, and termination (mainly in cerebellar lobules II, III–V, VIII–IXa–b, cerebellar nuclei, CN, nucleus X, NX, lateral reticular nucleus, LRN). The axons were classified into three major groups (magenta, orange, and green), confirming the conventional main types of the lumbar spinocerebellar projections to an extent. However, the results also indicated highly heterogeneous axonal populations beyond these groups.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Among the spinocerebellar projections vital for sensorimotor coordination of limbs and the trunk, the morphology of spinocerebellar axons originating from the lumbar cord has not been well characterized compared to those from thoracic and sacral cords. We reconstructed 26 single spinocerebellar axons labeled by biotinylated dextran injections into the gray matter of the lumbar spinal cord in mice. Axon terminals were mapped with the zebrin pattern of the cerebellar cortex. Reconstructed axons were primarily classified into ipsilaterally and contralaterally ascending axons, arising mainly from the dorsal and ventral horns, respectively. The majority of ipsilateral and contralateral axons took the dorsal-medullary and ventral-pontine pathways, respectively. The axons of both groups terminated mainly in the vermal and medial paravermal areas of lobules II–V and VIII–IXa, often bilaterally but predominantly ipsilateral to the axonal origin, with a weak preference to particular portions of zebrin stripes. The ipsilateral axons originating from the medial dorsal horn in the upper lumbar cord (<i>n</i> = 3) had abundant (43–147) mossy fiber terminals and no medullary collaterals. The ipsilateral axons originating from the lateral dorsal horn in the lower lumbar cord (<i>n</i> = 9) and the contralateral axons (<i>n</i> = 14) showed remarkable morphology variations. The number of their mossy fiber terminals varied from 2 to 172. Their collaterals, observed in 17 axons out of 23, terminated mainly in the medial cerebellar nucleus, nucleus X, and lateral reticular nucleus in various degrees. The results indicated that the lumbar spinocerebellar projection contains highly heterogeneous axonal populations regarding their pathway, branching, and termination patterns.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p><i>Proa valdearinnoensis</i> is a relatively large-headed and stocky iguanodontian dinosaur from the latest Early Cretaceous of Spain. Its braincase is known from three specimens. Similar to that of other dinosaurs, it shows a mosaic ossification pattern in which most of the bones seem to have fused together indistinguishably while a few (frontoparietal, basioccipital) might have remained loosely attached. The endocasts of the three specimens are described based on CT data and digital reconstructions. They show unmistakable morphological similarities with the endocast of closely related taxa, such as <i>Sirindhorna khoratensis</i> (which is close in age but from Thailand). This supports a high conservatism of the endocranial cavity. The issue of volumetric correspondence between endocranial cavity and brain in dinosaurs is analyzed. Although a brain-to-endocranial cavity (BEC) index of 0.50 has been traditionally used, we employ instead 0.73. This is indeed the mid-value between the situation in adults of <i>Alligator mississippiensis</i> and <i>Gallus gallus</i>, which are members of the extant bracketing taxa of dinosaurs (Crocodilia and Aves). We thence gauge the level of encephalization of <i>P. valdearinnoensis</i> through the calculation of the encephalization quotient (EQ), which remains valuable as a metric for assessing the degree of cognitive function in extinct taxa, especially those with fully ossified braincases like dinosaurs and other archosaurs. The EQ obtained for <i>P. valdearinnoensis</i> (3.611) suggests that this species was significantly more encephalized than most if not all extant nonavian, nonmammalian amniotes. Our work adds to the growing body of data concerning theoretical cognitive capabilities in dinosaurs and supports the idea that an increasing encephalization was fostered not only in theropods but also in parallel in the shorter-lived lineage of ornithopods. <i>P. valdearinnoensis</i> was ill-equipped to respond to theropod dinosaurs and possibly lived in groups as a strategy to mitigate the risk of being predated upon. We hypothesize that group-living and protracted caring of juveniles in this and possibly many other iguanodontian ornithopods favored a degree of encephalization that was outstanding by reptile standards.</p>

     alt="A schizophrenia risk factor induces marked anatomical deficits at GABAergic-dopaminergic synapses in the rat ventral tegmental area: Essential evidence for new targeted therapies"/>
<p><i>Hypothesis</i>: Synaptic changes occur within a midbrain GABA-dopamine circuit of male rat offspring exposed to maternal immune activation (MIA), a schizophrenia risk factor. <i>Outcomes</i>: In the offspring of MIA dams, markedly smaller inhibitory synapses were observed for non-triadic (classic) and newly discovered triadic synapses. These changes could contribute to well-documented striatal hyperdopaminergia. The findings provide a new therapeutic target.

<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>To develop new therapies for schizophrenia, evidence accumulated over decades highlights the essential need to investigate the GABAergic synapses that presynaptically influence midbrain dopaminergic neurons. Since current technology restricts these studies to animals, and evidence accumulated in recent decades indicates a developmental origin of schizophrenia, we investigated synaptic changes in male rat offspring exposed to maternal immune activation (MIA), a schizophrenia risk factor. Using a novel combination of lentiviruses, peroxidase-immunogold double labeling, three-dimensional serial section transmission electron microscopy and stereology, we observed clear anatomical alterations in synaptic inputs on dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain posterior ventral tegmental area (pVTA). These changes relate directly to a characteristic feature of schizophrenia: increased dopamine release. In 3-month-old and 14-month-old MIA rats, we found a marked decrease in the volume of presynaptic GABAergic terminals from the rostromedial tegmental nucleus (RMTg) and in the length of the synapses they made, when innervating pVTA dopaminergic neurons. In MIA rats in the long-term, we also discovered a decrease in the volume of the postsynaptic density (PSD) and in the maximum thickness of the PSD at the same synapses. These marked deficits were evident in conventional GABA-dopamine synapses and in synaptic triads that we discovered involving asymmetric synapses that innervated RMTg GABAergic presynaptic terminals, which in turn innervated pVTA dopaminergic neurons. In triads, the PSD thickness of asymmetric synapses was significantly decreased in MIA rats in the long-term cohort. The extensive anatomical deficits provide a potential basis for new therapies targeted at synaptic inputs on midbrain pVTA dopaminergic neurons, in contrast to current striatum-targeted antipsychotic drugs.</p>

     alt="Identification and characterization of rostral ventromedial medulla neurons synaptically connected to the urinary bladder afferents in female rats with or without neonatal cystitis"/>
<p>Talluri et al identified and characterized rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM) neurons that are synaptically linked to the bladder and the colon and studied the effect of early life bladder inflammation on molecular expressions of these neurons. They demonstrated alterations of synaptic connectivity and GABAergic/serotonergic expressions in bladder-related RVM neurons in rats with neonatal cystitis.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The neurons in the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM) play a major role in pain modulation. We have previously shown that early-life noxious bladder stimuli in rats resulted in an overall spinal GABAergic disinhibition and a long-lasting bladder/colon sensitization when tested in adulthood. However, the neuromolecular alterations within RVM neurons in the pathophysiology of early life bladder inflammation have not been elucidated. In this study, we have identified and characterized RVM neurons that are synaptically linked to the bladder and colon and examined the effect of neonatal bladder inflammation on molecular expressions of these neurons. A transient bladder inflammation was induced by intravesicular instillation of protamine sulfate and zymosan during postnatal days 14 through 16 (P14–16) followed by pseudorabies virus PRV-152 and PRV-614 injections into the bladder and colon, respectively, on postnatal day P60. Tissues were examined 96 h postinoculation for serotonergic, GABAergic, and enkephalinergic expressions using in situ hybridization and/or immunohistochemistry techniques. The results revealed that &gt; 50% of RVM neurons that are synaptically connected to the bladder (i.e., PRV-152+) were GABAergic, 40% enkephalinergic, and about 14% expressing serotonergic marker tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (TpH2). Neonatal cystitis resulted in a significant increase in converging neurons in RVM receiving dual synaptic inputs from the bladder and colon. In addition, neonatal cystitis significantly downregulated vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT) with a concomitant increase in TpH2 expression in bladder-linked RVM neurons, suggesting an alteration in supraspinal signaling. These alterations of synaptic connectivity and GABAergic/serotonergic expressions in RVM neurons may contribute to bladder pain modulation and cross-organ visceral sensitivity.</p>

                Payapilly, Guilbert et al. identify TIAM1, a selective activator of the small GTPase RAC1, as a gene product upregulated in neuroendocrine SCLC cells. They show that depletion of TIAM1 or RAC1 inhibition leads to SCLC cell apoptosis through cytoplasmic translocation of the orphan nuclear receptor Nur77 and pro-apoptotic BCL2 conformational change.

                Carter et al. show that mice lacking the mitochondrial sulfide oxidation pathway enzyme TST have high systemic sulfide levels that invoke an alternative hepatic sulfide disposal strategy. Consequently, hepatic metabolism is dominantly skewed toward a diabetogenic profile despite peripheral insulin sensitization. This has implications for sulfide donor therapeutic agents.

                Yang et al. find that the mechanical force exerted by a bolus passing across the fly pharynx is detected by multisensory neurons and is relayed, together with gustatory information, to IN1 neurons in the brain. This circuit activates MIP neuropeptidergic neurons to control feeding.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/inpress.rss">Contribution of autophagy machinery factors to HCV and SARS-CoV-2 replication organelle formation</a></h4>

              
                Twu et al. investigate involvement of autophagy machinery components in HCV and SARS-CoV-2 replication. Conventional macroautophagy is dispensable for replication of either virus. However, factors involved in autophagosome biogenesis, including components of class III PI3-kinase complex, contribute to viral replication. Most likely they promote membranous replication organelle formation.

                <p>Nature Communications, Published online: 09 November 2021; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-26785-9">doi:10.1038/s41467-021-26785-9</a></p>The most common oxidation state for lanthanides is +3. Here the authors use photoelectron spectroscopy and theoretical calculations to study half-sandwich complexes where a lanthanide center in the oxidation state +1 is bound to an aromatic wheel-like B82- ligand.

                <p>Nature Communications, Published online: 09 November 2021; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-26809-4">doi:10.1038/s41467-021-26809-4</a></p>In this study, Delaune et al., isolate and characterise a SARS-CoV-2-related coronavirus from two bats sampled in Cambodia. Their findings suggest that the geographic distribution of SARS-CoV-2-related viruses is wider than previously reported.

                <p>Nature Communications, Published online: 09 November 2021; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-26592-2">doi:10.1038/s41467-021-26592-2</a></p>Adaptation to heat stress through the use of air conditioners has received increasing attention. Here the authors show that income and humidity adjusted temperature are common determinants for adopting air conditioning, but their relative contribution varies in relation to household characteristics.

                <p>Nature Communications, Published online: 09 November 2021; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-26338-0">doi:10.1038/s41467-021-26338-0</a></p>The role of complex spikes in reinforcement learning is still unclear. Here, the authors show that complex spikes carry multiple context based, cell type specific and learning dependent signals that are independent of changes in any motor kinematics and unlikely to instruct the concurrent simple spike activity during reinforcement learning.

                <p>Nature Communications, Published online: 09 November 2021; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-26816-5">doi:10.1038/s41467-021-26816-5</a></p>Here the authors use nanovesicles, microfluidics and single-molecule methods to observe individual ligand binding events that stimulate activation of CNG ion channels. They find that binding is followed by a conformational change of either independent or weakly cooperative binding domains.
