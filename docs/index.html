              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13438">Adaptive modelling of anti-tau treatments for neurodegenerative disorders based on the Bayesian approach with physics-informed neural networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2504.13438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-beta (A$\beta$) and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) proteins, leading to cognitive decline measured by the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS) score. In this study, we develop and analyze a system of ordinary differential equation models to describe the interactions between A$\beta$, p-tau, and ADAS score, providing a mechanistic understanding of disease progression. To ensure accurate model calibration, we employ Bayesian inference and Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for parameter estimation based on Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative data. The data-driven Bayesian approach enables uncertainty quantification, improving confidence in model predictions, while the PINN framework leverages neural networks to capture complex dynamics directly from data. Furthermore, we implement an optimal control strategy to assess the efficacy of an anti-tau therapeutic intervention aimed at reducing p-tau levels and mitigating cognitive decline. Our data-driven solutions indicate that while optimal drug administration effectively decreases p-tau concentration, its impact on cognitive decline, as reflected in the ADAS score, remains limited. These findings suggest that targeting p-tau alone may not be sufficient for significant cognitive improvement, highlighting the need for multi-target therapeutic strategies. The integration of mechanistic modelling, advanced parameter estimation, and control-based therapeutic optimization provides a comprehensive framework for improving treatment strategies for AD.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13720">The relativity of color perception</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2504.13720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physical colors, i.e. reflected or emitted lights entering the eyes from a visual environment, are converted into perceived colors sensed by humans by neurophysiological mechanisms. These processes involve both three types of photoreceptors, the LMS cones, and spectrally opponent and non-opponent interactions resulting from the activity rates of ganglion and lateral geniculate nucleus cells. Thus, color perception is a phenomenon inherently linked to an experimental environment (the visual scene) and an observing apparatus (the human visual system). This is clearly reminiscent of the conceptual foundation of both relativity and quantum mechanics, where the link is between a physical system and the measuring instruments. The relationship between color perception and relativity was explicitly examined for the first time by the physicist H. Yilmaz in 1962 from an experimental point of view. The main purpose of this contribution is to present a rigorous mathematical model that, by taking into account both trichromacy and color opponency, permits to explain on a purely theoretical basis the relativistic color perception phenomena argued by Yilmaz. Instead of relying directly on relativistic considerations, we base our theory on a quantum interpretation of color perception together with just one assumption, called trichromacy axiom, that summarizes well-established properties of trichromatic color vision within the framework of Jordan algebras. We show how this approach allows us to reconcile trichromacy with Hering's opponency and also to derive the relativistic properties of perceived colors without any additional mathematical or experimental assumption.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13728">Sensitivity analysis enlightens effects of connectivity in a Neural Mass Model under Control-Target mode</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2504.13728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biophysical models of human brain represent the latter as a graph of inter-connected neural regions. Building from the model by Naskar et al. (Network Neuroscience 2021), our motivation was to understand how these brain regions can be connected at neural level to implement some inhibitory control, which calls for inhibitory connectivity rarely considered in such models. In this model, regions are made of inter-connected excitatory and inhibitory pools of neurons, but are long-range connected only via excitatory pools (mutual excitation). We thus extend this model by generalizing connectivity, and we analyse how connectivity affects the behaviour of this model.
  Focusing on the simplest paradigm made of a Control area and a Target area, we explore four typical kinds of connectivity: mutual excitation, Target inhibition by Control, Control inhibition by Target, and mutual inhibition. For this, we build an analytical sensitivity framework, nesting up sensitivities of isolated pools, of isolated regions, and of the full system. We show that inhibitory control can emerge only in Target inhibition by Control and mutual inhibition connectivities.
  We next offer an analysis of how the model sensitivities depends on connectivity structure, depending on a parameter controling the strength of the self-inhibition within Target region. Finally, we illustrate the effect of connectivity structure upon control effectivity in response to an external forcing in the Control area.
  Beyond the case explored here, our methodology to build analytical sensitivities by nesting up levels (pool, region, system) lays the groundwork for expressing nested sensitivities for more complex network configurations, either for this model or any other one.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13379">Radial Basis Function Techniques for Neural Field Models on Surfaces</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2504.13379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a numerical framework for solving neural field equations on surfaces using Radial Basis Function (RBF) interpolation and quadrature. Neural field models describe the evolution of macroscopic brain activity, but modeling studies often overlook the complex geometry of curved cortical domains. Traditional numerical methods, such as finite element or spectral methods, can be computationally expensive and challenging to implement on irregular domains. In contrast, RBF-based methods provide a flexible alternative by offering interpolation and quadrature schemes that efficiently handle arbitrary geometries with high-order accuracy. We first develop an RBF-based interpolatory projection framework for neural field models on general surfaces. Quadrature for both flat and curved domains are derived in detail, ensuring high-order accuracy and stability as they depend on RBF hyperparameters (basis functions, augmenting polynomials, and stencil size). Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate the convergence of our method, highlighting its advantages over traditional approaches in terms of flexibility and accuracy. We conclude with an exposition of numerical simulations of spatiotemporal activity on complex surfaces, illustrating the method's ability to capture complex wave propagation patterns.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13717">Human-aligned Deep Learning: Explainability, Causality, and Biological Inspiration</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2504.13717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work aligns deep learning (DL) with human reasoning capabilities and needs to enable more efficient, interpretable, and robust image classification. We approach this from three perspectives: explainability, causality, and biological vision. Introduction and background open this work before diving into operative chapters. First, we assess neural networks' visualization techniques for medical images and validate an explainable-by-design method for breast mass classification. A comprehensive review at the intersection of XAI and causality follows, where we introduce a general scaffold to organize past and future research, laying the groundwork for our second perspective. In the causality direction, we propose novel modules that exploit feature co-occurrence in medical images, leading to more effective and explainable predictions. We further introduce CROCODILE, a general framework that integrates causal concepts, contrastive learning, feature disentanglement, and prior knowledge to enhance generalization. Lastly, we explore biological vision, examining how humans recognize objects, and propose CoCoReco, a connectivity-inspired network with context-aware attention mechanisms. Overall, our key findings include: (i) simple activation maximization lacks insight for medical imaging DL models; (ii) prototypical-part learning is effective and radiologically aligned; (iii) XAI and causal ML are deeply connected; (iv) weak causal signals can be leveraged without a priori information to improve performance and interpretability; (v) our framework generalizes across medical domains and out-of-distribution data; (vi) incorporating biological circuit motifs improves human-aligned recognition. This work contributes toward human-aligned DL and highlights pathways to bridge the gap between research and clinical adoption, with implications for improved trust, diagnostic accuracy, and safe deployment.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13727">High-dimensional dynamics in low-dimensional networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2504.13727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many networks that arise in nature and applications are effectively low-dimensional in the sense that their connectivity structure is dominated by a few dimensions. It is natural to expect that dynamics on such networks might also be low-dimensional. Indeed, recent results show that low-rank networks produce low-dimensional dynamics whenever the network is isolated from external perturbations or noise. However, networks in nature are rarely isolated. We show that recurrent networks with low-rank structure often produce high-dimensional dynamics in the presence of high-dimensional perturbations. Counter to intuition, dynamics in these networks are \textit{suppressed} in directions that are aligned with the network's low-rank structure, a phenomenon we term "low-rank suppression." Our results clarify important, but counterintuitive relationships between a network's connectivity structure and the structure of the dynamics it generates.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.03540">Complex non-Markovian dynamics and the dual role of astrocytes in Alzheimer's disease development and propagation</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2208.03540v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder nowadays. Amyloid-beta (A$\beta$) and tau proteins are among the main contributors to the development or propagation of AD. In AD, A$\beta$ proteins clump together to form plaques and disrupt cell functions. On the other hand, the abnormal chemical change in the brain helps to build sticky tau tangles that block the neuron's transport system. Astrocytes generally maintain a healthy balance in the brain by clearing the A$\beta$ plaques (toxic A$\beta$). However, over-activated astrocytes release chemokines and cytokines in the presence of A$\beta$ and react to pro-inflammatory cytokines, further increasing the production of A$\beta$. In this paper, we construct a mathematical model that can capture astrocytes' dual behaviour. Furthermore, we reveal that the disease propagation depends on the current time instance and the disease's earlier status, called the ``memory effect''. We consider a fractional order network mathematical model to capture the influence of such memory effect on AD propagation. We have integrated brain connectome data into the model and studied the memory effect, the dual role of astrocytes, and the brain's neuronal damage. Based on the pathology, primary, secondary, and mixed tauopathies parameters are considered in the model. Due to the mixed tauopathy, different brain nodes or regions in the brain connectome accumulate different toxic concentrations of A$\beta$ and tau proteins. Finally, we explain how the memory effect can slow down the propagation of such toxic proteins in the brain, decreasing the rate of neuronal damage.

Abstract: Setting up a psychedelic study can be a long, arduous, and kafkaesque process. This rapidly-developing field poses several unique challenges for researchers, necessitating a range of considerations that have not yet been standardised. Many of the complexities inherent to psychedelic research also challenge existing assumptions around, for example, approaches to psychiatric prescribing, the conceptual framing of the placebo effect, and definitions of selfhood. This review paper brings together several of the major psychedelic research teams across the United Kingdom to formalise these unique considerations, identify continuing areas of debate, and provide a practical, experience-based guide, with recommendations for policymakers and future researchers intending to set up a psychedelic research study or clinical trial. We approach this such that the paper can either be read end to end, or treated as a manual: readers can dip into relevant sections as needed.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13541">SwitchMT: An Adaptive Context Switching Methodology for Scalable Multi-Task Learning in Intelligent Autonomous Agents</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2504.13541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to train intelligent autonomous agents (such as mobile robots) on multiple tasks is crucial for adapting to dynamic real-world environments. However, state-of-the-art reinforcement learning (RL) methods only excel in single-task settings, and still struggle to generalize across multiple tasks due to task interference. Moreover, real-world environments also demand the agents to have data stream processing capabilities. Toward this, a state-of-the-art work employs Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) to improve multi-task learning by exploiting temporal information in data stream, while enabling lowpower/energy event-based operations. However, it relies on fixed context/task-switching intervals during its training, hence limiting the scalability and effectiveness of multi-task learning. To address these limitations, we propose SwitchMT, a novel adaptive task-switching methodology for RL-based multi-task learning in autonomous agents. Specifically, SwitchMT employs the following key ideas: (1) a Deep Spiking Q-Network with active dendrites and dueling structure, that utilizes task-specific context signals to create specialized sub-networks; and (2) an adaptive task-switching policy that leverages both rewards and internal dynamics of the network parameters. Experimental results demonstrate that SwitchMT achieves superior performance in multi-task learning compared to state-of-the-art methods. It achieves competitive scores in multiple Atari games (i.e., Pong: -8.8, Breakout: 5.6, and Enduro: 355.2) compared to the state-of-the-art, showing its better generalized learning capability. These results highlight the effectiveness of our SwitchMT methodology in addressing task interference while enabling multi-task learning automation through adaptive task switching, thereby paving the way for more efficient generalist agents with scalable multi-task learning capabilities.

                arXiv:2504.13778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the field of hardware neural networks has been actively developing, where neurons and their connections are not simulated on a computer but are implemented at the physical level, transforming the neural network into a tangible device. In this paper, we investigate how internal noise during the training of neural networks affects the final performance of recurrent and deep neural networks. We consider feedforward networks (FNN) and echo state networks (ESN) as examples. The types of noise examined originated from a real optical implementation of a neural network. However, these types were subsequently generalized to enhance the applicability of our findings on a broader scale. The noise types considered include additive and multiplicative noise, which depend on how noise influences each individual neuron, and correlated and uncorrelated noise, which pertains to the impact of noise on groups of neurons (such as the hidden layer of FNNs or the reservoir of ESNs). In this paper, we demonstrate that, in most cases, both deep and echo state networks benefit from internal noise during training, as it enhances their resilience to noise. Consequently, the testing performance at the same noise intensities is significantly higher for networks trained with noise than for those trained without it. Notably, only multiplicative correlated noise during training has minimal has almost no impact on both deep and recurrent networks.

                arXiv:2504.13355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measurements acquired from distributed physical systems are often sparse and noisy. Therefore, signal processing and system identification tools are required to mitigate noise effects and reconstruct unobserved dynamics from limited sensor data. However, this process is particularly challenging because the fundamental equations governing the dynamics are largely unavailable in practice. Reservoir Computing (RC) techniques have shown promise in efficiently simulating dynamical systems through an unstructured and efficient computation graph comprising a set of neurons with random connectivity. However, the potential of RC to operate in noisy regimes and distinguish noise from the primary dynamics of the system has not been fully explored. This paper presents a novel RC method for noise filtering and reconstructing nonlinear dynamics, offering a novel learning protocol associated with hyperparameter optimization. The performance of the RC in terms of noise intensity, noise frequency content, and drastic shifts in dynamical parameters are studied in two illustrative examples involving the nonlinear dynamics of the Lorenz attractor and adaptive exponential integrate-and-fire system (AdEx). It is shown that the denoising performance improves via truncating redundant nodes and edges of the computing reservoir, as well as properly optimizing the hyperparameters, e.g., the leakage rate, the spectral radius, the input connectivity, and the ridge regression parameter. Furthermore, the presented framework shows good generalization behavior when tested for reconstructing unseen attractors from the bifurcation diagram. Compared to the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), the presented RC framework yields competitive accuracy at low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and high-frequency ranges.

                arXiv:2504.13495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This systematic review discusses the methodological approaches and statistical confirmations of cross-cultural adaptations of cognitive evaluation tools used with different populations. The review considers six seminal studies on the methodology of cultural adaptation in Europe, Asia, Africa, and South America. The results indicate that proper adaptations need holistic models with demographic changes, and education explained as much as 26.76% of the variance in MoCA-H scores. Cultural-linguistic factors explained 6.89% of the variance in European adaptations of MoCA-H; however, another study on adapted MMSE and BCSB among Brazilian Indigenous populations reported excellent diagnostic performance, with a sensitivity of 94.4% and specificity of 99.2%. There was 78.5% inter-rater agreement on the evaluation of cultural adaptation using the Manchester Translation Evaluation Checklist. A paramount message of the paper is that community feedback is necessary for culturally appropriate preparation, standardized translation protocols also must be included, along with robust statistical validation methodologies for developing cognitive assessment instruments. This review supplies evidence-based frameworks for the further adaptation of cognitive assessments in increasingly diverse global health settings.

                arXiv:2504.13522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate financial market forecasting requires diverse data sources, including historical price trends, macroeconomic indicators, and financial news, each contributing unique predictive signals. However, existing methods often process these modalities independently or fail to effectively model their interactions. In this paper, we introduce Cross-Modal Temporal Fusion (CMTF), a novel transformer-based framework that integrates heterogeneous financial data to improve predictive accuracy. Our approach employs attention mechanisms to dynamically weight the contribution of different modalities, along with a specialized tensor interpretation module for feature extraction. To facilitate rapid model iteration in industry applications, we incorporate a mature auto-training scheme that streamlines optimization. When applied to real-world financial datasets, CMTF demonstrates improvements over baseline models in forecasting stock price movements and provides a scalable and effective solution for cross-modal integration in financial market prediction.

Abstract: The rapid growth of the internet has made personalized recommendation systems indispensable. Graph-based sequential recommendation systems, powered by Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), effectively capture complex user-item interactions but often face challenges such as noise and static representations. In this paper, we introduce the Adaptive Long-term Embedding with Denoising and Augmentation for Recommendation (ALDA4Rec) method, a novel model that constructs an item-item graph, filters noise through community detection, and enriches user-item interactions. Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) are then employed to learn short-term representations, while averaging, GRUs, and attention mechanisms are utilized to model long-term embeddings. An MLP-based adaptive weighting strategy is further incorporated to dynamically optimize long-term user preferences. Experiments conducted on four real-world datasets demonstrate that ALDA4Rec outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, delivering notable improvements in both accuracy and robustness.

                arXiv:2504.13749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The design of coordination compounds with target properties often requires years of continuous feedback loop between theory, simulations and experiments. In the case of magnetic molecules, this conventional strategy has indeed led to the breakthrough of single-molecule magnets with working temperatures above nitrogen's boiling point, but at significant costs in terms of resources and time. Here, we propose a computational strategy able to accelerate the discovery of new coordination compounds with desired electronic and magnetic properties. Our approach is based on a combination of high-throughput multireference ab initio methods, genetic algorithms and machine learning. While genetic algorithms allow for an intelligent sampling of the vast chemical space available, machine learning reduces the computational cost by pre-screening molecular properties in advance of their accurate and automated multireference ab initio characterization. Importantly, the presented framework is able to generate novel organic ligands and explore chemical motifs beyond those available in pre-existing structural databases. We showcase the power of this approach by automatically generating new Co(II) mononuclear coordination compounds with record magnetic properties in a fraction of the time required by either experiments or brute-force ab initio approaches

                arXiv:2407.00641v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intelligent mobile agents (e.g., UGVs and UAVs) typically demand low power/energy consumption when solving their machine learning (ML)-based tasks, since they are usually powered by portable batteries with limited capacity. A potential solution is employing neuromorphic computing with Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), which leverages event-based computation to enable ultra-low power/energy ML algorithms. To maximize the performance efficiency of SNN inference, the In-Memory Computing (IMC)-based hardware accelerators with emerging device technologies (e.g., RRAM) can be employed. However, SNN models are typically developed without considering constraints from the application and the underlying IMC hardware, thereby hindering SNNs from reaching their full potential in performance and efficiency. To address this, we propose NeuroNAS, a novel framework for developing energyefficient neuromorphic IMC for intelligent mobile agents using hardware-aware spiking neural architecture search (NAS), i.e., by quickly finding an SNN architecture that offers high accuracy under the given constraints (e.g., memory, area, latency, and energy consumption). Its key steps include: optimizing SNN operations to enable efficient NAS, employing quantization to minimize the memory footprint, developing an SNN architecture that facilitates an effective learning, and devising a systematic hardware-aware search algorithm to meet the constraints. Compared to the state-of-the-art techniques, NeuroNAS quickly finds SNN architectures (with 8bit weight precision) that maintain high accuracy by up to 6.6x search time speed-ups, while achieving up to 92% area savings, 1.2x latency improvements, 84% energy savings across different datasets (i.e., CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet-200); while the state-of-the-art fail to meet all constraints at once.

Abstract: Going beyond 'dendritic democracy', we introduce a 'democracy of local processors', termed Cooperator. Here we compare their capabilities when used in permutation invariant neural networks for reinforcement learning (RL), with machine learning algorithms based on Transformers, such as ChatGPT. Transformers are based on the long standing conception of integrate-and-fire 'point' neurons, whereas Cooperator is inspired by recent neurobiological breakthroughs suggesting that the cellular foundations of mental life depend on context-sensitive pyramidal neurons in the neocortex which have two functionally distinct points. Weshow that when used for RL, an algorithm based on Cooperator learns far quicker than that based on Transformer, even while having the same number of parameters.

">Precon_all: A species-agnostic automated pipeline for non-human cortical surface reconstruction</a></h4>

              
                Cortical surface reconstruction has changed how we study brain morphology and geometry. However, extending these methods to non-human species has been limited by the lack of standardized pipelines, anatomical templates, and variability in imaging protocols. To address these challenges, we present Precon_all, an open-source, species-agnostic pipeline that automates cortical surface reconstruction for non-human neuroimaging. It runs reliably across a wide range of anatomical structures and imaging conditions and has been successfully applied to datasets from primates, carnivores, and artiodactyls. Its modular framework mirrors human neuroimaging workflows, supports manual quality control, and produces outputs compatible with FreeSurfer and Connectome Workbench. In doing so, it substantially reduces technical barriers to non-human neuroimaging. As data-sharing initiatives continue to expand access to non-human imaging datasets, Precon_all provides a scalable and standardized solution that supports the broader adoption of surface-based methods for studying cortical evolution through comparative neuroscience.

                Brain tissue microstructure influences the efficient delivery of therapeutics within the brain. Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) enables the depiction of tissue properties in vivo, and thus is potentially relevant for planning convection-enhanced delivery (CED) within the brain. We report on the quantitative assessment of the distribution of a Gadolinium solution infused by CED within the brain of a live ovine model. Infusate distributions were measured at multiple timepoints and compared to microstructural properties as depicted by DTI, thus demonstrating the impact of tissue features and catheter positioning on drug distribution in vivo. This study contributed to the clinical translation of the CED for flow-based therapy to ultimately provide new therapeutic approaches for several brain diseases, by providing essential tools and results used to develop a better prediction model and a delivery platform to reach the therapeutic target more precisely and non-invasively.

                Synaptic neurotransmission is a critical hallmark of brain activity and one of the first processes to be affected in neural diseases. Monitoring this process, and in particular synaptic vesicle recycling, in living cells has been instrumental in unraveling mechanisms responsible for neurotransmitter release. However, currently available reporters suffer from major limitations such large probe size or lack of suitability for human neurons, hampering the understanding of human synaptic pathophysiology. Here we describe the NbLumSyt1 toolkit, a panel of nanobody-based affinity probes targeting the luminal domain of the synaptic vesicle protein Synaptotagmin 1 (Syt1). These new tools enable quantitative, non-invasive imaging and functional interrogation of synaptic transmission in human neurons, with unprecedented precision, versatility and cost efficiency, in technologies ranging from fixed-and live-cell super resolution imaging to electron microscopy and mass spectrometry. Overall, NbLumSyt1 nanobinders provide a valuable platform for human synaptic physiology and pathophysiology, benefiting fundamental neuroscience and translational efforts to study and develop treatments for brain-related disorders.

">Neurologically altered brain activity may not look like aged brain activity: Implications for brain-age modeling and biomarker strategies</a></h4>

              
                Background: Brain-age gap (BAG), the difference between predicted age and chronological age, is studied as a biomarker for the natural progression of neurodegeneration. The BAG captures brain atrophy as measured with structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Electroencephalography (EEG) has also been explored as a functional means for estimating brain age. However, EEG studies showed mixed results for BAG including a seemingly paradoxical negative BAG, i.e. younger predicted age than chronological age, in neurological populations. Objectives: This study critically examined brain age estimation from spectral EEG power as common measure brain activity in two of the largest public EEG datasets containing neurological cases alongside controls. Methods: EEG recordings were analyzed from individuals with neurological conditions (n=900, TUAB data; n=417 MCI & n=311 dementia, CAU data) and controls (n=1254, TUAB data; n=459, CAU data). Results: We found that age-prediction models trained on the reference population systematically under-predicted age in people with neurological conditions replicating a negative BAG for diseased brain activity. Inspection of age-related trends along the EEG power spectra revealed complex frequency-dependent alterations in neurological groups underlying the seemingly paradoxical negative BAG. Conclusions: The utility of brain age as an interpretable biomarker relies on the observation from structural MRI that progressive neurodegeneration often broadly resembles accelerated aging. This assumption can be violated for functional assessments such as EEG spectral power and, potentially, different neurological and psychiatric conditions or therapeutic effects. The sign of the BAG may not meaningfully be interpreted as a deviation from normal aging.

">Real-world objects scaffold visual working memory for features: Increased neural delay activity when colors are remembered as part of meaningful objects</a></h4>

              
                Visual working memory is a core cognitive function that allows active storage of task-relevant visual information. While previous studies have postulated that the capacity of this system is fixed with respect to a single feature dimension, recent research has shown that working memory performance for a simple visual feature - color - is improved when this feature is encoded as part of a real-world object relative to an unrecognizable scrambled shape. Using EEG (N = 24), we here demonstrate that this performance increase is supported by enhanced neural delay activity during the retention period (indexed by the contralateral-delay-activity of the event-related potential), suggesting that the behavioral benefit is linked to the active maintenance process of working memory. Furthermore, using time-resolved neural similarity measures, we show that the neural activity is not only increased during the delay, but also more stable over time when colors are remembered as part of real-world objects. Finally, we report a novel fronto-central event-related potential that distinguishes between real-world objects and scrambled objects during encoding and maintenance processes. Overall, our results demonstrate that active visual working memory capacity for simple features is not fixed but can expand depending on what context these features are encoded in.

">Latent dimensions in neural representations predict choice context effects</a></h4>

              
                Choices are often affected by the context of available alternatives, a phenomenon termed choice context effects. Current models of context effects require options to be described by two explicit numerical attributes. However, decision-makers might represent these options by additional latent attributes. We propose to use participants' neural representations to access the full attribute set they consider and predict context effects without using the explicit numerical attributes. We first estimated the context effects elicited by lotteries using a behavioral sample. Then we recruited two fMRI samples with preregistered design to estimate the neural representations of each lottery without the context of choice. We predicted the context effects using only the similarity in neural representations between the individual lotteries, improving out-of-sample predictions by 14% and explained variance by 20% compared to traditional methods. These neural representations encoded a mixture of explicit and latent attributes, previously inaccessible to researchers using only behavioral methods.

">Identifying discriminative EEG features of Unsuccessful and Successful stopping during the Stop Signal Task</a></h4>

              
                The stop-signal task is often used to study inhibitory control. When combined with electrophysiological recordings, the N2 and P3 event-related potentials (ERPs) are regularly observed. Numerous studies link both amplitude and latency differences of the N2 and P3 to failed versus successful stopping. A slower N2-P3 complex when stopping fails has repeatedly been reported across many studies and found to correlate moderately with behavioral stopping speed. However, most studies rely on averaging across trials, thereby limiting the examination of trial-by-trial dynamics. In the present study, we employed different machine learning-approaches to classify successful from failed stop trials based on time-frequency single-trial EEG data. We also tested whether attenuating the slowing effect would alter classification performance. To preserve interpretability, we first identified five group-level EEG components time-locked to stopping and then used the time-frequency representation as features in different models. Our findings suggest that regularized logistic regression can reliably classify successful from failed stopping with an AUC = 0.72. Correcting for ERP latency differences did not markedly reduce overall classification (i.e., AUC = 0.71), but the model had to compensate by leveraging subtler, broadly distributed time-frequency features. Our feature importance measure indicated that a component closely resembling the N2-P3 complex contributed largely to the classification performance, producing a sparse model. Once the slowing effect was attenuated in the data, the model still retained predictive performance but had to rely on 15 times as many time-frequency features across the five components. Thus, it is likely that multiple overlapping processes unfold during stopping that influence response inhibition in addition to the N2-P3 complex. While the N2-P3 complex is consistently evoked during stopping and carry large discriminative ability, considering additional auxiliary processes might further our understanding into mechanisms underlying response inhibition.

">Whole-brain EEG dynamics depending on the stimulus modality and task requirements in oddball tasks</a></h4>

              
                Electroencephalography (EEG) microstates constitute temporal map configurations that reflect the whole brain electrical state. The dynamics of EEG microstates may serve as an effective discretization method for capturing spatiotemporally continuous neural dynamics with high temporal resolution. In this study, we employed polarity-sensitive microstate analysis to investigate whole-brain state transitions during audiovisual oddball tasks. Moreover, we examined how sensory modality and its coupling, types of response to target stimuli, and the physical presence or absence of target stimuli affected EEG dynamics. The results demonstrated that the abovementioned factors affected both behavioral indices and the event-related potential (ERP) components, particularly the P300. Importantly, when considering the topographical polarity of map configuration, transitions to microstate E-, which originates within 300 to 600 ms after stimulus onset and coincides with the typical latency of the P300 component potentially reflect attentional and conscious processes that are associated with the P300. These novel insights into the dynamic transitions of whole brain states during cognitive processes complement the results of traditional ERP analyses.

">Improved Injury Detection Through Harmonizing Multi-Site Neuroimaging Data after Experimental TBI: A Translational Outcomes Project in NeuroTrauma (TOP-NT) Consortium Study</a></h4>

              
                Multi-site neuroimaging studies have become increasingly common in order to generate larger samples of reproducible data to answer questions associated with smaller effect sizes. The data harmonization model NeuroCombat has been shown to remove site effects introduced by differences in site-related technical variance while maintaining group differences, yet its effect on improving statistical power in pre-clinical models of CNS disease is unclear. The present study examined fractional anisotropy data computed from diffusion weighted imaging data at 3 and 30 days post-controlled cortical impact injury from 184 adult rats across four sites as part of the Translational-Outcome-Project-in-Neurotrauma (TOP-NT) Consortium. Findings confirmed prior clinical reports that NeuroCombat fails to remove site effects in data containing a high proportion-of-outliers (>5%) and skewness, which introduced significant variation in non-outlier sites. After removal of one outlier site and harmonization using a global sham population, harmonization displayed an increase in effect size in data that displayed group level effects (p<0.01) in both univariate and voxel-level volumes of pathology. This was characterized by movement toward similar distributions in voxel measurements (Kolmogorov-Smirnov p<<0.001 to >0.01) and statistical power increases within the ipsilateral cortex. Harmonization improved statistical power and frequency of significant differences in areas with existing group differences, thus improving the ability to detect regions affected by injury rather than by other confounds. These findings indicate the utility of NeuroCombat in reproducible data collection, where biological differences can be accurately revealed to allow for greater reliability in multi-site neuroimaging studies.

">Cocaine-induced immediate-early gene expression in the nucleus accumbens: roles of separate cAMP sensors</a></h4>

              
                Immediate-early gene (IEG) induction after administration of amphetamine or cocaine has been used to trace the signaling pathways that mediate neuronal plasticity required for the short- and long-term behavioral effects of these psychostimulants. We recently reported that a novel cyclic AMP (cAMP)-dependent Rap guanine nucleotide exchange factor-2 (RapGEF2)-ERK signaling pathway is required for Egr-1 induction in D1 medium-spiny neurons (MSNs) of the nucleus accumbens (NAc) after cocaine treatment, and that its deletion from the NAc neurons attenuates cocaine-induced locomotor sensitization and conditioned place preference (CPP). However, the cell type-specific neuronal mechanisms underlying this effect remain unclear. In this study, we used Cre-LoxP technology and a novel Cre-amplifier transgene to generate conditional RapGEF2 knockout mice targeting D1-MSNs and investigated the functional role of RapGEF2 in cocaine reward. Deletion of RapGEF2 in D1-MSNs blocked cocaine-induced ERK phosphorylation (p-ERK) and Egr-1 induction. D1-MSN-specific RapGEF2 deletion did not affect intravenous cocaine self-administration, nor did it affect Fos induction by cocaine, prompting us to examine more closely the role of metabotropic (cAMP-dependent) signaling to IEGs after cocaine administration. We used a battery of D1-MSN-specific genetic interventions targeting cAMP signaling, including Drd1-Cre::Rap1A/Bfl/fl mice, and AAV injection of a Cre-dependent catalytically active phosphodiesterase (PDE4D3-cat) or a Cre-dependent protein kinase A-inhibitor (PKI) in the NAc of Drd1-Cre mice, to explore further the underlying cAMP dependence of IEG induction by acute and chronic cocaine administration, and the cAMP sensors required. Rap1 is reported as a necessary component for both RapGEF2- and PKA-dependent ERK activation, but a requirement for Rap in Fos induction by cocaine has not been examined. Deletion of Rap1A/B in D1-MSNs blocked cocaine-induced p-ERK and Egr-1 expression, but not c-Fos, supporting the idea that the RapGEF2-Rap1-ERK pathway specifically regulates Egr-1, not c-Fos, expression. D1-specific expression of the PDE4D3-cat ablated up-regulation of both Egr-1 and Fos in NAc after cocaine administration, demonstrating that induction of both IEGs requires cAMP elevation in D1-MSNs. Notably, inhibition of PKA activity via AAV-mediated expression of PKI-alpha in D1-MSNs blocked both c-Fos and Egr-1 induction. Thus, acute or chronic cocaine administration activates at least two cAMP-dependent signaling pathways in D1-MSNs: a PKA-Fos pathway and a RapGEF2-ERK-Egr-1 pathway. The finding that PKA also activates the ERK-Egr-1 signaling pathway by convergence on Rap1, and concomitantly activates c-Fos independently of Rap1, may underlie selective effects of metabotropic activation of RapGEF2 and PKA activation by cAMP on cocaine-dependent behaviors in mice.

">Linking neuron-axon-synapse architecture to white matter vasculature using high-resolution multimodal MRI in primate brain</a></h4>

              
                Blood vessels and axons align outside the brain due to shared growth factors. However, this neuron-axon-synapse and vessel relationship within the brain white matter remains unclear, primarily due to the technical challenges of charting the complex trajectories of fiber tracts and the dense network of arteries. Consequently, the organizational logic and neurometabolic factors shaping white matter vasculature remain poorly understood. Here, we address these questions using high-resolution multimodal MRI, in vitro neuron density, and receptor autoradiography in macaque monkeys. In superficial white matter, vascularity exhibited parallel alignment with the cortical surface. This vascularity showed negligible dependence on overlying gray matter neuron density (R2 = 0.01), minimal dependence on white matter myelination (R2 = 0.10), and moderate correlation with receptor density (R2 = 0.27). These suggest an association of vascularity with energy demands and axonal branching. In deep white matter, axon geometry, density, and proximity to the cortical surface predict vascular volume with high precision (R2 = 0.62). Overall, these findings establish a relation between neuron-axon-synapse architecture and white matter vasculature in the primate brain, offering advances in understanding the organization and pathophysiology of white matter.

">Dissociating the functional role of the para-hippocampal and the parietal cortex in human multi-step reinforcement learning</a></h4>

              
                Many real-life decisions involve a tension between short-term and long-term outcomes, which requires forward-looking abilities. In reinforcement learning, this tension arises at the initial stage of multi-step learning and decision tasks, where forward-looking decisions collect smaller immediate rewards but govern the transition to more advantageous second-stage states. Here, we investigated the neural mechanisms underlying such forward-looking decisions in a cohort of healthy participants undergoing fMRI scanning (N=28). Behavioral results confirmed that participants were able to learn concurrently reward values and state-transition probabilities. By contrasting BOLD signal elicited by first-stage versus second-stage at the time of decision, we isolated a brain network, with central nodes in the bilateral parahippocampal cortex (BA37), whose activity correlate with forward-looking choices. BOLD activity in another network, including the bilateral parietal cortex, correlated with structure learning signal at the time of outcome processing. Our results shed new light on the neural bases of model-based reinforcement learning by suggesting a specific role of the parahippocampal cortex in forward planning and the parietal cortex in learning the Markovian structure of the task.

">The crosstalk between the anterior hypothalamus and the locus coeruleus during wakefulness is associated with low frequency oscillations power during sleep</a></h4>

              
                Study Objectives Animal research has demonstrated that sleep regulation heavily depends on a network of subcortical nuclei. In particular, whether the crosstalk between the Locus Coeruleus (LC) and hypothalamic nuclei influences sleep variability and age-related changes in humans remains unexplored. This study investigated whether the effective connectivity between the LC and subparts of the hypothalamus is associated with the electrophysiology of rapid eye movement sleep (REMS). Methods Thirty-three healthy younger (~22y, 27 women) and 18 older (~61y, 14 women) individuals underwent 7-Tesla functional magnetic resonance imaging during wakefulness to investigate the effective connectivity between LC and distinct hypothalamus subparts encompassing several nuclei. Additionally, we recorded their sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) to explore relationships between effective connectivity measures and REMS theta energy and sigma power prior to REMS episodes. Results The effective connectivity analysis revealed robust evidence of a mutual positive influence between the LC and the anterior-superior and posterior hypothalamus, supporting the idea that the connectivity patterns observed in animal models are also present in humans. Furthermore, our results suggest that in older adults, stronger effective connectivity from the anterior-superior hypothalamus, including the preoptic area, to the LC is associated with reduced REM theta energy. Specificity analysis showed that this association was not limited to REM theta energy but also extended to specific lower-frequency bands during REMS and NREMS. Conclusions These findings highlight the complex age-dependent modulation of the LC circuitry and its role in sleep regulation. Understanding these neural interactions offers valuable insight into the mechanisms driving age-related sleep changes.

">Neural oscillations and top-down connectivity are modulated by object-scene congruency</a></h4>

              
                The knowledge we have about how the world is structured is known to influence object recognition. One way this is demonstrated is through a congruency effect, where object recognition is faster and more accurate if items are presented in expected scene contexts. However, our understanding of the dynamic neural mechanisms that underlie congruency effects are under-explored. Using MEG, we examine how the congruency between an object and a prior scene results in changes in the oscillatory activity in the brain, which regions underpin this effect, and whether congruency results arise from top-down or bottom-up modulations of connectivity. We observed that prior scene information impacts the processing of visual objects in behaviour, neural activity and connectivity. Processing objects that were incongruent with the prior scene resulted in slower reaction times, increased low frequency activity in the ventral visual pathway, and increased top-down connectivity from the anterior temporal lobe to the posterior ventral temporal cortex. Our results reveal that the recurrent dynamics within the ventral visual pathway are modulated by the prior knowledge imbued by our surrounding environment, suggesting that the way we recognise objects is fundamentally linked to their context.

">Value coding by primate amygdala neurons complies with economic choice theory</a></h4>

              
                Primate amygdala neurons are implicated in coding the value of choice options for decision-making. However, it remains unclear whether amygdala value signals comply with the notion that decision makers maximize the value of rewards, as formalized by key axioms of economic theory. In particular, the continuity axiom of Expected Utility Theory (EUT) postulates that reward maximization is reflected by a trade-off between reward probability and magnitude. Our experiment tested this trade-off in two male macaque monkeys who subjectively ranked three gambles in choices, thus revealing their subjective value. Axiom compliance was defined by choice indifference between the intermediate gamble and a probabilistic combination of the other two gambles. We found that the animals' choices between safe and gamble options reflected the integration of probability and magnitude into scalar values consistent with the continuity axiom. In a non-choice task, responses of individual amygdala neurons to separate probability and magnitude cues reflected the monkeys' individual preferences: neuronal responses were lower for non-preferred gambles (relative to safe options), higher for preferred gambles and equal at subjective indifference between safe and gamble options. In a choice task, amygdala neurons integrated probability and magnitude into subjective values that reflected individual preferences. In some neurons, value signals transitioned to signals coding the monkey's economic choices and chosen values. These findings identify amygdala neurons as substrates for encoding behavior-matching subjective values according to the continuity axiom of EUT, and for translating these values into economic choices.

">Development of a 24-Channel 3T Phased-Array Coil for fMRI in Awake Monkeys - Mitigating Spatiotemporal Artifacts in Ferumoxytol-Weighted Functional Connectivity Estimation</a></h4>

              
                Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of awake macaque monkeys holds promise for advancing our understanding of primate brain organization, including humans. However, estimating functional connectivity in awake animals is challenging due to the limited duration of imaging sessions and the relatively low sensitivity to neural activity. To overcome these challenges, we developed a 24-channel 3T receive radiofrequency (RF) coil optimized for parallel imaging of awake macaques. This enabled the acquisition of multiband and GRAPPA-accelerated ferumoxytol-weighted resting-state fMRI. The Human Connectome Project-style data processing pipelines were adapted to address the unique preprocessing demands of cerebral blood volume-weighted (CBVw) imaging, including motion correction, functional-to-structural image co-registration, and training a multi-run independent component analysis-based X-noiseifier (ICA-FIX) classifier for removal of structured artifacts. Our CBVw fMRI approach resulted in an elevated contrast-to-noise ratio compared to blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) imaging in anesthetized macaques. However, structured imaging artifacts still contributed more variance to the functional timeseries than neural activity. By applying the ICA-FIX classifier, we achieved highly reproducible parcellated functional connectivity at the single-subject level. At the group-level, we identified dense functional networks with spatial features homologous to those observed in humans. The developed RF receive coil, image acquisition protocols, and data analysis pipelines are publicly available, providing the broader scientific community with tools to leverage these advances for further research.

">Eye movements of younger and older adults decrease during story listening in background noise</a></h4>

              
                Assessments of listening effort are increasingly relevant to understanding the speech-comprehension difficulties experienced by older adults. Pupillometry is the most common tool to assess listening effort but has limitations. Recent research has shown that eye movements decrease when listening is effortful and proposed indicators of eye movements as alternative measures. However, much of the work was conducted in younger adults in trial-based sentence-listening paradigm, during concurrent visual stimulation. The extent to which eye movements index listening effort during continuous speech listening, independently of visual stimuli, and in older adults, is unknown. In the current study, younger and older adults listened to continuous stories with varying degrees of background noise under free and moving-dot viewing conditions. Eye movements decreased (as indexed by fixation duration, gaze dispersion, and saccade rate) with increasing speech masking. The reduction in eye movements did not depend on age group or viewing conditions, indicating that eye movements can be used to assess effects of speech masking in different visual situations and in people of different ages. The pupil area was only sensitive to speech masking early in the experiment. In sum, the current study suggests that eye movements are a potential tool to assess listening effort during continuous speech listening.

">Pathological Mechanisms of Motor Dysfunction in Familial Danish Dementia: Insights from a Knock-In Rat Model</a></h4>

              
                Familial Danish Dementia (FDD) is a rare autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused by a mutation in the integral membrane protein 2B (ITM2b) gene. Clinically, FDD is characterized by cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), cerebellar ataxia, and dementia. Notably, FDD shares several neuropathological features with Alzheimer's disease (AD), including CAA, neuroinflammation, and neurofibrillary tangles. In this study, we investigate the pathological mechanisms linking CAA, white matter damage, and motor dysfunction using a recently developed FDD knock-in (FDD-KI) rat model. This model harbors the Danish mutation in the endogenous rat Itm2b gene, along with an App gene encoding humanized amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}). Our analysis revealed substantial vascular Danish amyloid (ADan) deposition in the cerebellar subpial and leptomeningeal vessels of FDD-KI rats, showing an age-related increase comparable to that observed in human FDD patients. Additionally, vascular A{beta} deposits (A{beta}-CAA) were present in FDD-KI rats, but A{beta}-CAA patterns showed some differences between species. Motor function assessments in FDD-KI rats demonstrated age-accelerated motor deficits and gait abnormalities, mirroring the clinical characteristics of FDD patients. To further explore the mechanisms underlying these deficits, we examined cerebellar pathology and found age-related myelin disruption and axonal fiber loss, consistent with postmortem human FDD pathology. Cerebellar demyelination appeared to be driven by neuroinflammation, marked by increased microglial/macrophage activation in response to vascular amyloid deposition. Additionally, we observed extravascular fibrinogen leakage, indicating widespread vascular permeability in both white and gray matter, with fibrinogen deposits surrounding amyloid-positive vessels in aged FDD-KI rats and postmortem FDD cerebellum. These findings suggest that this FDD-KI rat model is the first animal model to recapitulate key neuropathological features of human FDD patients, including both ADan- and A{beta}-type CAA, neuroinflammation, and white matter lesions - pathologies that may underlie the motor and gait impairments seen in the disease.

                Many techniques to record and manipulate neuronal activity across large portions of the vertebrate brain, such as widefield and two-photon calcium imaging, electrophysiology, and optogenetics, are now available. However, few effective approaches enable both optical and mechanical access to the brain. In this work, we offer an in-depth guide for synthesizing, implanting, and using polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) windows as skull replacements for chronic optical neuronal imaging. Furthermore, we provide instructions to perform viral injections and multi-site silicon probe implantation.

">The superficial tufted and mitral cell output neurons of the mouse olfactory bulb have a dual role in insulin sensing</a></h4>

              
                The olfactory bulb (OB) contains multiple, parallel projection neurons to relay the nature of a stimulus. In a mouse ex vivo slice preparation, we used patch-clamp electrophysiology to measure intrinsic properties, excitability, action potential (AP) shape, voltage-activated conductances, and neuromodulation in the newly-categorized superficial tufted cells (sTCs) compared with those of mitral cells (MCs). We propose that a marked difference in voltage-dependent current represents distinct ion channel populations that affect the kinetics of action potentials, and evokes an increase in sTC firing frequency, albeit both types of projection neurons having similar AP spiking activity. Triple-colored immunofluorescence and RNA scope were used to detect co-localization of the Kv1.3 ion channel and the insulin receptor in sTCs, with ~73% of sTCs expressing both. The sTCs were modulated by bath application of insulin: increasing AP firing frequency by 97%, attributable to an 8% decrease in the intraburst interval, and a reduction of the latency to first spike by 37%. We conclude that there may be a range of neuromodulators of sTCs that may alter excitability and fine-tune olfactory information processing or metabolic balance.

">Electrochemical Metabolic Profiling Reveals Mitochondrial Hyperactivation and Enhanced Neural Progenitor Proliferation in MLC1-Mutant Human Cortical Organoids</a></h4>

              
                Mitochondrial function is critical for neural progenitor regulation, yet its dysregulation during early human brain development remains poorly defined. Megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy with subcortical cysts (MLC) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by MLC1 mutations, previously attributed to postnatal astrocyte dysfunction. Using patient-derived human cortical organoids, we show that MLC1 is expressed in early neuroepithelial cells. To assess mitochondrial state in live organoids, we developed the MAGO (Matrigel-coated gold nanostructure) platform for real-time, label-free detection of redox activity. MLC1 mutant organoids showed mitochondrial hyperactivation, increased ATP and ROS, reduced membrane potential, and altered fusion protein expression. These changes were accompanied by enhanced BrdU incorporation and expansion of PAX6/SOX2 progenitors. To assess the causal role of MLC1 mutation, we generated isogenic organoids using CRISPR prime editing, which recapitulated redox hyperactivation and increased proliferation. Our findings redefine MLC as a disorder of early mitochondrial and progenitor dysregulation and establish a tractable platform to study metabolic mechanisms in neurodevelopmental disease.

">Survey of hippocampal responses to sound in naive mice reveals widespread activation by broadband noise onsets</a></h4>

              
                Recent studies suggest some hippocampal (HC) neurons respond to passively presented sounds in naive subjects, but the specificity and prevalence of these responses remain unclear. We used Neuropixels probes to record unit activity in HC and auditory cortex (ACtx) of awake, untrained mice during presentation of diverse sound stimuli. A subset of HC neurons exhibited reliable, short-latency responses to passive sounds, including tones and broadband noise. HC units showed evidence of tuning for tone frequency but not spectrotemporal features in continuous dynamic moving ripples. Across sound types, HC responses overwhelmingly occurred at stimulus onset; they quickly adapted to continuous sounds and did not respond at sound offset. Among all sounds tested, broadband noise was by far most effective at driving HC activity, with response prevalence scaling with increasing spectral bandwidth and density. Responses to noise were also far more common than visual flash stimuli. Sound-evoked face movements, quantified by total facial motion energy (FME), correlated with population-level HC activity, but many individual units responded regardless of movement, indicating both auditory and motor-related inputs. These results show that abrupt, acoustic events are sufficient to activate HC neurons in the absence of learning or behavioral engagement. This suggests a possible role for HC in detecting salient environmental changes and supports the idea that auditory inputs contribute directly to HC function. Given emerging links between hearing loss and dementia, these findings highlight a potential pathway by which auditory deafferentation could impact cognitive health.

">Circadian-Related Dynamics of the Endocannabinoid System in Male Mouse Brain</a></h4>

              
                Endocannabinoids (eCBs) and related lipids play crucial roles in brain function, including the regulation of circadian rhythms and sleep. To comprehensively map these molecules, we employed liquid chromatography high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry (LC/HRMS/MS) to quantify 78 lipids across 14 families in seven brain areas of male mice at four time points throughout the day (every six hours), and during sleep initiation. We found that most eCBs from the fatty acids (FAs) family, particularly arachidonic acid (AA), were highly abundant in the mouse brain in all brain areas and during the circadian rhythm. High eCBs abundance was shown in deeper brain areas, while temporal differences using the Cosinor analysis revealed 26 eCBs behaving in a circadian rhythm response, with linolenic acid (LnA) being the only lipid to show rhythmicity across all brain areas. Sleep initiation (ZT1) was associated with increased N-acylphosphatidylethanolamine phospholipase D (NAPE-PLD) activity and N-acylethanolamide (NAE) levels in the cortex and hippocampus, while wake extension (WEx) altered 2-monoacylglycerol (2-MAG) metabolism and increased cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) expression. These findings provide a detailed lipidomic map of eCBs and related lipids in the male mouse brain, highlighting their area-specific distribution, circadian regulation, and involvement in sleep/wake transitions. Given the link between sleep disruption and neurodegeneration, future studies should investigate whether the observed eCB dysregulation contributes to sleep disturbances in these conditions, and if targeting these pathways offers novel therapeutic strategies.

">Cellular and Extracellular microRNA Dysregulation in LRRK2-Linked Parkinson's Disease</a></h4>

              
                Background and objective: The discovery of cell-free micro-RNAs in body fluids has made them a promising biomarker target in the field of neurodegenerative diseases. Although they have been reported to be differentially expressed in biofluids and tissues from sporadic Parkinson's disease patients, it remains unclear whether similar observations can be made in patients with genetic forms of the disease and if miRNA profiles reflect mutation-specific pathogenic pathways. Since induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons represent a widely used research model for both sporadic and familial Parkinson's disease, we sought to assess the usability of this model for the identification of differentially expressed cell-free micro-RNAs in the context of the Parkinson's disease-related LRRK2 G2019S mutation in a proof-of-concept study. Materials and methods: We isolated extracellular vesicles carrying cell-free RNA from patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells carrying the LRRK2 G2019S mutation and their gene-corrected isogenic controls. After the generation of small-RNA libraries and differential expression analysis, we quantified expression levels of fourteen micro-RNAs in an independent batch of cell-free and cellular RNA via RT-qPCR. Finally, we quantified pRab10 levels as a proxy of LRRK2 activity and correlated observable changes to the miRNA expression levels. Results: We successfully isolated extracellular vesicles from induced pluripotent stem cell-derived human dopaminergic neurons. We detected over 2000 different micro-RNAs of which 56 were differentially expressed. Dysregulation of four micro-RNAs was confirmed in an independent batch of cell-free RNA. We discovered a high correlation between changes in the cell-free and cellular micro-RNAomes. Finally, we showed poor correlation between LRRK2 expression or activity and miRNA expression levels. Conclusions: Our results suggest that patients carrying the LRRK2 G2019S mutation display alterations in cellular and cell-free micro-RNA expression levels. Notably, the miRNA changes observed in this study did not follow a linear relationship with LRRK2 expression levels or kinase activity. Validation in larger cohorts will be necessary.

">Distinct impacts of sodium channel blockers on the strength-duration properties of human motor cortex neurones</a></h4>

              
                Voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs) are essential for regulating axonal excitability in the human brain. While sodium channel blockers are known to modulate neuronal excitability, their in vivo effects on the human cortex remain poorly understood. Here, we employed novel transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) measures to investigate the effects of sodium channel blockers, carbamazepine and lacosamide, on the strength-duration behaviour of human cortical neurones, serving as an index of sodium channel function. Our data showed that single doses of both medications elevated resting motor thresholds compared to placebo, indicating reduced excitability; however, their impacts varied according to TMS pulse width. Carbamazepine raised thresholds proportionally across all pulse widths, whereas lacosamide disproportionately influenced thresholds for long-duration pulses. Crucially, lacosamide reduced the strength-duration time constant and increased rheobase, while carbamazepine had minimal effects on both. These results reveal subtle and unexpected differences in cortical neurone behaviour following VGSC-blocking medication administration. Lacosamide's response aligns with the proposed mechanism of sodium conductance blockade, while carbamazepine's effects suggest distinct VGSC interactions or potential off-target effects. Our findings advance the understanding of VGSC-blocking medication interactions in the human cortex and underscore the importance of employing specific TMS measures to gain deeper insights into medication mechanisms of action in vivo. Such measures could serve as valuable adjuncts in medication development and patient monitoring, enhancing understanding of medication action in clinical settings.

">Temporal-orbitofrontal pathway regulates choices across physical reward and visual novelty</a></h4>

              
                Perceptually novel objects have profound impacts on our daily decisions. People often pay to try novel meals over familiar ones, or to see novel visual scenes at art exhibits and travel destinations. This suggests that perceptual novelty and the value of physical rewards, such as food, interact at the level of neural circuits to guide decisions, but where and how is unknown. We designed a behavioral task to study this novelty-reward interaction in animals and to uncover its neural underpinnings. Subjects chose among familiar offers associated with different expectations of novel objects and different expectations of juice rewards. Expectation of novel objects increased the preference for expected rewards. This novelty-reward interaction was reflected by neural activity in the anterior ventral temporal cortex (AVMTC) - a region previously implicated in the detection and prediction of novelty - and in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) - an area that receives prominent AVMTC inputs and is known for its capacity to signal subjective value of visual objects. Neural activity patterns suggested that AVMTC was upstream of OFC in the decision process. Chemogenetic disruption of the AVMTC-OFC circuit altered the impact of expected novelty on the valuation of physical reward. Hence, the ventral visual system impacts novelty-reward interactions during decisions through direct projections to OFC.

">D3 dopamine receptors implicate a subtype of medium spiny neuron in the aversive effects of antipsychotic medications</a></h4>

              
                Second generation antipsychotics (SGAs) are widely used clinical tools, yet they often cause negative side effects and take weeks to become effective, leading to poor patient compliance. The effect/side effect profile of individual SGAs is highly variable, and the mechanisms that underlie this variability are not well understood. We found that SGA activity at D3 dopamine receptors (D3R) in the Nucleus Accumbens (NAc) mediates the aversive effects of SGAs. Using single-nucleus RNA sequencing, we found that D3R is expressed in a subpopulation of D1R neurons and defines its own distinct NAc cell type. We demonstrate that while multiple SGAs (clozapine and quetiapine) cause acute conditioned place aversion in mice, only chronic treatment with quetiapine, an arrestin-biased agonist at D3R, causes aversion to abate. We further show at both the cell and population level that quetiapine inhibits D3R-neurons in the lateral shell (LatSh) of the NAc. Selective optogenetic inhibition of D3R-neurons in the LatSh produces real time place aversion in mice, implicating this cell type in the aversive effects of SGAs. Our findings suggest a cellular and systems-level mechanism underlying aversion to SGAs and highlight the pathway to selective tolerance to this aversion, providing a framework for future therapeutic strategies in SGA development.

">Single electrically induced epileptic afterdischarge triggers synaptic weakening, AMPA receptor endocytosis and shrinkage of dendritic spines in the hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                Afterdischarge (AD) is an experimental model of electrically induced seizures. When induced in limbic structures, AD is known to induce acute behavioral alterations and flattening of local field potentials that persist for a few minutes. However, impairments in more complex cognitive processes such as learning and memory, can last for hours after the seizure. Considering the mismatch between ephemeral postictal electrophysiological changes and long-lasting cognitive impairments, synaptic plasticity emerges as a possible mechanism that integrates these findings. Therefore, we used a multilevel approach to evaluate the effects of a single seizure on synaptic plasticity. First, we showed that a single AD-eliciting stimulation at the perforant pathway-dentate gyrus (PP-DG) synapse causes long-lasting decrease of evoked postsynaptic potentials. Then, we observed that this functional alteration was accompanied by shrinkage of mushroom-shaped spines in the DG. Lastly, reduced levels of p(Ser845)-GluA1 and GluA1 subunits of AMPA receptors (AMPARs) were found in the hippocampal postsynaptic density. Together, our data suggest that a seizure induces a long-term depression (LTD)-like synaptic plasticity phenomenon, which is characterized by synaptic weakening, AMPAR endocytosis, and dendritic spines shrinkage. Furthermore, the postictal changes in synaptic plasticity observed here align with the course of cognitive impairments often reported in other studies.

">In the words of others: ERP evidence of speaker-specific phonological prediction</a></h4>

              
                Prediction models usually assume that highly constraining contexts allow the pre-activation of phonological information. However, the evidence for phonological prediction is mixed and controversial. In this study, we implement a paradigm that capitalizes on the phonological errors produced by non-native speakers to investigate whether speaker-specific phonological predictions are made based on speaker identity (native-vs-foreign). EEG data was recorded from 42 healthy native Italian speakers. Participants were asked to read sentence fragments after which a final word was spoken by either a native- or a foreign-accented speaker. The spoken final word could be predictable or not, depending on the sentence context. The identity of the speaker (native-vs-foreign) may or may not be cued by an image of the face of the speaker. Our main analysis indicated that cueing the speaker identity was associated with a larger N400 predictability effect, possibly reflecting an easier processing of predictable words due to phonological preactivation. As visual inspection of the waveforms revealed a more complex pattern than initially anticipated, we used temporal EFA (Exploratory Factor Analysis) to identify and disentangle the ERP components underlying the effect observed. In the native-accent condition, predictable words elicited a posterior positivity relative to unpredictable words, possibly reflecting a P3b response, which was more pronounced when the speaker identity was cued. In the foreign-accent condition, cueing the speaker identity was associated with a smaller N1 and a larger P3a response. These results suggest that phonological prediction for native- and foreign-accented speakers likely involve different cognitive processes.

">Multimodal approach to characterize surgically removed epileptogenic zone from patients with focal drug-resistant epilepsy: from operating room to wet lab</a></h4>

              
                Objective: We have established a comprehensive sample handling protocol designed for the multiscale assessment of epileptogenic tissue. This protocol aims to identify novel therapeutic targets and enhance the diagnosis and stratification of patients with drug-resistant epilepsy, thereby optimizing their treatment with anti-seizure medications and surgical interventions. Methods: Patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy, recommended for surgical treatment, are recruited after detailed multidisciplinary preoperative evaluation at the Epilepsy Center at Kuopio University Hospital in Finland. A day before the resective surgery, patients undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) including advanced methodologies. During the surgery, each piece of resected tissue is placed under oxygenation on ice-cold artificial cerebral spinal fluid-solution. The pieces are then immediately transported to the laboratory, assessed by a neuropathologist, and sliced for both clinical diagnosis and research. Two adjacent slices are provided for research and are sent to the University of Eastern Finland. Results: The developed sample handling protocol provides the opportunity for detailed characterization of the tissue from the same patient using emerging imaging, electrophysiology, and molecular biology technologies. We have optimized the conditions for preserving the resected tissue alive for electrophysiological measurements and simultaneously making possible ex vivo studies including multi-omics acquisition, electron microscopy, histology, and MRI. Our protocol enables the mapping of functional readouts to structural and molecular alterations in human tissue. Our goal is to integrate multimodal data and co-register the resected tissues within the whole brain's in vivo MRI space. This approach aims to enhance the characterization and localization of epileptogenic zones and refine surgical treatment targets by identifying abnormalities in global connectivity and structural patterns. Significance: We have successfully developed a systematic protocol for the collection and analysis of multimodal data. This protocol aims to elucidate the structural, functional, and molecular characteristics that render tissue epileptogenic, thereby enhancing the diagnosis and subsequent care of patients with epilepsy.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Cognitive functions rely on specific brain circuits involving cortical and subcortical regions. However, how age-related changes in effective connectivity within the prefrontoparietal-thalamo-hippocampal circuit affect cognition remains unclear. This study included 143 healthy older adults (60 to 88 yrs) and 124 young adults (18 to 44 yrs), using regression dynamic causal modeling to analyze resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data. Compared to young adults, older adults showed increased reciprocal effective connectivity within the ventromedial prefrontal cortex–lateral thalamic nuclei–right caudal hippocampus circuit. Enhanced bidirectional connectivity was also observed within the frontoparietal network, between the pregenual cingulate gyrus and superior frontal gyrus, and between lateral thalamic nuclei (LTN) and frontal pole. Additionally, heightened connectivity between thalamus and hippocampus negatively correlated with cognitive performance. Our findings reveal significant age-related increases in effective connectivity within the prefrontoparietal-thalamo-hippocampal circuit, linked to cognitive performance levels. Increased connectivity may indicate compensatory mechanisms helping preserve cognitive function in healthy aging. These results advance our understanding of neural dynamics underlying cognitive aging and potential adaptive mechanisms in older adults.</span>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To compare clinical and radiological outcomes among relapsing multiple sclerosis patients treated with autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHSCT), alemtuzumab (ATZ), and ocrelizumab (OCR).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>From a London (UK) hospital-based observational cohort, modeled data were obtained from 621 relapsing–remitting multiple sclerosis patients, who were treated with AHSCT (n = 103), ATZ (n = 204), and OCR (n = 314), and were followed up for 43, 43, and 32 median months, respectively. The annualized relapse rate, new magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) lesions, and disability progression on Expanded Disability Status Scale were assessed.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>AHSCT showed superior efficacy compared with ATZ and OCR. After 5-year follow up, the mean annualized relapse rate (0.026 vs 0.087; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), the risk of relapses (HR 0.29, 95% CI 0.13–0.63; <i>p</i> = 0.002), and of MRI activity (HR 0.33, 95% CI 0.15–0.72; <i>p</i> = 0.006) were significantly lower in AHSCT versus ATZ group. Compared with OCR, after 3-year follow-up AHSCT showed a significantly lower annualized relapse rate (0.028 vs 0.073; <i>p</i> = 0.02) and a trend to reduced risk of relapse (HR 0.45, 95% CI 0.18–1.14; <i>p</i> = 0.09), but similar low rates (6%) of new MRI activity (HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.28–2.67; <i>p</i> = 0.80). In addition, there was a similar risk of Expanded Disability Status Scale progression in AHSCT, and both ATZ (HR 1.19, 95% CI 0.71–2.00; <i>p</i> = 0.50) and OCR (HR 1.08, 95% CI 0.57–2.04; <i>p</i> = 0.82) groups.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>AHSCT was followed by greater prevention of relapses compared with ATZ and OCR, and suppressed more profoundly MRI activity than ATZ, but similarly to OCR, albeit with shorter follow up. The risk of accumulating disability was similar among the treated groups. Studies with larger sample sizes and longer follow up may enable confirmation of these findings or detection of any additional differential effects. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                Metabolic reprogramming and telomere maintenance are hallmarks of cancer. Udutha et al. demonstrate that TERT, which drives telomere maintenance, also upregulates glutathione synthesis in glioblastoma. Targeting glutathione synthesis, however, rewires metabolism to augment nucleotide biosynthesis. Importantly, combined inhibition of glutathione and nucleotide synthesis is synthetically lethal in preclinical glioblastoma models.

                Wang et al. report a diagnostic marker KIF26B for bladder cancer. Mechanistically, KIF26B activates Wnt/β-catenin pathway through maintaining TRAF2 protein stability via OTUB2 and enabling its translocation into nucleus via IPO11. Then, TRAF2 facilitates TCF4/β-catenin complex formation and induces pd-l1 transcription.

                Ku et al. reveal the amplification of antiviral signaling by SLIRP. The innate immune activation results in increased expression and mitochondrial localization of SLIRP. It then stabilizes mt-dsRNAs, which serve as non-self signatures to activate antiviral signaling further. Such regulation is involved in autoimmune disease and defense against viral infection.

                Adaptation in reaching is a fundamental topic in motor neuroscience, yet the origins of error signals driving this process remain unclear. In this study, Inoue and Kitazawa demonstrate that error signals encoded by the parvocellular division of the red nucleus are crucial for driving reaching adaptation.

     alt="Sex and Strain Differences in Analgesic and Hyperlocomotor Effects of Morphine and μ-Opioid Receptor Expression in Mice"/>
<p>Morphine dose-dependently increased analgesia in both CD-1 and C57BL/6 mice, with no observed sex differences. However, C57BL/6 mice of both sexes exhibited greater morphine-induced locomotor activity compared to CD-1 mice. These behavioral differences were paralleled by strain-specific patterns of μ-opioid receptor (MOR) expression: CD-1 mice showed elevated MOR levels in the spinal cord and periaqueductal gray, whereas C57BL/6 mice had increased MOR expression in the caudoputamen.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Sex and gender differences in the analgesic efficacy and side effects of opioids have been widely reported, but their underlying neurobiological mechanisms remain poorly understood. Preclinical animal models are essential tools for investigating these differences and providing insights into the neurobiology of opioid effects. Although studies in rats have revealed sex-specific effects of opioids, the sex-dependent behavioral profiles of opioids in mice, particularly across strains, remain largely unexplored. In this study, we characterized sex and strain differences in the antinociceptive and hyperlocomotor effects of morphine in the two most widely used mouse strains—CD1 and C57BL/6—and quantified regional expression of the μ-opioid receptor (MOR) in key brain and spinal cord regions. Both strains exhibited clear, dose-dependent antinociceptive and hyperlocomotor responses to morphine. While no significant sex or strain differences were observed in antinociceptive effects, C57BL/6 mice displayed significantly greater hyperlocomotor activity than CD1 mice. Western blot analyses revealed strain-specific MOR expression, with CD1 mice showing higher spinal cord and periaqueductal gray MOR levels, particularly in females, while C57BL/6 mice exhibited elevated MOR expression in the caudoputamen. Morphine treatment increased spinal MOR expression in CD1 mice but not C57BL/6, suggesting strain-dependent regulation of MOR. These findings highlight strain-specific behavioral and molecular responses to morphine, emphasizing the importance of strain and sex considerations in preclinical opioid research.</p>

                <p>One pending question in social neuroscience is whether interpersonal interactions are processed differently by the brain depending on the bodily characteristics of the interactor, i.e., their physical appearance. To address this issue, we engaged participants in a minimally interactive task with an avatar either showing bodily features or not while recording their brain activity using electroencephalography (EEG) in order to investigate indices of action observation and action monitoring processing. Multivariate results showed that bodily compared with nonbodily appearance modulated parieto-occipital neural patterns throughout the entire duration of the observed movement and that, importantly, such patterns differ from the ones related to initial shape processing. Furthermore, among the electrocortical indices of action monitoring, only the early observational positivity (oPe) was responsive to the bodily appearance of the observed agent under the specific task requirement to predict the partner movement. Taken together, these findings broaden the understanding of how bodily appearance shapes the spatiotemporal processing of an interactor's movements. This holds particular relevance in our modern society, where human&ndash;artificial (virtual or robotic) agent interactions are rapidly becoming ubiquitous.</p>

                Introduction Sharenting involves parents sharing photos, videos, or other information about their children on their social media profiles via online platforms. Research indicated the rising prevalence of parental sharenting behaviour among various countries. Objective The main aim of this article was to explore the role of motivations, perceptions, attitudes, and impression management on parental sharenting behaviours. Methods A systematic review examined empirical studies published from 2019 to 2024 regarding parental motivations, attitudes, perceptions, and impression management associated with sharenting. Relevant studies were identified via Scopus and manual reference searches, with data extraction concentrating on study characteristics, demographics, objectives, design, and principal findings. Findings Parental sharenting is motivated by intrinsic desires, social validation, and impression management, as parents curate content to improve their social image. While children value favourable representations, many object to sharing without consent. Notwithstanding privacy concerns, parents frequently prioritise advantages, raising ethical enquiries regarding children’s autonomy, privacy, and digital identity in digital self-representation. Conclusion Parental sharenting, motivated by emotional satisfaction, social validation, and impression management, frequently neglects privacy risks and ethical considerations. Such practices may compromise children’s autonomy, privacy, and digital identity, resulting in conflicts with their rights. Children’s varied responses underscore these dilemmas, highlighting the necessity of reconciling parental intentions with safeguarding children’s digital futures and overall well-being. Recommendation Parents should engage in mindful sharenting, policymakers must safeguard children’s digital rights, professionals should enhance awareness, and researchers should investigate methods to reconcile parental desires with children’s welfare.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1439/v2?src=rss">Case Report: Macrophage activation syndrome due to multifocal tuberculosis in an immunocompromised patient [version 2; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Macrophage Activation Syndrome (MAS) is a serious and life-threatening complication defined by excessive immune activation. While it’s commonly associated with rheumatic diseases, infections can also trigger MAS, with tuberculosis being a rare but significant cause. This case report discusses a rare occurrence of Macrophage Activation Syndrome (MAS) caused by multifocal tuberculosis in an immunocompromised patient with Crohn’s disease receiving immunosuppressive treatment. The patient is a 26-year-old woman with Crohn’s disease who is being treated with azathioprine. She arrived at the hospital battling persistent abdominal pain, overwhelming fatigue, and fever. Upon examination, splenomegaly and ascites were noted. A chest X-ray revealed bilateral pleural effusion consistent with tuberculosis. A CT scan confirmed the presence of pleural, pericardial, and intraperitoneal fluid. Blood tests indicated pancytopenia, hyperferritinemia, and hypofibrinogenemia. The analysis of ascitic fluid suggested an exudate. The PCR test of the bone marrow aspirate was positive for tuberculosis without rifampicin resistance, and the smear showed hemophagocytosis images. The patient was diagnosed with Macrophage Activation Syndrome secondary to multifocal tuberculosis. This report delves into the complex relationship between MAS and tuberculosis, emphasizing the challenges in diagnosing MAS in such cases and the potential link to tuberculosis. The complex diagnostic landscape of multifocal tuberculosis, which can often mimic malignancies, underscores the importance of promptly detecting and starting anti-tuberculosis interventions for improved clinical outcomes and the prevention of associated complications.

                Life support robots that can be fully autonomous clothing wear-support robotic identification control systems are challenging. Robotic-assisted dressing solutions have the potential to provide tremendous support to the elderly, patients with mobility impairments, and their caregivers. In this study, we propose an IoT control system that automatically identifies clothing wearing position boundaries and recognizes actual spatial height information using a stereo camera with computer vision. The location information of the clothes boundary was recognized use the semantic segmentation model and machine learning method. Then, using the depth measurement of the stereo camera, the spatial height position of the actual clothing boundary was calculated using the depth information. Finally, the auxiliary position movement control of the clothes-wearing support robot was carried out using the IoT method. We experimentally verified that the recognition control system can successfully achieve the recognition and control of the auxiliary position movement of the device. We performed practical experiments for the evaluation. The recognition accuracy and control accuracy in multiple situations and environmental conditions were 77.35% and 97.21%.

                Background Bioremediation faces several compounds to recover oil spilled ecosystem. The BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene) are toxic hydrocarbons requiring efficient microbial degradation for bioremediation. Pseudomonas aeruginosa can degrade hydrocarbons through emulsification (rhl genes) and tolerance (mla genes). However, genomic organization of these systems in environmental P. aeruginosa strains remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the rhl and mla systems in six strains isolated from hydrocarbon-contaminated sites in Peru. Methods Six Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were evaluated in this study. Each strain were able to degrade hydrocarbon and tolerate heavy metals. DNA extraction, sequencing, and quality-controlled assembly, functional genome annotation was performed using BAKTA. Comparative analysis included high-quality Pseudomonas genomes from RefSeq, with ANI metrics. A phylogenetic tree was built from core gene alignment, revealed evolutionary connections and was visualized with iTOL. Results The assembled genomes ranged from 5.6 to 6.0 Mbp with ~66% GC content. All the strains were confirmed as P. aeruginosa by ANI; placing them within Clade 1 alongside environmental and clinical strains. Pangenome analysis identified 3,544 core genes and a diverse accessory genome. All strains had rhlABRI genes in a conserved 3′-5′ orientation. Most of them contained duplicated rhlB gene, except C1BHIC5 strain. However, rhlG varied in position and orientation, it was often near rhlC, with C1BHIC5 also displaying an exception in rhlG orientation.100% of strains presented mla system, associated with toluene tolerance, with two copies of mlaA, mlaFEDC, and mlaEFD genes arranged with high synteny but variable orientations. In comparison to Pseudomonas putida, where mla genes are positioned between murA and ppcD with an additional toluene tolerance gene (ttg2D). Conclusions In conclusion, the presence of the rhlABC genes and the BTEX tolerance genes in all of the analyzed strains allowed us to understand the great ability of P. aeruginosa to survive in polluted environments.

                <p>by Laetitia Grabot, Garance Merholz, Jonathan Winawer, David J. Heeger, Laura Dugué</p>

Brain oscillations might be traveling waves propagating in cortex. Studying their propagation within single cortical areas has mostly been restricted to invasive measurements. Their investigation in healthy humans, however, requires non-invasive recordings, such as MEG or EEG. Identifying traveling waves with these techniques is challenging because source summation, volume conduction, and low signal-to-noise ratios make it difficult to localize cortical activity from sensor responses. The difficulty is compounded by the lack of a known ground truth in traveling wave experiments. Rather than source-localizing cortical responses from sensor activity, we developed a two-part model-based neuroimaging approach: (1) The putative neural sources of a propagating oscillation were modeled within primary visual cortex (V1) via retinotopic mapping from functional MRI recordings (encoding model); and (2) the modeled sources were projected onto MEG and EEG sensors to predict the resulting signal using a biophysical head model. We tested our model by comparing its predictions against the MEG-EEG signal obtained when participants viewed visual stimuli designed to elicit either fovea-to-periphery or periphery-to-fovea traveling waves or standing waves in V1, in which ground truth cortical waves could be reasonably assumed. Correlations on within-sensor phase and amplitude relations between predicted and measured data revealed good model performance. Crucially, the model predicted sensor data more accurately when the input to the model was a traveling wave going in the stimulus direction compared to when the input was a standing wave, or a traveling wave in a different direction. Furthermore, model accuracy peaked at the spatial and temporal frequency parameters of the visual stimulation. Together, our model successfully recovers traveling wave properties in cortex when they are induced by traveling waves in stimuli. This provides a sound basis for using MEG-EEG to study endogenous traveling waves in cortex and test hypotheses related with their role in cognition.

                <p>by Wasim Abbas, Sieun Lee, Sangil Kim</p>
Background <p>In Korea, Hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD) is a recurring illness that presents significant public health challenges, primarily because of its unpredictable epidemic patterns. The accurate prediction of the spread of HFMD plays a vital role in the effective management of the disease.</p> Methods <p>We have devised a dynamic model that accurately represents the transmission dynamics of HFMD. The model includes compartments for susceptible, exposed, inpatients, outpatients, recovered, and deceased individuals. By utilizing monthly inpatient and outpatient data, the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) method was employed to perform a joint estimation of model parameters and state variables. The calibration of model parameters involved using data from the months of January to May, while generating forecasts for the timeframe spanning from June to December.</p> Results <p>The findings reveal a significant alignment between the model and the observed data, as evidenced by root-mean-square error (RMSE) values below 1000 for inpatients and below 10000 for outpatients starting in June. The correlation coefficients surpassed 0.9, except for the year 2015. The implications of our findings suggest a notable shift in transmission and recovery rates, starting in 2015.</p> Discussion <p>The model successfully predicted the peak and magnitude of HFMD outbreaks occurring between June and December, closely matching the observed epidemic patterns. The model’s efficacy in predicting epidemic trends and informing preventive strategies is reinforced by the insights gained from monthly variations in parameter estimates of HFMD transmission dynamics.</p>

                <p>by Jiaxin Hu, Jesse N. Weber, Lauren E. Fuess, Natalie C. Steinel, Daniel I. Bolnick, Miaoyan Wang</p>

Studying the mechanisms underlying the genotype-phenotype association is crucial in genetics. Gene expression studies have deepened our understanding of the genotype  →  expression  →  phenotype mechanisms. However, traditional expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) methods often overlook the critical role of gene co-expression networks in translating genotype into phenotype. This gap highlights the need for more powerful statistical methods to analyze genotype  →  network  →  phenotype mechanism. Here, we develop a network-based method, called spectral network quantitative trait loci analysis (snQTL), to map quantitative trait loci affecting gene co-expression networks. Our approach tests the association between genotypes and joint differential networks of gene co-expression via a tensor-based spectral statistics, thereby overcoming the ubiquitous multiple testing challenges in existing methods. We demonstrate the effectiveness of snQTL in the analysis of three-spined stickleback (<i>Gasterosteus aculeatus</i>) data. Compared to conventional methods, our method snQTL uncovers chromosomal regions affecting gene co-expression networks, including one strong candidate gene that would have been missed by traditional eQTL analyses. Our framework suggests the limitation of current approaches and offers a powerful network-based tool for functional loci discoveries.

Drug-resistant tuberculosis is a pressing global health issue that requires the development of new drugs or the identification of new therapeutic targets. The ESX-3 secretion system is essential for the <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> growth and plays a role in iron/zinc homeostasis and virulence. The aim of this study was to evaluate the quaternary interface of EccD3, a component of the ESX-3 secretion system, and to evaluate the association of an <i>eccD3</i> mutant with drug resistance. The molecular structures of EccD3 protein and other ESX-3 secretion system proteins of the <i>M. tuberculosis</i> were predicted based in homology with the <i>Mycolicibacterium smegmatis</i> tertiary protein structures. According to the <i>in silico</i> results, selamectin, avermectin, ivermectin, and moxidectin were selected as prospective drugs. Selamectin and moxidectin had favorable ΔG values for the EccB3 and EccD3 dimer interfaces, whereas the ESX-3 Protomer 1 interface had the best ΔG + with avermectin, ivermectin, and moxidectin. Furthermore, ivermectin susceptibility increased when the <i>eccD3</i> gene was inhibited using CRISPRi in <i>M. smegmatis</i>. Blockage of EccD3 increased the ivermectin action, but the modest changes observed may be explained by the compensatory mechanisms or other ivermectin targets in absence of this Esx3 component. Further <i>in vitro</i> and preclinical studies are required to validate our findings.

                <p>by Benjamin M. Brisard, Kylie D. Cashwell, Stephanie M. Stewart, Logan M. Harrison, Aidan C. Charles, Chelsea V. Dennis, Ivie R. Henslee, Ethan L. Carrow, Heather A. Belcher, Debajit Bhowmick, Paul W. Vos, Maciej Majka, Martin Bier, David M. Hart, Cameron A. Schmidt</p>

During fertilization, mammalian sperm undergo a winnowing selection process that reduces the candidate pool of potential fertilizers from ~10<sup>6</sup>-10<sup>11</sup> cells to 10<sup>1</sup>-10<sup>2</sup> cells (depending on the species). Classical sperm competition theory addresses the positive or ‘stabilizing’ selection acting on sperm phenotypes within populations of organisms but does not strictly address the developmental consequences of sperm traits among individual organisms that are under purifying selection during fertilization. It is the latter that is of utmost concern for improving assisted reproductive technologies (ART) because low-fitness sperm may be inadvertently used for fertilization during interventions that rely heavily on artificial sperm selection, such as intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). Importantly, some form of sperm selection is used in nearly all forms of ART (e.g., differential centrifugation, swim-up, or hyaluronan binding assays, etc.). To date, there is no unifying quantitative framework (i.e., theory of sperm selection) that synthesizes causal mechanisms of selection with observed natural variation in individual sperm traits. In this report, we reframe the physiological function of sperm as a collective diffusive search process and develop multi-scale computational models to explore the causal dynamics that constrain sperm fitness during fertilization. Several experimentally useful concepts are developed, including a probabilistic measure of sperm fitness as well as an information theoretic measure of the magnitude of sperm selection, each of which are assessed under systematic increases in microenvironmental selective pressure acting on sperm motility patterns.

                <p>by Brittany M. Stewart, Linley R. Pierce, Mikayla C. Olson, Chengyuan Ji, Robert C. Orchard</p>

Norovirus, the leading cause of gastroenteritis worldwide, is a non-enveloped virus whose tropism is determined in part by the expression patterns of entry receptors. However, the contribution of cellular lipids to viral entry is not well understood. Here, we determined that the asymmetrical distribution of lipids within membrane bilayers is required for murine norovirus (MNV) replication. Specifically, TMEM30a, an essential subunit of lipid flippases, is required for MNV replication in vitro. Disruption of TMEM30a in mouse intestinal epithelial cells prevents persistent, enteric infection by MNV in vivo. Mechanistically, TMEM30a facilitates MNV binding and entry. Surprisingly, exoplasmic phosphatidylserine (PS), a typical marker of dying cells, does not inhibit MNV infection. Rather, TMEM30a maintains a lipid-ordered state that impacts membrane fluidity that is necessary for the low affinity, high avidity binding of MNV to cells. Our data provides a new role for lipid asymmetry in promoting non-enveloped virus infection in vitro and norovirus persistence in vivo.

Stem cells have lower facultative heterochromatin as defined by trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3) compared to differentiated cells. However, the mechanisms underlying these differential H3K27me3 levels remain elusive. Because H3K27me3 levels are diluted 2-fold in every round of replication and then restored through the rest of the cell cycle, we reasoned that the cell cycle length could be a key regulator of total H3K27me3 levels. Here, we propose that a short G1 phase restricts H3K27me3 levels in stem cells. To test this model, we determined changes to H3K27me3 levels in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) globally and at specific loci upon G1 phase lengthening – accomplished by thymidine block or growth in the absence of serum (with the “2i medium”). H3K27me3 levels in mESCs increase with G1 arrest when grown in serum and in 2i medium. Additionally, we observed via CUT&RUN and ChIP-seq that regions that gain H3K27me3 in G1 arrest and 2i media overlap, supporting our model of G1 length as a critical regulator of the stem cell epigenome. Furthermore, we demonstrate the inverse effect – that G1 shortening in differentiated human HEK293 cells results in a loss of H3K27me3 levels. Finally, in human tumor cells with extreme H3K27me3 loss, lengthening of the G1 phase leads to H3K27me3 recovery despite the presence of the dominant negative, sub-stoichiometric H3.K27M mutation. Our results indicate that G1 length is an essential determinant of H3K27me3 landscapes across diverse cell types.

Self-initiated behavior is accompanied by the experience of intending our actions. Here, we leverage the unique opportunity to examine the full intentional chain—from intention to action to environmental effects—in a tetraplegic person outfitted with a primary motor cortex (M1) brain–machine interface (BMI) generating real hand movements via neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES). This combined BMI-NMES approach allowed us to selectively manipulate each element of the intentional chain (intention, action, effect) while probing subjective experience and performing extra-cellular recordings in human M1. Behaviorally, we reveal a novel form of intentional binding: motor intentions are reflected in a perceived temporal attraction between the onset of intentions and that of actions. Neurally, we demonstrate that evoked spiking activity in M1 largely coincides in time with the onset of the experience of intention and that M1 spike counts and the onset of subjective intention may co-vary on a trial-by-trial basis. Further, population-level dynamics, as indexed by a decoder instantiating movement, reflect intention-action temporal binding. The results fill a significant knowledge gap by relating human spiking activity in M1 with the onset of subjective intention and complement prior human intracranial work examining pre-motor and parietal areas.

                <p>by Khang Ho, Rasika M. Harshey</p>

Chromosomal organization in <i>Escherichia coli</i> as examined by Hi-C methodology indicates that long-range interactions are sparse. Yet, spatial co-localization or “clustering” of 6/7 ribosomal RNA (<i>rrn</i>) operons distributed over half the 4.6 Mbp genome has been captured by two other methodologies—fluorescence microscopy and Mu transposition. Our current understanding of the mechanism of clustering is limited to mapping essential <i>cis</i> elements. To identify <i>trans</i> elements, we resorted to perturbing the system by chemical and physical means and observed that heat shock disrupts clustering. Levels of σ<sup>H</sup> are known to rise as a cellular response to the shock. We show that elevated expression of σ<sup>H</sup> alone is sufficient to disrupt clustering, independent of heat stress. The anti-clustering activity of σ<sup>H</sup> does not depend on its transcriptional activity but requires core-RNAP interaction and DNA-binding activities. This activity of σ<sup>H</sup> is suppressed by ectopic expression of σ<sup>D</sup> suggesting a competition for core-RNAP. A query of the other five known σ factors of <i>E. coli</i> found that elevated expression of FecI, the ECF σ factor that controls iron citrate transport, also perturbs clustering and is also suppressed by σ<sup>D</sup>. We discuss a possible scenario for how these membrane-associated σ factors participate in clustering of distant <i>rrn</i> loci.

                <p>by Hao Xiao, Wenyuan Chen, Hao Pang, Jing Zheng, Li Wang, Hao Feng, Jingdong Song, Lingpeng Cheng, Hongrong Liu</p>

In the assembly pathway of tailed double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) bacteriophages and herpesviruses, a procapsid with a dodecameric portal for DNA delivery at a unique vertex is initially formed. Appropriate procapsid assembly requires the transient presence of multiple copies of a scaffolding protein (SP), which is absent in the mature virion. However, how the SP contributes to dodecameric portal formation, facilitates portal and coat protein incorporation, and is subsequently released remains unclear because of a lack of structural information. Here, we present the structure of the SP–portal complex within the procapsid of bacteriophage P22 at 3–9 Å resolutions. The AlphaFold2-predicted SP model fits well with the density map of the complex. The SP forms trimers and tetramers that interact to yield a dome-like complex on the portal. Two SP domains mediate multimerization. Each trimer interacts with two neighboring portal subunits. The SP has a loop-hook-like structure that aids in coat protein recruitment during viral assembly. The loops of those SP subunits on the portal are positioned in clefts between adjacent portal subunits. Conformational changes in the portal during phage maturation may trigger the disassembly and release of the SP complex. Our findings provide insights into SP-assisted procapsid assembly in bacteriophage P22 and suggest that this strategy is also implemented by other dsDNA viruses, including herpesviruses.

                <p>by Ziwen Huang, Zhenxi Cai, Xin Tao, Xinli Wang, Xiaoxue Tian, Fan Chen, Zhen Li, Anlong Xu, Shaochun Yuan</p>

The discovery of the <i>ProtoRAG</i> transposon in lancelets revealed that V(D)J recombination originates from the <i>Recombination activating gene-like</i> (<i>RAGL</i>) transposon. Analogous to the vertebrate RAG complex, the RAGL transposase nicks host flanking DNA and leads to the formation of hairpin ends. Here, we showed that the Artemis nuclease, which is capable of resolving DNA hairpin ends generated during V(D)J recombination, is also responsible for unraveling <i>ProtoRAG</i>-mediated DNA hairpin ends. Notably, like the <i>RAGL</i> transposon, Artemis originated from the eukaryotic common ancestor. By tracing the evolving function of Artemis from cephalochordates to vertebrates, we revealed the lineage specific allele polymorphism of lancelet <i>Artemis</i> and uncovered an increased activity on hairpin DNA opening in vertebrate Artemis. Additionally, the evolutionarily conserved LYCS motif in Artemis β6, which may be associated with disease, is demonstrated to be crucial for its function. Overall, this study highlights the evolving function of Artemis, identifies novel critical residues, and provides new insights into the evolution of RAG-mediated recombination and the clinical therapy of <i>Artemis</i> deficient disease.

                Background The discoveries of Mulatu’s numbers, better known as Mulatu’s sequence, represent revolutionary contributions to the mathematical world. His best-known work is Mulatu’s sequence, in which each new number is the sum of the two preceding numbers. When various operations and manipulations are performed on the numbers in this sequence, remarkable and intricate patterns begin to emerge. This study aimed to identify novel characterizations of Mulatu’s numbers. Methods This study employed a multi-faceted approach to investigate characterizations of Mulatu’s numbers. Mathematical proof techniques such as principle of mathematical induction, proof by contradiction and direct proof were utilized to substantiate findings. Results In this study, we provided several characterizations of Mulatu’s numbers. We also investigated the properties and patterns of these numbers. Moreover, we have also shown that, similar to Fibonacci’s numbers, Mulatu’s numbers give the so-called golden ratio, which is most applicable in numerical optimization. Furthermore, we formulated a relation among Mulatu’s numbers, Fibonacci numbers, and Lucas numbers. Finally, we provided a generating function for the Mulatu numbers. Conclusions In this study, we uncovered novel characterizations of Mulatu’s numbers and introduced a generating function for them. We investigated relationship between Mulatu’s numbers and the golden ratio. The results discussed offer valuable insights and enhance our understanding of their properties. Furthermore, these findings play a vital role in the boarder context of mathematics and related areas, contributing significantly to the field.

                The study aimed at identifying the prevalence of preterm labor and the associated risk factors. Methods A quantitative approach using a retrospective case-control study was conducted at a tertiary care hospital in Udupi district, Karnataka. The sample consisted of women who delivered in the hospital. Among them, cases (250) were records of women who had delivered before 37 weeks of gestation, and controls (500) were records of women who delivered after 37 weeks 1 of gestation without any complications. Results The study revealed that the prevalence of preterm labor was 356 (14.86%) out of 2402 deliveries. Among these, only 250 were assessed. Preterm labor was significantly correlated with age, place of residence, degree of education, occupation, marital status, gravida, number of deliveries, type of deliveries, gap between births, blood type, and religion. Pregnant women exposed or at risk for preterm labor included those diagnosed with pregnancy-induced hypertension, those who took medication during pregnancy, those with a history of abortion, those engaged in intense physical labor, and those who conceived after the age of 30. Conclusion The prevalence of preterm labor can be minimized if modifiable risk factors are controlled, while non-modifiable risk factors require keen supervision. Health professionals must be alert to all modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors.

                Background Since 1900, the Mediterranean coast has experienced a notable increase in average annual temperatures, rising from 20°C to 24°C.This upward trend in outdoor climate plays a significant role in determining indoor environmental quality (IEQ) particularly in educational buildings. With growing concerns about energy consumption and urban climate change, This paper examines the potential of movable green walls on building facades to improve urban ecosystems. Unlike traditional passive green walls, active green walls offer dynamic aesthetics and provide various benefits, including shading, passive cooling, and opportunities for personal expression in urban environments. The primary aim of this research is to evaluate the shading effectiveness and energy performance of DVGS in hot climates, specifically within educational settings, to enhance their design as an architectural feature. 1 , 2 Methods A comprehensive approach is employed, specifically designed for the local climate of Egypt, utilizing DVGS to achieve comfort in temperatures and natural sunlight while reducing power consumption to enhance energy efficiency & thermal comfort for the occupants. The novelty of this paper lies in its comparative methodology, enhanced by software simulations (DesignBuilder7.0.2.006-Energy Plus plugin),(hyperlink: https://www.openstudio.net) to address design challenges in the existing educational building. Results The paper highlights the benefits of dynamic vertical green systems (DVGS) in educational institutions, revealing a significant reduction in energy efficiency and air quality. Louvers reduced chilling energy usage by 10.95% and heating energy usage by4.8%, while green walls reduced chilling energy and heating energy usage by 19.14% and 12.94% respectively. Louvers also reduced carbon dioxide emissions by 13%, while green walls reduced emissions by 28.43%. The vegetation layer’s thermal properties improved relative humidity by4% and 8%, respectively, in hot arid environments. DVGS installations also reduced electricity costs by 35% and 41.5% during August peak months. Conclusions The implementation of DVGS significantly improves indoor environmental quality by enhancing energy efficiency, thermal comfort and natural daylight.

                Hippocampal place fields emerge during exploration to support navigational learning and memory. The subcellular mechanisms supporting place field formation remain unclear. O’Hare et al. report that distal tuft dendrites are variably recruited during place field formation. The timing and magnitude of their recruitment predict the properties of new hippocampal place fields.

                Fu et al. find that low-dose prexasertib, a CHK1 inhibitor, enhances tumor sensitivity while mitigating on-target toxicity during immunotherapy through mtDNA-mediated STING pathway activation. Mechanistically, prexasertib at therapeutic doses blocks Nek1-mediated phosphorylation of VDAC1 at the threonine 107 residue, showing a phosphorylation-dependent regulatory mechanism of mitochondrial-nuclear crosstalk.

                Chen et al. demonstrate that HAF2 is a histone acetyltransferase that interacts with EIN2-C to regulate H3K14ac and H3K23ac in response to ethylene. HAF2 functions with the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, establishing its role in ethylene-induced chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation.

                Oka et al. show that basal cell carcinoma (BCC) has low immunogenicity due to low HLA-I expression from its inception. Foxc1, a transcription factor associated with BCC cell of origin, inhibits HLA-I expression in BCC cells, which can be reversed by a histone deacetylase inhibitor to enable BCC immunotherapy.
