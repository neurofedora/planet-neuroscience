              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Plasma MIA, CRP, and albumin predict cognitive decline in Parkinson's Disease</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Using a multi-cohort, Discovery-Replication-Validation design, we sought new plasma biomarkers that predict which PD individuals will experience cognitive decline.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In 108 Discovery Cohort PD individuals and 83 Replication Cohort PD individuals, we measured 940 plasma proteins on an aptamer-based platform. Using proteins associating with subsequent cognitive decline in both cohorts, we trained a logistic regression model to predict which PD patients showed fast (&gt;=1 point drop/year on Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)) vs. slow (&lt;1 point drop/year on MoCA) cognitive decline in the Discovery Cohort, testing it in the Replication Cohort. We developed alternate assays for the top three proteins and confirmed their ability to predict cognitive decline – defined by change in MoCA or development of incident Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) or dementia – in a Validation Cohort of 118 PD individuals. We investigated the top plasma biomarker for causal influence by Mendelian randomization.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A model with only three proteins (Melanoma Inhibitory Activity Protein (MIA), C-Reactive Protein (CRP), albumin) separated Fast vs. Slow cognitive decline subgroups with an AUC of 0.80 in the Validation Cohort. Validation Cohort PD individuals in the top quartile of risk for cognitive decline based on this model were 4.4 times more likely to develop incident MCI or dementia than those in the lowest quartile. Genotypes at <i>MIA</i> SNP rs2233154 associated with MIA levels and cognitive decline, providing evidence for MIA's causal influence.</p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>An easily-obtained plasma-based predictor identifies PD individuals at risk for cognitive decline. MIA may participate causally in development of cognitive decline.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dynamic Structure Of Motor Cortical Neuron Co-Activity Carries Behaviorally Relevant Information</a></h4>

              
                Skillful, voluntary movements are underpinned by computations performed by networks of interconnected neurons in the primary motor cortex (M1). Computations are reflected by patterns of co-activity between neurons. Using spike time correlations, co-activity can be represented as functional networks (FNs). Here, we show that the structure of FNs constructed from instructed-delay reach trials in non-human primates are behaviorally specific: low dimensional embedding and graph alignment scores show that FNs constructed from closer target reach distances are also closer in network space. We next constructed temporal FNs using short intervals across a trial. We find that temporal FNs traverse a low-dimensional subspace in a reach-specific trajectory. Alignment scores show that FNs become separable and correspondingly, decodable shortly after the instruction cue. Finally, we observe that reciprocal connections in FNs transiently decrease following the instruction cue, suggesting the network momentarily switches from a recurrent system to one that is more feedforward.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Spatiotemporal organization of human sensorimotor beta burst activity</a></h4>

              
                Beta oscillations in human sensorimotor cortex are hallmark signatures of healthy and pathological movement. In single trials, beta oscillations include bursts of intermittent, transient periods of high-power activity. These burst events have been linked to a range of sensory and motor processes, but their precise spatial, spectral, and temporal structure remains unclear. Specifically, a role for beta burst activity in information coding and communication suggests spatiotemporal patterns, or travelling wave activity, along specific anatomical gradients. We here show in human magnetoencephalography recordings that burst activity in sensorimotor cortex occurs in planar spatiotemporal wave-like patterns that dominate along two axes either parallel or perpendicular to the central sulcus. Moreover, we find that the two propagation directions are characterised by distinct anatomical and physiological features. Finally, our results suggest that sensorimotor beta bursts occurring before and after a movement share the same generator but can be distinguished by their anatomical, spectral and spatiotemporal characteristics, indicating distinct functional roles.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Bisected graph matching improves automated pairing of bilaterally homologous neurons from connectomes</a></h4>

              
                Graph matching algorithms attempt to find the best correspondence between the nodes of two networks. These techniques have previously been used to match individual neurons in nanoscale connectomes - in particular, to find pairings of neurons across hemispheres. However, since graph matching techniques deal specifically with two isolated networks, they have only utilized the ipsilateral (same hemisphere) subgraphs when performing the matching. Here, we present a modification to a state-of-the-art graph matching algorithm which allows it to solve what we call the bisected graph matching problem. This modification allows us to also use connections between the brain hemispheres when predicting neuron pairs. Via simulations and real connectome datasets we show that when edge correlation is present between the contralateral (between hemisphere) subgraphs, this approach improves matching accuracy. We expect that our proposed method will improve future endeavors to accurately match neurons across hemispheres in connectomes, and be useful in other applications where the bisected graph matching problem arises.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">AI-guided screen identifies probucol-mediated mitophagy enhancement through modulation of lipid droplets</a></h4>

              
                Failures in mitophagy, a process by which damaged mitochondria are cleared, results in neurodegeneration, while enhancing mitophagy promotes the survival of dopaminergic neurons. Using an artificial intelligence platform, we employed a natural language processing approach to evaluate the semantic similarity of candidate molecules to a set of well-established mitophagy enhancers. Top candidates were screened in a cell-based mitochondrial clearance assay. Probucol, a lipid-lowering drug, was validated across several orthogonal mitophagy assays. In vivo, probucol improved survival, locomotor function and dopaminergic neuron loss in zebrafish and fly models of mitochondrial damage. Probucol functioned independently of PINK1/Parkin but its effects on mitophagy and in vivo depended on ABCA1, which negatively regulated mitophagy following mitochondrial damage. Autophagosome and lysosomal markers were elevated under basal conditions by probucol treatment in addition to increased contact between lipid droplets and mitochondria. Conversely, lipid droplet expansion, which occurs following mitochondrial damage was suppressed by probucol and probucol-mediated mitophagy enhancement required lipid droplets. Probucol-mediated lipid droplet dynamics changes may prime the cell for a more efficient mitophagic response to mitochondrial damage.

	<p>Male predominance is a known feature of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Although ASD mouse models can be useful for elucidating mechanisms underlying abnormal behaviors relevant to human ASD, suitable models to analyze sex differences in ASD pathogenesis remain insufficient. Herein, we used collapsin response mediator protein 4 (Crmp4)-knockout (KO) mice exhibiting ASD-like phenotypes in a male-predominant manner and analyzed ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) to detect potential differences between genotypes and sexes during the early postnatal period. We recorded isolation-induced USVs emitted from wild-type (WT) and Crmp4-KO littermates and compared the total number of USVs between genotypes and sexes. We classified USVs into 10 types based on internal pitch changes, lengths, and shapes and compared the number of USVs in each type by genotypes and sex. Male Crmp4-KO mice exhibited a reduction in the total number of USVs. Crmp4-KO decreased the number of USVs in 7 out of 10 USV types, and male KO mice exhibited a greater reduction than females in 3 of the 7 types. This study offers a suitable ASD animal model and tool for assessing sex-based communication deficits during the early postnatal period, both of which would be valuable for elucidating the underlying mechanism.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: Bilateral peritonsillar abscess with complications of upper airway obstruction [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Peritonsillar abscess is a collection of pus between the tonsillar fibrous capsule and the pharyngeal constrictor muscle. Unilateral peritonsillar abscess is a common complication of acute tonsillitis, whereas bilateral peritonsillar abscess is rare. The incidence of bilateral peritonsillar abscess remains unknown but is estimated to be 4.9% of all peritonsillar abscess cases. Case report: A 20-year-old man came to the emergency room with bilateral peritonsillar abscess and complaining of shortness of breath for two weeks. Physical examination showed muffled voice, 82% oxygen saturation, and inspiratory stridor. The isthmus faucium was narrow, with approximately 30% remaining. Peritonsillar puncture revealed pus mixed with blood. The treatment for this patient included bilateral peritonsillar incision and drainage and intravenous antibiotics of levofloxacin and metronidazole. The patient came to the Ear, Nose, Throat, Head, and Neck (ENTHN) Outpatient Unit eight days after the procedure for a control checkup and was in good condition. Conclusion: We have reported a bilateral peritonsillar abscess with complications of upper airway obstruction, in which we performed incision and drainage. Prompt and appropriate management is needed to avoid unwanted morbidity and mortality.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">ALL-IN meta-analysis: breathing life into living systematic reviews [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Science is justly admired as a cumulative process (“standing on the shoulders of giants”), yet scientific knowledge is typically built on a patchwork of research contributions without much coordination. This lack of efficiency has specifically been addressed in clinical research by recommendations for living systematic reviews and against research waste. We propose to further those recommendations with ALL-IN meta-analysis: Anytime Live and Leading INterim meta-analysis. ALL-IN provides statistical methodology for a meta-analysis that can be updated at any time—reanalyzing after each new observation while retaining type-I error guarantees, live—no need to prespecify the looks, and leading—in the decisions on whether individual studies should be initiated, stopped or expanded, the meta-analysis can be the leading source of information. We illustrate the method for time-to-event data, showing how synthesizing data at interim stages of studies can increase efficiency when studies are slow in themselves to provide the necessary number of events for completion. The meta-analysis can be performed on interim data, but does not have to. The analysis design requires no information about the number of patients in trials or the number of trials eventually included. So it can breathe life into living systematic reviews, through better and simpler statistics, efficiency, collaboration and communication

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Estimated number of deaths directly avoided because of COVID-19 vaccination among older adults in Colombia in 2021: an ecological, longitudinal observational study [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Colombia’s national COVID-19 vaccination plan began in February of 2021. It gave priority to older adults, who constituted 77.7% of deaths from this illness in the year 2020. The main goal of the plan is to decrease specific mortality and the number of serious COVID-19 cases, however, the number of deaths avoided by this strategy is unknown. The objective of this study was to estimate the number of avoided deaths in Colombia by fully vaccinating older adults against COVID-19, during the first year of the implementation of the national vaccination plan. Methods: This study took on the design of an ecological, longitudinal study. Full vaccination coverage for older adults was calculated for each epidemiological week and age group from March to December 2021, based on which the number of avoided COVID-19 deaths was estimated. A sensitivity analysis was performed taking into account variations in the vaccines’ effectiveness by age group. Results: In Colombia, over 5.3 million adults 60 years of age and older received full COVID-19 vaccinations between March and December 2021. During that same period, nearly 46,000 deaths of older adults from this cause were registered. We estimated that vaccination has avoided around 22,000 more older adults from dying from COVID-19 in Colombia, that is, 32.4% of expected deaths in 2021. According to the sensitivity analysis, the number of lives saved ranged from 19,597 to 36,507. Conclusions: Colombia’s strategy to vaccinate older adults against COVID-19 has avoided mortality for this age group from being 48.0% higher than what was observed during the study period. Even more lives have been saved when taking into account the parameters that were defined and the omission of the contribution from partial vaccinations.

                Avian influenza virus subtype H9N2 was first documented in Indonesia in 2017. It has become prevalent in chickens in many provinces of Indonesia as a result of reassortment in live bird markets. Low pathogenic avian influenza subtype H9N2 virus-infected poultry provides a new direction for influenza virus. According to the latest research, the Indonesian H9N2 viruses may have developed through antigenic drift into new genotype, posing a significant hazard to poultry and public health. The latest proof of interspecies transmission proposes that, the next human pandemic variant will be avian influenza virus subtype H9N2. Manipulation and elimination of H9N2 viruses in Indonesia, constant surveillance of viral mutation, and vaccines updates are required to achieve effectiveness. The current review examines should be investigates/assesses/report on the development and evolution of newly identified H9N2 viruses in Indonesia and their vaccination strategy.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Post-pandemic e-learning: a pre-protocol to assess the impact of mobile VR on learner motivation and engagement for VARK learning styles [version 2; peer review: 3 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The Covid-19 pandemic has resulted in an abrupt but accelerated shift to e-learning worldwide. Education in a post-pandemic world has to amalgamate the advantages of e-learning with important pedagogical goals associated with in-person teaching. Although various advanced technologies are present at our fingertips today, we are still unable to use their full potential in teaching and learning. In this regard, mobile VR technology is both cost-efficient, versatile and engaging for students. Developing countries have more smartphone users than developed countries, implying that developing countries, like Malaysia, should utilize mobile or cellphones more significantly. With that in mind, we propose here a pre-protocol to investigate learner motivation and levels of engagement for e-learning with smartphone-integrated VR, based on their VARK (Visual, Auditory, Read/Write, Kinesthetic) learning styles. Proposed methodology: This study intends to look into students from the same age group under the K-12 (particularly grade 9-12) belonging to STEM curriculum. The Google Cardboard VR set will be used as the prime technology for its affordability, easy build feature and variety of available vendors. A mixed-method (survey and activity log/tracking) for data collection is suggested to find the degree of engagement and motivation of the learners’ learning in the mobile VR-assisted e-learning context. The students will be taught a topic using the mobile VR and then be assessed through simple classroom quizzes to assess how well they grasped the concept. The data collected through activity logs (while teaching the topic in mobile VR) and questionnaires will be mapped to each individual learner and organized in a data repository. Further visualization, analysis and investigation will be performed using Smart PLS, Python or R language. Conclusions: The study aims to provide context for smartphone and software companies to develop technologies that could facilitate learner motivation and engagement during the post-pandemic state.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Linear viscoelastic properties of the vertex model for epithelial tissues</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Sijie Tong, Navreeta K. Singh, Rastko Sknepnek, Andrej Košmrlj</p>

Epithelial tissues act as barriers and, therefore, must repair themselves, respond to environmental changes and grow without compromising their integrity. Consequently, they exhibit complex viscoelastic rheological behavior where constituent cells actively tune their mechanical properties to change the overall response of the tissue, e.g., from solid-like to fluid-like. Mesoscopic mechanical properties of epithelia are commonly modeled with the vertex model. While previous studies have predominantly focused on the rheological properties of the vertex model at long time scales, we systematically studied the full dynamic range by applying small oscillatory shear and bulk deformations in both solid-like and fluid-like phases for regular hexagonal and disordered cell configurations. We found that the shear and bulk responses in the fluid and solid phases can be described by standard spring-dashpot viscoelastic models. Furthermore, the solid-fluid transition can be tuned by applying pre-deformation to the system. Our study provides insights into the mechanisms by which epithelia can regulate their rich rheological behavior.

                <p>by Gabrielle Bonnet, Francesco Pizzitutti, Eloy A. Gonzales-Gustavson, Sarah Gabriël, William K. Pan, Hector H. Garcia, Javier A. Bustos, Percy Vilchez, Seth E. O’Neal, for the Cysticercosis Working Group in Peru </p>
Introduction <p>The <i>Taenia solium</i> tapeworm is responsible for cysticercosis, a neglected tropical disease presenting as larvae in the body of a host following taenia egg ingestion. Neurocysticercosis (NCC), the name of the disease when it affects the human central nervous system, is a major cause of epilepsy in developing countries, and can also cause intracranial hypertension, hydrocephalus and death. Simulation models can help identify the most cost-effective interventions before their implementation. Modelling NCC should enable the comparison of a broad range of interventions, from treatment of human taeniasis (presence of an adult taenia worm in the human intestine) to NCC mitigation. It also allows a focus on the actual impact of the disease, rather than using proxies as is the case for other models.</p> Methods <p>This agent-based model is the first model that simulates human NCC and associated pathologies. It uses the output of another model, CystiAgent, which simulates the evolution of pig cysticercosis and human taeniasis, adding human and cyst agents, including a model of cyst location and stage, human symptoms, and treatment. CystiHuman also accounts for delays in the appearance of NCC-related symptoms. It comprises three modules detailing cyst development, seizure probability and timing, and intracranial hypertension/hydrocephalus, respectively. It has been implemented in Java MASON and calibrated in three endemic villages in Peru, then applied to another village (Rica Playa) to compare simulation results with field data in that village.</p> Results and discussion <p>Despite limitations in available field data, parameter values found through calibration are plausible and simulated outcomes in Rica Playa are close to actual values for NCC prevalence and the way it increases with age and cases with single lesions. Initial simulations further suggest that short-term interventions followed by a rapid increase in taeniasis prevalence back to original levels may have limited impacts on NCC prevalence.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Enhancing long-term forecasting: Learning from COVID-19 models</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Hazhir Rahmandad, Ran Xu, Navid Ghaffarzadegan</p>

While much effort has gone into building predictive models of the COVID-19 pandemic, some have argued that early exponential growth combined with the stochastic nature of epidemics make the long-term prediction of contagion trajectories impossible. We conduct two complementary studies to assess model features supporting better long-term predictions. First, we leverage the diverse models contributing to the CDC repository of COVID-19 USA death projections to identify factors associated with prediction accuracy across different projection horizons. We find that better long-term predictions correlate with: (1) capturing the physics of transmission (instead of using black-box models); (2) projecting human behavioral reactions to an evolving pandemic; and (3) resetting state variables to account for randomness not captured in the model before starting projection. Second, we introduce a very simple model, SEIRb, that incorporates these features, and few other nuances, offers informative predictions for as far as 20-weeks ahead, with accuracy comparable with the best models in the CDC set. Key to the long-term predictive power of multi-wave COVID-19 trajectories is capturing behavioral responses endogenously: balancing feedbacks where the perceived risk of death continuously changes transmission rates through the adoption and relaxation of various Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs).

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Scalable and flexible inference framework for stochastic dynamic single-cell models</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Sebastian Persson, Niek Welkenhuysen, Sviatlana Shashkova, Samuel Wiqvist, Patrick Reith, Gregor W. Schmidt, Umberto Picchini, Marija Cvijovic</p>

Understanding the inherited nature of how biological processes dynamically change over time and exhibit intra- and inter-individual variability, due to the different responses to environmental stimuli and when interacting with other processes, has been a major focus of systems biology. The rise of single-cell fluorescent microscopy has enabled the study of those phenomena. The analysis of single-cell data with mechanistic models offers an invaluable tool to describe dynamic cellular processes and to rationalise cell-to-cell variability within the population. However, extracting mechanistic information from single-cell data has proven difficult. This requires statistical methods to infer unknown model parameters from dynamic, multi-individual data accounting for heterogeneity caused by both intrinsic (e.g. variations in chemical reactions) and extrinsic (e.g. variability in protein concentrations) noise. Although several inference methods exist, the availability of efficient, general and accessible methods that facilitate modelling of single-cell data, remains lacking. Here we present a scalable and flexible framework for Bayesian inference in state-space mixed-effects single-cell models with stochastic dynamic. Our approach infers model parameters when intrinsic noise is modelled by either exact or approximate stochastic simulators, and when extrinsic noise is modelled by either time-varying, or time-constant parameters that vary between cells. We demonstrate the relevance of our approach by studying how cell-to-cell variation in carbon source utilisation affects heterogeneity in the budding yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> SNF1 nutrient sensing pathway. We identify hexokinase activity as a source of extrinsic noise and deduce that sugar availability dictates cell-to-cell variability.

                <p>by Lucas Cardoso Lázari, Ivan Rodrigo Wolf, Amanda Piveta Schnepper, Guilherme Targino Valente</p>

Ethanol alters many subsystems of <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, including the cell cycle. Two ethanol-responsive lncRNAs in yeast interact with cell cycle proteins, and here, we investigated the role of these RNAs in cell cycle. Our network dynamic modeling showed that higher and lower ethanol-tolerant strains undergo cell cycle arrest in mitosis and G1 phases, respectively, during ethanol stress. The higher population rebound of the lower ethanol-tolerant phenotype after stress relief responds to the late phase arrest. We found that the lncRNA lnc9136 of SEY6210 (a lower ethanol-tolerant strain) induces cells to skip mitosis arrest. Simulating an overexpression of lnc9136 and analyzing CRISPR–Cas9 mutants lacking this lncRNA suggest that lnc9136 induces a regular cell cycle even under ethanol stress, indirectly regulating Swe1p and Clb1/2 by binding to Gin4p and Hsl1p. Notably, lnc10883 of BY4742 (a higher ethanol-tolerant strain) does not prevent G1 arrest in this strain under ethanol stress. However, lnc19883 circumvents DNA and spindle damage checkpoints, maintaining a functional cell cycle by interacting with Mec1p or Bub1p even in the presence of DNA/spindle damage. Overall, we present the first evidence of direct roles for lncRNAs in regulating yeast cell cycle proteins, the dynamics of this system in different ethanol-tolerant phenotypes, and a new yeast cell cycle model.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A computational model of stereoscopic prey capture in praying mantises</a></h4>

              
                <p>by James O’Keeffe, Sin Hui Yap, Ichasus Llamas-Cornejo, Vivek Nityananda, Jenny C. A. Read</p>

We present a simple model which can account for the stereoscopic sensitivity of praying mantis predatory strikes. The model consists of a single “disparity sensor”: a binocular neuron sensitive to stereoscopic disparity and thus to distance from the animal. The model is based closely on the known behavioural and neurophysiological properties of mantis stereopsis. The monocular inputs to the neuron reflect temporal change and are insensitive to contrast sign, making the sensor insensitive to interocular correlation. The monocular receptive fields have a excitatory centre and inhibitory surround, making them tuned to size. The disparity sensor combines inputs from the two eyes linearly, applies a threshold and then an exponent output nonlinearity. The activity of the sensor represents the model mantis’s instantaneous probability of striking. We integrate this over the stimulus duration to obtain the expected number of strikes in response to moving targets with different stereoscopic disparity, size and vertical disparity. We optimised the parameters of the model so as to bring its predictions into agreement with our empirical data on mean strike rate as a function of stimulus size and disparity. The model proves capable of reproducing the relatively broad tuning to size and narrow tuning to stereoscopic disparity seen in mantis striking behaviour. Although the model has only a single centre-surround receptive field in each eye, it displays qualitatively the same interaction between size and disparity as we observed in real mantids: the preferred size increases as perceived prey distance increases beyond the preferred distance. We show that this occurs because of a stereoscopic “false match” between the leading edge of the stimulus in one eye and its trailing edge in the other; further work will be required to find whether such false matches occur in real mantises. Importantly, the model also displays realistic responses to stimuli with vertical disparity and to pairs of identical stimuli offering a “ghost match”, despite not being fitted to these data. This is the first image-computable model of insect stereopsis, and reproduces key features of both neurophysiology and striking behaviour.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Major environmental drivers determining life and death of cold-water corals through time</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Rodrigo da Costa Portilho-Ramos, Jürgen Titschack, Claudia Wienberg, Michael Georg Siccha Rojas, Yusuke Yokoyama, Dierk Hebbeln</p>

Cold-water corals (CWCs) are the engineers of complex ecosystems forming unique biodiversity hotspots in the deep sea. They are expected to suffer dramatically from future environmental changes in the oceans such as ocean warming, food depletion, deoxygenation, and acidification. However, over the last decades of intense deep-sea research, no extinction event of a CWC ecosystem is documented, leaving quite some uncertainty on their sensitivity to these environmental parameters. Paleoceanographic reconstructions offer the opportunity to align the on- and offsets of CWC proliferation to environmental parameters. Here, we present the synthesis of 6 case studies from the North Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea, revealing that food supply controlled by export production and turbulent hydrodynamics at the seabed exerted the strongest impact on coral vitality during the past 20,000 years, whereas locally low oxygen concentrations in the bottom water can act as an additional relevant stressor. The fate of CWCs in a changing ocean will largely depend on how these oceanographic processes will be modulated. Future ocean deoxygenation may be compensated regionally where the food delivery and food quality are optimal.

                We report a rare case of a vertebro-vertebral arteriovenous fistula (VVAVF) manifesting as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). A 76-year-old female patient presented with progressive weakness, muscle atrophy, fasciculation, and preserved deep tendon reflexes in the right upper limb. Electrophysiological testing showed lower motor neuron dysfunction. The patient was suspected to have ALS, but cervical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed enlarged blood vessels in the spinal canal, which compressed the cervical spinal cord and nerve roots. Angiography showed a shunt from the right vertebral artery to the right intervertebral vein and the vertebral venous plexus; therefore, the patient was diagnosed with VVAVF. Transarterial embolization was performed to obliterate the shunt, and weakness in the patient’s right upper limb subsequently improved. It is worth considering VVAVF as a differential diagnosis of ALS-like diseases.

                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>Duchenne muscular dystrophy is associated with various degrees of cognitive impairment and behavioral disturbances. Emotional and memory deficits also constitute reliable outcome measures to assess efficacy of treatments in the <i>mdx</i> mouse lacking the muscle and neuronal full-length dystrophins. The present study aims at evaluating whether these deficits could be alleviated by the restoration of brain dystrophin.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed intracerebroventricular administration of a new potent tricyclo-DNA antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) containing a full phosphodiester backbone (PO) conjugated to a palmitic acid moiety (tcDNA-ASO), designed to skip the mutated exon 23 of <i>mdx</i> mice.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We first show that the tcDNA-ASO rescues expression of brain dystrophin to 10-30% of WT levels and significantly reduces the abnormal unconditioned fear responses in <i>mdx</i> mice in a dose-dependent manner, 5 weeks post-injection. Exon skipping efficiency, ASO biodistribution, protein restoration and effect on the fear response were optimal with a dose of 400 μg at 6-7 weeks post-injection, with synaptic-like expression in brain tissues such as hippocampus and amygdala. Moreover, this dose of tcDNA-ASO restored long-term memory retention of <i>mdx</i> mice in an object recognition task, but only had minor effects on fear conditioning.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These results suggest for the first time that postnatal re-expression of brain dystrophin could reverse or at least alleviate some cognitive deficits associated with DMD.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Student teachers' perceptions of the collaborative relationships form between universities and inclusive elementary schools in Indonesia [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The collaborative relationship between universities and inclusive elementary schools has not been maximally practiced. The form of collaboration that universities with inclusive elementary schools have carried out is still limited to the need to complete lecture materials during the semester. There is a gap between the theory and practice obtained by student teachers at universities when they have to teach in inclusive elementary schools. As a result, they have not contributed to solving problems that occur in inclusive elementary schools. The collaborative relationship between inclusive elementary schools and universities directly implies that the success of inclusive education is determined by the competence of student teachers whose lecturers have successfully educated them in order to teach in inclusive elementary schools. Compared to the background that the inclusive education system is developing in Indonesia, the researchers investigated student teachers' perceptions at universities regarding inclusive university-inclusive elementary school collaborative relationships. Methods: During data collection, an online survey and in-depth interviews of student teachers about individual experiences and their ideas about the form of inclusive elementary schools-university partnerships was conducted. The data analysis used was a thematic analysis technique. Result: The result summarizes student teachers' statements, revealed three main themes: provision of inclusive education needs, research, and field practice. The student teachers revealed that the collaborative relationship between universities and inclusive elementary schools is essential in order to develop holistic, inclusive practices in a collaborative partnership based on input-needs, which has a two-way impact or benefit for both parties. Conclusions: Furthermore, collaborative relationships must be in the form of long-term programs, such as continuous assistance, and adaptation to the development of inclusive education through lecture materials. To achieve successful inclusive education in Indonesia, we also recommended that the government make policies on multi-sectoral collaboration in order to support inclusive education.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">On the essence of cardiopulmonary resuscitation [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                This article discusses that the essence of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is energy transfer. The concept of occult cardiac arrest is proposed, and cardioversion after cardiac arrest is divided into spontaneous cardioversion and CPR according to the principle of energy transfer: the internal energy transmission of the body makes the cardioversion that is known as spontaneous cardioversion, and energy is mainly transfers from the outside leads to cardioversion, that is, CPR. The concept of domain energy in CPR is proposed, and it is argued that only energy transfer beyond the domain energy can lead to cardioversion in both spontaneous cardioversion and CPR. The principle of energy transfer is used to explain the common clinical electrocardiographic phenomena: dysrhythmia can occur when the energy required for the cardiac functions is insufficient, it is a manifestation of self-protection of the heart and the body, and the mechanism is further argued. It is demonstrated that serious cardiac events, such as ventricular fibrillation and cardiac arrest, are special types of cardiac self-protection. The mechanisms, general rules, and energy properties of modern CPR energy transfer are described, and the influence and interaction of energy transfer principle on the three states of time, space, and energy transfer during CPR are assessed, which will be significant for future research on CPR.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Recommendations for the formatting of Variant Call Format (VCF) files to make plant genotyping data FAIR [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                In this opinion article, we discuss the formatting of files from (plant) genotyping studies, in particular the formatting of metadata in Variant Call Format (VCF) files. The flexibility of the VCF format specification facilitates its use as a generic interchange format across domains but can lead to inconsistency between files in the presentation of metadata. To enable fully autonomous machine actionable data flow, generic elements need to be further specified. We strongly support the merits of the FAIR principles and see the need to facilitate them also through technical implementation specifications. They form a basis for the proposed VCF extensions here. We have learned from the existing application of VCF that the definition of relevant metadata using controlled standards, vocabulary and the consistent use of cross-references via resolvable identifiers (machine-readable) are particularly necessary and propose their encoding. VCF is an established standard for the exchange and publication of genotyping data. Other data formats are also used to capture variant data (for example, the HapMap and the gVCF formats), but none currently have the reach of VCF. For the sake of simplicity, we will only discuss VCF and our recommendations for its use, but these recommendations could also be applied to gVCF. However, the part of the VCF standard relating to metadata (as opposed to the actual variant calls) defines a syntactic format but no vocabulary, unique identifier or recommended content. In practice, often only sparse descriptive metadata is included. When descriptive metadata is provided, proprietary metadata fields are frequently added that have not been agreed upon within the community which may limit long-term and comprehensive interoperability. To address this, we propose recommendations for supplying and encoding metadata, focusing on use cases from plant sciences. We expect there to be overlap, but also divergence, with the needs of other domains.

                Background: Lake Wanchi is one of the Ethiopian lakes that have huge ecological, socio-economic and aesthetic value. This study was conducted to assess the ecological condition of Lake Wanchi using the macroinvertebrate-based index of biotic integrity between September 2016 and should 2017. Methods: Four sampling sites (LWS 1, LWS 2, LWS 3, and LWS 4) were purposively selected. A rapid bioassessment protocol criterion was accustomed to categorize the sites. About 1249 macroinvertebrate individuals were collected using the D-frame net with a mesh size of 500µm. Physico-chemical analysis was also done to assess the link between the benthic macroinvertebrate structure and environmental factors within the system. Results: The benthic index of biotic integrity ranged from 12.54 to 100 and also the sites were categorized into three quality ranks: LWS 1 and 3 as fair, LWS 2 as good, and LWS 4 as very good.  Conclusions: The study confirmed that Lake Wanchi was largely influenced by agricultural and other anthropogenic factors. This study concluded that the benthic index of biotic integrity is an appropriate tool for water quality and ecological assessment in the lakes.

                Background: Management of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and lupus nephritis (LN) in pregnancy has been improving in recent decades. However, SLE can still lead to adverse pregnancy outcomes if not appropriately treated. Optimal dose of steroids, as one of the most commonly used for the treatment of SLE and LN in pregnancy is still a subject of debate. In this review, we determine the pregnancy outcomes in SLE and LN patients treated with low vs high doses of steroids. Methods: ProQuest, Pubmed, Science Direct, Scopus, and Web of Science were carefully searched for relevant studies published in English. A total of 2,596 studies were reviewed. We extracted the data from previous studies showing the use of steroids treatment in high-dose and low-dose related to pregnancy outcomes. We provide larger data about maternal (preterm rupture of membrane, fetal loss, pre-eclampsia, and flare up) and fetal outcomes (prematurity, small gestational age, low birth weight) receiving high vs low steroid in patients with SLE and LN in this systematic review and meta-analysis. Results: A total of 13 studies were included. Of these, one study discussed a group with LN and 12 other studies discussed SLE with related maternal and fetal outcomes. Maternal outcome in the group with low-dose steroid showed a lower risk of fetal loss (odds ratio (OR): 1.93; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01-3.70), but there were no differences in other maternal outcomes. The low-dose steroid group showed a better fetal outcome, with a lower risk of prematurity (OR: 3.06; 95% CI 1.98-4.71), small gestational age (OR: 2.63; 95% CI 1.15-6.00), and low birth weight (OR: 2.43; 95% CI 1.23-4.79). Conclusions: In pregnant patients with SLE or LN, high-dose steroids are associated with the high risk of fetal loss during pregnancy, preterm birth, small gestational age, and low birth weight.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Unprecedented early-summer heat stress and forecast of coral bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef, 2021-2022 [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                The Great Barrier Reef (GBR) is predicted to undergo its sixth mass coral bleaching event during the Southern Hemisphere summer of 2021-2022. Coral bleaching-level heat stress over the GBR is forecast to start earlier than any previous year in the satellite record (1985-present). The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Coral Reef Watch (CRW) near real-time satellite-based heat stress products were used to investigate early-summer sea surface temperature (SST) and heat stress conditions on the GBR during late 2021. As of 14 December 2021, values of instantaneous heat stress (Coral Bleaching HotSpots) and accumulated heat stress over a 12-week running window (Degree Heating Weeks) on the GBR were unprecedented in the satellite record. Further, 89% of GBR satellite reef pixels for this date in 2021 had a positive seven-day SST trend of greater than 0.2 degrees Celsius/week. Background temperatures (the minimum temperature over the previous 29 days) were alarmingly high, with 87% of GBR reef pixels on 14 December 2021 being greater than the maximum SST over that same 29-day period for any year from 1985-2020. The GBR is starting the 2021-2022 summer season with more accumulated heat than ever before, which could have disastrous consequences for the health, recovery, and future of this critical reef system.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Evaluation of clinical, histology, TNF-α, and collagen expressions on oral ulcer in rats after treatment with areca nut and chrysanthemum oral gel [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 2 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Areca nut (Areca catechu Linn.) is the seed of the fruit of the oriental palm that is commonly used among Southeast Asian communities. Chrysanthemum (Dendrathema grandiflora) is a flowering plant originating from East Asia and dominantly grows in China. Both of these plants have strong antioxidant activities. To investigate the mechanism of their wound healing activities, we prepared areca nut and chrysanthemum polyethylene oral gel and performed several in vivo assays using Sprague–Dawley rats. Methods: Sprague–Dawley rats were divided into five groups: Negative control group (rats with base gel treatment), positive control group (rats treated with triamcinolone acetonide), F1 (treatment with 20% areca nut:80% chrysanthemum), F2 (treatment with 50% areca nut:50% chrysanthemum), and F3 (treatment with 80% areca nut:20% chrysanthemum). Traumatic ulcers were performed on the buccal mucosa of all experimental animals that received topical oral gel and triamcinolone acetonide twice a day for seven days. The clinical and histological characteristics were analyzed and scored. Results: During the six days, the ulcerated area receded linearly over time and was completely cicatrized in F2, F3, and positive control group (Dependent t-test, p<0.05). There were significant increases in body weight in F2 and positive control groups. There were no significant differences between groups in histology examination (Kruskal Wallis test, p<0.05). The moderate score of TNF-α levels was seen in F2 and positive control groups (ANOVA/Tukey test, p<0.05). In the collagenases assay, a high concentration of areca nut (F3) induced the abundance of collagen during the ulcer healing process. Conclusions: The combination of areca nut and chrysanthemum extract in the oral gel can optimize the healing of traumatic oral ulcers in Sprague-Dawley rats through the increase of TNF-α and collagen deposition.

                Background: This study focuses on identifying non-technical aspects that influence the sustainability of communal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in a peri-urban area of Indonesia. Methods: A questionnaire survey was conducted by random sampling using a method of descriptive analysis that combines qualitative and quantitative approaches. Economic support for communal WWTPs was measured by the community’s Willingness to Pay (WTP) and Ability to Pay (ATP). Results: The results indicate that social dimension, such as a community’s level of participation are critically important in sustaining communal WWTPs. In addition, institutional dimension influences the degree of satisfaction a community has toward the WWTP management. This support is reinforced by social capital in the form of a philosophy of mutual cooperation, like gotong royong (cooperation by members of a community to achieve a common goal) and swadaya (self-reliance). Conclusions: The findings of this study can be used in Indonesia to make policy recommendations for managing and ensuring sustainability of communal WWTPs on a non-technical dimension. Additionally, gotong royong deserves to be promoted internationally as a fundamental value for fostering participation and contribution.

                Portable electronic devices and miniaturized devices would require different operating voltages and load current which can be powered through DC-DC converter. In this paper, the proposed converter is based on a multiple topology of DC-DC converter circuit for more than one voltage gain regions using switched capacitor (SC) method. The post layout implementation showed that the high efficiency networks are achieved with low voltage drop and low internal resistance. The efficiency of 95% and 85% are shown, on the networks in the 1/2 and 2/3 voltage gain regions respectively, proving that this method is advantageous compared to other literature papers.

                Background: One of the fastest spreading vector-borne diseases in tropical and subtropical regions is dengue, which generates cost overruns for public health entities. Several factors can influence the dynamics of dengue virus transmission: environmental and climatic (abundance of vectors), interactions between hosts (infections by asymptomatic individuals), and population immunological factors. Given these conditions, it is necessary to carry out theoretical studies based on meteorological factors and asymptomatic transmission that are associated with both the existence of the vector and its incidence, in order to provide a scientific basis for health entities in decision-making. Methods: A mathematical model based on nonlinear ordinary differential equations is proposed to interpret the dynamics of dengue transmission in humans coupled to the dynamics of the Aedes aegypti species, considering the population of symptomatic and asymptomatic infected humans and the effect of temperature variability. The basic reproduction number was found and some simulation results based on the Runge-Kutta numerical method were obtained. Results: The simulations showed that the temperature had a directly proportional relationship with the basic reproduction number. The cases of infected people and carrier mosquitoes increased when the temperature peaks increased drastically; in low temperatures the infection persisted with low morbidity due to the survival of asymptomatic people. Conclusions: High temperatures tolerable by mosquitoes increase their life expectancy and their numbers in the environment which, together with a reservoir of asymptomatic infected people, leads to a higher incidence of the dengue virus in certain seasons or maintains its circulation in seasons of low temperatures, despite lower vector survival rates.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">Construction of complex memories via parallel distributed cortical–subcortical iterative integration</a></h4>

              
                The construction of complex engrams requires hippocampal–cortical interactions. These include both direct interactions and ones via often-overlooked subcortical loops. Here, we review the anatomical organization of a hierarchy of parallel ‘Papez’ loops through the hypothalamus that are homologous in mammals from rats to humans. These hypothalamic loops supplement direct hippocampal–cortical connections with iterative reprocessing paced by theta rhythmicity. We couple existing anatomy and lesion data with theory to propose that recirculation in these loops progressively enhances desired connections, while reducing interference from competing external goals and internal associations.

                Tuberculosis is a respiratory disease that is treatable with antibiotics. An increasing prevalence of resistance means that to ensure a good treatment outcome it is desirable to test the susceptibility of each infection to different antibiotics. Conventionally this is done by culturing a clinical sample and then exposing aliquots to a panel of antibiotics, Using 96-well broth micro dilution plates with each well containing a lyophilised predetermined amount of an antibiotic is a convenient and cost-effective way to measure the MICs of several drugs at once for a clinical sample. Although accurate, this is still an expensive and slow process that requires highly skilled and experienced laboratory scientists. Here we show that, through the BashTheBug project hosted on the Zooniverse citizen science platform, a crowd of volunteers can reproducibly and accurately determine the MICs for 13 drugs and that simply taking the median or mode of 11-17 independent classifications is sufficient. There is therefore a potential role for crowds to support (but not supplant) the role of experts in antibiotic susceptibility testing.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Single-cell transcriptome reveals insights into the development and function of the zebrafish ovary</a></h4>

              
                Zebrafish are an established research organism that has made many contributions to our understanding of vertebrate tissue and organ development, yet there are still significant gaps in our understanding of the genes that regulate gonad development, sex, and reproduction. Unlike the development of many organs, such as the brain and heart that form during the first few days of development, zebrafish gonads do not begin to form until the larval stage (≥5 dpf). Thus, forward genetic screens have identified very few genes required for gonad development. In addition, bulk RNA sequencing studies which identify genes expressed in the gonads do not have the resolution necessary to define minor cell populations that may play significant roles in development and function of these organs. To overcome these limitations, we have used single-cell RNA sequencing to determine the transcriptomes of cells isolated from juvenile zebrafish ovaries. This resulted in the profiles of 10,658 germ cells and 14,431 somatic cells. Our germ cell data represents all developmental stages from germline stem cells to early meiotic oocytes. Our somatic cell data represents all known somatic cell types, including follicle cells, theca cells and ovarian stromal cells. Further analysis revealed an unexpected number of cell subpopulations within these broadly defined cell types. To further define their functional significance, we determined the location of these cell subpopulations within the ovary. Finally, we used gene knockout experiments to determine the roles of <i>foxl2l</i> and <i>wnt9b</i> for oocyte development and sex determination and/or differentiation, respectively. Our results reveal novel insights into zebrafish ovarian development and function and the transcriptome profiles will provide a valuable resource for future studies.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Selection for infectivity profiles in slow and fast epidemics, and the rise of SARS-CoV-2 variants</a></h4>

              
                Evaluating the characteristics of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern is essential to inform pandemic risk assessment. A variant may grow faster if it produces a larger number of secondary infections ('R advantage') or if the timing of secondary infections (generation time) is better. So far, assessments have largely focused on deriving the R advantage assuming the generation time was unchanged. Yet, knowledge of both is needed to anticipate impact. Here we develop an analytical framework to investigate the contribution of <i>both</i> the R advantage and generation time to the growth advantage of a variant. It is known that selection on a variant with larger R increases with levels of transmission in the community. We additionally show that variants conferring earlier transmission are more strongly favoured when the historical strains have fast epidemic growth, while variants conferring later transmission are more strongly favoured when historical strains have slow or negative growth. We develop these conceptual insights into a new statistical framework to infer both the R advantage and generation time of a variant. On simulated data, our framework correctly estimates both parameters when it covers time periods characterized by different epidemiological contexts. Applied to data for the Alpha and Delta variants in England and in Europe, we find that Alpha confers a +54% [95% CI, 45-63%] R advantage compared to previous strains, and Delta +140% [98-182%] compared to Alpha, and mean generation times are similar to historical strains for both variants. This work helps interpret variant frequency dynamics and will strengthen risk assessment for future variants of concern.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">T cells discriminate between groups C1 and C2 HLA-C</a></h4>

              
                Dimorphic amino acids at positions 77 and 80 delineate HLA-C allotypes into two groups, C1 and C2, which associate with disease through interactions with C1 and C2-specific natural killer cell receptors. How the C1/C2 dimorphism affects T cell recognition is unknown. Using HLA-C allotypes that differ only by the C1/C2-defining residues, we found that KRAS-G12D neoantigen-specific T cell receptors (TCR) discriminated between C1 and C2 presenting the same KRAS-G12D peptides. Structural and functional experiments, and immunopeptidomics analysis revealed that Ser77 in C1 and Asn77 in C2 influence amino acid preference near the peptide C-terminus (pW), including the pW-1 position, in which C1 favors small and C2 prefers large residues. This resulted in weaker TCR affinity for KRAS-G12D-bound C2-HLA-C despite conserved TCR contacts. Thus, the C1/C2 dimorphism on its own impacts peptide presentation and HLA-C restricted T cell responses, with implications in disease, including adoptive T cell therapy targeting KRAS-G12D-induced cancers.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">SARS-CoV-2 host-shutoff impacts innate NK cell functions, but antibody-dependent NK activity is strongly activated through non-spike antibodies</a></h4>

              
                The outcome of infection is dependent on the ability of viruses to manipulate the infected cell to evade immunity, and the ability of the immune response to overcome this evasion. Understanding this process is key to understanding pathogenesis, genetic risk factors, and both natural and vaccine-induced immunity. SARS-CoV-2 antagonises the innate interferon response, but whether it manipulates innate cellular immunity is unclear. An unbiased proteomic analysis determined how cell surface protein expression is altered on SARS-CoV-2-infected lung epithelial cells, showing downregulation of activating NK ligands B7-H6, MICA, ULBP2, and Nectin1, with minimal effects on MHC-I. This occurred at the level of protein synthesis, could be mediated by Nsp1 and Nsp14, and correlated with a reduction in NK cell activation. This identifies a novel mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 host-shutoff antagonises innate immunity. Later in the disease process, strong antibody-dependent NK cell activation (ADNKA) developed. These responses were sustained for at least 6 months in most patients, and led to high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Depletion of spike-specific antibodies confirmed their dominant role in neutralisation, but these antibodies played only a minor role in ADNKA compared to antibodies to other proteins, including ORF3a, Membrane, and Nucleocapsid. In contrast, ADNKA induced following vaccination was focussed solely on spike, was weaker than ADNKA following natural infection, and was not boosted by the second dose. These insights have important implications for understanding disease progression, vaccine efficacy, and vaccine design.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Canonical Wnt signaling and the regulation of divergent mesenchymal Fgf8 expression in Axolotl limb development and regeneration</a></h4>

              
                The expression of Fibroblast growth factors (Fgf) ligands in a specialized epithelial compartment, the Apical Ectodermal Ridge (AER), is a conserved feature of limb development across vertebrate species. In vertebrates, <i>Fgf 4, 8, 9</i>, and <i>17</i> are all expressed in the AER. An exception to this paradigm is the salamander (axolotl) developing and regenerating limb, where key Fgf ligands are expressed in the mesenchyme. The mesenchymal expression of Amex.<i>Fgf8</i> in axolotl has been suggested to be critical for regeneration. To date, there is little knowledge regarding what controls Amex.<i>Fgf8</i> expression in the axolotl limb mesenchyme. A large body of mouse and chick studies have defined a set of transcription factors and canonical Wnt signaling as the main regulators of epidermal <i>Fgf8</i> expression in these organisms. In this study, we address the hypothesis that alterations to one or more of these components during evolution has resulted in mesenchymal Amex.<i>Fgf8</i> expression in the axolotl. To sensitively quantify gene expression with spatial precision, we combined optical clearing of whole-mount axolotl limb tissue with single molecule fluorescen <i>in situ</i> hybridization and a semi-automated quantification pipeline. Several candidate upstream components were found expressed in the axolotl ectoderm, indicating that they are not direct regulators of Amex.<i>Fgf8</i> expression. We found that Amex.<i>Wnt3a</i> is expressed in axolotl limb epidermis, similarly to chicken and mouse. However, unlike in amniotes, Wnt target genes are activated preferentially in limb mesenchyme rather than in epidermis. Inhibition and activation of Wnt signaling results in downregulation and upregulation of mesenchymal Amex.<i>Fgf8</i> expression respectively. These results implicate a shift in tissue responsiveness to canonical Wnt signaling from epidermis to mesenchyme as one step contributing to the unique mesenchymal Amex.<i>Fgf8</i> expression seen in the axolotl.

Here, we show that <i>Brucella</i>, the causative agent of brucellosis, the most prevalent bacterial zoonosis globally, subverts this immune defense pathway by activating regulated IRE1α-dependent decay (RIDD) of <i>Bloc1s1</i> mRNA encoding BLOS1, a protein that promotes endosome–lysosome fusion. RIDD-deficient cells and mice harboring a RIDD-incompetent variant of IRE1α were resistant to infection. Inactivation of the <i>Bloc1s1</i> gene impaired the ability to assemble BLOC-1-related complex (BORC), resulting in differential recruitment of BORC-related lysosome trafficking components, perinuclear trafficking of <i>Brucella</i>-containing vacuoles (BCVs), and enhanced susceptibility to infection. The RIDD-resistant <i>Bloc1s1</i> variant maintains the integrity of BORC and a higher-level association of BORC-related components that promote centrifugal lysosome trafficking, resulting in enhanced BCV peripheral trafficking and lysosomal destruction, and resistance to infection. These findings demonstrate that host RIDD activity on BLOS1 regulates <i>Brucella</i> intracellular parasitism by disrupting BORC-directed lysosomal trafficking. Notably, coronavirus murine hepatitis virus also subverted the RIDD–BLOS1 axis to promote intracellular replication. Our work establishes BLOS1 as a novel immune defense factor whose activity is hijacked by diverse pathogens.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Redox regulation of PTPN22 affects the severity of T-cell-dependent autoimmune inflammation</a></h4>

              
                Chronic autoimmune diseases are associated with mutations in PTPN22, a modifier of T cell receptor (TCR) signaling. As with all protein tyrosine phosphatases, the activity of PTPN22 is redox regulated, but if or how such regulation can modulate inflammatory pathways in vivo is not known. To determine this, we created a mouse with a cysteine-to-serine mutation at position 129 in PTPN22 (C129S), a residue proposed to alter the redox regulatory properties of PTPN22 by forming a disulfide with the catalytic C227 residue. The C129S mutant mouse showed a stronger T-cell-dependent inflammatory response and development of T-cell-dependent autoimmune arthritis due to enhanced TCR signaling and activation of T cells, an effect neutralized by a mutation in Ncf1, a component of the NOX2 complex. Activity assays with purified proteins suggest that the functional results can be explained by an increased sensitivity to oxidation of the C129S mutated PTPN22 protein. We also observed that the disulfide of native PTPN22 can be directly reduced by the thioredoxin system, while the C129S mutant lacking this disulfide was less amenable to reductive reactivation. In conclusion, we show that PTPN22 functionally interacts with Ncf1 and is regulated by oxidation via the noncatalytic C129 residue and oxidation-prone PTPN22 leads to increased severity in the development of T-cell-dependent autoimmunity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The Indirect Pathway of the Basal Ganglia Promotes Negative Reinforcement, But Not Motor Suppression</a></h4>

              
                Optogenetic stimulation of Adora2a receptor expressing spiny projection neurons (A2A-SPN) in the striatum drives locomotor suppression and negative reinforcement, results attributed to activation of the indirect pathway. The sole long-range projection target of A2A-SPNs is the external globus pallidus (GPe). Unexpectedly, we found that inhibition of the GPe did not suppress movement, but did drive robust negative reinforcement in a real-time place preference assay. Within the striatum, A2A-SPNs inhibit other SPNs through a short-range inhibitory collateral network, and we found that optogenetic stimuli that drove motor suppression shared a common mechanism of recruiting this inhibitory collateral network. Our results suggest that the indirect pathway plays a more prominent role in negative reinforcement than in motor control and challenges the assumption that activity of A2A-SPNs is synonymous with indirect pathway activity.

                The motor cortex controls skilled arm movement by recruiting a variety of targets in the nervous system, and it is important to understand the emergent activity in these regions as refinement of a motor skill occurs. One fundamental projection of the motor cortex is to the cerebellum. However, the emergent activity in the motor cortex and the cerebellum that appears as a dexterous motor skill is consolidated is incompletely understood. Here, we report on low-frequency oscillatory (LFO) activity that emerges in cortico-cerebellar networks with learning the reach-to-grasp motor skill. We chronically recorded the motor and the cerebellar cortices in rats which revealed the emergence of coordinated movement-related activity in the local-field potentials (LFPs) as the reaching skill consolidated. We found that the local and cross-area spiking activity was coordinated with LFOs. Finally, we also found that these neural dynamics were more prominently expressed during accurate behavior. This work furthers our understanding on emergent dynamics in the cortico-cerebellar loop that underlie learning and execution of precise skilled movement.

                Survival requires the selection of appropriate behaviour in response to threats, and dysregulated defensive reactions are associated with psychiatric illnesses such as posttraumatic stress and panic disorder.1 Threat-induced behaviour, including panic-like flight, is controlled by neuronal circuits in the central amygdala (CeA)2; however, the source of neuronal excitation to the CeA that contributes to these high-intensity defensive responses is unknown. Here we used a combination of neuroanatomical mapping, in-vivo calcium imaging, functional manipulations, and slice physiology to characterize a previously unknown projection from the dorsal peduncular (DP) prefrontal cortex to the CeA. DP-to-CeA neurons are glutamatergic and specifically target the medial CeA. Using a behavioural paradigm that elicits both freezing and flight, we found that CeA-projecting DP neurons are activated by high-intensity threats in a context-dependent manner. Functional manipulations revealed that the DP-to-CeA pathway is necessary for both avoidance behaviour and flight. Furthermore, we found that DP projections preferentially target distinct medial CeA neuronal populations linked to flight. These results are the first demonstration that the prefrontal cortex exerts direct, top-down control of the CeA and elucidate a non-canonical pathway regulating panic-like fear responses.

                Human cortical expansion has occurred non-uniformly across the brain. We assessed the genetic architecture of cortical global expansion and regionalization by comparing two sets of genome-wide association studies of 24 cortical regions with and without adjustment for global measures (i.e. total surface area, mean cortical thickness) using a genetically-informed parcellation in 32,488 adults. We found 393 and 756 significant loci with and without adjusting for globals, respectively, among which 8% and 45% loci were associated with more than one region. Results from analyses without adjustment for globals recounted loci associated with global measures. Genetic factors that contribute to total surface area of the cortex particularly expand anterior/frontal regions, whereas those contributing to thicker cortex predominantly increase dorsal/frontal-parietal thickness. Interactome-based analyses revealed significant overlap of global and regional genetic modules, enriched for neurodevelopmental and immune system pathways. Consideration of global measures is important in understanding the genetic variants underlying cortical morphology.

                Stress resilience is the ability of neuronal networks to maintain function despite exposure to stress. In this study, we investigated whether stress resilience is an actively developed dynamic process in adult mice. To assess the resilient and anhedonic behavioral phenotypes developed after induction the chronic unpredictable stress, we quantitatively characterized the structural and functional plasticity of excitatory synapses in the hippocampus using a combination of proteomic, electrophysiological, and imaging methods. Our results indicate that stress resilience is a dynamic and multifactorial process manifested by structural, functional, and molecular changes in synapses. We reveal that chronic stress influences palmitoylation, the profiles of which differ between resilient and anhedonic animals. We also observed that stress resilience is associated with structural compensatory plasticity of the postsynaptic parts of synapses.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sparse RNNs can support high-capacity classification</a></h4>

              
                Feedforward network models performing classification tasks rely on highly convergent output units that collect the information passed on by preceding layers. Although convergent output-unit like neurons may exist in some biological neural circuits, notably the cerebellar cortex, neocortical circuits do not exhibit any obvious candidates for this role; instead they are highly recurrent. We investigate whether a sparsely connected recurrent neural network (RNN) can perform classification in a distributed manner without ever bringing all of the relevant information to a single convergence site. Our model is based on a sparse RNN that performs classification dynamically. Specifically, the interconnections of the RNN are trained to resonantly amplify the magnitude of responses to some external inputs but not others. The amplified and non-amplified responses then form the basis for binary classification. Furthermore, the network acts as an evidence accumulator and maintains its decision even after the input is turned off. Despite highly sparse connectivity, learned recurrent connections allow input information to flow to every neuron of the RNN, providing the basis for distributed computation. In this arrangement, the minimum number of synapses per neuron required to reach maximum memory capacity scales only logarithmically with network size. The model is robust to various types of noise, works with different activation and loss functions and with both backpropagation- and Hebbian-based learning rules. The RNN can also be constructed with a split excitation-inhibition architecture with little reduction in performance.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Deep Learning-Based Parameter Estimation for Neurophysiological Models of Neuroimaging Data</a></h4>

              
                Connectome-based neural mass modelling is the emerging computational neuroscience paradigm for simulating large-scale network dynamics observed in whole-brain activity measurements such as fMRI, M/EEG, and related techniques. Estimating physiological parameters by fitting these models to empirical data is challenging however, due to large network sizes, often physiologically detailed fast-timescale system equations, and the need for long (e.g. tens of minutes) simulation runs. Here we introduce a novel approach to connectome-based neural mass model parameter estimation by employing optimization tools developed for deep learning. We cast the system of differential equations representing both neural and haemodynamic activity dynamics as a deep neural network, implemented within a widely used machine learning programming environment (PyTorch). This allows us to use robust industry-standard optimization algorithms, automatic differentiation for computation of gradients, and other useful functionality. The approach is demonstrated using a connectome-based network with nodal dynamics specified by the two-state reduced-Wong-Wang mean-field model equations, which we use here as a model of fMRI-measured activity and correlation fluctuations. Additional optimization constraints are explored and prove fruitful, including restricting the model to domains of parameter space near a bifurcation point that yield metastable dynamics. Using these techniques, we first show robust recovery of physiological model parameters in synthetic data and then, as a proof-of-principle, apply the framework to modelling of empirical resting-state fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project database. For resting state activity, the system can be understood as a deep net that receives uncorrelated noise on its input layer, which is transformed into network-wide modelled functional connectivity on its output layer. This is consistent with the prevailing conception in theoretical neuroscience of resting-state functional connectivity patterns as an emergent phenomenon that is driven by (effectively) random activity fluctuations, which are then in turn spatiotemporally filtered by anatomical connectivity and local neural dynamics.

                Successive auditory inputs are rarely independent, their relationships ranging from local transitions between elements to hierarchical and nested representations. In many situations, humans retrieve these dependencies even from limited datasets. However, this learning at multiple scale levels is poorly understood. Here We used the formalism proposed by network science to study the representation of local and higher order structures, and their interaction, in auditory sequences. We show that human adults exhibited biases in their perception of local transitions between elements, which made them sensitive to high-order structures such as network communities. This behavior is consistent with the creation of a parsimonious simplified model from the evidence they receive, achieved by pruning and completing relationships between network elements. This observation suggests that the brain does not rely on exact memories but compressed representations of the world. Moreover, this bias can be analytically modeled by a memory/efficiency trade-off. This model correctly account for previous findings, including local transition probabilities as well as high order network structures, unifying statistical learning across scales. We finally propose putative brain implementations of such bias.

                Responses to natural stimuli in area V4, a mid-level area of the visual ventral stream, are well predicted by features from convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on image classification. This result has been taken as evidence for the functional role of V4 in object classification. However, we currently do not know if and to what extent V4 plays a role in solving other computational objectives. Here, we investigated normative accounts of V4 by predicting macaque single-neuron responses to natural images from the representations extracted by 23 CNNs trained on different computer vision tasks including semantic, geometric, 2D, and 3D visual tasks. We found that semantic classification tasks do indeed provide the best predictive features for V4. Other tasks (3D in particular) followed very closely in performance, but a similar pattern of tasks performance emerged when predicting the activations of a network exclusively trained on object recognition. Thus, our results support V4's main functional role in semantic processing. At the same time, they suggest that V4's affinity to various 3D and 2D stimulus features found by electrophysiologists could be a corollary of a semantic functional goal.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Precision motor timing via scalar input fluctuations</a></h4>

              
                Complex motor skills like playing piano require precise timing over long periods, without errors accumulating between subprocesses like the left and right hand movements. While biological models can produce motor-like sequences, how the brain quenches timing errors is not well understood. Motivated by songbirds, where the left and right brain nuclei governing song sequences do not connect but may receive low-dimensional thalamic input, we present a model where timing errors in an autonomous sequence generator are continually corrected by one-dimensional input fluctuations. We show in a spiking neural network model how such input can rapidly correct temporal offsets in a propagating spike pulse, recapitulating the precise timing seen in songbird brains. In a reduced, more general model, we show that such timing correction emerges when the spatial profile of the input over the sequence sufficiently reflects its temporal fluctuations, yielding *time-locking attractors* that slow advanced sequences and hasten lagging ones, up to the input timescale. Unlike models without fluctuating input, our model predicts anti-correlated durations of adjacent segments of the output sequence, which we verify in recorded zebra finch songs. This work provides a bioplausible picture of how temporal precision could arise in extended motor sequences and generally how low-dimensional input could continuously coordinate time-varying output signals.

                Multiple studies have recognized the involvement of the complement cascade during Alzheimers disease pathogenesis; however, the specific role of C5a-C5aR1 signaling in the progression of this neurodegenerative disease is still not clear. Furthermore, its potential as a therapeutic target to treat AD still remains to be elucidated. Canonically, generation of the anaphylatoxin C5a as the result of complement activation and interaction with its receptor C5aR1 triggers a potent inflammatory response. Previously, genetic ablation of C5aR1 in a mouse model of Alzheimers disease exerted a protective effect by preventing cognitive deficits. Here, using PMX205, a potent, specific C5aR1 antagonist, in the Tg2576 mouse model of Alzheimers disease we show a striking reduction in dystrophic neurites in parallel with the reduced amyloid load, rescue of the excessive pre-synaptic loss associated with AD cognitive impairment and the polarization of microglial gene expression towards a DAM-like phenotype that are consistent with the neuroprotective effects seen. These data support the beneficial effect of a pharmacological inhibition of C5aR1 as a promising therapeutic approach to treat Alzheimers disease. Supportive of the safety of this treatment is the recent FDA-approval of another other C5a receptor 1 antagonist, Avacopan, as a treatment for autoimmune inflammatory diseases.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Mating disrupts morning anticipation in Drosophila melanogaster females 2</a></h4>

              
                After mating, the physiology of Drosophila females undergoes several important changes, some of which are reflected in their rest-activity cycles. To explore the hypothesis that mating modifies the temporal organization of locomotor activity patterns, we recorded the fly activity by a video tracking method. Monitoring rest-activity patterns under light/dark (LD) cycles indicated that mated females lose their ability to anticipate the night-day transition, in stark contrast to males and virgins; this postmating response is mediated by the sex peptide (SP) acting mainly on pickpocket ( ppk ) expressing neurons, since reducing expression of the SP receptor (SPR) in these neurons restores the ability to anticipate the LD transition in mated females. We further provide evidence of connectivity between PPK + neurons and the pigment-dispersing factor (PDF)-positive ventral lateral neurons (sLNv), which play a central role in the temporal organization of daily activity. Since PDF has been associated to the generation of the morning activity peak, we hypothesized that the mating signal could modulate PDF levels. Indeed, mated females have reduced PDF levels at the dorsal protocerebrum; moreover, SPR downregulation in PPK + neurons mimics PDF levels observed in males. In sum, our results are consistent with a model whereby mating-triggered signals reaches clock neurons in the fly central nervous system to modulate the temporal organization of circadian behavior according to the needs of the new status.

                Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are exposed to a variety of stressors owing to their behavioral traits. Cortisol is a hormone typically associated with stress, and its concentration and response to stress are higher in individuals with ASD than in controls. The mechanisms underlying cortisol dysregulation in ASD have been explored in rodents. Although rodent models have successfully replicated the major symptoms of autism (i.e., impaired vocal communication, social interaction deficits, and restricted/repetitive patterns of behavior), evidence suggests that the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis system differs between rodents and primates. We developed an ASD model in the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), a New World monkey, utilizing prenatal exposure to valproic acid (VPA). In this study, we collected the salivary cortisol levels in VPA-exposed and unexposed marmosets in the morning and afternoon. Our results revealed that both VPA-exposed and unexposed marmosets showed similar diurnal changes in cortisol levels, which were lower in the afternoon than in the morning. However, heightened cortisol levels were observed in VPA-exposed marmosets in the morning, but not in the afternoon. These results are consistent with those of ASD in humans. Our results suggest that VPA-exposed marmosets show similarities not only in their behavioral patterns and brain pathologies, which we have reported previously but also in hormonal regulation, validating the usefulness of VPA-exposed marmosets also as a tool for ASD stress research.

                Microglia invade the neuroblast migratory corridor of the rostral migratory stream (RMS) early in development. This work examines how microglia maintain the homeostatic conditions permissive to neuroblast migration in the RMS during the early postnatal period. GFP labeled microglia in CX3CR-1GFP/+ mice assemble primarily along the outer borders of the RMS during the first postnatal week, where they exhibit predominantly an ameboid morphology and associate with migrating neuroblasts. Microglia ablation for 3 days postnatally does not impact the density of pulse labeled BrdU+ neuroblasts nor the distance migrated by tdTomato electroporated neuroblasts in the RMS. However, microglia wrap DsRed-labeled neuroblasts in the RMS of P7 CX3CR-1GFP/+;DCXDsRed/+ mice and express the phagocytic markers CD68, CLEC7A and MERTK, suggesting active phagocytosis of neuroblasts in the developing RMS. Microglia depletion for 14 days postnatally further induced an accumulation of DCX+ neuroblasts and CC3+ apoptotic cells in the RMS, a wider RMS and extended patency of the lateral ventricle extension in the olfactory bulb. These findings illustrate the importance of microglia phagocytosis in maintaining the homeostasis of the early postnatal RMS.

                The predictive nature of the hippocampus is thought to be useful for memory-guided cognitive behaviors. Inspired by the reinforcement learning literature, this notion has been formalized as a predictive map called the successor representation (SR). The SR captures a number of observations about hippocampal activity. However, the algorithm does not provide a neural mechanism for how such representations arise. Here, we show the dynamics of a recurrent neural network naturally calculate the SR when the synaptic weights match the transition probability matrix. Interestingly, the predictive horizon can be flexibly modulated simply by changing the network gain. We derive simple, biologically plausible learning rules to learn the SR in a recurrent network. We test our model with realistic inputs and match hippocampal data recorded during random foraging. Taken together, our results suggest that the SR is more accessible in neural circuits than previously thought and can support a broad range of cognitive functions.

                Goal-directed choices that are not triggered by external cues arise from internal representations of the outcomes. The use of a stimulus to specify when to act, which option to take, or whether to explore, has led to consider the reward circuit as a feedforward set of modules carrying independent computations. Here, we develop an uncued task in which mice self-determine the initiation, direction, vigor and pace of their actions based on their knowledge of the outcomes. Using electrophysiological recordings, pharmacology and optogenetics, we identify a sequence of oscillations and firing in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), orbitofrontal (OFC) and prefrontal cortices (PFC) that co-encodes and co-determines self-initiation and choices. This sequence appeared with learning as an unguided realignment of spontaneous dynamics. The interactions between the structures depended on the reward context, in particular regarding the uncertainty associated with the different options. We suggest that self-generated choices arise from a distributed circuit based on an OFC-VTA core setting whether to wait or to initiate actions, while the PFC is specifically engaged by reward uncertainty to participate in both the selection and pace of actions.

                Clinical studies have revealed that the cerebellum is activated by noxious stimuli or pathological pain, and its removal results in somatosensory dysfunction. However, the neural circuit, cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying pain transmission and modulation in the cerebellum remain unknown. Here, we show that Bergmann glia (BG) relay noradrenaline (NA) signals ascending from the locus coeruleus (LC) to Purkinje cells (PCs), contributing to pain behavior. Using two-photon microscopy and optogenetics in mice, we found that the LC releases NA in the cerebellar cortex during peripheral noxious electrical stimuli, which elevates intracellular calcium in most BG. This global calcium activation of BG, called 'flare', was also elicited during capsaicin-induced pain, and chemogenetic inactivation of BG or LC terminals inhibited not only BG flares but also pain behavior. Pharmacological blockade or genetic knockdown of BG alpha-1 adrenergic receptors (1-ARs) also suppressed capsaicin-induced BG flares and pain behavior. Electrophysiological recordings indicated that capsaicin-induced pain accompanies the reduction of PC activity, which was mimicked by chemogenetic activation of BG and prevented when flares were blocked by prazosin, an 1-AR blocker. Taken together, our study identified a glia-mediated mechanism of cerebellar pain processing, providing new insights into the cerebellum as an active pain modulator.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Associations between abstract working memory abilities and brain activity underlying long-term recognition of auditory sequences</a></h4>

              
                Memory is a complex cognitive process comprised by several subsystems, namely short- and long-term memory and working memory (WM). Previous research has shown that adequate interaction between subsystems is crucial for successful memory processes such as encoding, storage and manipulation of information. However, few studies have investigated the relationship between different subsystems at the behavioral and neural levels. Thus, here we assessed the relationship between individual WM abilities and brain activity underlying the recognition of previously memorized auditory sequences. First, recognition of previously memorized versus novel auditory sequences was associated with a widespread network of brain areas comprising the cingulate gyrus, hippocampus, insula, inferior temporal cortex, frontal operculum, and orbitofrontal cortex. Second, we observed positive correlations between brain activity underlying auditory sequence recognition and WM. We showed a sustained positive correlation in the medial cingulate gyrus, a brain area which was widely involved in the auditory sequence recognition. Remarkably, we also observed positive correlations in the inferior temporal, temporal-fusiform, and postcentral gyri, brain areas which were not strongly associated to auditory sequence recognition. In conclusion, we discovered positive correlations between WM abilities and brain activity underlying long-term recognition of auditory sequences, providing new evidence on the relationship between memory subsystems. Furthermore, we showed that high WM performers recruited a larger brain network including areas associated to visual processing (i.e., inferior temporal, temporal-fusiform and postcentral gyri) for successful auditory memory recognition.

                Motivation is a powerful driver of learning and memory. Functional MRI studies show that interactions between the dopaminergic midbrain (SN/VTA), hippocampus, and nucleus accumbens (NAc) are critical for motivated memory encoding. However, it is not known if these effects are transient and purely functional, or if individual differences in the structure of this circuit underlie motivated memory encoding. To quantify individual differences in structure, diffusion-weighted MRI and probabilistic tractography were used to quantify SN/VTA-striatum and SN/VTA-hippocampus pathways associated with motivated memory encoding in humans. Participants completed a motivated source memory paradigm. During encoding, words were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: reward ($1.00), control ($0.00), or punishment (-$1.00). During retrieval, participants were asked to retrieve item and source information of the previously studied words and were rewarded or penalized according to their performance. Source memory for words assigned to both reward and punishment conditions was greater than control words, while there were no differences in item memory based on value. Anatomically, probabilistic tractography results revealed a heterogeneous, topological arrangement of the SN/VTA. Related to memory, tract integrity measures of SN/VTA-hippocampus pathways were positively correlated with individual differences in reward and punishment modulated memory performance, while tract integrity measures of SN/VTA-striatum pathways showed no association. This novel finding suggests that pathways emerging from the human SV/VTA are anatomically separable and functionally heterogeneous. Individual differences in structural integrity of the dopaminergic hippocampus-VTA loop are selectively associated with motivated memory encoding.

                There are no pharmacological disease-modifying treatments that can mitigate the seizures and comorbidities associated with established chronic temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). This study evaluated the effect of sodium selenate in the post-status epilepticus (SE) rat model of chronic drug resistant TLE. Wistar rats underwent kainic acid-induced SE or sham. Ten-weeks post-SE, rats were randomly assigned to receive either sodium selenate, levetiracetam, or vehicle treatments continuously for 4 weeks. To evaluate the effects of the treatments, 1 week of continuous video-EEG was acquired before, during, and 4, 8 weeks post-treatment, followed by behavioral tests. Targeted and untargeted proteomics and metabolomics were performed on post-mortem brain tissue to identify potential pathways associated with modified disease outcomes. Telomere length was investigated as a novel surrogate marker of disease severity. Sodium selenate treatment was able to mitigate disease severity, reducing the number of spontaneous seizures (p< 0.05), cognitive dysfunction (p< 0.05 in both novel object placement and recognition tasks), and sensorimotor deficits (p< 0.01) 8 weeks post-treatment cessation. Moreover, increased protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) expression, reduced hyperphosphorylated tau, and reversed telomere length shortening caused 1 by SE (p< 0.05). Network medicine integration of multi-omics/ pre-clinical outcomes identified protein-metabolite modules positively correlated with the TLE phenotype. Our results provide evidence that treatment with sodium selenate results in a sustained disease modifying effect in chronically epileptic rats in the post-KA SE model of TLE, including improved comorbid learning and memory deficits.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Disinhibition of Rab10 gates AMPAR insertion and spine enlargement during long-term potentiation</a></h4>

              
                Rab-dependent membrane trafficking is critical for changing the structure and function of dendritic spines during synaptic plasticity. Here, we developed highly sensitive sensors to monitor Rab protein activity in single dendritic spines undergoing structural long-term potentiation (sLTP) in rodent organotypic hippocampal slices. During sLTP, Rab10 was persistently inactivated (>30 min) in the stimulated spines, whereas Rab4 was transiently activated over ~5 min. Inhibiting or deleting Rab10 enhanced sLTP, electrophysiological LTP and AMPA receptor (AMPAR) insertion during sLTP. In contrast, disrupting Rab4 impaired sLTP only in the first few minutes, and decreased AMPAR insertion during sLTP. Thus, our results suggest that Rab10 and Rab4 oppositely regulate AMPAR trafficking during sLTP, and disinhibition of Rab10 signaling gates the induction of LTP and associated spine structural plasticity.

	<p>The topic of the therapeutic use of cannabinoids in Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) is broadly discussed and frequently comes up in the outpatient clinic. So far, there are only a few randomized clinical trials assessing the effects of cannabinoids in PD. We are able to demonstrate a reduction in non-motor symptom (NMS) burden after the administration of nabilone. As impairment of attention and working memory have been described earlier as possible side effects, we assess cognitive performance using saccadic paradigms measured by an eye tracker. We do not observe a significant difference in any of the saccadic paradigms between PD patients on placebo versus those treated with nabilone. We, therefore, conclude that top-down inhibitory control is not affected by the tetrahydrocannabinol analogue. Nabilone did not significantly worsen cognitive performance and appears to be safe to use in selected PD patients who suffer from disabling NMS.</p>

	<p>The role of social odors on human social interactions, including face evaluation, has been widely indicated. However, for nonsocial odors, there has not been a consistent conclusion. Therefore, this study aimed to verify the effect of suprathreshold nonsocial odors on facial attractiveness judgment when the visual input is ambiguous. We designed a 3 (odor valence: neutral, pleasant, and unpleasant) &amp;amp;times; 7 (continuous levels of morphed fuzziness of attractiveness: 37.5% to 62.5%) within-subject experiment. A total of 30 participants (18 females) completed the whole experiment simultaneously for three consecutive days. The results showed that faces presented with pleasant and neutral odors were judged as significantly more attractive than those with unpleasant odors. The intervention effect of odor valence on facial attractiveness differed by fuzzy attractiveness levels. Results also suggested that male faces were perceived as more attractive than female faces no matter the odor conditions. The results of this study provide evidence to support the cross-modal emotion integration effect of olfaction and vision. Follow-up studies need to be conducted to reveal the underlying mechanism of odor valence on visual fact attractive judgment.</p>

	<p>Background: Chronic ankle instability (CAI) is a common peripheral joint injury and there is still no consensus on the mechanisms. It is necessary to investigate electrocortical parameters to provide clinical insight into the functional alterations of brain activity after an ankle sprain, which would greatly affect the implementation of rehabilitation plans. The purpose of this study was to assess cortical activation characteristics during drop-jump landing among soccer athletes with CAI. Methods: A total of 24 participants performed the drop-jump landing task on a force platform while wearing a 64-channel EEG system. The differences of power spectral density (PSD) in theta and alpha (alpha-1 and alpha-2) bands were analyzed between two groups (CAI vs. CON) and between two limbs (injured vs. healthy). Results: CAI participants demonstrated significantly higher theta power at the frontal electrode than that in healthy control individuals (F(1,22) = 7.726, p = 0.011, &amp;amp;eta;2p = 0.260). No difference in parietal alpha-1 and alpha-2 power was found between groups (alpha-1: F(1,22) = 0.297, p = 0.591, &amp;amp;eta;2p = 0.013; alpha-2: F(1,22) = 0.118, p = 0.734, &amp;amp;eta;2p = 0.005). No limb differences were presented for any frequency band in selected cortical areas (alpha-1: F(1,22) = 0.149, p = 0.703, &amp;amp;eta;2p = 0.007; alpha-2: F(1,22) = 0.166, p = 0.688, &amp;amp;eta;2p = 0.007; theta: F(1,22) = 2.256, p = 0.147, &amp;amp;eta;2p = 0.093). Conclusions: Theta power at the frontal cortex was higher in soccer athletes with CAI during drop-jump landing. Differences in cortical activation provided evidence for an altered neural mechanism of postural control among soccer athletes with CAI.</p>

	<p>Depression is often associated with co-occurring neurocognitive deficits in executive function (EF), processing speed (PS) and emotion regulation (ER), which impact treatment response. Cognitive training targeting these capacities results in improved cognitive function and mood, demonstrating the relationship between cognition and affect, and shedding light on novel targets for cognitive-focused interventions. Computerized cognitive training (CCT) is one such new intervention, with evidence suggesting it may be effective as an adjunct treatment for depression. Parallel research suggests that mindfulness training improves depression via enhanced ER and augmentation of self-referential processes. CCT and mindfulness training both act on anti-correlated neural networks involved in EF and ER that are often dysregulated in depression&amp;amp;mdash;the cognitive control network (CCN) and default-mode network (DMN). After practicing CCT or mindfulness, downregulation of DMN activity and upregulation of CCN activity have been observed, associated with improvements in depression and cognition. As CCT is posited to improve depression via enhanced cognitive function and mindfulness via enhanced ER ability, the combination of both forms of training into mindfulness-enhanced CCT (MCCT) may act to improve depression more rapidly. MCCT is a biologically plausible adjunct intervention and theoretical model with the potential to further elucidate and target the causal mechanisms implicated in depressive symptomatology. As the combination of CCT and mindfulness has not yet been fully explored, this is an intriguing new frontier. The aims of this integrative review article are four-fold: (1) to briefly review the current evidence supporting the efficacy of CCT and mindfulness in improving depression; (2) to discuss the interrelated neural networks involved in depression, CCT and mindfulness; (3) to present a theoretical model demonstrating how MCCT may act to target these neural mechanisms; (4) to propose and discuss future directions for MCCT research for depression.</p>

	<p>(1) Background: glioma is the most prevalent primary tumor of the human central nervous system and accompanies extremely poor prognosis in patients. The transient receptor potential (TRP) channels family consists of six different families, which are closely associated with cancer cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, and invasion. TRP family genes play an essential role in the development of tumors. Nevertheless, the function of these genes in gliomas is not fully understood. (2) Methods: we analyze the gene expression data of 28 TRP family genes in glioma patients through bioinformatic analysis. (3) Results: the study showed the aberrations of TRP family genes were correlated to prognosis in glioma. Then, we set enrichment analysis and selected 10 hub genes that may play an important role in glioma. Meanwhile, the expression of 10 hub genes was further established according to different grades, survival time, IDH mutation status, and 1p/19q codeletion status. We found that TRPC1, TRPC3, TRPC4, TRPC5, TRPC6, MCOLN1, MCOLN2, and MCOLN3 were significantly correlated to the prognosis in glioma patients. Furthermore, we illustrated that the expression of hub genes was associated with immune activation and immunoregulators (immunoinhibitors, immunostimulators, and MHC molecules) in glioma. (4) Conclusions: we proved that TRP family genes are promising immunotherapeutic targets and potential clinical biomarkers in patients with glioma.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Delta-Aminolevulinic acid dehydratase enzyme activity and susceptibility to lead toxicity in Uganda’s urban children [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Rapid industrialization, urbanization, and population explosion in sub-Saharan Africa escalate environmental lead levels and subsequently blood lead levels in children. Its levels in one’s environment account for their blood lead levels. One’s susceptibility to lead toxicity is governed by nutrition status, age and genetics. This study aimed at expounding susceptibility to lead toxicity by relating blood lead levels, delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD) enzyme activity, and genetic variations of proteins that code for ALAD in urban children of Uganda. Methods: A total of 198 blood samples were spectrophotometrically analysed for blood lead levels (BLL), hemoglobin (Hb) levels, and ALAD enzyme activity before DNA extraction, polymerase chain reaction, and restriction fragment length digestion for ALAD polymorphism.  Results: Up to 99.5% of the total samples analyzed coded for ALAD1 allele compared to 0.05% that coded for ALAD2. There was a significant relationship between BLL, Hb status and ALAD enzyme activity in the three isozymes (ALAD1-1, ALAD1-2 and ALAD2-2) in strength of ALAD1-1 (r = 0.42, p -value = 0.02) ˂ ALAD1-2 (r = 0.62, p -value = ˂ 0.001) ˂ ALAD2-2 (r = 0.67, p -value = ˂ 0.001). Conclusions: Majority of children in Uganda code for the ALAD1 allele, which is important for blood lead ions hoarding during lead toxicity. Hoarding of blood lead not only delays exposure effects but also accumulates its levels in deposit tissues and this poses adverse effects later in their lives

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Gustatory Cortex Is Involved in Evidence Accumulation during Food Choice</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Food choice is one of the most fundamental and most frequent value-based decisions for all animals including humans. However, the neural circuitry involved in food-based decisions is only recently being addressed. Given the relatively fast dynamics of decision formation, electroencephalography (EEG)-informed fMRI analysis is highly beneficial for localizing this circuitry in humans. Here, by using the EEG correlates of evidence accumulation in a simultaneously recorded EEG-fMRI dataset, we found a significant role for the right temporal-parietal operculum (PO) and medial insula including gustatory cortex (GC) in binary choice between food items. These activations were uncovered by using the "EEG energy" (power 2 of EEG) as the BOLD regressor and were missed if conventional analysis with the EEG signal itself were to be used, in agreement with theoretical predictions for EEG and BOLD relations. No significant positive correlations were found with higher powers of EEG (powers 3 or 4) pointing to specificity and sufficiency of EEG energy as the main correlate of the BOLD response. This finding extends the role of cortical areas traditionally involved in palatability processing to value-based decision-making and offers the "EEG energy" as a key regressor of BOLD response in simultaneous EEG-fMRI designs.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Glutamate Transporters EAAT2 and EAAT5 Differentially Shape Synaptic Transmission from Rod Bipolar Cell Terminals</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Excitatory amino acid transporters (EAATs) control visual signal transmission in the retina by rapidly removing glutamate released from photoreceptors and bipolar cells (BCs). Although it has been reported that EAAT2 and EAAT5 are expressed at presynaptic terminals of photoreceptors and some BCs in mammals, the distinct functions of these two glutamate transporters in retinal synaptic transmission, especially at a single synapse, remain elusive. In this study, we found that EAAT2 was expressed in all BC types while coexisting with EAAT5 in rod bipolar (RB) cells and several types of cone BCs from mice of either sex. Our immunohistochemical study, together with a recently published literature (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B17">Gehlen et al., 2021</cross-ref>), showed that EAAT2 and EAAT5 were both located in RB axon terminals near release sites. Optogenetic, electrophysiological and pharmacological analyses, however, demonstrated that EAAT2 and EAAT5 regulated neurotransmission at RB-&gt;AII amacrine cell synapses in significantly different ways: EAAT5 dramatically affected both the peak amplitude and kinetics of postsynaptic responses in AIIs, whereas EAAT2 had either relatively small or opposite effects. By contrast, blockade of EAAT1/GLAST, which was exclusively expressed in Mu&#x0308;ller cells, showed no obvious effect on AII responses, indicating that glutamate uptake by Mu&#x0308;ller cells did not influence synaptic transmission from RB terminals. Furthermore, we found that temporal resolution at RB-&gt;AII synapses was reduced substantially by blockade of EAAT5 but not EAAT2. Taken together, our work reveals the distinct functions of EAAT2 and EAAT5 in signal transmission at RB ribbon synapses.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Chronic Cortical Inflammation, Cognitive Impairment, and Immune Reactivity Associated with Diffuse Brain Injury Are Ameliorated by Forced Turnover of Microglia</a></h4>

              
                <p>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is associated with an increased risk of cognitive, psychiatric, and neurodegenerative complications that may develop after injury. Increased microglial reactivity following TBI may underlie chronic neuroinflammation, neuropathology, and exaggerated responses to immune challenges. Therefore, the goal of this study was to force turnover of trauma-associated microglia that develop after diffuse TBI and determine whether this alleviated chronic inflammation, improved functional recovery and attenuated reduced immune reactivity to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge. Male mice received a midline fluid percussion injury (mFPI) and 7 d later were subjected to a forced microglia turnover paradigm using CSF1R antagonism (PLX5622). At 30 d postinjury (dpi), cortical gene expression, dendritic complexity, myelin content, neuronal connectivity, cognition, and immune reactivity were assessed. Myriad neuropathology-related genes were increased 30 dpi in the cortex, and 90% of these gene changes were reversed by microglial turnover. Reduced neuronal connectivity was evident 30 dpi and these deficits were attenuated by microglial turnover. TBI-associated dendritic remodeling and myelin alterations, however, remained 30 dpi independent of microglial turnover. In assessments of functional recovery, increased depressive-like behavior, and cognitive impairment 30 dpi were ameliorated by microglia turnover. To investigate microglial priming and reactivity 30 dpi, mice were injected intraperitoneally with LPS. This immune challenge caused prolonged lethargy, sickness behavior, and microglial reactivity in the TBI mice. These extended complications with LPS in TBI mice were prevented by microglia turnover. Collectively, microglial turnover 7 dpi alleviated behavioral and cognitive impairments associated with microglial priming and immune reactivity 30 dpi.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> A striking feature of traumatic brain injury (TBI), even mild injuries, is that over 70% of individuals have long-term neuropsychiatric complications. Chronic inflammatory processes are implicated in the pathology of these complications and these issues can be exaggerated by immune challenge. Therefore, our goal was to force the turnover of microglia 7 d after TBI. This subacute 7 d postinjury (dpi) time point is a critical transitional period in the shift toward chronic inflammatory processes and microglia priming. This forced microglia turnover intervention in mice attenuated the deficits in behavior and cognition 30 dpi. Moreover, microglia priming and immune reactivity after TBI were also reduced with microglia turnover. Therefore, microglia represent therapeutic targets after TBI to reduce persistent neuroinflammation and improve recovery.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Human APOER2 Isoforms Have Differential Cleavage Events and Synaptic Properties</a></h4>

              
                <p>Human apolipoprotein E receptor 2 (APOER2) is a type I transmembrane protein with a large extracellular domain (ECD) and a short cytoplasmic tail. APOER2-ECD contains several ligand-binding domains (LBDs) that are organized into exons with aligning phase junctions, which allows for in-frame exon cassette splicing events. We have identified 25 human APOER2 isoforms from cerebral cortex using gene-specific APOER2 primers, where the majority are exon-skipping events within the N-terminal LBD regions compared with six identified in the heart. APOER2 undergoes proteolytic cleavage in response to ligand binding that releases a C-terminal fragment (CTF) and transcriptionally active intracellular domain (ICD). We tested whether the diversity of human brain-specific APOER2 variants affects APOER2 cleavage. We found isoforms with differing numbers of ligand-binding repeats generated different amounts of CTFs compared with full-length APOER2 (APOER2-FL). Specifically, APOER2 isoforms lacking exons 5&ndash;8 (ex5&ndash;8) and lacking exons 4&ndash;6 (ex4&ndash;6) generated the highest and lowest amounts of CTF generation, respectively, in response to APOE peptide compared with APOER2-FL. The differential CTF generation of ex5&ndash;8 and ex4&ndash;6 coincides with the proteolytic release of the ICD, which mediates transcriptional activation facilitated by the Mint1 adaptor protein. Functionally, we demonstrated loss of mouse <I>Apoer2</I> decreased miniature event frequency in excitatory synapses, which may be because of a decrease in the total number of synapses and/or VAMP2 positive neurons. Lentiviral infection with human APOER2-FL or ex4&ndash;6 isoform in <I>Apoer2</I> knockout neurons restored the miniature event frequency but not ex5&ndash;8 isoform. These results suggest that human APOER2 isoforms have differential cleavage events and synaptic properties.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Humans and mice share virtually the same number of protein-coding genes. However, humans have greater complexity of any higher eukaryotic organisms by encoding multiple protein forms through alternative splicing modifications. Alternative splicing allows pre-mRNAs transcribed from genes to be spliced in different arrangements, producing structurally and functionally distinct protein variants that increase proteomic diversity and are particularly prevalent in the human brain. Here, we identified 25 distinct human APOER2 splice variants from the cerebral cortex using gene-specific APOER2 primers, where the majority are exon-skipping events that exclude N-terminal ligand-binding regions of APOER2. We show that some of the APOER2 variants have differential proteolytic properties in response to APOE ligand and exhibit distinct synaptic properties.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Fibroblastic SMOC2 Suppresses Mechanical Nociception by Inhibiting Coupled Activation of Primary Sensory Neurons</a></h4>

              
                <p>Nociceptive information is detected and transmitted by neurons in the DRG. Recently, single-cell RNA sequencing has revealed the molecular profile of various cell types, including fibroblasts in the DRG. However, the role of molecules in fibroblasts needs to be elucidated in nociceptive regulation. Here, we found that secreted modular calcium-binding protein 2 (SMOC2) was secreted by fibroblasts to become a component of basement membrane and envelop the unit consisting of DRG neurons and attached satellite glial cells. KO of <I>Smoc2</I> in both sexes of mice led to increased neuronal clusters and decreased mechanical threshold, but unchanged noxious thermal response. Knockdown of <I>Smoc2</I> in the DRG phenocopied the behavioral performance by <I>Smoc2</I> KO in both sexes of mice. <I>In vivo</I> calcium imaging showed that <I>Smoc2</I> KO increased coupled activation of adjacent DRG neurons induced by nociceptive mechanical stimuli, which was reversed by DRG injection of SMOC2. Importantly, SMOC2 interacted with P2X7 receptor (P2X7R) and suppressed ATP-induced activation in HEK293 cells expressing this receptor. Injection of A740003, an antagonist of P2X7R, to the DRG reduced coupled activation of adjacent DRG neurons induced by nociceptive mechanical stimuli but did not further enhance the SMOC2-inhibited effect. Furthermore, peripheral inflammation resulted in a decreased SMOC2 and increased neuronal clusters. DRG injection of SMOC2 inhibited the neuronal coupling resulted from peripheral inflammation. This study reveals a specific role of fibroblastic SMOC2 in suppressing mechanical nociception through inhibiting the communication of adjacent DRG neurons, which provides an important mechanism of fibroblasts in nociceptive regulation.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The function of fibroblastic molecules is rarely noticed in the regulation of nociceptive sensation. Here, we reveal that fibroblastic SMOC2 is secreted to be a component of basement membrane and surrounded the unit consisting of DRG neuron and attached satellite glial cells. SMOC2 is required for maintaining the basal mechanical nociceptive threshold in the DRG. Loss of SMOC2 leads to the increased coupled activation of adjacent DRG neurons induced by noxious mechanical stimuli. Peripheral inflammation causes decreased fibroblast cells and SMOC2, which may result in the increase of coupled activation of adjacent DRG neurons. Mechanistically, SMOC2 interacts with and suppresses satellite glial P2X7 receptor to inhibit the coupled activation of adjacent DRG neurons.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">The Nogo-66 Receptors NgR1 and NgR3 Are Required for Commissural Axon Pathfinding</a></h4>

              
                <p>Nogo-66 receptors (NgR1-3) are glycosylphosphatidyl inositol-linked proteins that belong to the leucine-rich repeat superfamily. Through binding to myelin-associated inhibitors, NgRs contribute to the inhibition of axonal regeneration after spinal cord injury. Their role in limiting synaptic plasticity and axonal outgrowth in the adult CNS has been described previously, but not much is known about their role during the development of the nervous system. Here, we show that NgR1 and NgR3 mRNAs are expressed during spinal cord development of the chicken embryo. In particular, they are expressed in the dI1 subpopulation of commissural neurons during the time when their axons navigate toward and across the floorplate, the ventral midline of the spinal cord. To assess a potential role of NgR1 and NgR3 in axon guidance, we downregulated them using <I>in ovo</I> RNAi and analyzed the trajectory of commissural axons by tracing them in open-book preparations of spinal cords. Our results show that loss of either NgR1 or NgR3 causes axons to stall in the midline area and to interfere with the rostral turn of postcrossing axons. In addition, we also show that NgR1, but not NgR3, requires neuronal PlexinA2 for the regulation of commissural axon guidance.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Over the last decades, many studies have focused on the role of NgRs, particularly NgR1, in axonal regeneration in the injured adult CNS. Here, we show a physiological role of NgRs in guiding commissural axons during early development of the chicken spinal cord <I>in vivo</I>. Both NgR1 and NgR3 are required for midline crossing and subsequent turning of postcrossing axons into the longitudinal axis of the spinal cord. NgR1, but not NgR3, forms a receptor complex with PlexinA2 during axon guidance. Overall, these findings provide a link between neural regenerative mechanisms and developmental processes.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">The Retinal Basis of Light Aversion in Neonatal Mice</a></h4>

              
                <p>Aversive responses to bright light (photoaversion) require signaling from the eye to the brain. Melanopsin-expressing intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) encode absolute light intensity and are thought to provide the light signals for photoaversion. Consistent with this, neonatal mice exhibit photoaversion before the developmental onset of image vision, and melanopsin deletion abolishes photoaversion in neonates. It is not well understood how the population of ipRGCs, which constitutes multiple physiologically distinct types (denoted M1-M6 in mouse), encodes light stimuli to produce an aversive response. Here, we provide several lines of evidence that M1 ipRGCs that lack the Brn3b transcription factor drive photoaversion in neonatal mice. First, neonatal mice lacking TRPC6 and TRPC7 ion channels failed to turn away from bright light, while two photon Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging of their acutely isolated retinas revealed reduced photosensitivity in M1 ipRGCs, but not other ipRGC types. Second, mice in which all ipRGC types except for Brn3b-negative M1 ipRGCs are ablated exhibited normal photoaversion. Third, pharmacological blockade or genetic knockout of gap junction channels expressed by ipRGCs, which reduces the light sensitivity of M2-M6 ipRGCs in the neonatal retina, had small effects on photoaversion only at the brightest light intensities. Finally, M1s were not strongly depolarized by spontaneous retinal waves, a robust source of activity in the developing retina that depolarizes all other ipRGC types. M1s therefore constitute a separate information channel between the neonatal retina and brain that could ensure behavioral responses to light but not spontaneous retinal waves.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> At an early stage of development, before the maturation of photoreceptor input to the retina, neonatal mice exhibit photoaversion. On exposure to bright light, they turn away and emit ultrasonic vocalizations, a cue to their parents to return them to the nest. Neonatal photoaversion is mediated by intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs), a small percentage of the retinal ganglion cell population that express the photopigment melanopsin and depolarize directly in response to light. This study shows that photoaversion is mediated by a subset of ipRGCs, called M1-ipRGCs. Moreover, M1-ipRGCs have reduced responses to retinal waves, providing a mechanism by which the mouse distinguishes light stimulation from developmental patterns of spontaneous activity.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Robust Coding of Eye Position in Posterior Parietal Cortex despite Context-Dependent Tuning</a></h4>

              
                <p>Neurons in posterior parietal cortex (PPC) encode many aspects of the sensory world (e.g., scene structure), the posture of the body, and plans for action. For a downstream computation, however, only some of these dimensions are relevant; the rest are "nuisance variables" because their influence on neural activity changes with sensory and behavioral context, potentially corrupting the read-out of relevant information. Here we show that a key postural variable for vision (eye position) is represented robustly in male macaque PPC across a range of contexts, although the tuning of single neurons depended strongly on context. Contexts were defined by different stages of a visually guided reaching task, including (1) a visually sparse epoch, (2) a visually rich epoch, (3) a "go" epoch in which the reach was cued, and (4) during the reach itself. Eye position was constant within trials but varied across trials in a 3 <FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">x</FONT> 3 grid spanning 24&deg; <FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">x</FONT> 24&deg;. Using demixed principal component analysis of neural spike-counts, we found that the subspace of the population response encoding eye position is orthogonal to that encoding task context. Accordingly, a context-naive (fixed-parameter) decoder was nevertheless able to estimate eye position reliably across contexts. Errors were small given the sample size (~1.78&deg;) and would likely be even smaller with larger populations. Moreover, they were comparable to that of decoders that were optimized for each context. Our results suggest that population codes in PPC shield encoded signals from crosstalk to support robust sensorimotor transformations across contexts.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Neurons in posterior parietal cortex (PPC) which are sensitive to gaze direction are thought to play a key role in spatial perception and behavior (e.g., reaching, navigation), and provide a potential substrate for brain-controlled prosthetics. Many, however, change their tuning under different sensory and behavioral contexts, raising the prospect that they provide unreliable representations of egocentric space. Here, we analyze the structure of encoding dimensions for gaze direction and context in PPC during different stages of a visually guided reaching task. We use demixed dimensionality reduction and decoding techniques to show that the coding of gaze direction in PPC is mostly invariant to context. This suggests that PPC can provide reliable spatial information across sensory and behavioral contexts.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Activity Subspaces in Medial Prefrontal Cortex Distinguish States of the World</a></h4>

              
                <p>Medial prefrontal cortex (mPfC) activity represents information about the state of the world, including present behavior, such as decisions, and the immediate past, such as short-term memory. Unknown is whether information about different states of the world are represented in the same mPfC neural population and, if so, how they are kept distinct. To address this, we analyze here mPfC population activity of male rats learning rules in a Y-maze, with self-initiated choice trials to an arm end followed by a self-paced return during the intertrial interval (ITI). We find that trial and ITI population activity from the same population fall into different low-dimensional subspaces. These subspaces encode different states of the world: multiple features of the task can be decoded from both trial and ITI activity, but the decoding axes for the same feature are roughly orthogonal between the two task phases, and the decodings are predominantly of features of the present during the trial but features of the preceding trial during the ITI. These subspace distinctions are carried forward into sleep, where population activity is preferentially reactivated in post-training sleep but differently for activity from the trial and ITI subspaces. Our results suggest that the problem of interference when representing different states of the world is solved in mPfC by population activity occupying different subspaces for the world states, which can be independently decoded by downstream targets and independently addressed by upstream inputs.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Activity in the medial prefrontal cortex plays a role in representing the current and past states of the world. We show that during a maze task, the activity of a single population in medial prefrontal cortex represents at least two different states of the world. These representations were sequential and sufficiently distinct that a downstream population could separately read out either state from that activity. Moreover, the activity representing different states is differently reactivated in sleep. Different world states can thus be represented in the same medial prefrontal cortex population but in such a way that prevents potentially catastrophic interference between them.</p>

At the cellular level, larger supragranular pyramidal neurons have larger, more branched dendritic trees, more synapses, and perform more complex computations; at the macroscale, region-to-region connections display a diverse architecture with highly connected hub areas facilitating complex information integration and computation. Here, we explore the hypothesis that the branching structure of large-scale region-to-region connectivity follows similar organizational principles as the neuronal scale. We examine microscale connectivity of basal dendritic trees of supragranular pyramidal neurons (300+) across 10 cortical areas in five human donor brains (1 male, 4 female). Dendritic complexity was quantified as the number of branch points, tree length, spine count, spine density, and overall branching complexity. High-resolution diffusion-weighted MRI was used to construct white matter trees of corticocortical wiring. Examining complexity of the resulting white matter trees using the same measures as for dendritic trees shows heteromodal association areas to have larger, more complex white matter trees than primary areas (<I>p</I> &lt; 0.0001) and macroscale complexity to run in parallel with microscale measures, in terms of number of inputs (<I>r</I> = 0.677, <I>p</I> = 0.032), branch points (<I>r</I> = 0.797, <I>p</I> = 0.006), tree length (<I>r</I> = 0.664, <I>p</I> = 0.036), and branching complexity (<I>r</I> = 0.724, <I>p</I> = 0.018). Our findings support the integrative theory that brain connectivity follows similar principles of connectivity at neuronal and macroscale levels and provide a framework to study connectivity changes in brain conditions at multiple levels of organization.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Within the human brain, cortical areas are involved in a wide range of processes, requiring different levels of information integration and local computation. At the cellular level, these regional differences reflect a predictable organizational principle with larger, more complexly branched supragranular pyramidal neurons in higher order regions. We hypothesized that the 3D branching structure of macroscale corticocortical connections follows the same organizational principles as the cellular scale. Comparing branching complexity of dendritic trees of supragranular pyramidal neurons and of MRI-based regional white matter trees of macroscale connectivity, we show that macroscale branching complexity is larger in higher order areas and that microscale and macroscale complexity go hand in hand. Our findings contribute to a multiscale integrative theory of brain connectivity.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">A Neurodevelopmental Shift in Reward Circuitry from Mother's to Nonfamilial Voices in Adolescence</a></h4>

              
                <p>The social worlds of young children primarily revolve around parents and caregivers, who play a key role in guiding children's social and cognitive development. However, a hallmark of adolescence is a shift in orientation toward nonfamilial social targets, an adaptive process that prepares adolescents for their independence. Little is known regarding neurobiological signatures underlying changes in adolescents' social orientation. Using functional brain imaging of human voice processing in children and adolescents (ages 7-16), we demonstrate distinct neural signatures for mother's voice and nonfamilial voices across child and adolescent development in reward and social valuation systems, instantiated in nucleus accumbens and ventromedial prefrontal cortex. While younger children showed greater activity in these brain systems for mother's voice compared with nonfamilial voices, older adolescents showed the opposite effect with increased activity for nonfamilial compared with mother's voice. Findings uncover a critical role for reward and social valuative brain systems in the pronounced changes in adolescents' orientation toward nonfamilial social targets. Our approach provides a template for examining developmental shifts in social reward and motivation in individuals with pronounced social impairments, including adolescents with autism.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Children's social worlds undergo a transformation during adolescence. While socialization in young children revolves around parents and caregivers, adolescence is characterized by a shift in social orientation toward nonfamilial social partners. Here we show that this shift is reflected in neural activity measured from reward processing regions in response to brief vocal samples. When younger children hear their mother's voice, reward processing regions show greater activity compared with when they hear nonfamilial, unfamiliar voices. Strikingly, older adolescents show the opposite effect, with increased activity for nonfamilial compared with mother's voice. Findings identify the brain basis of adolescents' switch in social orientation toward nonfamilial social partners and provides a template for understanding neurodevelopment in clinical populations with social and communication difficulties.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Isolating the Neural Substrates of Visually Guided Attention Orienting in Humans</a></h4>

              
                <p>The neural processes that enable healthy humans to orient attention to sudden visual events are poorly understood because they are tightly intertwined with purely sensory processes. Here we isolated visually guided orienting activity from sensory activity using event-related potentials (ERPs). By recording ERPs to a lateral stimulus and comparing waveforms obtained under conditions of attention and inattention, we identified an early positive deflection over the ipsilateral visual cortex that was associated with the covert orienting of visual attention to the stimulus. Across five experiments with male and female adult participants, this ipsilateral visual orienting activity (VOA) could be distinguished from purely sensory-evoked activity and from other top-down spatial attention effects. The VOA was linked with behavioral measures of orienting, being significantly larger when the stimulus was detected rapidly than when it was detected more slowly, and its presence was independent of saccadic eye movements toward the targets. The VOA appears to be a specific neural index of the visually guided orienting of attention to a stimulus that appears abruptly in an otherwise uncluttered visual field.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The study of visual attention orienting has been an important impetus for the field of cognitive neuroscience. Seminal reaction-time studies demonstrated that a suddenly appearing visual stimulus attracts attention involuntarily, but the neural processes associated with visually guided attention orienting have been difficult to isolate because they are intertwined with sensory processes that trigger the orienting. Here, we disentangled orienting activity from sensory activity using scalp recordings of event-related electrical activity in the human brain. A specific neural index of visually guided attention orienting was identified. Surprisingly, whereas peripheral sensory stimulation is processed initially and predominantly by the contralateral visual cortex, this electrophysiological index of visual orienting was recorded over the cerebral hemisphere that was ipsilateral to the attention-capturing stimulus.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Aberrant Phase Precession of Lateral Septal Cells in a Maternal Immune Activation Model of Schizophrenia Risk May Disrupt the Integration of Location with Reward</a></h4>

              
                <p>Spatial memory and reward processing are known to be disrupted in schizophrenia. Since the lateral septum (LS) may play an important role in the integration of location and reward, we examined the effect of maternal immune activation (MIA), a known schizophrenia risk factor, on spatial representation in the rat LS. In support of a previous study, we found that spatial location is represented as a phase code in the rostral LS of adult male rats, so that LS cell spiking shifts systematically against the phase of the hippocampal, theta-frequency, local field potential as an animal moves along a track toward a reward (phase precession). Whereas shallow precession slopes were observed in control group cells, they were steeper in the MIA animals, such that firing frequently precessed across several theta cycles as the animal moved along the length of the apparatus, with subsequent ambiguity in the phase representation of location. Furthermore, an analysis of the phase trajectories of the control group cells revealed that the population tended to converge toward a common firing phase as the animal approached the reward location. This suggested that phase coding in these cells might signal both reward location and the distance to reward. By comparison, the degree of phase convergence in the MIA-group cells was weak, and the region of peak convergence was distal to the reward location. These findings suggest that a schizophrenia risk factor disrupts the phase-based encoding of location&ndash;reward relationships in the LS, potentially smearing reward representations across space.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> It is unclear how spatial or contextual information generated by hippocampal cells is converted to a code that can be used to signal reward location in regions, such as the VTA. Here we provide evidence that the firing phase of cells in the lateral septum, a region that links the two areas, may code reward location in the firing phase of cells. This phase coding is disrupted in a maternal immune activation model of schizophrenia risk such that representations of reward may be smeared across space in maternal immune activation animals. This could potentially underlie erroneous reward processing and misattribution of salience in schizophrenia.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Outcome-Locked Cholinergic Signaling Suppresses Prefrontal Encoding of Stimulus Associations</a></h4>

              
                <p>Acetylcholine (ACh) is thought to control arousal, attention, and learning by slowly modulating cortical excitability and plasticity. Recent studies, however, discovered that cholinergic neurons emit precisely timed signals about the aversive outcome at millisecond precision. To investigate the functional relevance of such phasic cholinergic signaling, we manipulated and monitored cholinergic terminals in the mPFC while male mice associated a neutral conditioned stimulus (CS) with mildly aversive eyelid shock (US) over a short temporal gap. Optogenetic inhibition of cholinergic terminals during the US promoted the formation of the CS&ndash;US association. On the contrary, optogenetic excitation of cholinergic terminals during the US blocked the association formation. The bidirectional behavioral effects paralleled the corresponding change in the expression of an activity-regulated gene, c-Fos in the mPFC. In contrast, optogenetic inhibition of cholinergic terminals during the CS impaired associative learning, whereas their excitation had marginal effects. In parallel, photometric recording from cholinergic terminals in the mPFC revealed strong innate phasic responses to the US. With subsequent CS&ndash;US pairings, cholinergic terminals weakened the responses to the US while developing strong responses to the CS. The across-session changes in the CS- and US-evoked terminal responses were correlated with associative memory strength. These findings suggest that phasic cholinergic signaling in the mPFC exerts opposite effects on aversive associative learning depending on whether it is emitted by the outcome or the cue.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Drugs compensating for the decline of acetylcholine (ACh) are used for cognitive impairment, such as Alzheimer's disease. However, their beneficial effects are limited, demanding new strategies based on better understandings of how ACh modulates cognition. Here, we report that by manipulating ACh signals in the mPFC, we can control the strength of aversive associative learning in mice. Specifically, the suppression of ACh signals during an aversive outcome facilitated its association with a preceding cue. In contrast, the suppression of ACh signals during the cue impaired learning. Considering that this paradigm depends on the brain regions affected in Alzheimer's disease, our findings indicate that precisely timed control of ACh signals is essential to refine ACh-based strategies for cognitive enhancement.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The role of genetic factors in microtia: A systematic review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Microtia is a congenital malformation of the outer ears caused by improper embryonic development. The origin of microtia and causes of its variations remain unknown. Because of the lack of clarity regarding the role of genetic variables in microtia, we conducted a systematic review to qualitatively identify the genes most important in the development of microtia to provide an up-to-date review. Methods: Using six search engines, we searched all published studies related to the genetic factors of isolated microtia and syndromic microtia. The identified publications were screened and selected based on inclusion and exclusion criteria by the authors and assessed for methodological quality using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) critical appraisal tools. We found 40 studies, including 22 studies on syndromic microtia and 18 studies on isolated microtia. Data extraction of each study was arranged in tabulation for syndromic and isolated microtia. The extracted data were: first author’s surname, year of publication, country of origin, study design, sample characteristic and gene assessed. Results: After the data were extracted, analyzed, and reviewed, the most common gene suspected to be involved in isolated microtia was Homeobox A2 (HOXA2, 12.1%). Conversely, in syndromic microtia, the two most common genes supposed to play a role were Fibroblast Growth Factor 3 (FGF3, 47.2%) and Treacher–Collins–Franceschetti syndrome 1 (TCOF1, 30.2%). From the studies, the three most prevalent genes associated with microtia were HOXA2 (10%), FGF3 (8.4%), and TCOF1 (5.4%). In syndromic microtia, the most common mutation types were deletion in TCOF1 (46.9%) and missense and deletion in FGF3 (both 38%), and in isolated microtia, the most common mutation type was silent in HOXA2 (54.2%). Conclusions: In summary, genetic factors are involved in microtia; thus, molecular analysis is strongly advised. PROSPERO registration: CRD42021287294 (25/10/21).

                COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in a global pandemic with a rapidly developing global health and economic crisis. Variations in the disease have been observed and have been associated with the genomic sequence of either the human host or the pathogen. Worldwide scientists scrambled initially to recruit patient cohorts to try and identify risk factors. A resource that presented itself early on was the UK Biobank (UKBB), which is investigating the respective contributions of genetic predisposition and environmental exposure to the development of disease. To enable COVID-19 studies, UKBB is now receiving COVID-19 test data for their participants every two weeks. In addition, UKBB is delivering more frequent updates of death and hospital inpatient data (including critical care admissions) on the UKBB Data Portal. This frequently changing dataset requires a tool that can rapidly process and analyse up-to-date data. We developed an R package specifically for the UKBB COVID-19 data, which summarises COVID-19 test results, performs association tests between COVID-19 susceptibility/severity and potential risk factors such as age, sex, blood type, comorbidities and generates input files for genome-wide association studies (GWAS). By applying the R package to data released in April 2021, we found that age, body mass index, socioeconomic status and smoking are positively associated with COVID-19 susceptibility, severity, and mortality. Males are at a higher risk of COVID-19 infection than females. People staying in aged care homes have a higher chance of being exposed to SARS-CoV-2. By performing GWAS, we replicated the 3p21.31 genetic finding for COVID-19 susceptibility and severity. The ability to iteratively perform such analyses is highly relevant since the UKBB data is updated frequently. As a caveat, users must arrange their own access to the UKBB data to use the R package.

                The increase in the consumption of pulses can perform a key role in preventing protein deficiency among people specifically in developing countries. The fortification of whole wheat bread with pulses is an efficient approach to boost the nutritional profile of bread as protein, starches, dietary fiber, vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and phytochemicals are all abundant in pulses. The optimum ratio of the pulse to whole wheat flour is necessary to determine for producing bread with good quality, sensory attributes, and handling properties. This review investigated the impact of the pulse addition on the whole wheat dough rheology, bread quality, and sensory characteristics, with a particular focus on dough stability, elasticity, strength, and bread volume. The improvement in the nutritional value as well as the negative impact of pulses on whole-wheat bread was also reviewed. The research gaps in pulse supplemented whole grains bread were identified, and further study directions were recommended. Fortification of whole wheat bread with pulses produced affordable bread with a balanced diet for all classes of people. The addition of a higher level of pulses develops a weak gluten structure, which negatively affects dough stability, strength, elasticity, and handling properties. The volume of bread also decreased, and the off-flavor compound produced at a higher level of pulse fortification. The addition of additives and prior processing of pulses not only promote the nutritional value but also produce bread with better dough stability, bread volume, and sensory score.

                Research that investigates respective researchers’ engagement in Open Science varies widely in the topics addressed, methods employed, and disciplines investigated, which makes it difficult to integrate and compare its results. To investigate current outcomes of Open Science research, and to get a better understanding on well-researched topics and research gaps, we aimed at providing an openly accessible overview of empirical studies that focus on different aspects of Open Science in different scientific disciplines, academic groups and geographical regions. In this paper, we describe a data set of studies about Open Science practices retrieved following a PRISMA approach to compile a literature review. We included studies from the Scopus and Web of Science databases with keywords relating to Open Science between the years 2000 and 2020, as well as a snowball search for relevant articles. Studies that did not investigate any aspect of Open Science, or weren’t peer-reviewed were excluded, resulting in a total of 695 remaining studies. The data set was collaboratively annotated to ensure intercoder reliability of the coded data.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">MSTCN: A multiscale temporal convolutional network for user independent human activity recognition [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: In recent years, human activity recognition (HAR) has been an active research topic due to its widespread application in various fields such as healthcare, sports, patient monitoring, etc. HAR approaches can be categorised as handcrafted feature methods (HCF) and deep learning methods (DL). HCF involves complex data pre-processing and manual feature extraction in which the models may be exposed to high bias and crucial implicit pattern loss. Hence, DL approaches are introduced due to their exceptional recognition performance. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) extracts spatial features while preserving localisation. However, it hardly captures temporal features. Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) learns temporal features, but it is susceptible to gradient vanishing and suffers from short-term memory problems. Unlike RNN, Long-Short Term Memory network has a relatively longer-term dependency. However, it consumes higher computation and memory because it computes and stores partial results at each level. Methods: This work proposes a novel multiscale temporal convolutional network (MSTCN) based on the Inception model with a temporal convolutional architecture. Unlike HCF methods, MSTCN requires minimal pre-processing and no manual feature engineering. Further, multiple separable convolutions with different-sized kernels are used in MSTCN for multiscale feature extraction. Dilations are applied to each separable convolution to enlarge the receptive fields without increasing the model parameters. Moreover, residual connections are utilised to prevent information loss and gradient vanishing. These features enable MSTCN to possess a longer effective history while maintaining a relatively low in-network computation. Results: The performance of MSTCN is evaluated on UCI and WISDM datasets using a subject independent protocol with no overlapping subjects between the training and testing sets. MSTCN achieves accuracies of 97.42 on UCI and 96.09 on WISDM. Conclusion: The proposed MSTCN dominates the other state-of-the-art methods by acquiring high recognition accuracies without requiring any manual feature engineering.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Prediction of the effects of the top 10 nonsynonymous variants from 30229 SARS-CoV-2 strains on their proteins [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: SARS-CoV-2 virus is a highly transmissible pathogen that causes COVID-19. The outbreak originated in Wuhan, China in December 2019. A number of nonsynonymous mutations located at different SARS-CoV-2 proteins have been reported by multiple studies. However, there are limited computational studies on the biological impacts of these mutations on the structure and function of the proteins.   Methods: In our study nonsynonymous mutations of the SARS-CoV-2 genome and their frequencies were identified from 30,229 sequences. Subsequently, the effects of the top 10 highest frequency nonsynonymous mutations of different SARS-CoV-2 proteins were analyzed using bioinformatics tools including co-mutation analysis, prediction of the protein structure stability and flexibility analysis, and prediction of the protein functions.   Results: A total of 231 nonsynonymous mutations were identified from 30,229 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences. The top 10 nonsynonymous mutations affecting nine amino acid residues were ORF1a nsp5 P108S, ORF1b nsp12 P323L and A423V, S protein N501Y and D614G, ORF3a Q57H, N protein P151L, R203K and G204R. Many nonsynonymous mutations showed a high concurrence ratio, suggesting these mutations may evolve together and interact functionally. Our result showed that ORF1a nsp5 P108S, ORF3a Q57H and N protein P151L mutations may be deleterious to the function of SARS-CoV-2 proteins. In addition, ORF1a nsp5 P108S and S protein D614G may destabilize the protein structures while S protein D614G may have a more open conformation compared to the wild type.   Conclusion: The biological consequences of these nonsynonymous mutations of SARS-CoV-2 proteins should be further validated by in vivo and in vitro experimental studies in the future.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Spatially resolved in silico modeling of NKG2D signaling kinetics suggests a key role of NKG2D and Vav1 Co-clustering in generating natural killer cell activation</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Rajdeep Kaur Grewal, Jayajit Das</p>

Natural Killer (NK) cells provide key resistance against viral infections and tumors. A diverse set of activating and inhibitory NK cell receptors (NKRs) interact with cognate ligands presented by target host cells, where integration of dueling signals initiated by the ligand-NKR interactions determines NK cell activation or tolerance. Imaging experiments over decades have shown micron and sub-micron scale spatial clustering of activating and inhibitory NKRs. The mechanistic roles of these clusters in affecting downstream signaling and activation are often unclear. To this end, we developed a preDISCLOSUREdictive in silico framework by combining spatially resolved mechanistic agent based modeling, published TIRF imaging data, and parameter estimation to determine mechanisms by which formation and spatial movements of activating NKG2D microclusters affect early time NKG2D signaling kinetics in a human cell line NKL. We show co-clustering of NKG2D and the guanosine nucleotide exchange factor Vav1 in NKG2D microclusters plays a dominant role over ligand (ULBP3) rebinding in increasing production of phospho-Vav1(pVav1), an activation marker of early NKG2D signaling. The in silico model successfully predicts several scenarios of inhibition of NKG2D signaling and time course of NKG2D spatial clustering over a short (~3 min) interval. Modeling shows the presence of a spatial positive feedback relating formation and centripetal movements of NKG2D microclusters, and pVav1 production offers flexibility towards suppression of activating signals by inhibitory KIR ligands organized in inhomogeneous spatial patterns (e.g., a ring). Our in silico framework marks a major improvement in developing spatiotemporal signaling models with quantitatively estimated model parameters using imaging data.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">CBEA: Competitive balances for taxonomic enrichment analysis</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Quang P. Nguyen, Anne G. Hoen, H. Robert Frost</p>

Research in human-associated microbiomes often involves the analysis of taxonomic count tables generated via high-throughput sequencing. It is difficult to apply statistical tools as the data is high-dimensional, sparse, and compositional. An approachable way to alleviate high-dimensionality and sparsity is to aggregate variables into pre-defined sets. Set-based analysis is ubiquitous in the genomics literature and has demonstrable impact on improving interpretability and power of downstream analysis. Unfortunately, there is a lack of sophisticated set-based analysis methods specific to microbiome taxonomic data, where current practice often employs abundance summation as a technique for aggregation. This approach prevents comparison across sets of different sizes, does not preserve inter-sample distances, and amplifies protocol bias. Here, we attempt to fill this gap with a new single-sample taxon enrichment method that uses a novel log-ratio formulation based on the competitive null hypothesis commonly used in the enrichment analysis literature. Our approach, titled competitive balances for taxonomic enrichment analysis (CBEA), generates sample-specific enrichment scores as the scaled log-ratio of the subcomposition defined by taxa within a set and the subcomposition defined by its complement. We provide sample-level significance testing by estimating an empirical null distribution of our test statistic with valid p-values. Herein, we demonstrate, using both real data applications and simulations, that CBEA controls for type I error, even under high sparsity and high inter-taxa correlation scenarios. Additionally, CBEA provides informative scores that can be inputs to downstream analyses such as prediction tasks.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Negative feedback may suppress variation to improve collective foraging performance</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Andreagiovanni Reina, James A. R. Marshall</p>

Social insect colonies use negative as well as positive feedback signals to regulate foraging behaviour. In ants and bees individual foragers have been observed to use negative pheromones or mechano-auditory signals to indicate that forage sources are not ideal, for example being unrewarded, crowded, or dangerous. Here we propose an additional function for negative feedback signals during foraging, variance reduction. We show that while on average populations will converge to desired distributions over forage patches both with and without negative feedback signals, in small populations negative feedback reduces variation around the target distribution compared to the use of positive feedback alone. Our results are independent of the nature of the target distribution, providing it can be achieved by foragers collecting only local information. Since robustness is a key aim for biological systems, and deviation from target foraging distributions may be costly, we argue that this could be a further important and hitherto overlooked reason that negative feedback signals are used by foraging social insects.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Anomalous diffusion and asymmetric tempering memory in neutrophil chemotaxis</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Peter Dieterich, Otto Lindemann, Mats Leif Moskopp, Sebastien Tauzin, Anna Huttenlocher, Rainer Klages, Aleksei Chechkin, Albrecht Schwab</p>

The motility of neutrophils and their ability to sense and to react to chemoattractants in their environment are of central importance for the innate immunity. Neutrophils are guided towards sites of inflammation following the activation of G-protein coupled chemoattractant receptors such as CXCR2 whose signaling strongly depends on the activity of Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeable TRPC6 channels. It is the aim of this study to analyze data sets obtained in vitro (murine neutrophils) and in vivo (zebrafish neutrophils) with a stochastic mathematical model to gain deeper insight into the underlying mechanisms. The model is based on the analysis of trajectories of individual neutrophils. Bayesian data analysis, including the covariances of positions for fractional Brownian motion as well as for exponentially and power-law tempered model variants, allows the estimation of parameters and model selection. Our model-based analysis reveals that wildtype neutrophils show pure superdiffusive fractional Brownian motion. This so-called anomalous dynamics is characterized by temporal long-range correlations for the movement into the direction of the chemotactic CXCL1 gradient. Pure superdiffusion is absent vertically to this gradient. This points to an asymmetric ‘memory’ of the migratory machinery, which is found both in vitro and in vivo. CXCR2 blockade and TRPC6-knockout cause tempering of temporal correlations in the chemotactic gradient. This can be interpreted as a progressive loss of memory, which leads to a marked reduction of chemotaxis and search efficiency of neutrophils. In summary, our findings indicate that spatially differential regulation of anomalous dynamics appears to play a central role in guiding efficient chemotactic behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Networks of necessity: Simulating COVID-19 mitigation strategies for disabled people and their caregivers</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Thomas E. Valles, Hannah Shoenhard, Joseph Zinski, Sarah Trick, Mason A. Porter, Michael R. Lindstrom</p>

A major strategy to prevent the spread of COVID-19 is the limiting of in-person contacts. However, limiting contacts is impractical or impossible for the many disabled people who do not live in care facilities but still require caregivers to assist them with activities of daily living. We seek to determine which interventions can best prevent infections of disabled people and their caregivers. To accomplish this, we simulate COVID-19 transmission with a compartmental model that includes susceptible, exposed, asymptomatic, symptomatically ill, hospitalized, and removed/recovered individuals. The networks on which we simulate disease spread incorporate heterogeneity in the risk levels of different types of interactions, time-dependent lockdown and reopening measures, and interaction distributions for four different groups (caregivers, disabled people, essential workers, and the general population). Of these groups, we find that the probability of becoming infected is largest for caregivers and second largest for disabled people. Consistent with this finding, our analysis of network structure illustrates that caregivers have the largest modal eigenvector centrality of the four groups. We find that two interventions—contact-limiting by all groups and mask-wearing by disabled people and caregivers—most reduce the number of infections in disabled and caregiver populations. We also test which group of people spreads COVID-19 most readily by seeding infections in a subset of each group and comparing the total number of infections as the disease spreads. We find that caregivers are the most potent spreaders of COVID-19, particularly to other caregivers and to disabled people. We test where to use limited infection-blocking vaccine doses most effectively and find that (1) vaccinating caregivers better protects disabled people from infection than vaccinating the general population or essential workers and that (2) vaccinating caregivers protects disabled people from infection about as effectively as vaccinating disabled people themselves. Our results highlight the potential effectiveness of mask-wearing, contact-limiting throughout society, and strategic vaccination for limiting the exposure of disabled people and their caregivers to COVID-19.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Phase-locking patterns underlying effective communication in exact firing rate models of neural networks</a></h4>

              
                <p>by David Reyner-Parra, Gemma Huguet</p>

Macroscopic oscillations in the brain have been observed to be involved in many cognitive tasks but their role is not completely understood. One of the suggested functions of the oscillations is to dynamically modulate communication between neural circuits. The Communication Through Coherence (CTC) theory proposes that oscillations reflect rhythmic changes in excitability of the neuronal populations. Thus, populations need to be properly phase-locked so that input volleys arrive at the peaks of excitability of the receiving population to communicate effectively. Here, we present a modeling study to explore synchronization between neuronal circuits connected with unidirectional projections. We consider an Excitatory-Inhibitory (E-I) network of quadratic integrate-and-fire neurons modeling a Pyramidal-Interneuronal Network Gamma (PING) rhythm. The network receives an external periodic input from either one or two sources, simulating the inputs from other oscillating neural groups. We use recently developed mean-field models which provide an exact description of the macroscopic activity of the spiking network. This low-dimensional mean field model allows us to use tools from bifurcation theory to identify the phase-locked states between the input and the target population as a function of the amplitude, frequency and coherence of the inputs. We identify the conditions for optimal phase-locking and effective communication. We find that inputs with high coherence can entrain the network for a wider range of frequencies. Besides, faster oscillatory inputs than the intrinsic network gamma cycle show more effective communication than inputs with similar frequency. Our analysis further shows that the entrainment of the network by inputs with higher frequency is more robust to distractors, thus giving them an advantage to entrain the network and communicate effectively. Finally, we show that pulsatile inputs can switch between attended inputs in selective attention.

Therapeutic methods to modulate skin pigmentation has important implications for skin cancer prevention and for treating cutaneous hyperpigmentary conditions. Towards defining new potential targets, we followed temporal dynamics of melanogenesis using a cell-autonomous pigmentation model. Our study elucidates 3 dominant phases of synchronized metabolic and transcriptional reprogramming. The melanogenic trigger is associated with high MITF levels along with rapid uptake of glucose. The transition to pigmented state is accompanied by increased glucose channelisation to anabolic pathways that support melanosome biogenesis. SREBF1-mediated up-regulation of fatty acid synthesis results in a transient accumulation of lipid droplets and enhancement of fatty acids oxidation through mitochondrial respiration. While this heightened bioenergetic activity is important to sustain melanogenesis, it impairs mitochondria lately, shifting the metabolism towards glycolysis. This recovery phase is accompanied by activation of the NRF2 detoxication pathway. Finally, we show that inhibitors of lipid metabolism can resolve hyperpigmentary conditions in a guinea pig UV-tanning model. Our study reveals rewiring of the metabolic circuit during melanogenesis, and fatty acid metabolism as a potential therapeutic target in a variety of cutaneous diseases manifesting hyperpigmentary phenotype.

<p>In a light-induced retinal degeneration model (LIRD), treadmill exercise promotes preserved retinal function, increased retinal astrocyte GFAP expression, density, branching, endpoints and dendritic arborization. Additionally, exercised groups had increased astrocytic BDNF expression that was visualized using proximity ligase assay. Isolated retinal astrocytes from exercised LIRD groups had significantly increased expression of a specific isoform of TrkB associated with cell survival, TrkB.FL. Conversely, inactive LIRD isolated retinal astrocytes had significantly increased expression of TrkB.T1, which has been implicated in neuronal cell death. Our data indicate exercise not only alters retinal astrocyte morphology but also promotes specific BDNF-TrkB signaling associated with cell survival and protection during retinal degeneration.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Exercise is an effective neuroprotective intervention that preserves retinal function and structure in several animal models of retinal degeneration. However, the retinal cell types governing exercise-induced neuroprotection remain elusive. Previously, we found exercise-induced retinal neuroprotection was associated with increased levels of retinal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and required intact signal transduction with its high-affinity receptor, tropomyosin kinase B (TrkB). Brain studies have shown astrocytes express BDNF and TrkB and that decreased BDNF–TrkB signaling in astrocytes contributes to neurodegeneration. Additionally, exercise has been shown to alter astrocyte morphology. Using a light-induced retinal degeneration (LIRD) model, we investigated how exercise influences retinal astrocytes in adult male BALB/c mice. Treadmill exercise in dim control and LIRD groups had increased astrocyte density, GFAP labeling, branching, dendritic endpoints, and arborization. Meanwhile, inactive LIRD animals had significant reductions in all measured parameters. Additionally, exercised groups had increased astrocytic BDNF expression that was visualized using proximity ligase assay. Isolated retinal astrocytes from exercised LIRD groups had significantly increased expression of a specific isoform of TrkB associated with cell survival, TrkB.FL. Conversely, inactive LIRD isolated retinal astrocytes had significantly increased expression of TrkB.T1, which has been implicated in neuronal cell death. Our data indicate exercise not only alters retinal astrocyte morphology but also promotes specific BDNF–TrkB signaling associated with cell survival and protection during retinal degeneration. These findings provide novel insights into the effects of treadmill exercise on retinal astrocyte morphology and cellular expression, highlighting retinal astrocytes as a potential cell type involved in BDNF–TrkB signaling.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques such as transcranial magnetic stimulation and transcranial direct current stimulation are widely used to test the involvement of specific cortical regions in various domains such as cognition and emotion. Despite the capability of stimulation techniques to test causal directions, this approach has been only sparsely used to examine the cortical regulation of autonomic nervous system (ANS) functions such as heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) and to test current models in this regard. In this preregistered (PROSPERO) systematic review and meta-analysis, we aimed to investigate, based on meta-regression, whether NIBS represents an effective method for modulating HR and HRV measures, and to evaluate whether the ANS is modulated by cortical mechanisms affected by NIBS. Here we have adhered to the PRISMA guidelines. In a series of four meta-analyses, a total of 131 effect sizes from 35 sham-controlled trials were analyzed using robust variance estimation random-effects meta-regression technique. NIBS was found to effectively modulate HR and HRV with small to medium effect sizes. Moderator analyses yielded significant differences in effects between stimulation of distinct cortical areas. Our results show that NIBS is a promising tool to investigate the cortical regulation of ANS, which may add to the existing brain imaging and animal study literature. Future research is needed to identify further factors modulating the size of effects. As many of the studies reviewed were found to be at high risk of bias, we recommend that methods to reduce potential risk of bias be used in the design and conduct of future studies.</p>

                Regulating energy metabolism is critical to maintain homeostasis of cellular and systemic functions. In the brain, specialised centres for energy storage regulation finely communicate with the periphery and integrate signals about internal states. As a result, the behavioural responses can be directly adjusted accordingly to the energetic demands. In the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, one of these regulatory centres is the mushroom bodies (MBs), a brain region involved in olfactory memory. The integration of metabolic cues by the MBs has a crucial impact on learned behaviour.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/neuron/current.rss">O-LM interneurons: Gatekeepers of pyramidal neuron activity in the hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                A balanced and fine-tuned ratio of neuronal excitation and inhibition is a prerequisite for information processing. In this issue of Neuron, He et al. (2022) reveal a causal link between reduced input to local somatostatin-expressing, MeCP2-negative O-LM interneurons in CA1 and long-term memory impairment in a mouse model of Rett syndrome.

                Socioemotional behaviors rely on the integration of information across multiple systems in the brain. In this issue of Neuron, Mague et al. (2022) characterize a multi-regional functional network that coordinates positively valenced social interactions in mice.
