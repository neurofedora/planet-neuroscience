              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1422/v1?src=rss">Strengthening bioinformatics education: e-learning initiatives across ELIXIR Nodes and Communities [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                The rapid evolution of bioinformatics and data-driven life sciences necessitates widespread, effective training solutions capable of transcending geographical and institutional boundaries. ELIXIR, as a pan-European bioinformatics research infrastructure, has strategically embraced e-learning methodologies to meet this challenge. This white paper systematically reviews the current landscape of e-learning initiatives across various ELIXIR Nodes and Communities, detailing both historical developments and contemporary practices. It identifies core attributes and desirable features of effective e-learning, presenting an analysis of diverse educational platforms and the deployment of Learning Management Systems (LMS) within ELIXIR’s framework. Emphasis is placed on the interactive, open-access, and sustainable nature of these resources, exemplified by platforms such as the Training e-Support System (TeSS) and the ELIXIR-SI eLearning Platform (EeLP). The paper highlights critical advancements toward standardization and interoperability through initiatives such as the adoption of SCORM protocols, facilitating resource reuse across Nodes. Additionally, the integration of e-learning into broader educational strategies—such as hybrid learning environments and structured learning paths—is examined. Finally, future directions are discussed, including strategies for integrating e-learning with traditional training methods, enhancing trainer expertise, and further expanding the availability and FAIRification of bioinformatics training resources.

                Abstract* Background Fresh produce is a vital vehicle for the transmission of foodborne pathogens, yet data from low- and middle-income countries on contamination levels and associated health risks remain scarce. Methods This study provided an analysis of Listeria species contamination in 208 fruit and vegetable samples from major geopolitical regions in Nigeria. Conventional microbiological techniques and molecular methods were used for the analysis. Results We reported a high prevalence (38.5%) and substantial bacterial loads (up to 8.33×102 CFU/25g) among the organically grown crops, with produce from Northern states exhibiting the highest contamination. Genetic characterisation revealed significant diversity, including novel strains and others closely related to global clones, confirming a resilient environmental presence. Importantly, antibiotic susceptibility testing uncovered alarming resistance rates to vancomycin (83.1%) and oxacillin (88.1%), with hierarchical clustering identifying distinct multidrug-resistant clusters. The presence of resistance genes (vanA, vanB, tetL, tetM) and the virulence gene hly was confirmed. A quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA), incorporating this empirical data, estimated the annual probability of illness, highlighting high-risk produce-region combinations. Conclusions These findings demonstrate that fresh produce in Nigeria is a significant reservoir of pathogenic, antimicrobial-resistant L. monocytogenes, posing a serious public health threat. This study highlights the urgent need for targeted interventions, including enhanced agricultural water safety and strengthened surveillance of antimicrobial resistance, to mitigate risks and support evidence-based food safety policies in Nigeria and similar regions.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1420/v1?src=rss">Effect of Corruption, Inequality, and Unemployment on Poverty in South African Perspective: Evidence from Quantile Regression Model. [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background introduction Corruption has emerged to the point where it is underreported but in reality, it haunts many people daily, especially in public offices. In South Africa the corruption take place in most government institutions, government administration at top level, middle and lower level of government. Corruption benefits the few and harm the majority of people living as lower income households. The economic literature has little evidence of the connection between corruption and poverty. Many studies have concentrated on the causal effect of poverty on corruption, not vice versa. Method This study extends the literature on corruption to investigate the impact of corruption on poverty from a South African perspective. Other control variables such as the Gini coefficient and unemployment were considered equally. Secondary data stretching from 2000 to 2021 were selected based on data availability it was then converted to quarterly data (poverty and corruption). The study used the quantile regression model, descriptive statistics table and data trends of the selected variables. Results The results of the quantile regression model indicate that corruption has a positive and significant effect on poverty at all quantiles (25th, 50th, and 75th). Moreover, income inequality has a positive, dominant, and significant effect on poverty at all quantiles, and unemployment equally causes poverty at all quantiles. This imply that socio-economic issues are a threat that exacerbate poverty in South Africa. Conclusion The study argues that policymakers should invest in youth development programs concerning entrepreneurship, education and support women cooperatives and small businesses to reduce the high dependency ratio of people on state services and to reduce high inequality and unemployment rates. The study was limited to investigate the causal effect that run from corruption to poverty only and not on the other way around.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17255">From Priors to Predictions: Explaining and Visualizing Human Reasoning in a Graph Neural Network Framework</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2512.17255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Humans excel at solving novel reasoning problems from minimal exposure, guided by inductive biases, assumptions about which entities and relationships matter. Yet the computational form of these biases and their neural implementation remain poorly understood. We introduce a framework that combines Graph Theory and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to formalize inductive biases as explicit, manipulable priors over structure and abstraction. Using a human behavioral dataset adapted from the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC), we show that differences in graph-based priors can explain individual differences in human solutions. Our method includes an optimization pipeline that searches over graph configurations, varying edge connectivity and node abstraction, and a visualization approach that identifies the computational graph, the subset of nodes and edges most critical to a model's prediction. Systematic ablation reveals how generalization depends on specific prior structures and internal processing, exposing why human like errors emerge from incorrect or incomplete priors. This work provides a principled, interpretable framework for modeling the representational assumptions and computational dynamics underlying generalization, offering new insights into human reasoning and a foundation for more human aligned AI systems.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17317">Novel Kuramoto model with inhibition dynamics modeling scale-free avalanches and synchronization in neuronal cultures</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2512.17317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neuronal cultures exhibit a complex activity, bursts, or avalanches, characterized by the coexistence of scale invariance and synchronization, quite stable with the percentage of inhibitory neurons. While this bistable behavior has been already observed in the past, the characterization of the statistical properties of avalanche activity and their temporal organization is still lacking, as well as a model able to reproduce these dynamics. Here, we analyze experimental data of human neuronal cultures with controlled percentage of inhibitory neurons and characterize their statistical properties and dynamical organization. In order to model the experimental data, we propose a novel version of the Kuramoto model for two populations of oscillators, excitatory and inhibitory, implementing successfully the inhibition dynamics. The model can fully reproduce the experimental results, confirming the existence of correlations in the temporal organization of avalanche activity and the presence of an amplification - attenuation regime, as found in the human brain.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17735">Gravity Prior and Temporal Horizon Shape Interceptive Behavior under Active Inference</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2512.17735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate interception of moving objects, such as catching a ball, requires the nervous system to overcome sensory delays, noise, and environmental dynamics. One key challenge is predicting future object motion in the presence of sensory uncertainty and inherent neural processing latencies. Theoretical frameworks such as internal models and optimal control have emphasized the role of predictive mechanisms in motor behavior. Active Inference extends these ideas by positing that perception and action arise from minimizing variational free energy under a generative model of the world. In this study, we investigate how different predictive strategies and the inclusion of environmental dynamics, specifically an internal model of gravity, influence interceptive control within an Active Inference agent. We simulate a simplified ball-catching task in which the agent moves a cursor horizontally to intercept a parabolically falling object. Four strategies are compared: short temporal horizon prediction of the next position or long horizon estimation of the interception point, each with or without a gravity prior. Performance is evaluated across diverse initial conditions using spatial and temporal error, action magnitude, and movement corrections. All strategies produce successful interception behavior, but those that incorporate gravity and longer temporal horizons outperform others. Including a gravity prior significantly improves spatial and temporal accuracy. Predicting the future interception point yields lower action values and smoother trajectories compared to short-horizon prediction. These findings suggest that internal models of physical dynamics and extended predictive horizons can enhance interceptive control, providing a unified computational account of how the brain may integrate sensory uncertainty, physical expectations, and motor planning.

                arXiv:2512.17775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Working memory is a promising paradigm for assessing cognitive ergonomics of brain states in brain-computer interfaces(BCIs). This study decodes these states with a focus on environmental illumination effects via two distinct working memory tasks(Recall and Sequence) for mixed-recognition analysis. Leveraging nonlinear patterns in brain connectivity, we propose an innovative framework: multi-regional dynamic interplay patterns based on beta phase synchrony dynamics, to identify low-dimensional EEG regions (prefrontal, temporal, parietal) for state recognition. Based on nonlinear phase map analysis of the above three brain regions using beta-phase connectivity, we found that: (1)Temporal-parietal phase clustering outperforms other regional combinations in distinguishing memory states; (2)Illumination-enhanced environments optimize temporoparietal balance;(3) Machine learning confirms temporal-parietal synchrony as the dominant cross-task classification feature. These results provide a precise prediction algorithm, facilitating a low-dimensional system using temporal and parietal EEG channels with practical value for real-time cognitive ergonomics assessment in BCIs and optimized human-machine interaction.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17655">Bitbox: Behavioral Imaging Toolbox for Computational Analysis of Behavior from Videos</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2512.17655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computational measurement of human behavior from video has recently become feasible due to major advances in AI. These advances now enable granular and precise quantification of facial expression, head movement, body action, and other behavioral modalities and are increasingly used in psychology, psychiatry, neuroscience, and mental health research. However, mainstream adoption remains slow. Most existing methods and software are developed for engineering audiences, require specialized software stacks, and fail to provide behavioral measurements at a level directly useful for hypothesis-driven research. As a result, there is a large barrier to entry for researchers who wish to use modern, AI-based tools in their work. We introduce Bitbox, an open-source toolkit designed to remove this barrier and make advanced computational analysis directly usable by behavioral scientists and clinical researchers. Bitbox is guided by principles of reproducibility, modularity, and interpretability. It provides a standardized interface for extracting high-level behavioral measurements from video, leveraging multiple face, head, and body processors. The core modules have been tested and validated on clinical samples and are designed so that new measures can be added with minimal effort. Bitbox is intended to serve both sides of the translational gap. It gives behavioral researchers access to robust, high-level behavioral metrics without requiring engineering expertise, and it provides computer scientists a practical mechanism for disseminating methods to domains where their impact is most needed. We expect that Bitbox will accelerate integration of computational behavioral measurement into behavioral, clinical, and mental health research. Bitbox has been designed from the beginning as a community-driven effort that will evolve through contributions from both method developers and domain scientists.

                arXiv:2512.17412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an aircraft maintenance scheduling problem, which requires suitably qualified staff to be assigned to maintenance tasks on each aircraft. The tasks on each aircraft must be completed within a given turn around window so that the aircraft may resume revenue earning service. This paper presents an initial study based on the application of an Evolutionary Algorithm to the problem. Evolutionary Algorithms evolve a solution to a problem by evaluating many possible solutions, focusing the search on those solutions that are of a higher quality, as defined by a fitness function. In this paper, we benchmark the algorithm on 60 generated problem instances to demonstrate the underlying representation and associated genetic operators.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17444">Assessing Long-Term Electricity Market Design for Ambitious Decarbonization Targets using Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</a></h4>

Abstract: Electricity systems are key to transforming today's society into a carbon-free economy. Long-term electricity market mechanisms, including auctions, support schemes, and other policy instruments, are critical in shaping the electricity generation mix. In light of the need for more advanced tools to support policymakers and other stakeholders in designing, testing, and evaluating long-term markets, this work presents a multi-agent reinforcement learning model capable of capturing the key features of decarbonizing energy systems. Profit-maximizing generation companies make investment decisions in the wholesale electricity market, responding to system needs, competitive dynamics, and policy signals. The model employs independent proximal policy optimization, which was selected for suitability to the decentralized and competitive environment. Nevertheless, given the inherent challenges of independent learning in multi-agent settings, an extensive hyperparameter search ensures that decentralized training yields market outcomes consistent with competitive behavior. The model is applied to a stylized version of the Italian electricity system and tested under varying levels of competition, market designs, and policy scenarios. Results highlight the critical role of market design for decarbonizing the electricity sector and avoiding price volatility. The proposed framework allows assessing long-term electricity markets in which multiple policy and market mechanisms interact simultaneously, with market participants responding and adapting to decarbonization pathways.

                arXiv:2506.13361v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper evaluates the cost competitiveness of microreactors in today's electricity markets, with a focus on uncertainties in reactor costs. A Genetic Algorithm (GA) is used to optimize key technical parameters, such as reactor capacity, fuel enrichment, tail enrichment, refueling interval, and discharge burnup, to minimize the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE). Base case results are validated using Simulated Annealing (SA). By incorporating Probability Distribution Functions (PDFs) for fuel cycle costs, the study identifies optimal configurations under uncertainty. Methodologically, it introduces a novel framework combining probabilistic cost modeling with evolutionary optimization. Results show that microreactors can remain cost-competitive, with LCOEs ranging from \$48.21/MWh to \$78.32/MWh when supported by the Production Tax Credit (PTC). High reactor capacity, low fuel enrichment, moderate tail enrichment and refueling intervals, and high discharge burnup enhance cost efficiency. Among all factors, overnight capital cost (OCC) has the most significant impact on LCOE, while O&M and fuel cost uncertainties have lesser effects. The analysis highlights how energy policies like the PTC can reduce LCOE by 22-24%, improving viability despite cost variability. Compared to conventional nuclear, coal, and renewable sources like offshore wind, hydro, and biomass, optimized microreactors show strong economic potential. This research defines a realistic design space and key trade-offs, offering actionable insights for policymakers, reactor designers, and energy planners aiming to accelerate the deployment of affordable, sustainable microreactors.

                arXiv:2510.08582v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a modular and scalable design optimization framework for the wing design process that enables faster early-phase design while ensuring aerodynamic stability. The pipeline starts with the generation of initial wing geometries and then proceeds to optimize the wing using several algorithms. Aerodynamic performance is assessed using a Vortex Lattice Method (VLM) applied to a carefully selected dataset of wing configurations. These results are employed to develop surrogate neural network models, which can predict lift and drag rapidly and accurately. The stability evaluation is implemented by setting the control surfaces and components to fixed positions in order to have realistic flight dynamics. The approach unifies and compares several optimization techniques, including Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Genetic Algorithms (GA), gradient-based MultiStart methods, Bayesian optimization, and Lipschitz optimization. Each method ensures constraint management via adaptive strategies and penalty functions, where the targets for lift and design feasibility are enforced. The progression of aerodynamic characteristics and geometries over the optimization iterations will be investigated in order to clarify each algorithm's convergence characteristics and performance efficiency. Our results show improvement in aerodynamic qualities and robust stability properties, offering a mechanism for wing design at speed and precision. In the interest of reproducibility and community development, the complete implementation is publicly available at Github.

                arXiv:2510.14386v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spiking neural networks have garnered increasing attention due to their energy efficiency, multiplication-free computation, and sparse event-based processing. In parallel, state space models have emerged as scalable alternatives to transformers for long-range sequence modelling by avoiding quadratic dependence on sequence length. We propose SHaRe-SSM (Spiking Harmonic Resonate-and-Fire State Space Model), a second-order spiking SSM for classification and regression on ultra-long sequences. SHaRe-SSM outperforms transformers and first-order SSMs on average while eliminating matrix multiplications, making it highly suitable for resource-constrained applications. To ensure fast computation over tens of thousands of time steps, we leverage a parallel scan formulation of the underlying dynamical system. Furthermore, we introduce a kernel-based spiking regressor, which enables the accurate modelling of dependencies in sequences of up to 50k steps. Our results demonstrate that SHaRe-SSM achieves superior long-range modelling capability with energy efficiency (52.1x less than ANN-based second order SSM), positioning it as a strong candidate for resource-constrained devices such as wearables

Abstract: High-capacity kernel Hopfield networks exhibit a \textit{Ridge of Optimization} characterized by extreme stability. While previously linked to \textit{Spectral Concentration}, its origin remains elusive. Here, we analyze the network dynamics on a statistical manifold, revealing that the Ridge corresponds to the Edge of Stability, a critical boundary where the Fisher Information Matrix becomes singular. We demonstrate that the apparent Euclidean force antagonism is a manifestation of \textit{Dual Equilibrium} in the Riemannian space. This unifies learning dynamics and capacity via the Minimum Description Length principle, offering a geometric theory of self-organized criticality.

                arXiv:2512.10477v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In our work we not explicitly hint that it is a misconception to think that humans learn fast. Learning process takes time. Babies start learning to move in the restricted liquid area called placenta. Children often are limited by underdeveloped body. Even adults are not allowed to participate in complex competitions right away. However, with robots, when learning from scratch, we often don't have the privilege of waiting for dozen millions of steps. "Swaddling" regularization is responsible for restraining an agent in rapid but unstable development penalizing action strength in a specific way not affecting actions directly. The Symphony, Transitional-policy Deterministic Actor and Critic algorithm, is a concise combination of different ideas for possibility of training humanoid robots from scratch with Sample Efficiency, Sample Proximity and Safety of Actions in mind. It is no secret that continuous increase in Gaussian noise without appropriate smoothing is harmful for motors and gearboxes. Compared to Stochastic algorithms, we set a limited parametric noise and promote a reduced strength of actions, safely increasing entropy, since the actions are kind of immersed in weaker noise. When actions require more extreme values, actions rise above the weak noise. Training becomes empirically much safer for both the environment around and the robot's mechanisms. We use Fading Replay Buffer: using a fixed formula containing the hyperbolic tangent, we adjust the batch sampling probability: the memory contains a recent memory and a long-term memory trail. Fading Replay Buffer allows us to use Temporal Advantage when we improve the current Critic Network prediction compared to the exponential moving average. Temporal Advantage allows us to update Actor and Critic in one pass, as well as combine Actor and Critic in one Object and implement their Losses in one line.

                Background High-dose intravenous vitamin C (HDIVC) has gained interest as an adjunctive therapy in cancer care due to its pro-oxidative antioxidative and cytotoxic effects. Despite growing research, a comprehensive synthesis of the evidence on the efficacy and safety of HDIVC in advanced solid tumors remains limited. Materials and Methods This review will follow the six steps of the Arksey and O’Malley framework, as adapted by Levac et al, namely: identifying the research question, identifying relevant studies, study selection eligibility, charting the data, collating, summarizing and reporting the results, and consultation. PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar databases will be used for the search of articles from 2000 – 2025. Grey literature will also be conducted. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and the Meta-Analysis for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) will be used as a guide for this scoping review protocol. A two-stage screening process will be used to determine the eligibility of articles with two independent reviewers. Discrepancies will be handled by consensus or by consulting an expert in cancer care. The selection of studies for the review is anticipated to be completed within 12 weeks, from 01 October to 31 December 2025. The extracted data will be analyzed and presented in a report. Conclusion This scoping review will consolidate evidence on HDIVC for advanced solid tumors, identifying efficacy outcomes, safety profiles, and patient experiences limited to African adult populations and other global studies applicable to African settings in African populations that will inform clinical practice and guide policy making. Ethics and Dissemination Ethical approval is not required for this scoping review. However, the results of this search will be disseminated through academic presentations and publications in peer-reviewed journals.

                Ethnomedicine and ethnobotany constitute key fields for understanding how different cultures document, use, and transmit knowledge related to medicinal plants and their therapeutic applications. In recent decades, growing scientific interest has highlighted their potential contributions to healthcare systems, biodiversity conservation, and the preservation of cultural heritage. However, the integration of ethnomedicinal knowledge into modern medicine faces persistent challenges, particularly the lack of standardized documentation protocols and rigorous scientific validation. In this context, the present systematic review aims to assess the documentation, evaluation, and conservation of medicinal plants and their therapeutic applications across diverse cultural settings. A systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted following PRISMA guidelines, using Scopus, EBSCO, and Web of Science databases to identify peer-reviewed studies published between 2007 and 2024. Seventy studies met the inclusion criteria and were analyzed thematically to identify trends, methodological approaches, and research gaps. The findings reveal a wide diversity of medicinal plants and ethnomedicinal practices, with a strong emphasis on the documentation and conservation of traditional knowledge. Nevertheless, significant gaps persist in terms of phytochemical, pharmacological, and clinical validation, as well as in the integration of ethnomedicinal knowledge into conservation and public health policies. The thematic analysis underscores the need for standardized methodological frameworks and multidisciplinary approaches to strengthen the scientific validation, conservation, and intergenerational transmission of ethnomedicinal knowledge, ensuring its relevance for modern medicine and sustainable development.

                Background The aim of this study was to investigate the knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) among scuba divers in Saudi Arabia towards equipment infection control measures, protective guidelines measures and potential post COVID-19 infection complications. Methods A cross-sectional study using a pre-validated questionnaire was conducted. The questionnaire consisted of 35 close-ended questions, which covered the scuba divers’ profile and experience, the KAP of COVID-19 precautionary measures during diving activities as well as the demographic data and background of the scuba divers. KAP scores were subjected to non-parametric tests of statistical significance (Mann Whitney and Kruskal Wallis test). Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. Results Most of the 461 participants’ answers were in agreeance on the proper KAP of infection control during the COVID-19 pandemic. There was a statistically significant difference in attitude between all the demographic and professional variables (p<0.05) except for gender and region of residence (p>0.05). In addition, there was a statistically significant practice difference among age groups, education levels, and employee status in the diving center (p<0.05). Conclusions Our findings showed that scuba divers presented a good level of KAP of infection control measures against the spread of the coronavirus disease. Local officials and diving organizations need to continue their efforts in combating and control the spread of this pandemic.

">Single-cell perturbations reveal adaptive, stimulus-dependent recurrence in visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                Cortical processing must adapt dynamically to the strength of sensory inputs, integrating information when signals are weak and refining representations when they are strong. Experimental and theoretical studies suggest this adaptation involves recurrent cortical circuits through cooperative amplification and competitive interactions within functional networks. Recent studies in mouse primary visual cortex (V1) have begun to support this idea, consistent with novel circuit motifs whereby excitatory and inhibitory cells are strongly connected. Despite these advancements, neither models or data provide a clear picture of the behavior of cortical columns within circuits with functional topography. Here, neighboring cells (excitatory and inhibitory) are selective for similar features in visual space, raising the question as to whether cortical columns act as amplifiers or engage in feature competition. Moreover, columnar network models make a strong prediction: cortical circuits should engage in functional amplification during weak sensory drive, transitioning to suppressive interactions with increasing sensory drive-a prediction not yet directly tested. Using single-cell perturbations in ferret V1, we show that cortical networks switch between amplification and suppression, depending on stimulus strength. Combining two-photon optogenetic stimulation with a generalized linear model (GLM) to quantify perturbations, we uncovered spatially broad suppressive influence modulated by stimulus contrast. At low contrast, we observed amplification between functionally-coupled cells. At high contrast, these networks switched to suppression. This reversal emerged in a recurrent network model with strong inhibitory-excitatory connectivity and weaker excitatory-excitatory connections. This class of models predicts markedly stronger suppressive influences from inhibitory cells onto excitatory populations, which we confirmed with cell-specific perturbations. Our results show that cortical recurrence with functional topography toggles between amplification and suppression, providing direct evidence long-predicted by normative and mechanistic circuit models of visual cortex.

">Distinct neural temporal architectures encode rapid social expressions and sustained internal mood states</a></h4>

              
                Affective processing operates across multiple temporal scales, from rapid social signaling through facial expressions to sustained internal mood states, yet the neural computational principles governing these different timescales remain unclear. Understanding how the brain implements distinct temporal architectures for momentary versus persistent affective phenomena is important to comprehending emotional processing and developing objective biomarkers for psychiatric conditions. Here, we introduced a multimodal approach combining automated facial expression monitoring and continuous intracranial electroencephalography in 2,037 electrode contacts across 16 epilepsy patients, over multiple days. Of these, 15 and 12 patients met criteria for facial expression and for mood analysis, respectively. Among patients meeting criteria, we captured 1,396 naturalistic smiles, and 3,746 neutral expressions, separated by at least 10 seconds, alongside 336 periodic mood assessments. This paradigm revealed distinct behavioral and neural computational architectures. Aperiodic neural activity in the lateral temporal cortex (79.5% accuracy) encoded facial expressions with high cross-participant generalizability. Mood states, however, showed different encoding patterns. Facial expressions provided no consistent mood indicators across participants. Critically, low-gamma power dynamics in limbic regions encoded mood states in only a subset of individuals (5 of 12 participants) with expression-mood behavioral correlations, suggesting a distinct encoding phenotype. Cross-domain analysis confirmed computational independence: neural features optimized for facial expression decoding failed to predict sustained mood states, and vice versa. These findings suggest that multiple neural mechanisms may influence underlying affective processing, with variations in their contributions between individuals. The results provide a framework for understanding individual differences in neural mood representation and establish methodological approaches for objective measurement of naturalistic affective behaviors.

">Physiological Arousal as a Predominant Source of Individual Differences in Functional Brain Networks</a></h4>

              
                Individual differences in brain network function and organization are promising targets for fMRI-based biomarkers in precision psychiatry, yet the sources of individual variability remain poorly understood. We show that arousal, assessed by systemic low-frequency oscillation (sLFO) amplitude in the fMRI signal, accounts for a substantial portion of variance in brain network properties (e.g.: R= 0.70 for default mode network (DMN)-dorsal attention connectivity; R= -0.63 for DMN dynamics). These relationships replicated across sessions, across independent samples, and when assessed with traditional arousal indices. Critically, associations persisted after sLFO denoising, indicating a genuine brain-physiology relationship rather than hemodynamic artifact. Pharmacological manipulation showed that drug-induced sLFO-assessed arousal changes were accompanied by corresponding shifts in network connectivity and dynamics. This work identifies arousal as a prominent determinant of variability in functional brain networks, providing a new perspective on brain-based individual differences while offering an approach to measure arousal directly from fMRI data.

">Evidence for an Integrated Bilingual Language System from Discourse Tasks in Aphasia</a></h4>

              
                Background: The extent to which bilingual individuals represent and process their two languages within a shared or partially distinct neural architecture remains a topic of ongoing debate. While both parallel and divergent patterns of impairment have been reported in bilingual aphasia, such findings likely reflect a spectrum of representational overlap influenced by dominance, proficiency, and task demands. Critically, few studies have examined how breakdown manifests across multiple levels of linguistic structure using ecologically valid, discourse-based tasks. Aims: This study investigates whether Spanish-English bilinguals with aphasia exhibit parallel or dissociable patterns of impairment across their two languages, focusing on naturalistic narrative production and fine-grained analysis of error types and code-switching. Methods & Procedures: Thirteen bilingual individuals with aphasia following acquired brain injury produced story retellings in both languages. Speech samples were transcribed and coded for phonological, morphological, syntactic, and semantic errors, and for the word type at which they occurred. Code-switches were also identified and categorized. Analyses included generalized linear modeling and unsupervised clustering. Outcomes & Results: While participants made more errors in their non-dominant language, the structure and distribution of errors were highly similar across languages. Clustering algorithms revealed that impairments were parallel across languages and did not group by language dominance. Code-switching occurred more frequently from the non-dominant to the dominant language, consistent with activation-based lexical selection. Conclusions: Findings support an integrated bilingual language system that spans multiple levels of linguistic representation, modulated by language dominance. Naturalistic discourse tasks allow for richer characterization of bilingual language breakdown and may better inform both theoretical models and clinical management of bilingual aphasia.

">Evidence for dimensional representations and anticipatory dynamics in facial expression perception</a></h4>

              
                Expression recognition relies on the ability to distinguish subtle visual differences across a range of facial expressions. Here, we examine the neural representation of dynamic expressions as reflected by electroencephalography (EEG) data in human adults. We find that a wide range of expressions (i.e., 14 emotional and 10 conversational expressions) can be decoded from neural signals, and that their representational structure evinces the classic dimensions of valence and arousal. Critically, we recover, through EEG-based video reconstruction, dynamic representations whose content succeeds in capturing even fine differences across related expressions (e.g., happy-satiated versus schadenfreude). Further, time-resolved decoding reveals anticipatory dynamics that maximize accuracy before the occurrence of an apex expression in the visual stimulus. These results are validated against behavioral data, which yield static reconstructions consistent with their neural counterparts. Thus, our results shed light on the representational basis of expression recognition and serve to recover the dynamic content of visual experience.

">Early Post-Stimulus Activity Negatively Predicts P300 Amplitude: A Single-Trial Analysis of the Auditory Oddball Task</a></h4>

              
                The P300 event-related potential is a core index of attention and context updating, yet the trial-by-trial factors that modulate its amplitude remain incompletely characterized. This study tested whether early post-stimulus signal magnitude in the sensory window (0 150 ms) predicts subsequent P300 amplitude (300 600 ms) at the single-trial level. Using data from the ERP CORE auditory oddball dataset (N = 40 participants; 1,661 accepted trials), early activity was quantified as root mean square (RMS) amplitude at electrode Fz. A linear mixed-effects model revealed a statistically reliable negative association between early RMS and P300 amplitude at Pz ({beta} = -0.064, SE = 0.0245, z = -2.61, p = 0.0085). However, early RMS explained minimal trial-level variance (R2 = 0.0042), indicating a modest effect. Model diagnostics confirmed adequate assumptions for inference (Shapiro-Wilk W = 0.9995, p = 0.9690). Exploratory complexity measures (permutation entropy, Lempel / Ziv) were not predictive. Because RMS reflects both signal magnitude and within-trial variability, the findings are most conservatively interpreted as evidence that higher early signal energy is associated with slightly reduced P300 amplitude, possibly reflecting resource competition, refractory effects, or state-dependent processing. The results provide methodologically rigorous evidence for a small but reliable coupling between early and late ERP components, while highlighting the importance of distinguishing amplitude-based measures from trial-to-trial variability. Independent replication and control analyses separating mean amplitude from dispersion are needed to clarify the underlying mechanism.

">Cortex-wide Dynamics of Internal Decisions About Behavioral Context</a></h4>

              
                Many human decisions manifest in the outside world as motor actions. Correspondingly, neural signals reflecting decision formation are expressed in neural populations encoding the final action. Some decisions, however, are internal, shaping overt behavior indirectly through the selection of policies or rules that guide elementary sensory-motor decisions. We studied the human brain dynamics underlying internal decisions about the stimulus-response mapping rule for reporting visual orientation judgments. The rule changed unpredictably in a hidden fashion, and participants tracked it by accumulating ambiguous sensory cues. Computational model-based decoding of source-level magnetoencephalography data uncovered representations of the internal belief about the active rule in many areas, including occipital cortex. These representations exhibited profiles as predicted by normative models and as observed in action-related frontal areas during overt decisions. We conclude that a widely distributed network of cortical areas implements evidence accumulation for internal decisions, and that even visual cortex may represent high-level beliefs.

">Musical training improves planning and robustness of sequence learning</a></h4>

              
                Musicians demonstrate advantages in acquiring motor sequences, showing faster learning and better explicit sequence knowledge than non-musicians. However, it is unclear whether this advantage extends beyond acquisition to the consolidation phase, which is when newly learned skills stabilize and become resistant to interference. Additionally, while interference from executing competing motor tasks is well-established, less is known about whether purely sensory information presented after learning can disrupt consolidation of a bimodal motor sequence. We investigated how post-acquisition sensory interference affects performance of a learned audio-visual sequence, and whether musical training moderates this vulnerability. Participants first learned an explicit sequence in a serial reaction time task using synchronous, informative audio-visual cues. After a brief consolidation period, they were randomly assigned to one of four observational conditions that manipulated the relationship between auditory and visual streams. Motor performance was then reassessed. Post-acquisition sensory interference significantly impaired subsequent motor performance, but this effect was modality-specific: it was driven primarily by manipulations to the task-relevant visual stream, while auditory interference alone had no credible effect. Distributional analysis revealed that learning involved a strategic shift from reactive to anticipatory responding. Critically, participants with musical training made this shift significantly faster than those without, demonstrating a more rapid adoption of predictive motor control. These findings demonstrate that newly formed sensorimotor memories are selectively vulnerable to interference in task-relevant modalities. Furthermore, our work provides a mechanistic explanation for the musician advantage in sequence learning, linking it to faster development of predictive motor strategies during consolidation.

">Magnetoencephalography reveals adaptive neural reorganization maintaining lexical-semantic proficiency in healthy aging</a></h4>

              
                Although semantic cognition remains behaviorally stable with age, neuroimaging studies report age-related alterations in response to semantic context. We aimed to reconcile these inconsistent findings by combining behavioral and magnetoencephalography (MEG) measures and examined the neural mechanisms underlying lexical-semantic processing in healthy aging. Forty-six Finnish-speaking adults (25 female) across younger (22 - 32 years) and older (62 - 69 years) cohorts performed a semantic congruency judgment task on word pairs. Both age groups performed the task with high accuracy, with older adults responding faster than young. While advancing age was not associated with impaired task performance, MEG revealed neural reorganization in the old compared to young adults. Young participants exhibited the canonical N400 effect in the left temporal cortex 300 - 400 ms post-stimulus, followed by a Late Positive Complex (LPC), whereas older adults showed less pronounced congruency effects, and the activation distribution was shifted toward frontal and bilateral regions. Despite the absence of the canonical N400 effect in older participants, multivariate time-resolved decoding demonstrated that the congruency effect was decodable from the MEG responses in both groups from ~300 ms post-stimulus, indicating preserved sensitivity to congruency with age. Decoding performance correlated with response time, suggesting that increased neural separation between semantic concepts facilitates rapid decision-making. Critically, age groups were distinguishable based on their neural responses 300 - 800 ms post-stimulus, reflecting functional reorganization in older adults. Overall, our findings suggest that healthy aging involves adaptive reconfiguration of neural systems, supported by experience-driven strategies that preserve semantic proficiency despite broader age-related cognitive changes.

">Dual cholinergic mechanisms for sculpting striatal dopamine in vivo</a></h4>

              
                Striatal dopamine (DA) and acetylcholine constitute a computationally powerful neuromodulatory dyad that orchestrates action selection, motivational vigor, and reward learning. Striatal cholinergic interneurons (CINs) synapse onto DA axons and stimulate DA release via {beta}2-containing nicotinic receptors ({beta}2-nAChRs), providing a local modulatory channel distinct from midbrain-derived spikes. Yet whether this mechanism operates in vivo and how it contributes to striatal computations, orthogonal to those facilitated by prediction errors encoded in the DA somata, remains unresolved. Using spatiotemporally precise optogenetic stimulation of CINs paired with ultrafast DA imaging in the dorsal striatum, we identify a biphasic mode of CIN-evoked DA release in awake mice. CIN activation evoked an ultra-fast {beta}2-nAChR-dependent DA transient peaking within ~40 ms that requires millimeter-scale CIN synchrony and is systematically obscured by conventional imaging bandwidths or slow DA sensor kinetics. A second, delayed DA elevation peaking at ~180 ms persists despite {beta}2-nAChR blockade and is mediated by muscarinic receptors, - and *-nAChRs, and a non-cholinergic CIN messenger, revealing a previously unrecognized polysynaptic CIN mechanism. Our observations reconcile discrepancies between slice and in vivo studies and show that CINs engage DA release through two mechanistically distinct pathways: (i) an ultra-fast, monosynaptic mode provides a spatially expansive DA signal ideally positioned to reconfigure striatal microcircuits globally, and (ii) a slower, spatially flexible polysynaptic DA mode suited for sustaining ongoing decisions. This dual architecture expands the computational repertoire of striatal DA dynamics in behavioral and cognitive control.

">Excitatory nicotinic signaling drives action potential bursting in dopaminergic axons</a></h4>

              
                Axons of dopamine (DA) neurons express nicotinic receptors (nAChRs) that have been shown to both facilitate and suppress striatal DA release, but the mechanisms underlying these opposing actions are unclear. We combined axonal recordings and calcium imaging approaches to examine the effects of nAChRs on DAergic axon excitability. Activation of nAChRs consistently depolarized DAergic axons and increased the probability of evoking action potentials. Calcium imaging experiments showed that weak or moderate stimulation of striatal cholinergic interneurons (CINs) activated DAergic axons, while strong stimulation blunted multi-pulse protocols. Axon recordings showed that highly synchronous stimulation of CINs triggered a rapid (~125 Hz) burst of 2-4 action potentials in DAergic axons. Imaging experiments showed that nAChR-evoked axon bursts led to prolonged refractoriness, which was mimicked by direct burst stimulation. Thus, nAChR activation locally enhances excitability of DAergic axons over a range of intensities, including the production of locally generated burst firing and subsequent refractory inhibition.

">Why motor learning involves multiple systems: an algorithmic perspective</a></h4>

              
                The initial stage of learning motor skills involves exploring vast action spaces, making it impractical to learn the value of every possible action independently. This poses a challenge for standard reinforcement learning approaches, which excel in constrained domains but struggle when the space of possible actions is high-dimensional. Recent work in machine learning has sought to mitigate this problem by combining deep reinforcement learning with a supervised learning system that reduces the complexity of the control policy space by learning low-dimensional embeddings of an action space. Here, we propose that in the mammalian brain, the cortico-cerebellar network learns these low-dimensional action embeddings in a supervised way, while the basal ganglia learn value and policies in this action embedding space using reinforcement learning. We trained this model on reaching tasks and show that, contrary to traditional models of the basal ganglia, it recapitulates features of neural activity whereby similar reaching movements are associated with similar neural activity patterns in the basal ganglia. We also demonstrate a link between learning these low-dimensional action embeddings and both generalisation and the limits of multi-task adaptation in human behavioural studies. Through this framework, we propose a novel computational view of how key motor regions of the brain interact to efficiently learn a new skill.

">The effects of elevated serum lactate on measures of apparent cerebral metabolism and perfusion in the anesthetised rodent brain.</a></h4>

              
                Cerebral metabolism is coupled to perfusion and can be probed using a combination of hyperpolarized carbon-13 MRI and perfusion weighted imaging. It is unknown how alterations in serum lactate affect apparent lactate exchange and pyruvate dehydrogenase flux using hyperpolarized 13C MRI, and so this pre-clinical study was designed to assess the sensitivity of MRI to detect changes in perfusion and apparent metabolism in the anesthetized rodent brain due to sodium lactate administration. Results demonstrated significant differences in cerebral blood flow between the saline and sodium L-lactate administered at 0.5 g/kg (112 {+/-} 5 vs 127 {+/-} 2 mL/100g/min), saline and sodium L-lactate administered at 1 g/kg (112 {+/-} 5 vs 90 {+/-} 5 mL/100g/min), and between sodium L-lactate at 0.5 g/kg and sodium L-lactate at 1 g/kg (127 {+/-} 2 vs 90 {+/-} 5 mL/100g/min). There was excellent reproducibility of cerebral perfusion measurements (ICC > 0.95) between observers, indicating high reliability in these results. There were significant differences in [1-13C] lactate:[1-13C] pyruvate between saline vs 0.5 g/kg (0.22 {+/-} 0.05 vs 0.59 {+/-} 0.15) and saline vs 1 g/kg (0.22 {+/-} 0.05 vs 0.62 {+/-} 0.04), but no significant differences in 13C bicarbonate:[1-13C] pyruvate (p = 0.1). In conclusion, perfusion and [1-13C] lactate:[1-13C] pyruvate are sensitive to changes in serum lactate, but 13C bicarbonate:[1-13C] pyruvate were not. This has implications for brain studies using [1-13C] pyruvate, and understanding the impact of serum lactate on clinical hyperpolarised imaging is needed.

">Theta-mediated conceptual reinstatement in vmPFC precedes perceptual reinstatement in ventral visual cortex during memory recall</a></h4>

              
                When recalling past episodes, different features of an experience, such as conceptual meaning and perceptual detail, are reconstructed and reinstated across distributed cortical regions. However, current models of human memory remain unclear how these feature-specific reinstatements unfold over time, and whether they interact hierarchically during memory retrieval. Using magnetoencephalography (MEG) and time-resolved encoding-retrieval cross-phase classification analysis, we compared the time course of conceptual and perceptual reinstatement during cued visual recall. Conceptual information decoding in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) preceded perceptual information decoding in the ventral visual cortex (VVC), and the two were expressed in distinct frequency bands: theta (4-8 Hz) for conceptual and gamma (30-40 Hz) for perceptual information. Cross-correlation and spectral Granger causality analyses revealed that during reinstatement conceptual information in vmPFC predicted and directed perceptual information in VVC, with theta-band information flow predominantly from vmPFC to VVC. In addition, bottom-up connectivity from VVC to vmPFC was expressed in the alpha band. These findings suggest that memory retrieval proceeds from abstract conceptual reconstruction to the reinstatement of perceptual details, mediated by theta oscillatory communication between prefrontal and sensory areas. We propose a hierarchical interactive model in which vmPFC initiates conceptual activation through theta-band top-down signals, while VVC provides alpha-band feedback for evaluating reconstructed perceptual details.

">OpenStride: an inexpensive, open-source force plate actometry system for quantification of rodent motor activity and behaviour</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Force plate actometry (FPA) enables quantitative assessment of rodent motor and behavioural activity. Through tracking centre of mass at high temporal and spatial resolution, FPA can directly quantifying motor performance and various behaviours in the context of operator-independent, naturalistic movement. Previously designed systems have been expensive and non-customisable, and they are no longer commercially available. Methods: We designed OpenStride, an open-source FPA system consisting of both hardware and software. Our system was designed to be able to be constructed with standard tools worldwide at a cost of ~$550 USD, with modifiable hardware files, modular software, and support for both Mac and Windows operating systems. Required tools include 3D printing and acrylic laser cutting. Results: OpenStride reliably tracks position within a 30 x 30 cm2 environment. Based on these positional data, OpenStride currently quantifies tremor, ataxia, distance, velocity, low-mobility bouts, and centre-vs-margin time, with potential to expand to additional analyses. Conclusions: OpenStride is intended to provide a valuable tool for high-throughput, inexpensive study of motor and behavioural function and dysfunction. Software and hardware files will be freely disseminated online via GitHub at the time of final publication to enable others to construct and utilise the OpenStride system.

">DGAT1-dependent lipid droplet synthesis in microglia attenuates neuroinflammatory responses to lipopolysaccharides.</a></h4>

              
                Lipid droplets (LD) are dynamic storage organelles for triglycerides (TG). LD act as a hub that modulates the availability of fatty acids to sustain metabolic needs and the generation of fatty-acid derived signals. Recent evidence demonstrates that LD metabolism regulates immune responses including in microglia, the resident immune cells of the central nervous system. We have previously shown that blocking LD lipolysis in microglia reduces acute pro-inflammatory responses to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) including cytokine and prostanoid synthesis. Here, we investigated the role of diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1), a key enzyme catalyzing the final step of TG synthesis, in microglial LD biogenesis and inflammatory responses induced by LPS. We found that treatment with LPS downregulates specific enzymes in the TG synthesis pathway in primary microglia, including GPAT1, AGPAT3, AGPAT5, and DGAT1, while upregulating TMEM68, a non-canonical TG synthesizing enzyme. Pharmacological inhibition of DGAT1 significantly reduced LD formation in both oleate- and LPS-stimulated conditions, indicating that DGAT1 is essential for inflammation-induced LD synthesis. Moreover, DGAT1 inhibition selectively decreased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF- and IL-1{beta}, without affecting IL-6, CCL2, or the anti-inflammatory cytokine TGF-{beta}. These findings show, that DGAT1-dependent LD formation acts as an important modulator of microglial inflammatory signaling.

                <p>by Veronika Petrova, Muqing Niu, Thomas S. Vierbuchen, Emily S. Wong</p>

Single-cell RNA-seq data from F1 hybrids provides a unique framework for dissecting complex regulatory phenomena, but allelic measurements are limited by technical noise due to low counts. Here, we present ASPEN, a statistical method for modeling allelic mean and variance in single-cell transcriptomic data from F1 hybrids. ASPEN combines a sensitive mapping pipeline and adaptive shrinkage to distinguish allelic imbalance and allelic variance in single cells. In both simulated and empirical datasets, ASPEN achieves a 30% increase in sensitivity over existing approaches for single cell allelic imbalance detection. Applied to mouse brain organoids and T cells, ASPEN identifies genes with incomplete X inactivation, stochastic monoallelic expression, and significant deviations in allelic variance. These results reveal reduced variance in essential pathways and increased variance at neurodevelopmental and immune genes.

                <p>by Fen Yan, ZhiHua Du, Yu-An Huang</p>

Developing computational methods for single-cell drug response prediction deepens our understanding of tumor heterogeneity and uncovers resistance mechanisms critical to improving cancer therapy. However, current approaches struggle to fully capture intratumoral heterogeneity, as bulk RNA sequencing (bulk RNA-seq) obscures heterogeneity across individual cells, while single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) remains constrained by limited throughput and high cost. Current approaches integrating bulk and scRNA-seq data frequently encounter batch effects, impairing robust knowledge transfer. Moreover, most existing methods overlook the role of intercellular interactions, treating cells as isolated entities. To overcome these limitations, we propose DAGFormer, a Graph-based Domain Adaptation framework that integrates bulk and scRNA-seq data for predicting single-cell drug responses. DAGFormer constructs cellular neighbor graphs using diverse topological strategies and employs Graph Domain Adaptation (GDA) to bridge graph-level distribution gaps between bulk and single-cell RNA-seq data. A dual-domain decoder further disentangles shared and modality-specific representations, preserving both general and unique biological signals. Benchmarking DAGFormer on ten independent scRNA-seq datasets demonstrated its superior performance compared to existing methods, underscoring its effectiveness and robustness in cancer drug response prediction.

Organisations are challenged when meeting the computational requirements of large-scale bioinformatics analyses using their own resources. Cloud computing has democratised large-scale resources, and to reduce the barriers of working with large-scale compute, leading cloud vendors offer serverless computing, a low-maintenance and low-cost model that provides ample resources for highly scalable software applications. While serverless computing has broad use, its adoption in bioinformatics remains poor. Here, we demonstrate the most extensive use of high-performance serverless computing for bioinformatics by applying the available technologies to CRISPR-Cas9 guide RNA (gRNA) design. Our adaptation of the established gRNA design tool, named Crackling, implements a novel, cloud-native and serverless-based, high-performance computing environment using technologies made available by Amazon Web Services (AWS). The architecture, compatible with technologies from all leading cloud vendors, and the AWS implementation, contributes to an effort of reducing the barrier to large computational capacity in bioinformatics and for CRISPR-Cas9 gRNA design. Crackling Cloud can be deployed to any AWS account, and is freely available on GitHub under the BSD 3-clause license: https://github.com/bmds-lab/Crackling-AWS

Accurate simulation of the brain’s intrinsic dynamic activity is essential for understanding human cognition and behavior and developing personalized brain disease therapies. Traditional neurodynamics models depend on structural connectivity to explain the emergence of functional connectivity (FC). However, achieving high-fidelity simulations at the individual level remains challenging, as the models fail to fully capture the brain information. To address these challenges, we introduce the Stable Individualized Brain Computing Model (SI-BCM), a data-driven reverse engineering framework designed to infer spatiotemporal co-activity patterns from fMRI data for simulating whole-brain activity. This model captures the dynamic interactions between brain regions by integrating spatiotemporal dimensional information to extract a stable and shared connectivity pattern, representing the intrinsic functional collaboration pattern of the brain. This connectivity pattern is then used as the core connection weight in the dynamical system. Additionally, the model has a new cost function based on the Phase-Space Association matrix (PSA), enhancing its ability to capture brain activity dynamics. This combination enables the SI-BCM to improve simulation accuracy at the individual level compared to existing models, achieving a correlation coefficient between simulated and empirical FC of 0.87. The SI-BCM also showed enhanced robustness and reliability, and effectively captured brain properties. We found the model sensitively reflected changes in cognitive function, thereby providing valuable insights into the underlying neural mechanisms. Furthermore, the application of SI-BCM in the brain modeling of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients substantiated the hypothesis that AD pathogenesis may be due to excessive neuronal excitation. This work establishes a new paradigm for brain network modeling by prioritizing the inference of stable dynamics features from activity data, providing a powerful tool for understanding brain function and pathophysiology.

The advent of environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding marks a transformative era in large-scale biodiversity monitoring. However, the analysis of eDNA datasets is limited by incomplete reference databases and the increasing volume of data requiring processing from raw sequences to annotated taxonomic lists. To detect unexpected taxa in eDNA analysis, geographic priors are incorporated through expert post-analysis, which may introduce potential biases in assignments. Instead of relying on expert intervention, a combination of taxonomic and geographic co-occurrences could be directly integrated into machine learning to automatize and improve taxonomic annotation. Here, we introduce a deep learning approach to the taxonomic assignment of eDNA sequences, which leverages a species reference database, species co-occurrence data, and a phylogeny to enhance annotation directly from raw sequences. The phylogeny provides the structure to the network’s embedding space in which DNA sequences are placed utilizing an artificial neural network (ANN). We train an additional ANN from the phylogenetic embedding and co-occurrence species data to learn coherent species combinations from the whole collection of eDNA sequences, as opposed to single sequences only. When applied directly to the raw sequences, this method correctly predicts unseen species (i.e., those not contained in the reference database), out of more than 31,000 possibilities, in about 24% of the tested cases by relying on phylogenetic embeddings and geographic modulation. The trained ANNs discern species relationships accurately from the raw data, which facilitates the process of associating sequences with taxa—even those absent from reference databases. When we use real eDNA samples, our predictions mostly agree with those from a traditional bioinformatic pipeline, highlighting the potential of our method for the annotation of the increasing number of eDNA sequences.

                <p>by Xiaoxin Guo, Gang Du, Juanyu Zhou, Fang Fu, Yu Yuan, Xingzhu Liu, Haiou Chen, Qianyi Wan, Bo Gong, Haiyang Chen</p>

Aging disrupts intestinal stem cell (ISC) lineage fidelity, impairing epithelial barrier function and then promoting systemic health decline. In this study, we identify peroxisomal dysfunction as a critical driver of age-associated ISC mis-differentiation. Using <i>Drosophila</i> and mouse colonic organoids, we demonstrate that reduced PEX5 expression in aged ISCs impairs peroxisomal matrix protein import, leading to very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) accumulation. In addition, we found that RAB7-dependent late endosome maturation and SOX21A were downstream of the peroxisome in controlling aged ISC differentiation. Aspirin, a classic anti-inflammatory drug, restores ISC lineage fidelity by enhancing PEX5-mediated peroxisomal β-oxidation of VLCFAs. Taken together, these findings highlight peroxisomal dysfunction and VLCFA metabolism as pivotal regulators of ISC aging and suggest new therapeutic strategies for combating age-related intestinal decline.

                Background Biogas production from different types of biodegradable waste is an alternative to fossil fuels for energy consumption and biodegradable waste management. Biogas is a cost-effective, environmentally friendly, and sustainable energy source that provides a reliable method for handling food waste. Methods This study evaluated the effects of rumen fluid and S. cerevisiae isolate MUTJ0F as fermentation activators on biogas production from the co-digestion of cattle manure, fruit and vegetable residues, and cafeteria food waste at Debre Markos University in Ethiopia. Under mesophilic conditions, 12 treatments with different rumen fluid (0–150 ml/100 g) and S. cerevisiae isolate MUTJ0F inoculum (5–10 ml/100 g) dosages were assessed. Biogas was produced from mixed waste using plastic digesters (0.6 L) at mesophilic temperature (30°C) after the 60-day retention period. Standard techniques were used to measure the physicochemical characteristics of the mixed waste, such as pH, total solids, volatile solids, organic carbon, and moisture. This study was conducted experimentally using factorial patterns and a completely randomized 6 × 2 design. The water displacement method was used to estimate the average amount of biogas generated by a 0.6 L digester. Result Rumen fluid with S. cerevisiae isolate MUTJ0F increased biogas generation by more than four times compared to the uninoculated control. The combination of 100 ml rumen fluid and 10 ml S. cerevisiae isolate MUTJ0F per 100 g of mixed waste produced the highest volume of biogas (6900.3 ml). pH monitoring revealed normal acidogenesis followed by a gradual return to methanogenic conditions, while combustibility tests showed the presence of methane in the biogas. Conclusion These results suggest that using rumen fluid and the S. cerevisiae isolate MUTJ0F as inoculants in a biogas digester can enhance methane production and biodegradation efficiency.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1417/v1?src=rss">Breaking Barriers in Male-Dominated Sectors: The Role of Industry Gender Composition and Context in Shaping Women’s Decision-Making Engagement in Uganda [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Women’s participation in decision-making within Uganda’s logistics sector remains limited despite global and national commitments to gender equality. The logistics industry is largely male-dominated, with women often facing structural and socio-cultural barriers that restrict access to leadership opportunities. Guided by Social Role Theory and Critical Mass Theory, this study explores how the broader industry environment and gender representation dynamics shape women’s engagement in decision-making processes within this sector. Methods A quantitative cross-sectional survey design was employed, targeting professionals from private logistics companies, industry associations, and government regulatory agencies. A total of 298 valid responses were obtained. Data were analysed using Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) in SmartPLS to test hypothesised relationships among industry context, industry gender composition, and women’s engagement in decision-making. Results Findings reveal that both industry context and industry gender composition exert significant and positive effects on women’s engagement in decision-making. Furthermore, industry gender composition mediates the relationship between industry context and women’s engagement, implying that higher female representation within the industry reduces tokenism and legitimises women’s leadership participation. Conclusion The study extends the application of Social Role and Critical Mass Theory to Uganda’s logistics sector, highlighting that structural inclusivity and gender-balanced representation are critical enablers of women’s decision-making participation. The findings practically call for gender-responsive policies, mentorship initiatives, and inclusive recruitment strategies to build a sustainable pipeline of female leaders, thereby advancing national goals of gender equality and inclusive economic development.

                Background This study applied geographical standards (coverage distance) and demographic standards to investigate the capabilities of primary healthcare facilities to cover the largest area of the study area and the service area that can be accessed. This study aimed to determine the number of primary healthcare (PHC) centres required to ensure adequate healthcare coverage for the entire community. Methods Data was obtained by applying geographic information system (GIS) techniques, including proximity analysis, spatial overlay, and network analysis, to analyze primary care facilities using the demographic and geographic standards for primary care facilities. The study was conducted in Sleman District, Yogyakarta, Indonesia, using ArcGIS 10.5 and QGIS software for spatial analysis. Results PHC centers cover 79% of the study area according to the geographical standard. The study area needs 41 additional centers to cover the shortfall in service provision per the demographic and geographic standards. Conclusions A significant deficiency in the number of primary care centers found in the study area compared to the large population at the geographical and demographic standards level.

                Dermatophytes are the keratinophilic fungi which infect humans and is the most recurring type of disease. The high level of transmissibility creates an epidemiological risk and emphasises the significance of these illnesses. However, a growing number of reports describing dermatophytes can cause deep infections in diabetic and immunocompromised patients, by invading deep layers like the dermis and hypodermis. Despite the prevalence and significance of dermatophytes in clinical mycology, it is not always possible to accurately diagnose this specific infection due to its overlapping structures among species of dermatophytes. Since it is difficult to identify species that exhibit weak characteristics in the morphological highlights, identification of the dermatophyte is often relied on its morphological analysis, which is a laborious process and demands skill. The massive shift in genetic variation, the source of infection, and epidemiological research can be discovered using molecular approaches. Therefore, the development of an accurate laboratory test for dermatophyte species identification is essential for the prevention and efficient management of dermatophytoses. One such methodology allows use of PCR technology which has many methods for molecular level characterization which is rapid, efficient, and capable of producing DNA polymorphisms specific to various dermatophyte species based on distinctive band patterns seen by agarose gel electrophoresis. The RAPD-PCR approach will be used in this study protocol to molecularly characterize the dermatophytes for precise speciation of the sample. In addition to improving knowledge of fungal biology and pathology with a focus on adaptive mechanisms to combat difficult conditions from host counteractions, there is a need to improve awareness of the importance of these diseases through accurate epidemiological data. The advantages of molecular approaches for characterizing objects over traditional methods are their sensitivity and specificity.

                The increasing prevalence of vector-borne diseases like West Nile virus (WNV) highlights the critical need for predictive modelling tools that can guide public health decision-making, particularly given the absence of effective vaccines. We developed a modular computational framework that simulates and analyses WNV transmission dynamics through compartmental models capturing the intricate ecological interactions among avian hosts, mosquito vectors, and human populations. Our system integrates epidemiological parameters with customizable intervention mechanisms, facilitating the assessment of scenario-specific mitigation approaches. Distinguishing itself from conventional static models, this framework enables users to model dynamic, time-sensitive interventions including targeted mosquito control and strategic bird population management, the two principal containment strategies currently employed against WNV. Using simulations that reflect realistic outbreak scenarios, we evaluated how varying intervention intensities and implementation timings affect epidemic progression. Our findings reveal that early implemented, dual-target strategies addressing both vector populations and avian reservoirs can substantially reduce transmission dynamics and minimize human exposure risk. This framework serves as a comprehensive decision-support platform for policymakers and vector control agencies, delivering mechanistic insights into the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions against zoonotic pathogens within complex ecological systems. The tool’s modular design and scenario-testing capabilities make it particularly valuable for proactive outbreak preparedness and evidence-based intervention planning.

                Background Peer tutoring, a pedagogical approach in which students assist one another in the learning process, has demonstrated strong educational and psychosocial benefits in health professions education. It enhances cognitive development, communication, self-efficacy, and social connectedness. Within nursing education, peer tutoring encourages reflective learning and professional growth. However, limited research has explored its impact within culturally and linguistically diverse student populations in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Aims This study explored the experiences of nursing student tutors and tutees at the University of Sharjah, evaluating their impact on academic development, emotional resilience, interpersonal connections, and the overall learning experience within a culturally and linguistically diverse population. Methods This qualitative study used semi-structured interviews with a purposive sampling of 20 undergraduate nursing students (6tutors and12 tutees) at the University of Sharjah. Data were analyzed inductively through thematic content analysis following the COREQ guidelines. Results Three main themes emerged: (1) Tutors’ perspectives and experiences, (2) Tutees’ perspectives and experiences, and (3) Barriers to peer tutoring. Peer tutoring was found to enhance academic comprehension, communication, and confidence, while also fostering collaboration and empathy. Challenges included language barriers, inconsistent commitment, and limited time for relationship building Conclusions Peer tutoring represents an effective, student-centered learning strategy that supports academic success, promotes psychological safety, and nurtures professional competencies among nursing students. Findings underscore the need for structured, institutionally supported peer tutoring programs that address linguistic diversity, ensure tutor preparation, and integrate emotional and cultural sensitivity into nursing curricula.

[version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background The study analyzed psychosocial predictors of secondary school adolescents between emotional neglect, family dysfunction, parental substance abuse, and their drug use disorders in Abuja, Nigeria. Methods The paper also adopted the descriptive cross-sectional research design within the quantitative research approach. A sample of 275 was drawn from a population size of 965 through multistage sampling techniques. Data collection instruments included a self-developed questionnaire comprising the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) for Emotional Neglect Subscale, an adapted Family Assessment Device (FAD), and Parental Substance Abuse Checklist. Five experts validated the instruments: three medical doctors and two secondary school teachers. The Cronbach’s alpha coefficient, finally used on the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) for Emotional Neglect Subscale, was found to be 0.760; data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Results The results of the findings reveal that there has not been a day in the past year when they drank more than a few sips of alcohol; also, it shows that the relationship between emotional neglect and drug use disorder among secondary school students is concerning. The study shows that the overall family dysfunction score provides very significant insights about the familial relationships observed among students, and finally, the study shows low parental substance abuse. Conclusions The researchers, therefore, conclude that in the quest to reduce psychosocial factors related to drug use disorder among adolescents, family training on how to avoid emotional neglect should be emphasized. Recommendations Finally, it is recommended that there should be a partnership treatment plan between mental health practitioners, teachers, and policymakers to share insightful information concerning emotional well-being that would help establish more supportive conditions for adolescents.

[version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Objectives To estimate Global, Regional, and National prevalence of Malnutrition, specifically Coexisting forms of malnutrition (CFM) and its various types: Coexistence of underweight with stunting (CUS), Coexistence of underweight with wasting (CUW), Coexistence of underweight with wasting & stunting (CUWS), Coexistence of stunting with overweight/obesity (CSO) among children under five years in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Methods This cross-sectional observational study utilized latest nationally representative Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) datasets of 62 LMICs corresponding to six global regions from 2006 to 2024. Data of 541,707 children aged 0 to 59 months with complete anthropometry were analysed descriptively (prevalence estimates) and inferentially (multivariate logistic regression). Results The global malnutrition prevalence among children was 43.9%, of which CFM was observed among 20.9% children. Among various CFM types, CUS was highly prevalent (11.8%), followed by CUW (4.2%), CUWS (3.2%), and CSO (2.1%). South & Southeast Asian had highest CFM prevalence of 29.6%, while Central Asia and Latin America & Caribbean reported the lowest CFM prevalence of 8.1% and 6.2%, respectively. Among all the LMIC included, Timor-Leste exhibited the highest CFM at 41.8%. In general, children aged between 12 to 35 months had 2-3 times higher odds of various forms of CFM. However, female sex, maternal education, improvement in socioeconomic status, medium to large family size showed significantly lower odds with various forms of CFM. Conclusions This study advances the understanding of CFM’s prevalence, determinants, and regional variations, filling a critical gap in global nutrition research. The findings serve as a reminder to reinvest in efforts to protect children from malnutrition during their early years of life. Governments and other global health sector must invest in a well-established system of nutrition surveillance for addressing CFM, informing targeted interventions to improve child health outcomes in LMICs.

                In a context where teaching electrochemistry concepts requires pedagogical approaches capable of fostering student understanding and supporting their situational interest, this study aimed to examine the effect of teaching based on numerical simulation on students’ situational interest and academic performance. It involved 1,020 secondary school students. The sample was divided into an experimental group and a control group. A pre-test and a post-test were administered to assess the impact of this intervention on student performance. The main results are: a comparison of the pre-test and post-test results showed a significant improvement in the mean scores of the experimental group compared to the control group. A Student’s t-test for independent samples revealed a significant difference between the two groups, t(1018) = 2.643, p = 0.008, indicating that the experimental group achieved significantly greater improvements than the control group. A comparison of incorrect answers between the two groups revealed a decrease in misconceptions in the experimental group. The IS2G scale was used to measure situational interest. A mixed-variance analysis revealed a significant interaction effect between time and group, F(1) = 27.11, p ≤ 0.001, and η2p = 0.026. This indicates that the use of simulation led to increased interest among the students who participated in this intervention. In conclusion, the use of interactive numerical simulations represents a promising approach to facilitate the learning of electrochemistry and stimulate student interest.

Classical olfactory learning assays revealed that Caenorhabditis elegans kept on ice or treated with lithium exhibited delayed forgetting of olfactory memories. We showed that the worm’s cold-tolerance internal state ‘switch’ and diacylglycerol (DAG) pathway activity in AWC neurons regulate memory retention.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/107467">G-protein-coupled receptor diversity and evolution in the closest living relatives of metazoa</a></h4>

              
                G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) play a pivotal role in the perception of environmental cues across eukaryotic diversity. Although GPCRs have been relatively well characterized in metazoans, GPCR signaling is poorly understood in their sister group, the choanoflagellates, and in other close relatives of metazoans (CRMs). Here, we examine GPCR diversity and evolution in choanoflagellates by curating a catalog of 918 GPCRs, 141 G proteins, and 367 associated regulators from 23 choanoflagellate genomes and transcriptomes. We found that the repertoire of choanoflagellate GPCRs is larger and more diverse than previously anticipated, with 18 GPCR families found in choanoflagellates, of which 12 families are newly identified in these organisms. Comparative analyses revealed that most choanoflagellate GPCR families are conserved in metazoans and/or other eukaryotic lineages. Adhesion GPCRs and a class of GPCRs fused to kinases (the GPCR-TKL/Ks) are the most abundant GPCRs in choanoflagellates. The identification of GPCR repertoires in CRMs and other non-metazoans refines our understanding of metazoan GPCR evolution and reveals the existence of previously unreported GPCR families in metazoans and at the root of the eukaryotic tree.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105209">Applying 3D correlative structured illumination microscopy and X-ray tomography to characterise herpes simplex virus-1 morphogenesis</a></h4>

              
                Numerous viral genes are involved in the assembly of herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1), but their relative importance and function remain poorly characterised. Transmission electron microscopy has been used to study viral protein function in cells infected with HSV-1 mutants; however, these studies were usually conducted without correlative light microscopy to identify specific viral components. In this study, fluorescent capsid (eYFP-VP26) and envelope (gM-mCherry) proteins were imaged by structured illumination microscopy under cryogenic conditions (cryoSIM) and cellular ultrastructure was captured from the same infected cells using cryo-soft-X-ray tomography (cryoSXT). Nine fluorescent HSV-1 mutants, each lacking a different viral protein, were compared to assess the importance of viral proteins in different stages of HSV-1 morphogenesis. The relative importance of five viral proteins to nuclear egress were ranked (pUL34 &gt;pUL21&gt;VP16&gt;pUL16&gt;pUS3) according to the levels of attenuation observed for each virus. Correlative imaging also revealed the roles of five viral proteins in cytoplasmic envelopment. VP16 was found to be important in capsid delivery to envelopment compartments, while cytoplasmic clusters of virus particles plus features of stalled envelopment not previously described were observed in the absence of pUL11, pUL51, gK, and gE. Finally, this 3D imaging approach was used to capture different assembly stages during cytoplasmic envelopment and to determine that envelopment occurs by particle budding rather than wrapping. The findings demonstrate that tomographic 3D correlative imaging is an emerging technology that sheds new light on viral protein functions and virion morphogenesis.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105086">A green lifetime biosensor for calcium that remains bright over its full dynamic range</a></h4>

              
                Fluorescent biosensors toggle between two states, and for the vast majority of biosensors, one state is bright and the other state is dim. As a consequence, there is a substantial difference in the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for the two states. The dim state has a low SNR, which is problematic when precise, quantitative measurements are needed. During the engineering of a red-shifted variant of an mTurquoise-based calcium sensor, we serendipitously generated a green-emitting sensor that shows high brightness in both the calcium-bound and -unbound state, while still showing a calcium-dependent lifetime change of &gt;1 ns. This sensor, named G-Ca-FLITS, is comparable in brightness to the bright state of GCaMP3 and jGCaMP7c in mammalian cells. The calcium-induced loss in fluorescence intensity is only around 30% and therefore we observe little variation in the SNR when calcium levels change. G-Ca-FLITS shows negligible sensitivity to pH in the physiological range, like its turquoise parent. Using fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM), we measured the calcium concentration with G-Ca-FLITS in various organelles and observed in HeLa cells transient and spatially heterogeneous calcium elevations in mitochondria. Finally, we evaluated the use of G-Ca-FLITS and its turquoise predecessor for two-photon FLIM in <i>Drosophila</i> brains.

">In vitro reconstitution of hippocampal cell assemblies</a></h4>

              
                Three-dimensional neuronal cultures, such as brain organoids, have proven effective for in vitro modeling of brain development and disease. However, it remains unclear whether these systems can intrinsically generate the spatiotemporal network motifs that support cognitive function, particularly given their lack of sensory input. To address this, we developed a 3D long-range modular neuronal network approach to test whether dissociated embryonic hippocampal cells can self-organize into neuronal manifolds capable of generating network dynamics analogous to the in vivo hippocampal cell assemblies implicated in cognitive function. Using all-optical interrogation, we demonstrate in vitro recapitulation of cell assemblies and their hallmark features, including recurring sequential activation, hierarchical chaining, multi-day stability, resilience to perturbation, and attractor-like pattern completion. We further investigated the effects of acute ketamine exposure on these assemblies, revealing network-wide reconfiguration reminiscent of in vivo responses. Finally, we show that human iPSC-derived neurons can similarly self-organize into modular network architectures. Together, these findings are consistent with an intrinsically inside-out view of the brain, rather than a tabula rasa model in which sensory input is required for the emergence of cognitive network motifs, and open new avenues for in vitro modeling of network-level mechanisms relevant to neuropsychiatric disorders.

">Sex differences in the neural circuitry of aggression</a></h4>

              
                The social behavior neural network (SBNN) is a circuit composed of reciprocally connected limbic structures that regulate a range of social behaviors, including aggression. Although both males and females of many species display aggressive behavior, studies of the neural circuitry underlying aggression have focused almost exclusively on males. In the present study, we investigated sex differences in neuronal activation of the neural circuitry controlling aggression in Syrian hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus). We employed c-Fos immunohistochemistry to quantify neuronal activation following aggressive encounters between same-sex male and female dyads. Animals were tested in their home cage either alone (n=7 per sex) or with a same-sex, non-aggressive intruder (n=7 per sex) for 10 minutes. Our data revealed substantial sex differences in the neuronal activation of the SBNN following aggression. In some regions, neuronal activity changed in opposite directions in males and females compared to controls (e.g., posterior lateral septum), while in others, there was a change in neuronal activation in only one sex (e.g., medial amygdala). These findings support the hypothesis that the neural circuitry regulating aggression exhibits marked sexual differentiation.

">BRD1 haploinsufficiency alters early neuronal programming and disrupts maturation in human induced glutamatergic neurons</a></h4>

              
                BRD1 is an epigenetic regulator implicated in neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders, yet its role in human neuronal differentiation, maturation, and function remains poorly understood. Here we show that BRD1 haploinsufficiency disrupts early neuronal programming, resulting in accelerated maturation and altered neurodevelopmental trajectories in human induced glutamatergic neurons. Transcriptomic profiling reveals an early shift toward neuronal identity, characterized by downregulation of pluripotency markers and persistent upregulation of genes involved in synapse assembly and organization, including GRIA3. Despite this, BRD1+/- neurons form significantly smaller synapses and display increased neuronal activity. Our findings highlight BRD1 as a key regulator of neurodevelopmental timing and synaptic maturation, and network activity reinforcing growing evidence that disruptions in chromatin-mediated control of differentiation and synaptic organization contribute to neurodevelopmental disorders.

">Salient auditory stimuli evoke spatially segregated phasic and sustained neural responses in the human brain</a></h4>

              
                Salient sensory stimuli are known to evoke neural activations across distributed brain regions. However, the temporal dynamics of these responses over sub-second timescales remain poorly understood, in part due to limitations in the temporal resolution of non-invasive neuroimaging methods. We examined the spatiotemporal dynamics of neural activations evoked by salient sensory stimuli (rare sounds) using 1,194 widely distributed intracranial electrodes in 5 neurosurgical patients. Salient stimuli preferentially activated 263 of 1,194 electrodes (22%), with responses segregating into two largely distinct spatiotemporal patterns: (1) phasic activation in sensorimotor regions, and (2) sustained activation within the salience network. Cross-correlation analysis revealed that phasic sensorimotor activation preceded sustained salience network activation on a trial-by-trial basis. These findings support an updated view of salience processing in the human brain, revealing that salient stimuli evoke two sequential stages of neural activation - phasic sensorimotor responses followed by sustained salience network activity - rather than simultaneous widespread activation.

">Languages of the brain: fMRI dissection of the amodal networks for language, mathematics, and social knowledge</a></h4>

              
                The ability to compose complex mental representations by recombining simpler primitives is a characteristic of the human brain that manifests itself in a variety of domains such as spoken or written language, mathematics, or social reasoning. While it is known that these domains rest on partially distinct brain networks, they are rarely investigated together in the same paradigm. Here, we present a systematic functional MRI study of written and spoken word and sentence processing in each of these domains. In a true-false judgment task, adult participants were presented with a hierarchy of meaningless and meaningful stimuli bearing on various domains of general semantic knowledge and mathematics. The results show that distinct brain regions are activated by (1) syntax and semantics; (2) math versus non-math knowledge; (3) different domains of mathematics, such as geometry versus arithmetic; (4) social knowledge versus other knowledge. All of these regions are activated essentially identically in the written and spoken modalities. The results were replicated in a group of adolescents. Our experiments show that the human brain comprises distinct amodal networks for various domains of linguistic and semantic knowledge, and provide a simple paradigm to dissect them within a short fMRI session.

">Myelin maintenance and addition regulate synaptic plasticity in the adult mouse cortex</a></h4>

              
                Myelination of the developing central nervous system (CNS) increases action potential conduction velocity but can also act as a plasticity brake, limiting neurite reorganisation and synaptic plasticity. As myelination is a life-long process, the myelin laid down in development or adulthood could also affect synapse number or plasticity across the lifespan. We report that conditionally deleting the transcription factor, myelin regulatory factor (Myrf), to disrupt the myelin maintenance program in oligodendrocytes (OLs) from P57 (Plp-CreERT2 :: Myrf fl/fl mice), led to significant myelin loss and impaired action potential conduction and gross motor performance. By sparsely labelling layer V pyramidal neurons in the primary motor cortex, we could visualise the apical and basal dendrites and their excitatory post-synaptic dendritic spines and determined that spine density was normal in P57+60 Plp-CreERT2 :: Myrf fl/fl mice. However, a higher proportion of the dendritic spines were large, stable mushroom spines and generated larger amplitude miniature excitatory post-synaptic currents. These data indicate that the myelin maintenance program is critical for preserving neuron adaptability, homeostasis and glutamate sensitivity. When we instead prevented the addition of new OLs and myelin from P57, action potential conduction velocity and gross motor performance appeared normal. Spine density was also normal in Pdgfr-CreERTM :: Myrf fl/fl mice, however, spine morphology was changed along the basal dendrites of layer V M1 pyramidal neurons. At P117, the basal dendrites were frozen in a state that resembled P57 dendrites, as they retained a higher proportion of thin, plastic spines. These data suggest that adult myelination supports the life-long accumulation of stable spines within the basal but not apical dendritic compartment and have important implications for understanding dendritic plasticity rules in the motor circuit.

">Dynamic Reversal of IT-PFC Information Flow Orchestrates Visual Categorization Under Perceptual Uncertainty</a></h4>

              
                Categorization relies on a dynamic interplay between sensory representation and cognitive control, yet the classical view posits a fixed, feed-forward (FF) information flow from Inferotemporal (IT) to Prefrontal Cortex (PFC). Whether and how this hierarchical directionality adapts to cognitive context, such as perceptual certainty, remains a fundamental question. We investigated this question in monkeys performing a complex delayed match-to-category task using intracranial recording and a novel connectivity analysis: Model-Based Representational Connectivity Analysis (RCA). This approach allowed us to simultaneously track the content, timing, and directionality of information flow between IT and PFC, while controlling for common task-general representations. Our Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) revealed that while both areas rapidly encoded the task-relevant information, IT coding was earlier and transient, whereas PFC exhibited stronger, sustained coding and content-specific recurrence during the memory delay, reflecting active maintenance of the category rule. Crucially, the directionality of information flow was highly modulated by stimulus certainty. For high-certainty stimuli (Far from the category boundary), we observed the classical, predicted feed-forward flow (IT -> PFC). However, for low-certainty stimuli (Close to the category boundary), this hierarchy dynamically reversed, with a dominant, early feedback (FB) flow (PFC -> IT), preceding the feed-forward sweep. This FB signal carried information related to the ambiguous stimuli, suggesting a top-down mechanism to enhance sensory representations. These results challenge fixed-hierarchy models of categorization, providing mechanistic evidence that the brain dynamically reconfigures the direction of information flow between sensory and executive areas as a function of perceptual difficulty. We propose that the PFC initiates a top-down biasing signal to IT when sensory evidence is ambiguous, thus serving as an adaptive, context-driven control mechanism.

">Excellent agreement between automated deep learning-based and manual DWI infarct volume measurement in hyperacute stroke</a></h4>

              
                Background: Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) lesion volume and infarct growth are important imaging markers in acute ischemic stroke, but manual volume measurement is time-consuming and resource-intensive. Deep learning (DL)-based automated segmentation may facilitate rapid assessment; however, its performance on hyperacute DWI has not been sufficiently assessed. The aim was to evaluate the agreement between DL-based automated and manual infarct volume measurements and to compare their ability to predict clinical outcomes in patients treated with mechanical thrombectomy (MT). Method: Consecutive MT-treated patients (September 2014-December 2019) who underwent DWI at admission and at approximately 24 hours were retrospectively analyzed. Manual infarct volume was measured by stroke neurologists. Automated measurements were obtained using DL-based software. Agreement was assessed using Pearson?s correlation, Bland-Altman analysis, and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC 2,1). Inter- and intra-rater reliabilities were evaluated in a randomly selected subgroup of 150 patients. Predictive ability for a good outcome at 3 months (modified Rankin Scale score 0?2 or stable/improved from premorbid status) was compared using C-statistics and DeLong's test. Results: A total of 371 patients (677 DWI scans) were included. Manual and automated measurements showed very strong correlation (r = 0.96) with minimal bias (?1.77 mL). The ICC for manual-automated agreement was 0.959 (95% CI, 0.952-0.965), comparable to inter- and intra-rater ICCs. Agreement remained high across onset-to-imaging times and lesion sizes. Predictive abilities for a good outcome were similar for manual and automated admission DWI volume (C-statistics 0.867 vs. 0.861) and infarct growth (0.859 vs. 0.853). Manual follow-up DWI volume showed slightly better predictive ability than automated measurement (0.880 vs. 0.866). Conclusion: DL-based automated infarct volume measurement shows excellent agreement with experienced clinicians, with predictive performance comparable to manual assessment. Automated DWI-based quantification is reliable and feasible for use in hyperacute stroke management.

">C57BL/6 Mouse Substrain Differences in the Ontogeny of Auditory Fear</a></h4>

              
                Early life adversity is a major risk factor for mental disorders later in life. Genetic and individual differences modulate the impact of early life trauma and stress on adult mental health, emphasizing the importance of understanding how the early onset of individual differences may shape behavioral outcomes across life. In rodents, genetic differences can be studied using inbred rodent strains or substrains. While C57BL/6 mouse substrains differ in their adult fear behavior, it is unclear when in development these differences emerge. Here we compared the ontogenesis of remote auditory fear retrieval, spontaneous recovery and renewal in the mouse C57BL/6J (Jax, from Jackson Laboratories) and C57BL/6NTac (Taconic Biosciences) substrains spanning postnatal days (P)16, P18, P21, P25 and P30. Taconic male and female mice show an earlier onset of persistent auditory fear memory and spontaneous recovery (females only) compared to Jax mice. Male Taconic mice also display earlier onset of renewal compared to Jax males. These data identify ontogenetic differences in fear processing among C57BL/6 mouse substrains, highlighting how individual differences can contribute to altered behavioral phenotypes in early development.

">An open-source system for recording the auditory brainstem response (ABR) and an example application in mice with hearing loss</a></h4>

              
                The auditory brainstem response (ABR) is a measure of the neurophysiological response to sound, widely used in clinical and research settings. In this manuscript, we describe an open-source and low-cost system suitable for measuring the ABR in mice. (This system is not evaluated or approved for clinical use in humans.) The heart of the system is the commercially available Texas Instruments ADS1299 chip, which is designed for multi-channel differential recording of biosignals. We designed auxiliary hardware and software to record and visualize the ABR. To demonstrate that this system is capable of high-quality and low-noise measurements, we recorded the response to free-field auditory clicks from the left and right. Next, we compared different electrode configurations, quantified the most consistent aspects of the ABR, and assessed variability within and across mice. Finally, we demonstrated how to detect the decreased auditory sensitivity caused by surgically induced conductive hearing loss. Users can deploy this open-source system at low cost and customize it for different applications, such as recording other biosignals like electromyography (EMG) or electrocardiography (ECG).

">The Hemodynamic Response Function Varies Across Anatomical Location and Pathology in the Epileptic Brain</a></h4>

              
                The hemodynamic response function (HRF) links neuronal activity to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals. While most fMRI studies use a canonical HRF, increasing evidence from studies of healthy subjects suggests that the HRF depends on anatomical location and disease states. Here, we investigate how HRF variability relates to anatomical location and pathology in the epileptic brain, using a large simultaneous electroencephalogram and fMRI dataset. Applying HRF deconvolution and temporal decomposition, we built the first whole-brain HRF library specific to epilepsy, identifying four distinct shape groups. We mapped HRF features across parcellations of two atlases using novel Bayesian hierarchical models. In non-epileptogenic regions, HRF shape and spatial distributions align with findings from healthy subjects. Within pathological regions, they vary significantly according to pathology. Our results indicate that HRF variability is associated with pathology, in addition to its dependence on anatomical location, motivating region- and pathology-based HRF modulation in epilepsy studies.

">Cross-modal quality transfer: enhancing MEG spatial resolution using BOLD-fMRI and Explainable machine learning.</a></h4>

              
                Purpose: Blood-oxygen-level-dependent functional MRI (BOLD-fMRI) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) offer complementary insights into brain function, with BOLD-fMRI providing high spatial resolution and MEG offering high temporal sensitivity. This study aimed to enhance MEG spatial resolution through learning inter-modal relationships via data-driven fusion with BOLD-fMRI using explainable machine learning (xML). Methods: MEG and BOLD-fMRI data were collected for sixteen participants watching the same naturalistic visual stimulus. MEG signals were filtered into standard frequency bands and processed to match the haemodynamic response. Data were then decomposed using Tensorial Independent Component Analysis (TICA), yielding 250 MEG (25 per frequency band) and 30 BOLD-fMRI components. A set of Extreme Gradient Boosted (XGBoost) models were trained to predict MEG component activity from downsampled BOLD-fMRI components. The models with best-performing configuration of hyperparameters at this resolution were then used to generate voxelwise upsampled MEG maps using the natively higher-resolution BOLD-fMRI data. Performance was compared to trilinear interpolation using R2, mean squared error (MSE), and structural similarity index (SSI). Model interpretability was enhanced by generating Shapley values (SHAP), describing relationships between input data and model output. Results Models trained on 6mm3 data achieved high predictive performance on previously unseen data (R2 = 0.80, MSE = .07). Using higher-resolution 2mm3 BOLD-fMRI data, MEG activity was upsampled to 2mm3, resulting in more detailed image, while maintaining reasonable congruence to naive interpolation (R2 = .81, MSE = .06). Conclusions: This work demonstrates that explainable machine learning enables spatial super-resolution of MEG maps via BOLD-fMRI-informed quality transfer, enabling enhancement of spatial resolution, and offering improved localization, as well as means of generating data-driven insights into neurovascular coupling.

">N-Ethylmaleimide-Sensitive Factor Deletion in Dopamine D2 Receptor Cells and Associated Neuronal and Behavioural Changes in Mice</a></h4>

              
                N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF) plays a crucial role in neurotransmitter release and membrane molecule trafficking by regulating membrane fusion. Dysfunction of NSF has been linked to neuropsychiatric disorders. Although the interaction of NSF with dopamine receptor 2 (D2R) and the resulting excitotoxicity from its reduction in vitro have been demonstrated, the role of NSF in D2R-expressing cells in vivo remains unclear. This study investigated the effects of NSF loss on the survival of D2R-expressing cells and on mouse behaviour. We generated D2R-specific NSF conditional knockout (Nsff/f;D2R-Cre) mice. Targeted deletion of NSF in D2R-expressing cells led to a significant decrease in D2R-expressing neurons, accompanied by increased apoptosis during postnatal development, reduced striatal volume, and substantially lowered dopamine levels in the striatum. Further evidence of dopaminergic dysfunction was shown by reduced dopamine transporter expression in the striatum and tyrosine hydroxylase expression in the striatum and substantia nigra. The Nsff/f;D2R-Cre mice exhibited attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)-like behaviours, including hyperactivity and impulsivity. Notably, combined administration of methylphenidate and a D2R agonist effectively alleviated hyperactivity and impulsivity, indicating a potential synergistic approach for ADHD treatment. These findings highlight the critical role of NSF in the survival of D2R-expressing neurons and suggest that disruption of the NSF-D2R interaction may contribute to ADHD-like phenotypes. This study underscores the translational relevance of the Nsff/f;D2R-Cre model for ADHD and suggests that targeting D2R dysfunction, particularly in treatment-resistant cases, may represent a promising therapeutic strategy for ADHD.

">Large-Scale Brain Networks Track Gasoline Price Shifts</a></h4>

              
                Macroeconomic conditions shape daily constraints and perceived environment, yet it remains unclear whether real-world economic dynamics are reflected in intrinsic brain organization at the population level. Here, I leveraged the Human Connectome Project (HCP) acquisition timeline as a naturalistic sampling frame to test whether macroeconomic time series vary with large-scale resting-state networks. Resting-state fMRI from 726 healthy young adults was aligned to quarterly macroeconomic indicators using the HCP "Quarter" variable. I quantified intrinsic organization using network functional connectivity (FC) and network-level amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF). I implemented (1) a quasi-natural experiment contrasting a pre- vs post-gasoline-price shock (collapse) cohort, and (2) quarter-level partial correlations between network measures and four macro indicators, including gasoline price, consumer sentiment, unemployment, and stock market return. Post-shock participants showed significantly higher within-network FC across all seven networks and selective increases in between-network coupling concentrated among sensory and attention systems, as well as limbic-default interactions. ALFF exhibited bidirectional shifts: Visual ALFF increased post-shock, whereas Limbic and Frontoparietal ALFF were higher pre-shock. Quarter-level analyses mirrored this differential pattern, with gas price positively associated with Limbic and Frontoparietal ALFF and negatively with Visual and Dorsal Attention ALFF. Across macro indicators, gasoline price and consumer sentiment showed the most widespread FC associations, with largely opposing correlation signatures, while unemployment and equity returns were comparatively weak after correction. These findings suggest that salient, behaviorally proximal macroeconomic dynamics, particularly energy price variation, track population-level differences in intrinsic brain network architecture, motivating future work with finer-grained timing and individual-level exposure measures to strengthen causal inference.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Eye blinks modulate neural activity in visual areas even if the visual input is unchanged. Is the influence of blinking defined by the motor output of the blink? We analyzed blink-related neural activity with laminar resolution in V1 of two macaque monkeys in two conditions, viewing a video and at rest. During free viewing a video, blinks induced a modulation of the local field potential (LFP) in the theta, beta, and gamma band with a granular/infragranular focus. The multiunit activity (MUA) decreased around blink execution. Surprisingly, when comparing the results to blinks executed during the rest condition, we found that MUA increased around blinks. The blink-related LFP power changes, while increasing after a blink in both conditions, were significantly different in amplitude and latency. Our findings show that the blink induced modulation of V1 activity is not determined by the motor execution but depends on the condition in which the movement is executed. This suggests that interactions between movement and neural processes in sensory areas are context-dependent. These interactions may play an important role in predictive coding within the framework of active sensing.</span>

                <p>Olfaction is the dominant sensory modality in rodents. It can be used to assess behavioral phenomena including stress, learning and memory, and social investigation, and impaired olfaction is implicated in several neurological disorders. Paradigms such as the olfactory habituation/dishabituation (OHD) task can assess olfactory perception, memory, and motivation. However, these tasks require manual stimulus presentation, introducing variability and making them labor-intensive. Olfactometers allow automated stimulus delivery, but the OHD task has not yet been adapted for use with an olfactometer. Additionally, current olfactometer designs require proprietary software or components that are difficult to obtain/fabricate and commercial units are expensive. As a result, these apparatuses have not been widely implemented. Here, we describe the design and assembly of the Odor Delivery Optimization Research System (ODORS), an economical, modular, and open-source olfactometer for use in rodents, and describe a variant of the OHD task that can be automated using this apparatus. The design is based on five principles: (1) familiar layout and function; (2) use of inexpensive, readily available components; (3) easily integrated, modular design; (4) real-time assessment of odorant levels; and (5) the ability to test tethered and untethered rodents in optogenetic and electrophysiological experiments. Male and female C57BL/6NCrl mice performing OHD in the ODORS exhibit the characteristic habituation to repeated presentations of an odor and dishabituation to the first presentation of a novel odor. As a result, we suggest that the ODORS makes improved olfactory testing accessible to many labs and offers a major refinement over existing OHD testing paradigms.</p>

<p>Repeated blast TBI in adult female rats produced long-lasting mechanical and thermal hypersensitivity, accompanied by anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors. These deficits aligned with increased glial activation in pain-related brain regions, suggesting chronic pain post-blast TBI arises from sustained glial activity.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Clinical studies have established that repeated blast traumatic brain injury (rbTBI) can result in chronic pain conditions, with outcomes exhibiting notable sex-dependent differences. However, limited preclinical rbTBI models have systematically investigated the behavioral and neuropathological outcomes of female subjects. In the present study, adult female rats were subjected to repeated blast exposures, and the subsequent development of chronic pain–related behaviors and neuropathological changes was assessed. Repeated blast events induced robust mechanical and thermal hypersensitivity beginning 48 h post-injury and persisted through 12 weeks, accompanied by anxiety and depressive-like behaviors at the chronic time point. These behavioral alterations were associated with increased glial activity, as evidenced by Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein (GFAP) and Ionized Calcium-Binding Adaptor Molecule 1 (IBA-1) in the frontal cortex and posterior nucleus regions at 12 weeks following injury. Notably, expression levels of neuropeptide markers, Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide (CGRP) and Substance P (SP), remained unchanged. Collectively, these findings suggest that chronic pain behaviors following rbTBI in females are mediated primarily by sustained glial activation rather than neuropeptide dysregulation.</p>

                Introduction The brachial plexus block is one of the most commonly used anaesthesia techniques for upper limb surgeries. The supraclavicular brachial plexus block (SCBB) has been a frequently performed technique because it provides excellent quality of blockade, faster onset, and dense blockade. Different adjuvants and local anaesthetics are used to improve the onset and quality of the blockade. In our study, the local anaesthetic used was 0.5% levobupivacaine, and the adjuvants used were buprenorphine and nalbuphine. Materials and Methods Our study, a randomised, prospective double-blinded investigation, was conducted on 60 patients scheduled for elective upper limb orthopaedic surgeries. We performed the Supraclavicular brachial plexus block with 25 ml of 0.5% levobupivacaine plain (Group L) or with buprenorphine (Group LB) or with nalbuphine (Group LN) as adjuvants. We recorded the onset, duration of blockade (motor and sensory), sedation score, and time for rescue analgesia. Results The onset of sensorimotor blockade was notably faster in Group LB than in Group LN or Group L. The sensorimotor blockade duration was significantly prolonged in Group LB compared to LN and L. Group LB also had a delayed time after 12 hrs for rescue analgesia compared to the other two groups. Conclusion Buprenorphine as an adjuvant to 0.5% levobupivacaine in ultrasound-guided supraclavicular brachial plexus block significantly shortens the onset of sensorimotor blockade and enhances the duration of blockade when compared to nalbuphine. Both the adjuvants delayed the time for request of rescue analgesia compared to plain levobupivacaine.

                Background Ischemic stroke (IS) is a severe neurological disorder that can lead to disability and mortality in adults. The management of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) requires the ability to predict functional outcomes. Blood biomarkers are valuable prognostic tools because of their rapid assessment, cost-effectiveness, and clinical accessibility. Given that Neurogranin (Ng) is a small postsynaptic neural protein, and when the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is damaged, Ng levels are altered in the bloodstream. Methods This study aimed to assess the concentration of Ng in patients with acute ischemic stroke. We investigated forty-six thrombotic patients, forty-five embolic patients, and forty-five healthy individuals. Serum concentrations of Ng, D-dimer, random blood sugar (RBS), lipid profile, renal function tests, liver function tests, complete blood count (CBC), and electrolyte tests were performed for all participants. Results The results revealed that the embolic group had the highest serum level of Ng compared to the thrombotic and control groups (0.600±0.339 ng/ml, 0.464±0.121 ng/ml, and 0.304±0.065 ng/ml, respectively). Moreover, correlation analysis revealed that serum Ng was positively correlated with some biomarker parameters, specifically platelets, total cholesterol (TC), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL), in the embolic group. Meanwhile, Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve analysis yielded area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.879 vs. 0.897 for the thrombotic and embolic groups, respectively. Conclusion These results led us to conclude that the assessment of serum Ng levels suggests that it can be used as a successful diagnostic parameter for ischemic stroke patients during the early stages of the disease.

                Abstract* The integration of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, into academic research is accelerating. While these tools offer considerable utility for professional doctorate students, especially those engaged in practice-based, qualitative inquiry, their use also presents serious epistemological, ethical, and pedagogical challenges. This article critically examines the promise and limitations of AI in the context of professional doctorates, with a specific focus on qualitative research. Drawing from recent scholarship, it highlights how overreliance on AI can bypass crucial aspects of intellectual development, compromise reflexivity, and obscure researcher accountability. This paper argues for a principled and transparent use of AI, guided by structured frameworks, to ensure that the human researcher remains central to meaning-making and scholarly authorship. The proposed stance foregrounds epistemic agency and underscores the importance of learning through complexity and discomfort in the doctoral journey.

                Background The global commercial banking sector is under increasing pressure to integrate Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) into its core strategies. This shift is driven by evolving regulatory frameworks, heightened stakeholder expectations, and a growing recognition of sustainability’s impact on long-term viability. However, empirical evidence on the CSR-financial performance (FP) relationship remains fragmented and often contradictory, creating a critical knowledge gap for practitioners and scholars alike. Methods This systematic literature review, conducted in accordance with PRISMA 2020 guidelines, synthesizes the most recent evidence (2022-2025). A comprehensive search of Scopus-indexed databases identified relevant studies. The review employed a convergent synthesis approach, integrating quantitative and qualitative findings through thematic analysis and effect size calculations. Study quality was appraised using a modified Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, with 85% of the included studies meeting high-quality thresholds. Results The synthesis indicates a predominantly positive, though context-dependent, association between CSR and financial performance. Meta-analytical findings show moderate positive correlations with key profitability indicators, including return on assets (r = 0.34) and return on equity (r = 0.29). A significant finding is CSR’s pronounced role in risk mitigation, evidenced by a negative correlation with non-performing loans (r = -0.26) and enhanced resilience during market volatility. The relationship is strongly moderated by institutional factors: bank size, regulatory environment, and geographic context. Crucially, the depth of strategic integration was a key differentiator, with substantive, authentic CSR implementations yielding significantly greater financial benefits than symbolic approaches. Conclusion This review provides a contemporary synthesis of the CSR-FP nexus in commercial banking, offering three principal contributions: it identifies key moderators that explain contradictory findings in prior literature; it documents risk mitigation as a fundamental mechanistic pathway linking CSR to financial outcomes. The findings offer evidence-based guidance for banking executives and policymakers to navigate the complex landscape of sustainable finance effectively.

                <p>by Rohit Kumar Singh, Pinaki Swain, Mahipal Ganji, Sandeep Choubey</p>

The compaction of DNA by phase-separating, DNA-binding proteins has emerged as a key mechanism for organizing chromatin and shaping genome architecture. Although experimental studies have provided insights into the governing principles of such protein-mediated DNA compaction, the effect of DNA sequence remains unclear. Here, guided by experimental observations, we present a simple polymer-based model of protein-mediated DNA compaction that explicitly accounts for sequence-dependent protein binding. Using coarse-grained Brownian dynamics simulations, we demonstrate that, in the case of a homogeneous DNA, only one condensate forms in equilibrium. In sharp contrast, DNA sequence heterogeneity can result in the coexistence of multiple condensates. Interestingly, we find that interfacial DNA binding affinity controls capillary forces generated by protein-DNA condensates, offering a potential mechanism to regulate chromatin structure and 3D genome organization. To demonstrate the usefulness of our modeling framework, we compare the simulation results against published data for the compaction of DNA via Dps, Sox2, and HP1. We find that DNA sequence dictates the compaction of Sox2 and HP1 with DNA. Overall, our framework provides mechanistic insights into how DNA sequence affects protein-mediated DNA compaction and paves the way for developing a deeper understanding of genome organization.

Cancer cells undergo extensive metabolic rewiring to support growth, survival, and phenotypic plasticity. A non-canonical variant of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, characterized by mitochondrial-to-cytosolic citrate export, has emerged as critical for embryonic stem cell differentiation. However, its role in cancer remains poorly understood.
Here, we present a two-step computational framework to systematically analyze the activity of this non-canonical TCA cycle across over 500 cancer cell lines and investigate its role in shaping hallmarks of malignancy. First, we applied constraint-based modeling to infer cycle activity, defining two complementary metrics: <i>Cycle Propensity</i>, measuring the likelihood of its engagement in each cell line, and <i>Cycle Flux Intensity</i>, quantifying average flux through the reaction identified as rate-limiting. We identified distinct tumor-specific patterns of pathway utilization. Notably, cells with high <i>Cycle Propensity</i> preferentially reroute cytosolic citrate via aconitase 1 (ACO1) and isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1), promoting α-ketoglutarate (αKG) and NADPH production. Elevated engagement of this cycle strongly correlated with Warburg-like metabolic shifts, including decreased oxygen consumption and increased lactate secretion.
In the second step, to uncover non-metabolic transcriptional signatures associated with non-canonical TCA cycle activity, we performed machine learning–based feature selection using ElasticNet and XGBoost, identifying robust gene signatures predictive of cycle activity. Over-representation analysis revealed enrichment in genes involved in metastatic behavior, angiogenesis, stemness, and key oncogenic signaling. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) further prioritized genes with the strongest predictive contributions, highlighting candidates for experimental validation. Correlation analysis of DepMap gene-dependency profiles revealed distinct vulnerability patterns associated with non-canonical TCA cycle activity, outlining a characteristic landscape of genetic dependencies.
Together, our integrative framework uniting constraint-based metabolic modeling and machine learning systematically reveals how non-canonical TCA cycle dynamics underpin metabolic plasticity and promote malignant traits.

                <p>by Emma L. Fairbanks, Matthew Baylis, Janet M. Daly, Michael J. Tildesley</p>

Vector-borne disease transmission involves complex interactions between vectors, reservoir hosts and dead-end hosts. We present a mathematical model for the vectorial capacity that incorporates multiple host types and their interactions, focusing specifically on West Nile virus transmission by <i>Culex pipiens</i> mosquitoes. Our model integrates climate-dependent parameters affecting vector biology with vector control interventions to predict transmission potential under various scenarios. We demonstrate how vector control interventions targeting one host type can significantly impact transmission dynamics across all host populations. By examining the effects of different vector control tool modes of action (repellency, preprandial killing, disarming and postprandial killing), we develop target product profiles that minimise unintended consequences of vector control. Notably, we identify the optimal intervention characteristics needed to prevent repellency on dead-end hosts from inadvertently increasing transmission among reservoir hosts. This research provides valuable insights for public health officials designing targeted vector control strategies and offers a flexible modelling framework that can be adapted to other vector-borne diseases with complex host dynamics.

Vertebrate neural circuit properties are shaped by synaptic cell adhesion molecules (CAMs). CAMs often have multiple paralogs but the possible redundancy of such paralogs remains underexplored. Using circuit-specific conditional knockout (cKO) mice deficient for Slitrk1 and Slitrk2, we show that these paralogs lack specific laminar expression in mature hippocampal neurons but divergently guide the specificity of neural circuits in distinct hippocampal subfields. Slitrk1 and Slitrk2 regulate distinct facets of excitatory synaptic properties in a microcircuit-dependent manner through binding to LAR-RPTPs, and additionally in the case of Slitrk2, through binding to PDZ domain-containing proteins and TrkB. Analyses of Slitrk2 V89M knock-in mice revealed that this schizophrenia-associated substitution acts uniquely as a loss-of-function mutation in some microcircuits to impair excitatory synaptic transmission, asynchronous release, and spatial reference memory. These findings demonstrate that even structurally and biochemically similar synaptic CAMs can play distinct roles in specifying neural circuit architecture.

                <p>by Nick D. Pokorzynski, Elisabeth C. Sams-Dodd, Christopher Esneault, Katarina A. Jones, Shawn R. Campagna, Eduardo A. Groisman</p>

The intracellular pathogen <i>Salmonella enterica</i> serovar Typhimurium confronts cytoplasmic Mg<sup>2+</sup> starvation inside macrophages. This stress alters carbon metabolism and subverts canonical carbon source preferences by reducing synthesis of 3′, 5′-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), the essential allosteric activator of the cAMP receptor protein (CRP), master regulator of carbon utilization. How, then, does <i>S.</i> Typhimurium preferentially utilize CRP-cAMP-dependent carbon sources inside macrophages? We now report that the virulence and Mg<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis regulator PhoP controls CRP-cAMP-dependent transcription, metabolism, and growth on a mixture of carbon sources during low cytoplasmic Mg<sup>2+</sup>. We determine that the PhoP-activated MgtA and MgtB proteins promote CRP-cAMP activity by importing Mg<sup>2+</sup>, indispensable cofactor of the cAMP-synthesizing adenylate cyclase CyaA. Significantly, the PhoP-activated MgtC preserves cAMP amounts despite reducing abundance of CyaA substrate adenosine triphosphate (ATP) because ATP at high concentrations inhibits CyaA. Restoring CRP activity by supplementation of cAMP or introduction of the constitutively active <i>crp*</i> allele corrected CRP-dependent transcriptional and growth behaviors of the <i>mgtA mgtB</i> mutant. By controlling cAMP synthesis, PhoP dictates the amounts of active CRP, thereby reprogramming <i>S.</i> Typhimurium’s metabolism.

Maintenance of somatic sex identity is essential for adult tissue function. In the <i>Drosophila</i> testis, adult somatic stem cells known as cyst stem cells (CySCs) require the transcription factor Chinmo to preserve male identity. Loss of Chinmo leads to reprogramming of CySCs into their ovarian counterparts through induction of the female-specific RNA-binding protein Transformer<sup>F</sup> (Tra<sup>F</sup>), though the underlying mechanism has remained unclear. Here, we identify the pioneer transcription factor Zelda (Zld) as a critical mediator of this sex reversal. In wild-type CySCs, <i>zld</i> mRNA is repressed by microRNAs (miRs), but following Chinmo loss, these miRs are downregulated, allowing <i>zld</i> mRNA to be translated. Zld is necessary for feminization of <i>chinmo</i>-mutant CySCs, and ectopic expression of Zld in wild-type CySCs is sufficient to induce Tra<sup>F</sup> and drive female reprogramming. Two Zld target genes, <i>qkr58E-2</i> and <i>Ecdysone receptor</i> (<i>EcR</i>), are upregulated in <i>chinmo</i>-mutant CySCs and are normally female-biased in adult gonads. Qkr58E-2 facilitates Tra<sup>F</sup> production, while EcR promotes female gene expression programs. Zld overexpression feminizes otherwise wild-type CySCs by upregulating EcR, which in turn downregulates the <i>chinmo</i> gene. Strikingly, overexpression of Zld also feminizes adult male adipose tissue by inducing Tra<sup>F</sup> and downregulating Chinmo, indicating that Zld can override male identity in multiple adult XY tissues. Together, these findings uncover a post-transcriptional mechanism in which miRs-mediated repression of a pioneer factor safeguards male identity and prevents inappropriate activation of the female program in adult somatic cells.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3003522">Identification of intestinal enteroendocrine cell subtypes and their associated hormones in zebrafish</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Margaret Morash, Richard G. Kay, Erik J. Soderblom, Grace H. MacLean, Jia Wen, Peyton J. Moore, Colin R. Lickwar, Mujahid Ali Shah, Julia Ganz, Fiona M. Gribble, Frank Reimann, Rodger A. Liddle, John F. Rawls</p>

Enteroendocrine cells (EECs) are rare sensory cells in the intestinal epithelium that coordinate digestive physiology by secreting a diverse repertoire of peptide hormones. These hormones are the main effectors of EEC function, and their characterization requires direct observation by mass spectrometry due to the specialized protein cleavage and posttranslational modifications that yield their mature forms. Based on the distinct subset of hormones they predominantly secrete, EECs can be categorized into subtypes. How each EEC subtype is specified, however, remains poorly understood. Here, we describe EEC subtype differentiation and hormone production in the zebrafish. Using single-cell RNA sequencing data, we identified EEC progenitors and six EEC subtypes in zebrafish and revealed that their expression profiles are consistent across larval and adult stages. Mass spectrometry analysis of isolated zebrafish EECs identified highly processed peptides derived from 19 of 23 hormone-coding genes expressed by EECs, including a previously undescribed zebrafish <i>secretin</i> ortholog. We assembled reporters for zebrafish EEC subtypes to test the lineage relationships between EEC subtypes and the EEC progenitor population, which expresses <i>neurogenin 3 (neurog3)</i>. Despite its essential role in mammalian EEC differentiation, we found that selective cytotoxic ablation of <i>neurog3</i>+ cells in zebrafish only reduced a subset of EEC subtypes and loss of the <i>neurog3</i> gene had no impact on EEC numbers. Finally, we discovered that selective ablation of <i>ghrelin</i>+ EECs reduced a different subset of EEC subtypes, together suggesting that <i>neurog3</i>+ and <i>ghrelin</i>+ cells serve as distinct precursors for separate EEC subtypes. We anticipate these observations and resources will facilitate future studies in the zebrafish to discern the developmental biology, physiology, and endocrinology of EEC subtypes.

                Background Recommender systems have become inherent in personalizing experiences, especially digital experiences, across domains such as e-commerce, media, and entertainment. These systems use the user to item interactions data (how an user reacts to an item) to identify patterns that predict preference and rank content. Collaborative filtering is one of the most widely used approaches, relying on similarity between users or items to generate recommendations. Methods This study examines collaborative filtering using similarity metrics applied to a curated IMDB movie dataset. Data was preprocessed using merging metadata and ratings, encoding categorical fields, and constructing feature vectors for each movie. The primary metric to compute pairwise distances between items was Cosine similarity. An item-item recommendation engine was then created and implemented, and the output was evaluated using a movie example (the Saw 2004). Results The system produced coherent recommendations aligned with the genre and thematic characteristics of the input movie used, Saw (2004). The top-ranked films exhibited high cosine similarity scores, indicating strong vector space proximity and consistent user engagement patterns. Visual exploration of the data confirmed that the similarity-based approach captured meaningful behavioral relationships. Conclusions The findings show that a simple similarity-based collaborative filtering model can effectively identify related movies without complex model architectures. Even with lightweight feature engineering, the system generated relevant recommendations that mirror typical user preferences. This demonstrates the practicality of similarity-based methods for scalable and interpretable recommendation tasks, and highlights opportunities for future extensions using hybrid or embedding based models.

                Background The shipbuilding and ship-repair industries are important contributors to world trade. However, it also generates various types of waste, similar to any other industry, which has a detrimental impact on the environment. This study aims to understand the critical need for effective and appropriate waste management practices in this industry by investigating the factors involved in generating various types of waste. It identifies and ranks the major challenges in waste management in this industry. The study also suggests potential solutions for shipyards and repair yards to address these challenges. Methods The study used the Fuzzy Delphi Method (FDM) to prioritize the challenges identified through a literature review and finalized them based on the feedback of experts. Further, a list of solutions for these challenges was prepared based on interviews with experts in this area. Finally, the Best Worst Method (BWM) was used to rank the solutions for each of the identified challenges. Results The findings indicate that the major challenges for the industry are the generation of hazardous waste and the high costs involved in adopting sustainable practices. The results also showed that strict waste segregation and containment are the top solutions to handle the challenge of hazardous waste generation. Further, the leverage on external funding mechanisms and implementation in a phase-wise manner are the top two solutions to deter the challenge of high costs associated with adopting sustainable practices. Conclusions By prioritizing these challenges and solutions, this study provides a road map for shipyards around the world to effectively allocate resources, improve environmental performance, meet regulations, and improve operational performance. This is important for the adoption of an environmentally friendly and economically sustainable shipbuilding and repair industry.

                Background The success of the theories of special and general relativity in describing localised phenomena, such as objects undergoing high speed motion or located in gravitational fields, needs no further elaboration. However, when applied to the evolution of the universe several problems arise which can require an additional model, e.g., inflation during the early expansion, and adjustments to parameters to account for phenomena such as the late-time acceleration of the universe. Methods Focusing on the difference between the ways in which space and time are measured, this paper shows that there are two paths which allow the equations of special relativity to be produced from the same basic postulates. Results Both the standard theory and the energy/momentum, or dynamic model, utilise the Minkowski metric, but with different coordinate systems. The dynamic model transforms Cartesian coordinates into an Euclidean form by multiplying the coordinates by functions of γ (= (1– ν 2/c 2)-1/2). When utilising these coordinates, the relativistic equations are unchanged for local phenomena such as the Lorentz coordinate transformation and the energy/momentum equation for high-velocity objects. Conclusions However, the derived coordinates alter the perceived overall structure of the universe in a manner that, for the simplest model under this system, allows the reproduction of observed cosmological features, such as the intrinsic flatness of the universe and the apparent late-time acceleration of its expansion, without the need of additional models or changes in parameter values.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-661/v4?src=rss">Determinants of urban mosquito population density and community responses: A cross-sectional study [version 4; peer review: 2 approved, 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background Vector-borne diseases transmitted by various arthropods account for approximately 17% of the global burden of infectious diseases. These arthropods, especially mosquitoes, are particularly rampant in Mangalore because of the humid coastal climate and scaling urbanization. Objectives To identify key environmental and household determinants of mosquito presence in urban Mangalore, to assess household-level prevention practices, and to evaluate community perceptions and self-reported disease burden towards mosquito-borne diseases. Methods The study involved households in selected wards of the urban field practice area of the Department of Community Medicine, a teaching and service field area under the Mangalore City Corporation, selected through convenience sampling. Data were collected using a semi-structured questionnaire covering sociodemographic details, mosquito proliferation, breeding determinants, behavioral measures, perception of mosquito control, and self-reported cases of mosquito-borne diseases. The data were analyzed using Jamovi version 2.6.26. Results Among 95 respondents (70.5% female and 94.8% literate), 42.1% reported an increase in mosquito breeding sites over the past year, 69.4% recognized the rainy season as the peak period of mosquito activity. Water stagnation [74.7% (95% CI: 64.8–83.1)] and ongoing construction activity [32.4% (95% CI: 21.8–44.1)] emerged as significant environmental determinants of higher mosquito density which was not statistically significant. A large majority of households (91.6%) reported using chemical measures for mosquito prevention, while 92.6% of participants were aware of mosquito-borne diseases. Despite this, nearly one-third (29.4%) of respondents had experienced a mosquito-borne illness in the preceding year, with 71.4% dengue infection. The use of mosquito repellents was paradoxically associated with a higher prevalence of mosquito-borne diseases (OR = 3.7; 95% CI: 1.4–9.6; p = 0.024). Conclusion Although awareness and preventive measure uptake were high, gaps remain in consistent environmental control and municipal interventions. Strengthening local authority action on water stagnation and construction-site management is essential for sustainable vector control.
