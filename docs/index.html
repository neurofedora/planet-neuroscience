              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Mechanistic contribution of CaV3.2 calcium channels to trigeminal neuralgia pathophysiology not clarified [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is a rare, yet debilitating trigeminal pain disorder, with jolts of supramaximal-debilitating pain in one or more of the three trigeminal branches. Familial TN is now recognized, with a recent report describing several human genetic polymorphisms. One affected gene is the voltage-gated calcium channel, CaV3.2 (CACNA1H), with 19 polymorphisms first described. A recent study in PAIN by Gambeta-et-al (DOI:10.1097/j.pain.0000000000002651) is entitled "CaV3.2 calcium channels contribute to trigeminal neuralgia ". Here, I call into question their claim. My main arguments are 1)-3):  1) Gambeta-et-al studied 4/19 mutations reported in heterologous cellular expression, with two mutations showing gain-of-function of CaV3.2, two mutations not showing gain-of-function. Therefore the exemplary picks of familial TN-associated CaV3.2 mutations do not show a uniform change of channel function, such as gain-of-function.  2) In Gambeta-et-al, one gain-of-function mutation, CaV3.2(G563R) was directed to mouse trigeminal ganglion (TG) neurons, and their resulting hyperexcitability was demonstrated. A critical control of a non-gain-of-function channel was not included here, it was unclear whether neurons were separated by sex, and human sensory neurons were not used. Importantly, it is not clear that TG  neurons are the critical cellular site of CaV3.2 mutations. 3) Gambeta-et-al used CaV3.2-/- pan-null knockout mice. Human TN-associated CaV3.2 mutations were not over-expressed. They used a infraorbital nerve constriction injury and measured facial heat hyperalgesia.  CaV3.2-/- show a pain phenotype similar to control, yet are not affected by a CaV3-inhibitory compound, Z944. My argument is that when starting with TN-associated human mutations, use of a trigeminal neuropathic pain model is of limited value, and that human mutations have to be expressed against a mouse null background. Re thermal cue, Gambeta-et-al failed to study cold-evoked pain which is a TN clinical hallmark. Thus, Gambeta-et-al's 2022 PAIN-paper offers little new mechanistic evidence why CaV3.2 polymorphisms are associated with trigeminal neuralgia.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Effectiveness of a peanut ball device during labour on maternal and neonatal outcomes: protocol for a randomised controlled trial [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Frequent positional changes and movements during labour is one of the recommendations by the World Health Organization (WHO) to prevent prolonged labour, thereby avoiding cesarean sections. However, labour induction, continuous fetal monitoring in supine position and immobilising the women during labour are standard practices in most private hospitals. To combat these problems and to implement WHO recommendations, the peanut ball is an effective device through which frequent positional changes will be achieved without disrupting the labour procedures. The current study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the peanut ball device during labour on maternal and neonatal outcomes and assess the stress response induced by labour in terms of maternal and neonatal cortisol in low-risk primigravid women. The study is a prospective, block randomised controlled trial with parallel arms. A total of 768 study participants will be randomised to the peanut-ball group (intervention) and standard care group (control). The intervention group will receive different peanut ball positions during labour at or after 4 cm of cervical dilatation. The primary outcomes of the study are maternal outcome that includes measurement of duration of the active and the second stage of labour, stress level as measured by serum cortisol level at 3–4 cm and at 10 cm of cervical dilatation, mode of delivery, perception of pain, behavioural response during the active stage of labour and neonatal outcomes, which includes the pattern of fetal heart rate, APGAR score, birth injuries, and umbilical serum and salivary cortisol level. The collected data will be compared between the intervention and control groups.  Trial Registration: This research is registered under the CTRI (Clinical Trials Registry of India) (CTRI/2019/08/020802) (21/8/2019).

	<p>Background: Diagnosis of Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s Disease (PD) based on clinical symptoms and scale scores is mostly objective, and the accuracy of neuroimaging for PD diagnosis remains controversial. This study aims to introduce a radiomic tool to improve the sensitivity and specificity of diagnosis based on Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) metrics. Methods: In this machine learning-based retrospective study, we collected basic clinical information and DTI images from 54 healthy controls (HCs) and 56 PD patients. Among them, 60 subjects (30 PD patients and 30 HCs) were assigned to the training group, whereas the test cohort was 26 PD patients and 24 HCs. After the feature extraction and selection using newly developed image processing software Ray-plus, LASSO regression was used to finalize radiomic features. Results: A total of 4600 radiomic features were extracted, of which 12 were finally selected. The values of the AUC (area under the subject operating curve) in the training group, the validation group, and overall were 0.911, 0.931, and 0.919, respectively. Conclusion: This study introduced a novel radiometric and computer algorithm based on DTI images, which can help increase the sensitivity and specificity of PD screening.</p>

<p>Graphical Abstract: Using RNAscope in situ hybridization, we comprehensively mapped oxytocin receptor mRNA throughout the prairie vole brain. A comparison of mRNA and protein localization revealed localized mismatches suggesting both pre- and postsynaptic functions for oxytocin receptors (OXTRs). Coexpression of Oxtr mRNA with D1/D2 receptors in the nucleus accumbens was also examined.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Oxytocin regulates social behavior via direct modulation of neurons, regulation of neural network activity, and interaction with other neurotransmitter systems. The behavioral effects of oxytocin signaling are determined by the species-specific distribution of brain oxytocin receptors. The socially monogamous prairie vole has been a useful model organism for elucidating the role of oxytocin in social behaviors, including pair bonding, response to social loss, and consoling. However, there has been no comprehensive mapping of oxytocin receptor-expressing cells throughout the prairie vole brain. Here, we employed a highly sensitive in situ hybridization, RNAscope, to construct an exhaustive, brain-wide map of oxytocin receptor mRNA-expressing cells. We found that oxytocin receptor mRNA expression was widespread and diffused throughout the brain, with specific areas displaying a particularly robust expression. Comparing receptor binding with mRNA revealed that regions of the hippocampus and substantia nigra contained oxytocin receptor protein but lacked mRNA, indicating that oxytocin receptors can be transported to distal neuronal processes, consistent with presynaptic oxytocin receptor functions. In the nucleus accumbens, a region involved in oxytocin-dependent social bonding, oxytocin receptor mRNA expression was detected in both the D1 and D2 dopamine receptor-expressing subtypes of cells. Furthermore, natural genetic polymorphisms robustly influenced oxytocin receptor expression in both D1 and D2 receptor cell types in the nucleus accumbens. Collectively, our findings further elucidate the extent to which oxytocin signaling is capable of influencing brain-wide neural activity, responses to social stimuli, and social behavior.</p>
<h2>Key points</h2>
<p>
<p>Oxytocin receptor mRNA is diffusely expressed throughout the brain, with strong expression concentrated in certain areas involved in social behavior.</p>
<p>Oxytocin receptor mRNA expression and protein localization are misaligned in some areas, indicating that the receptor protein may be transported to distal processes.</p>
<p>In the nucleus accumbens, oxytocin receptors are expressed on cells expressing both D1 and D2 dopamine receptor subtypes, and the majority of variation in oxytocin receptor expression between animals is attributable to polymorphisms in the oxytocin receptor gene.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Optoception: Perception of Optogenetic Brain Perturbations</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>How do animals experience brain manipulations? Optogenetics has allowed us to manipulate selectively and interrogate neural circuits underlying brain function in health and disease. However, little is known about whether mice can detect and learn from arbitrary optogenetic perturbations from a wide range of brain regions to guide behavior. To address this issue, mice were trained to report optogenetic brain perturbations to obtain rewards and avoid punishments. Here, we found that mice can perceive optogenetic manipulations regardless of the perturbed brain area, rewarding effects, or the stimulation of glutamatergic, GABAergic, and dopaminergic cell types. We named this phenomenon optoception, a perceptible signal internally generated from perturbing the brain, as occurs with interoception. Using optoception, mice can learn to execute two different sets of instructions based on the laser frequency. Importantly, optoception can occur either activating or silencing a single cell type. Moreover, stimulation of two brain regions in a single mouse uncovered that the optoception induced by one brain region does not necessarily transfer to a second not previously stimulated area, suggesting a different sensation is experienced from each site. After learning, they can indistinctly use randomly interleaved perturbations from both brain regions to guide behavior. Collectively taken, our findings revealed that mice&rsquo;s brains could "monitor" perturbations of their self-activity, albeit indirectly, perhaps via interoception or as a discriminative stimulus, opening a new way to introduce information to the brain and control brain-computer interfaces.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Readiness and determinants of Vietnam's general public to receive the COVID-19 Vaccine: a national online cross-sectional study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Despite vaccinations' efficacy in combating disease, people's readiness to get the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine are substantially varied. This study aimed to assess Vietnamese people's readiness, attitudes, and determinants for COVID-19 vaccination. Methods: A web-based cross-sectional online survey was conducted using a convenience sampling approach. The Vietnamese population's readiness to receive COVID-19 vaccinations was assessed using the 7C of vaccination readiness scale (7Cs). The scale was posted on Facebook and Zalo platforms. Descriptive statistics were calculated, and inferential analysis was applied to identify determinants predicting respondents' vaccine readiness. Results: Of the 1086 respondents invited to the study, 1026 completed the questionnaire. The Vietnamese population demonstrated a moderate level of readiness for COVID-19 vaccination uptake, with an average 7Cs score of 103.25±15.13. A high level was underscored in the complacency, constraints, collective responsibility, and compliance components, and a low level was reported in the calculation component. The Vietnamese population emphasized that the awareness of the significant adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccination was the primary factor influencing their readiness to get the vaccine (p < 0.001). Worrying about the vaccine manufacturer and its origin was the second most crucial factor influencing their readiness to get the vaccine (p < 0.001). Conclusions: Building confidence between people and the Vietnamese authorities is a high priority to enhance people's readiness to get the COVID-19 vaccine. The authorities should focus on dispelling disinformation posted on social media and promoting the usefulness of COVID-19 vaccines.

                Background - Marketers face evolution of online brand positioning marketing strategy due to changes of search engine algorithm that affects the reaching out of brands to potential internet users. Brand owners realise that to be relevant in modern market, they need to transition and focus more into online market. However, many brand owners have ignored the power of search engine optimisation (SEO) strategy for attracting the online market, which is highly competitive and faces rapid changes.  A brand can be considered as old fashioned if it does not utilise the SEO as their marketing strategy, in penetrating the online marketplace. Various studies have analysed factors that can enhance the persistency of using the SEO strategy, however gaps remain regarding the relationship of this strategy with the online brand positioning. The main aim of this study was to identify the persistency of using the SEO strategy including the niche point of differentiation, valuable content, targeted keyword and scalable link building, as the determinants that enhance the success of online brand positioning. Methods – This study applies quantitative design using online survey to gather information from the online business entrepreneurs. The survey questionnaire was arranged to focus on the use of SEO as a new way to strategies online business. Results – Based on the results of this study, most online entrepreneurs have somewhat realised the effects of using the SEO strategy to enhance effectiveness of online brand positioning. Conclusion – This research provides insights on the importance of SEO strategy in online business positioning. It is hoped that the online entrepreneurs will take the SEO strategy into consideration in the positioning of their brand in the marketplace.

                Avian influenza virus subtype H9N2 was first documented in Indonesia in 2017. It has become prevalent in chickens in many provinces of Indonesia as a result of reassortment in live bird markets. Low pathogenic avian influenza subtype H9N2 virus-infected poultry provides a new direction for the influenza virus. According to the latest research, the Indonesian H9N2 viruses may have developed through antigenic drift into a new genotype, posing a significant hazard to poultry and public health. The latest proof of interspecies transmission proposes that the next human pandemic variant will be the avian influenza virus subtype H9N2. Manipulation and elimination of H9N2 viruses in Indonesia, constant surveillance of viral mutation, and vaccine updates are required to achieve effectiveness. The current review examines should be investigates/assesses/report on the development and evolution of newly identified H9N2 viruses in Indonesia and their vaccination strategy.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">COVID19 vaccination choice among Iraqi students at Al-Zahraa University for women [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background:  COVID19 vaccine rejection is a global issue that most developing countries face. A study of COVID-19 vaccine preference among Al-Zahraa University female students will pave the way to resolving the issue of vaccine rejection among students. Vaccine hesitation refers to a delay in accepting or refusing immunization despite the fact that vaccination services are readily available. Students' preferences and refusals of the COVID19 vaccine were evaluated to determine the reasons for their decisions.  Methods: This study involved 198 students from Al-Zahraa University for women. An observational cross-sectional study was conducted at Al-Zahraa University in Karbala, Iraq, to find out which Health and Medical Technology students preferred the COVID19 vaccine. Tests based on statistics made use of frequency and rate data.  Results: Most students (95%) were over the age of 19. The COVID-19 vaccine was rejected by 138 people (70.4%).  A total of 43 students (28.5%) believed that the COVID19 vaccine may not be completely safe. 49.3% of students were not aware of the differences between the various types of vaccines.  Pfizer was the most preferred by 64 (34.8%), AstraZeneca by 17 (9.2%), and Chinse-Sinovac by only 11 (6%). 20 students (16.4%) believed that with the vaccine they could return to life as it was before the COVID-19 pandemic. Covid-19 vaccine acceptance among Al-Zahara University students may be low in part because of myths, and partly because of the fear of side-effects associated with the vaccine.  Conclusion:  Information about COVID-19 vaccines should be transparently communicated to the media by health authorities to help the public make informed decisions.

                <p>by Brett L. Foster, Eleonora Bartoli</p>

New findings in PLOS Biology show that visual gamma oscillations are greatly attenuated by small spatial discontinuities in visual stimuli, suggesting that their genesis occurs in response to predictable regularities in the visual world.

This Primer explores the implications of a recent PLOS Biology study showing that gamma synchrony in visual cortex is disrupted when small discontinuities are added to visual stimuli. This suggests that gamma synchrony is highly sensitive to regularities in the visual world and potentially play a role in predictive processing.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">DEVEA: an interactive shiny application for Differential Expression analysis, data Visualization and Enrichment Analysis of transcriptomics data [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                We are at a time of considerable growth in the use and development of transcriptomics studies and subsequent in silico analysis. RNA sequencing is one of the most widely used approaches, now integrated in many studies.  The processing of these data may typically require a noteworthy number of steps, statistical knowledge, and coding skills which is not accessible to all scientists. Despite the undeniable development of software applications over the years to address this concern, it is still possible to improve.  Here we present DEVEA, an R shiny application tool developed to perform differential expression analysis, data visualization and enrichment pathway analysis mainly from transcriptomics data, but also from simpler gene lists with or without statistical values.  Its intuitive and easy-to-manipulate interface facilitates gene expression exploration through numerous interactive figures and tables, statistical comparisons of expression profile levels between groups and further meta-analysis such as enrichment analysis, without bioinformatics expertise. DEVEA performs a thorough analysis from multiple and flexible input data representing distinct analysis stages. From them, it produces dynamic graphs and tables, to explore the expression levels and statistical differential expression analysis results. Moreover, it generates a comprehensive pathway analysis to extend biological insights. Finally, a complete and customizable HTML report can be extracted for further result exploration outside the application. DEVEA is accessible at https://shiny.imib.es/devea/ and the source code is available on our GitHub repository https://github.com/MiriamRiquelmeP/DEVEA.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis: to investigate the association of adherence to plant-based diets with cardiovascular disease risk [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background:Plant-based diets (PBDs) are characterised as healthy dietary patterns that emphasise the intake of plant foods and limit the intake of animal foods. The Mediterranean and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diets are common examples of healthy dietary patterns that are mainly plant based. There are different dietary pattern analysis approaches and scoring systems available to construct indices that measure adherence to a dietary pattern. Nutritional epidemiology studies necessitate the use of appropriate dietary indices when investigating diet-disease associations. This protocol is for a review that will: 1) evaluate how a PBD has been defined in studies published globally; and 2) assess the methods used to construct dietary indices that measure adherence to a PBD; with a focus on studies that have assessed the association between adherence to a PBD and CVD risk. Methods:This protocol was developed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis Protocols guidelines. PubMed–Medline, Scopus and biomedical databases within EBSCOhost will be searched up to August 2021. Two reviewers will independently screen the identified records and review the eligible full texts for inclusion. Discrepancies will be resolved by consensus or through discussion with a third reviewer. Meta-analysis will be performed where possible and consistency of the findings checked through subgroup analysis. Heterogeneity across studies will be assessed and quantified, and publication bias investigated. Relevant sensitivity analyses will be performed to substantiate the robustness of the study findings. Conclusion:Currently, there is some inconsistency in defining and measuring adherence to a PBD across study populations. Moreover, a lack of global data on the association between adherence to a PBD and CVD risk. This systematic review could aid in promoting the worldwide uptake of these findings for policy and practice purposes. This research will use previously published studies; and therefore, will not require ethical approval.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Intrapartum care intervention fidelity and factors associated with it in South Wollo Administrative Zone, Northeast Ethiopia. [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Abstract Background: Implementation of recommended intrapartum care intervention varies across places due to contextual socio-cultural and behavioral determinants. Previous research has utilized several operationalizations to measure intrapartum intervention content and has failed to analyze provider and facility-related factors that influence intrapartum intervention content. So yet, no study has used intervention fidelity metrics to assess intrapartum care. Therefore, this study aimed at assessing institutional intrapartum care intervention fidelity & factors associated with it. Methods: On randomly selected keabeles (study sites), a cross-sectional study design was used. All health posts and health extension workers within the specified area were included, as were 898 postnatal mothers within six months of delivery. Data was collected via an interview, self-administered questionnaires, and an observation checklist. To calculate the institutional delivery coverage and intrapartum care intervention fidelity, descriptive statistics were used. The weighted sum of all intrapartum care components and institutional delivery coverage were used to calculate intrapartum care intervention fidelity. The researchers utilized a multilevel linear regression analysis model to find characteristics linked to intrapartum care intervention fidelity. Results: In this study, institutional delivery coverage was 60.9% (95% CI: 57.7 – 64.1) with intrapartum care intervention fidelity of 35.6% (95% CI: 31.3-35.9). Moreover, only 21 (2.3%) of mothers received all of the contents of intrapartum care intervention. Health posts’ distance from mothers’ home, unskilled birth attendant, poor relationship between HEWs and HC staffs and low HEWs knowledge of danger signs were statistically significant barriers while HEWs as birth attendant were facilitators for Intrapartum care intervention fidelity. Conclusion: This study investigated that intrapartum care intervention fidelity was low. This finding indicated that distance from health institution inhibit mothers to receive skilled intrapartum care interventions as recommended.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/neuron/inpress.rss">Core transcription programs controlling injury-induced neurodegeneration of retinal ganglion cells</a></h4>

              
                By independent in vivo genetic screen and multi-omic analysis of injured retinal ganglion cells, Feng et al. identify four transcription factors, which act as complementary critical regulators of neuronal survival following injury. These genes regulate two distinct degenerative programs in response to extrinsic and intrinsic stressors, respectively.

                Several interventions promote survival and regeneration of retinal ganglion cells following injury. scRNA-seq analysis shows that these interventions downregulate a gene expression program associated with cell death and upregulate programs associated with survival and regeneration. Overexpression of some regeneration module genes enhances RGC survival and axon regeneration in vivo.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Post-transcriptional regulation of transcription factor codes in immature neurons drives neuronal diversity</a></h4>

              
                Guan et al. discovered that the individual morphological fates of motoneurons are determined by the transcription factor mRNAs they express together with gradients of RNA-binding proteins that determine which TF mRNAs are translated, ultimately producing a set of TF codes that are unique for each neuron.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Divergent outer retinal circuits drive image and non-image visual behaviors</a></h4>

              
                Beier et al. show that light information diverges at the visual system’s first synapse to control major visual functions: image formation and non-image behaviors, such as circadian photoentrainment and pupil constriction. Like image formation, the non-image system depends on the most sensitive retinal circuit under dim light conditions.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Stable antibiotic resistance and rapid human adaptation in livestock-associated MRSA</a></h4>

              
                Mobile genetic elements (MGEs) are agents of horizontal gene transfer in bacteria, but can also be vertically inherited by daughter cells. Establishing the dynamics that led to contemporary patterns of MGEs in bacterial genomes is central to predicting the emergence and evolution of novel and resistant pathogens. Methicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (MRSA) clonal-complex (CC) 398 is the dominant MRSA in European livestock and a growing cause of human infections. Previous studies have identified three categories of MGEs whose presence or absence distinguishes livestock-associated CC398 from a closely related and less antibiotic-resistant human-associated population. Here, we fully characterise the evolutionary dynamics of these MGEs using a collection of 1180 CC398 genomes, sampled from livestock and humans, over 27 years. We find that the emergence of livestock-associated CC398 coincided with the acquisition of a Tn<i>916</i> transposon carrying a tetracycline resistance gene, which has been stably inherited for 57 years. This was followed by the acquisition of a type V SCC<i>mec</i> that carries methicillin, tetracycline, and heavy metal resistance genes, which has been maintained for 35 years, with occasional truncations and replacements with type IV SCC<i>mec</i>. In contrast, a class of prophages that carry a human immune evasion gene cluster and that are largely absent from livestock-associated CC398 have been repeatedly gained and lost in both human- and livestock-associated CC398. These contrasting dynamics mean that when livestock-associated MRSA is transmitted to humans, adaptation to the human host outpaces loss of antibiotic resistance. In addition, the stable inheritance of resistance-associated MGEs suggests that the impact of ongoing reductions in antibiotic and zinc oxide use in European farms on livestock-associated MRSA will be slow to be realised.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">CAMSAP2 organizes a γ-tubulin-independent microtubule nucleation centre through phase separation</a></h4>

              
                Microtubules are dynamic polymers consisting of αβ-tubulin heterodimers. The initial polymerization process, called microtubule nucleation, occurs spontaneously via αβ-tubulin. Since a large energy barrier prevents microtubule nucleation in cells, the γ-tubulin ring complex is recruited to the centrosome to overcome the nucleation barrier. However, a considerable number of microtubules can polymerize independently of the centrosome in various cell types. Here, we present evidence that the minus-end-binding calmodulin-regulated spectrin-associated protein 2 (CAMSAP2) serves as a strong nucleator for microtubule formation by significantly reducing the nucleation barrier. CAMSAP2 co-condensates with αβ-tubulin via a phase separation process, producing plenty of nucleation intermediates. Microtubules then radiate from the co-condensates, resulting in aster-like structure formation. CAMSAP2 localizes at the co-condensates and decorates the radiating microtubule lattices to some extent. Taken together, these in vitro findings suggest that CAMSAP2 supports microtubule nucleation and growth by organizing a nucleation centre as well as by stabilizing microtubule intermediates and growing microtubules.

                Induced differentiation is one of the most experience- and skill-dependent experimental processes in regenerative medicine, and establishing optimal conditions often takes years. We developed a robotic AI system with a batch Bayesian optimization algorithm that autonomously induces the differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cell-derived retinal pigment epithelial (iPSC-RPE) cells. From 200 million possible parameter combinations, the system performed cell culture in 143 different conditions in 111 days, resulting in 88% better iPSC-RPE production than that obtained by the pre-optimized culture in terms of the pigmentation scores. Our work demonstrates that the use of autonomous robotic AI systems drastically accelerates systematic and unbiased exploration of experimental search space, suggesting immense use in medicine and research.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Domain fusion TLR2-4 enhances the autophagy-dependent clearance of Staphylococcus aureus in the genetic engineering goat</a></h4>

              
                <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> infections pose a potential threat to livestock production and public health. A novel strategy is needed to control <i>S. aureus</i> infections due to its adaptive evolution to antibiotics. Autophagy plays a key role in degrading bacteria for innate immune cells. In order to promote <i>S. aureus</i> clearance via Toll-like receptor (TLR)-induced autophagy pathway, the domain fusion TLR2-4 with the extracellular domain of TLR2, specific recognizing <i>S. aureus</i>, and transmembrane and intracellular domains of TLR4 is assembled, then the goat expressing <i>TLR2-4</i> is generated. TLR2-4 substantially augments the removal of <i>S. aureus</i> within macrophages by elevating autophagy level. Phosphorylated JNK and ERK1/2 promote LC3-puncta in TLR2-4 macrophages during <i>S. aureus</i>-induced autophagy via MyD88 mediated the TAK1 signaling cascade. Meantime, the TRIF-dependent TBK1-TFEB-OPTN signaling is involved in TLR2-4-triggered autophagy after <i>S. aureus</i> challenge. Moreover, the transcript of <i>ATG5</i> and <i>ATG12</i> is significantly increased via cAMP-PKA-NF-κB signaling, which facilitates <i>S. aureus</i>-induced autophagy in TLR2-4 macrophages. Overall, the novel receptor TLR2-4 enhances the autophagy-dependent clearance of <i>S. aureus</i> in macrophages via TAK1/TBK1-JNK/ERK, TBK1-TFEB-OPTN, and cAMP-PKA-NF-κB-ATGs signaling pathways, which provide an alternative approach for resistant against <i>S. aureus</i> infection.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Gill developmental program in the teleost mandibular arch</a></h4>

              
                Whereas no known living vertebrate possesses gills derived from the jaw-forming mandibular arch, it has been proposed that the jaw arose through modifications of an ancestral mandibular gill. Here, we show that the zebrafish pseudobranch, which regulates blood pressure in the eye, develops from mandibular arch mesenchyme and first pouch epithelia and shares gene expression, enhancer utilization, and developmental <i>gata3</i> dependence with the gills. Combined with work in chondrichthyans, our findings in a teleost fish point to the presence of a mandibular pseudobranch with serial homology to gills in the last common ancestor of jawed vertebrates, consistent with a gill origin of vertebrate jaws.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Antibacterial potency of Type VI amidase effector toxins is dependent on substrate topology and cellular context</a></h4>

              
                Members of the bacterial T6SS amidase effector (Tae) superfamily of toxins are delivered between competing bacteria to degrade cell wall peptidoglycan. Although Taes share a common substrate, they exhibit distinct antimicrobial potency across different competitor species. To investigate the molecular basis governing these differences, we quantitatively defined the functional determinants of Tae1 from <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> PAO1 using a combination of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and a high-throughput <i>in vivo</i> genetic approach called deep mutational scanning (DMS). As expected, combined analyses confirmed the role of critical residues near the Tae1 catalytic center. Unexpectedly, DMS revealed substantial contributions to enzymatic activity from a much larger, ring-like functional hot spot extending around the entire circumference of the enzyme. Comparative DMS across distinct growth conditions highlighted how functional contribution of different surfaces is highly context-dependent, varying alongside composition of targeted cell walls. These observations suggest that Tae1 engages with the intact cell wall network through a more distributed three-dimensional interaction interface than previously appreciated, providing an explanation for observed differences in antimicrobial potency across divergent Gram-negative competitors. Further binding studies of several Tae1 variants with their cognate immunity protein demonstrate that requirements to maintain protection from Tae activity may be a significant constraint on the mutational landscape of <i>tae1</i> toxicity in the wild. In total, our work reveals that Tae diversification has likely been shaped by multiple independent pressures to maintain interactions with binding partners that vary across bacterial species and conditions.

                Most rapid diagnostic tests for <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> malaria target the Histidine-Rich Proteins 2 and 3 (HRP2, HRP3)<i>.</i> Deletions of the <i>hrp2</i> and <i>hrp3</i> genes result in false negative tests and are a threat for malaria control. A novel assay for molecular surveillance of <i>hrp2</i>/<i>hrp3</i> deletions was developed based on droplet digital PCR (ddPCR). The assay quantifies <i>hrp2</i>, <i>hrp3</i>, and a control gene with very high accuracy. The theoretical limit of detection was 0.33 parasites/µL. The deletion was reliably detected in mixed infections with wild-type and <i>hrp2</i>-deleted parasites at a density of &gt;100 parasites/reaction. For a side-by-side comparison with the conventional nested PCR (nPCR) assay, 248 samples were screened in triplicate by ddPCR and nPCR. No deletions were observed by ddPCR, while by nPCR <i>hrp2</i> deletion was observed in 8% of samples. The ddPCR assay was applied to screen 830 samples from Kenya, Zanzibar/Tanzania, Ghana, Ethiopia, Brazil, and Ecuador. Pronounced differences in the prevalence of deletions were observed among sites, with more <i>hrp3</i> than <i>hrp2</i> deletions. In conclusion, the novel ddPCR assay minimizes the risk of false-negative results (i.e. <i>hrp2</i> deletion observed when the sample is wild type), increases sensitivity, and greatly reduces the number of reactions that need to be run.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Understanding drivers of phylogenetic clustering and terminal branch lengths distribution in epidemics of Mycobacterium tuberculosis</a></h4>

              
                Detecting factors associated with transmission is important to understand disease epidemics, and to design effective public health measures. Clustering and terminal branch lengths (TBL) analyses are commonly applied to genomic data sets of <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> (MTB) to identify sub-populations with increased transmission. Here, I used a simulation-based approach to investigate what epidemiological processes influence the results of clustering and TBL analyses, and whether differences in transmission can be detected with these methods. I simulated MTB epidemics with different dynamics (latency, infectious period, transmission rate, basic reproductive number R0, sampling proportion, sampling period, and molecular clock), and found that all considered factors, except for the length of the infectious period, affect the results of clustering and TBL distributions. I show that standard interpretations of this type of analyses ignore two main caveats: (1) clustering results and TBL depend on many factors that have nothing to do with transmission, (2) clustering results and TBL do not tell anything about whether the epidemic is stable, growing, or shrinking, unless all the additional parameters that influence these metrics are known, or assumed identical between sub-populations. An important consequence is that the optimal SNP threshold for clustering depends on the epidemiological conditions, and that sub-populations with different epidemiological characteristics should not be analyzed with the same threshold. Finally, these results suggest that different clustering rates and TBL distributions, that are found consistently between different MTB lineages, are probably due to intrinsic bacterial factors, and do not indicate necessarily differences in transmission or evolutionary success.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Aberrant cortical development is driven by impaired cell cycle and translational control in a DDX3X syndrome model</a></h4>

              
                Mutations in the RNA helicase, <i>DDX3X</i>, are a leading cause of Intellectual Disability and present as <i>DDX3X</i> syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder associated with cortical malformations and autism. Yet, the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which DDX3X controls cortical development are largely unknown. Here, using a mouse model of <i>Ddx3x</i> loss-of-function we demonstrate that DDX3X directs translational and cell cycle control of neural progenitors, which underlies precise corticogenesis. First, we show brain development is sensitive to <i>Ddx3x</i> dosage; complete <i>Ddx3x</i> loss from neural progenitors causes microcephaly in females, whereas hemizygous males and heterozygous females show reduced neurogenesis without marked microcephaly. In addition, <i>Ddx3x</i> loss is sexually dimorphic, as its paralog, <i>Ddx3y</i>, compensates for <i>Ddx3x</i> in the developing male neocortex. Using live imaging of progenitors, we show that DDX3X promotes neuronal generation by regulating both cell cycle duration and neurogenic divisions. Finally, we use ribosome profiling <i>in vivo</i> to discover the repertoire of translated transcripts in neural progenitors, including those which are DDX3X-dependent and essential for neurogenesis. Our study reveals invaluable new insights into the etiology of <i>DDX3X</i> syndrome, implicating dysregulated progenitor cell cycle dynamics and translation as pathogenic mechanisms.

                Mutations in LRRK2 are the most common genetic cause of Parkinson's disease. Despite substantial research efforts, the physiological and pathological role of this multidomain protein remains poorly defined. In this study, we used a systematic approach to construct the general protein-protein interactome around LRRK2, which was then differentiated into 15 tissue-specific interactomes taking into consideration the differential expression patterns and the co-expression behaviours of the LRRK2 interactors in different healthy tissues. The LRRK2 interactors exhibited distinct expression features in the brain as compared to the peripheral tissues analysed. Moreover, a high degree of similarity was found for the LRRK2 interactors in putamen, caudate and nucleus accumbens, thus defining a potential LRRK2 functional cluster within the striatum. We also explored the functions highlighted by the "core LRRK2 interactors" within each tissue and illustrated how the LRRK2 interactomes can be used as a tool to trace the relationship between LRRK2 and specific interactors of interest, here exemplified with a study focused on the LRRK2 interactors belonging to the Rab protein family.

                We propose that in order to harness our understanding of neuroscience toward machine learning, we must first have powerful tools for training brain-like models of learning. Although substantial progress has been made toward understanding the dynamics of learning in the brain, neuroscience-derived models of learning have yet to demonstrate the same performance capabilities as methods in deep learning such as gradient descent. Inspired by the successes of machine learning using gradient descent, we demonstrate that models of neuromodulated synaptic plasticity from neuroscience can be trained in Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) with a framework of learning to learn through gradient descent to address challenging online learning problems. This framework opens a new path toward developing neuroscience inspired online learning algorithms.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Reinstatement of emotional associations during human sleep: an intracranial EEG study</a></h4>

              
                The scientific literature suggests that emotional memories benefit from a privileged consolidation over neutral memories. This effect extends to consolidation processes that occur during sleep. Indeed, during sleep, a complex set of oscillations (namely slow-oscillations, theta rhythm and spindles) mediates the communication between brain regions involved in the long-term integration of memories. However, whether sleep oscillations may contribute to the reactivation and consolidation of emotional memories in humans is still unclear. Because non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG) has limited access to deep brain regions implicated in memory and emotion (e.g., hippocampus, amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex), here we recorded EEG signal from these brain regions using intracranial electrodes placed in medically-resistant epileptic patients in the context of presurgical investigation. During wakefulness, we presented the patients with emotional (i.e., humorous) vs emotionally neutral pictures paired with a sound. Then, we tested for the reinstatement of emotional-associations by delivering the sound during a subsequent period of sleep. We found that the reactivation of emotional (compared to neutral) memories during sleep enhanced slow-oscillation and spindle activity in the orbitofrontal cortex, paralleled with an increase in theta connectivity between the hippocampus and the orbitofrontal cortex. In addition, we observed that the theta response to emotional memories reactivated at subsequent wake was different than for neutral memories, suggesting a change in memory traces with targeted memory reactivation. These data suggest that consolidation of emotional events during sleep is due to a larger expression of sleep features (in the slow-oscillation, theta and sigma frequency bands) and that the mechanisms of brain plasticity also take place in emotional brain regions during NREM sleep.

                Cognitive neuroscience posits that humans perform physical inferences using mental simulations. Here, we test this hypothesis by analyzing neural activity in the monkeys' frontal cortex in a ball interception task. We find a low-dimensional neural embedding of the ball position that tracks the ball both when it is visible and invisible. This embedding may serve as a neural substrate for mental simulation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A novel preparation of the entire isolated CNS unveils the modulatory influences of supra-pontine structures on brainstem and spinal networks.</a></h4>

              
                Several spinal motor output and essential rhythmic behaviors are controlled by supraspinal structures. Although of great advantage in deciphering their functional organization, existing preparations of the isolated brainstem and spinal networks only focus on local circuitry. The goal of our study has been to better characterize the contribution of higher centers to the neuronal networks involved in respiration and locomotion. Thus, a novel in vitro preparation from the isolated CNS of neonatal rodents was introduced to simultaneously record a stable respiratory rhythm from both cervical and lumbar ventral roots (VRs). Selective electrical pulses supplied to the pons and medulla evoked distinct VR responses in rostrocaudal direction with a staggered onset, while stimulation of ventrolateral medulla resulted in higher events from homolateral VRs. Moreover, electrical stimulation of a lumbar dorsal root (DR) elicited responses even from cervical VRs, albeit small and delayed, confirming functional ascending pathways. Furthermore, prototypical fictive locomotion was induced by trains of pulses applied to either the ventrolateral medulla or a DR. By progressively removing higher centers, duration of respiratory burst was reduced after a precollicular decerebration, which also affected the area of lumbar DR and VR potentials elicited by DR stimulation while frequency of respiration increased after a following pontobulbar transection. Keeping legs attached to the CNS allows for expressing the respiratory rhythm during peripheral stimulation of limbs. The study demonstrates that supra-pontine centers regulate the spontaneous respiratory rhythm, as well as electrically-evoked reflexes and spinal network activity. Thus, the current approach contributes to clarifying the modulatory influence of the brain on the brainstem and spinal micro-circuits.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Measuring motion-to-photon latency for sensorimotor experiments with virtual reality systems</a></h4>

              
                Consumer virtual reality (VR) systems are increasingly being deployed in research to study sensorimotor behaviours, but properties of such systems require verification before being used as scientific tools. The 'motion-to-photon' latency (the lag between a user making a movement and the movement being displayed within the display) is a particularly important metric as temporal delays can degrade sensorimotor performance. Extant approaches to quantifying this measure have involved the use of bespoke software and hardware and produce a single measure of latency and ignore the effect of the motion prediction algorithms used in modern VR systems. This reduces confidence in the generalisability of the results. We developed a novel, system-independent, high-speed camera-based latency measurement technique to co-register real and virtual controller movements, allowing assessment of how latencies change through a movement. We applied this technique to measure the motion-to-photon latency of controller movements in the HTC Vive, Oculus Rift, Oculus Rift S, and Valve Index, using the Unity game engine and SteamVR. For the start of a sudden movement, all measured headsets had mean latencies between 21-42ms. Once motion prediction could account for the inherent delays, the latency was functionally reduced to 2-13ms, and our technique revealed this reduction occurs within ~25-58ms of movement onset. Our findings indicate that sudden accelerations (e.g. movement onset, impacts and direction changes) will increase latencies and lower spatial accuracy. Our technique allows researchers to measure these factors and determine the impact on their experimental design before collecting sensorimotor data from VR systems.

                Our understanding of the surrounding world and communication with other people are tied to mental representations of concepts. In order for the brain to recognize an object, it must determine which concept to access based on information available from sensory inputs. In this study, we combine magnetoencephalography and machine learning to investigate how concepts are represented and accessed in the brain over time. Using brain responses from a silent picture naming task, we track the dynamics of semantic processing, and show that the brain gradually accumulates semantic information before eventually reaching a plateau. The timing of this plateau point varies across individuals, indicating differences in the temporal domain of semantic processing, a new dimension of individual variability in the faculty of language.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Control Limited Perceptual Decision Making</a></h4>

              
                Bounded temporal accumulation of evidence is a canonical computation for perceptual decision making (PDM). Previously derived optimal strategies for PDM, however, ignore the fact that focusing on the task of accumulating evidence in time requires cognitive control, which is costly. Here, we derive a theoretical framework for studying how to optimally trade-off performance and control costs in PDM. We describe agents seeking to maximize reward rate in a two-alternative forced choice task, but endowed with default, stimulus-independent response policies which lead to errors and which also bias how speed and accuracy are traded off by the agent. Limitations in the agent's ability to control these default tendencies lead to optimal policies that rely on 'soft' probabilistic decision bounds with characteristic observable behavioral consequences. We show that the axis of control provides an organizing principle for how different task manipulations shape the phenomenology of PDM, including the nature and consequence of decision lapses and sequential dependencies. Our findings provide a path to the study of normative decision strategies in real biological agents.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Ancient midbrain inhibitory neurons control selective spatial attention</a></h4>

              
                The neural circuit mechanisms for the control of selective visuospatial attention remain elusive. Here, in mice, we demonstrate that a relatively unknown, but evolutionarily conserved group of parvalbumin-positive inhibitory neurons in the mammalian midbrain, called the pLTN (periparabigeminal lateral tegmental nucleus), controls target selection and distractor suppression for spatial attention. Selectively inactivating pLTN in mice performing a human-like visuospatial attention task (flanker task) makes mice hyper-distractible, impairing accuracy (and perceptual sensitivity) of the target amidst distractors. It also impairs the reliability (categorical nature) of target selection. These deficits occur without affecting perceptual sensitivity to the target presented singly, motor plan selection, or task-related orienting behaviors. The behavioral results are consistent with pLTN's action on the midbrain sensorimotor hub, the superior colliculus. We thus establish pLTN as a dedicated midbrain seat for the control of selective spatial attention.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Constraints of vigilance-dependent noradrenergic signaling to mouse cerebellar Bergmann glia</a></h4>

              
                Behavioral state plays an important role in determining astroglia Ca2+ signaling. In particular, locomotion-mediated elevated vigilance has been found to trigger norepinephrine-dependent whole cell Ca2+ elevations in astroglia throughout the brain. For cerebellar Bergmann glia it has recently been found that locomotion-induced transient Ca2+ elevations depend on their 1A-adrenergic receptors. With increasing availability and implementation of locomotion as behavioral parameter it becomes important to understand the constraints of noradrenergic signaling to astroglia. Here we evaluated the effect of speed, duration and interval of locomotion on Ca2+ signals in Bergmann glia as well as cerebellar noradrenergic axon terminals. We found almost no dependence on locomotion speed, but following the initial Ca2+ transient prolonged locomotion events revealed a steady-state Ca2+ elevation. Comparison of time course and recovery of transient Bergmann glia and noradrenergic terminal Ca2+ dynamics suggested that noradrenergic terminal Ca2+ activity determines Bergmann glia Ca2+ activation and does not require noradrenergic receptor desensitization to account for attenuation during prolonged locomotion. Further, analyzing the correlation among Ca2+ dynamics within regions within the field of observation we found that coordinated activity among noradrenergic terminals accounts for fluctuations of steady-state Bergmann glia Ca2+ activity. Together, our findings will help to better understand astroglia Ca2+ dynamics during less controlled awake behavior and may guide the identification of behavioral contexts preferably dependent on astroglia Ca2+ signaling.

                The periaqueductal gray (PAG) is a critical midbrain hub that relays information from the forebrain to motor and autonomic brainstem centers to orchestrate instinctive behaviors. The current organization of the PAG into four main radial columns lacks the resolution needed to account for the vast range of PAG functions. Using spatially resolved single-cell transcriptomic measurements, we uncovered widespread transcriptional heterogeneity in the PAG with >100 excitatory and inhibitory neuronal populations, which further assemble into 19 spatial metaclusters. We explored the transcriptional and spatial logic of PAG function during instinctive behaviors and demonstrated the regional recruitment of cell types for distinct behaviors. Unexpectedly, certain behaviors trigger differential spatial activation patterns within given cell types, illustrating the complexity of PAG molecular and functional 3D organization. The newly uncovered spatial motifs and high precision cellular map of instinctive behavior in the PAG open new avenues for a mechanistic understanding of PAG function.

                Neural entrainment to continuous speech is typically observed within the language network and can be modulated by both low-level acoustic features and high-level meaningful linguistic units (e.g., phonemes, phrases, and sentences). Recent evidence showed that visual cortex may entrain to speech envelope, however its putative role in the hierarchy of speech processing remains unknown. We tested blindfolded participants who listened to semantically meaningful or meaningless stories, either in quiet or embedded in multi-talker babble noise. Entrainment to speech was assessed with forward linear modeling of participants' EEG activity. We investigated (1) low-level acoustic effects by contrasting neural tracking of speech presented in quiet or noise and (2) high-level linguistic effects by contrasting neural tracking to meaningful or meaningless stories. Results showed that envelope tracking was enhanced and delayed for speech embedded in noise compared to quiet. When semantic information was missing, entrainment to speech envelope was fastened and reduced. Source modeling revealed that envelope tracking engaged wide neural networks beyond the auditory cortex, including early visual cortex. Surprisingly, while no clear influence of semantic content was found, the magnitude of visual cortex entrainment was affected by low-level features. The decrease of sound SNR-level dampened visual cortex tracking, suggesting an active suppressing mechanism in challenging listening conditions. Altogether, these findings provide further evidence of a functional role of early visual cortex in the entrainment to continuous speech.

                Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a heterogenous, early-onset neurodevelopmental disorder with multifactorial aetiology. There are hundreds of genes that contribute to ASD. Additionally, several environmental factors, such as neurotoxic compounds, endocrine modulators, and neuropsychiatric medications, have been associated with ASD outcomes. We investigated a highly efficient and multiplexable, fractional factorial experimental design to study multiple environmental factors and human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines in the context of ASD. RNA expression analysis revealed significant upregulation of pathways related to synaptic function and lipid metabolism, following exposure to lead and fluoxetine, respectively. We validated our findings using mass spectrometry-based metabolomics after fluoxetine exposure. The study demonstrates that the fractional factorial experiment design can be used for multiplexed transcriptomic analyses to detect relevant changes at the pathway level. Our study provides a roadmap for understanding the impact of low-grade environmental exposures on human neurodevelopment. Expansive future studies will require multiple cell lines with different genetic backgrounds for characterising environmental exposures in ASD and other neurodevelopmental disorders.

	<p>Background: Comprehensive geriatric care (CGC) is a multidisciplinary approach developed to meet the needs of older patients. Electroencephalography (EEG) provides valuable information for monitoring the cerebral function. As a surrogate, EEG findings may help to estimate the course of diseases as well as the treatment outcomes. Objectives: Therefore, the aim of the present study is to investigate EEG findings in older patients receiving CGC. Methods: Patients with an initial EEG in a geriatric unit between May 2019 and April 2020 and treated using the CGC approach were analyzed. EEG abnormalities were defined as generalized (diffuse) background slowing and/or intermittent/persistent focal slowing and/or epileptiform discharges. Assessment results for the Barthel index (BI), Tinetti Balance and Gait test (TBGT), and Timed Up and Go test (TUG) were analyzed in relation to the presence of EEG abnormalities. Results: The study included 398 patients (mean age: 83.0 &amp;amp;plusmn; 6.57 years, 69.3% were female). Abnormal EEG patterns were found in 94 (23.6%) patients. Patients with EEG abnormalities had a mean age of 83.4 years versus a mean of 82.8 years in those without (p = 0.451). Based on all calculated scores, the majority of the patients improved after CGC, with a tendency to higher-grade improvements in those without EEG abnormalities (BI: 86.2% vs. 75.5%, p = 0.024; TUG: 53.3% vs. 31.9%, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001); for TBGT, only a gradual difference was detected (TBGT prior CGC: 79.9% vs. TBGT after CGC: 71.3%, p = 0.088). The presence of EEG abnormalities was associated with the parameters dementia (36.2% vs. 22.4%, p = 0.010), known epilepsy/seizure (19.1% vs. 5.9%, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), structural brain lesion (47.9% vs. 19.7%, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), and delirium (9.6% vs. 3.6%, p = 0.030) during hospitalization. Conclusions: We found EEG abnormalities in almost a quarter of the patients treated in the geriatric unit. In older patients, the presence of EEG abnormalities is associated with lower improvements after CGC.</p>

	<p>To evaluate the potential effect of radiofrequency ablation and deep brain stimulation in patients with treatment-refractory Tourette syndrome (TS), this study enrolled thirteen patients with TS who were admitted to our hospital between August 2002 and September 2018. Four patients received a single- or multi-target radiofrequency ablation after local, potentiated, or general anesthesia; eight patients underwent deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery; and one patient underwent both ablation and DBS surgery. The severity of tics and obsessive compulsive disorder symptoms and the quality of life were evaluated using the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS), Yale&amp;amp;ndash;Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (YBOCS), and Gilles de la Tourette Syndrome Quality of Life scale (GTS-QOL), respectively, before surgery, one month after surgery, and at the final follow-up after surgery, which was conducted in December 2018. A paired-sample t test and a multiple linear regression analysis were performed to analyze the data. All patients underwent the operation successfully without any severe complications. Overall, the YGTSS total scores at one month post-surgery (44.1 &amp;amp;plusmn; 22.3) and at the final visit (35.1 &amp;amp;plusmn; 23.7) were significantly decreased compared with those at baseline (75.1 &amp;amp;plusmn; 6.2; both p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). Additionally, the YBOCS scores at one month post-surgery (16.5 &amp;amp;plusmn; 10.1) and at the final visit (12.0 &amp;amp;plusmn; 9.5) were significantly decreased compared with those at baseline (22.5 &amp;amp;plusmn; 13.1; both p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). Furthermore, the GTS-QOL scores at one month post-surgery (44.0 &amp;amp;plusmn; 12.8) and at the final visit (31.0 &amp;amp;plusmn; 17.8) were significantly decreased compared with those at baseline (58.4 &amp;amp;plusmn; 14.2; both p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). Results from a multiple linear regression analysis revealed that the improvement in the YGTSS total score was independently associated with the improvement in the GTS-QOL score at one month post-surgery (standardized &amp;amp;beta; = 0.716, p = 0.023) and at the final visit (standardized &amp;amp;beta; = 1.064, p = 0.000). Conversely, changes in YBOCS scores did not correlate with changes in GTS-QOL scores (p &amp;amp;gt; 0.05). Our results demonstrate that tics, psychiatric symptoms, and the quality of life in patients with intractable TS may be relieved by stereotactic ablation surgery and deep brain stimulation. Furthermore, it appears that the improvement in tics contributes more to the post-operative quality of life of patients than does the improvement in obsessive compulsive symptoms.</p>

	<p>The integrated gradients (IG) method is widely used to evaluate the extent to which each input feature contributes to the classification using a deep learning model because it theoretically satisfies the desired properties to fairly attribute the contributions to the classification. However, this approach requires an appropriate baseline to do so. In this study, we propose a compensated IG method that does not require a baseline, which compensates the contributions calculated using the IG method at an arbitrary baseline by using an example of the Shapley sampling value. We prove that the proposed approach can compute the contributions to the classification results reliably if the processes of each input feature in a classifier are independent of one another and the parameterization of each process is identical, as in shared weights in convolutional neural networks. Using three datasets on electroencephalogram recordings, we experimentally demonstrate that the contributions obtained by the proposed compensated IG method are more reliable than those obtained using the original IG method and that its computational complexity is much lower than that of the Shapley sampling method.</p>

	<p>The increasing prevalence of obesity and eating disorders makes identifying neural substrates controlling eating and regulating body weight a priority. Recent studies have highlighted the role of the lateral septum (LS) in eating control mechanisms. The current study explored the roles of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors within the LS in the control of food intake. Experiments with a rat model (n &amp;amp;ge; 11/group) showed that LS microinjection of the GABAA receptor agonist, muscimol, and the GABAB receptor agonist, baclofen hydrochloride (baclofen), elicited intense, dose-dependent feeding. In contrast, LS pretreatment with the GABAA receptor antagonist, picrotoxin, markedly reduced the muscimol-elicited feeding, and pretreatment injections with the GABAB receptor antagonist, 2-hydroxysaclofen (2-OH saclofen), reduced the baclofen evoked response. Next, we showed that picrotoxin injection at the beginning of the dark phase of the light-dark cycle&amp;amp;mdash;when rats show a burst of spontaneous eating&amp;amp;mdash;reduced naturally occurring feeding, whereas 2-OH saclofen was ineffective. These results indicate that the activation of LS GABAA and GABAB receptors strongly stimulates feeding and suggests potential roles in feeding control neurocircuitry. In particular, our evidence indicates that endogenous LS GABA and GABAA receptors may be involved in mediating naturally occurring nocturnal feeding.</p>

	<p>Background: Early diagnosis of cerebral palsy (CP) in high-risk infants is possible at 3&amp;amp;ndash;4 months&amp;amp;rsquo; corrected age (CA) using standardised assessments. Aim: To assess the utility of neonatal screening assessments&amp;amp;mdash;writhing general movements (GMs) and the Hammersmith Neonatal Neurological Examination (HNNE)&amp;amp;mdash;to predict CP/high-risk status at 3&amp;amp;ndash;4 months&amp;amp;rsquo; CA in extremely preterm infants. Methods: Retrospective cohort study of high-risk preterm infants (born &amp;amp;lt; 29 weeks&amp;amp;rsquo; gestation and/or birth weight &amp;amp;lt; 1000 g) attending an Early Neurodevelopment Clinic. Data from neonatal assessments were compared with CP/high-risk diagnosis at 3&amp;amp;ndash;4 months&amp;amp;rsquo; CA, fidgety GMs, and Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examinations (HINE) using logistic regression, linear regression, and Spearman rank correlation. Results: Two hundred and two preterm infants (median gestation age at birth 27.3 (IQR 25.4&amp;amp;ndash;28.3) weeks, mean birth weight 870.3 (SD 248.4) grams) were included. A total of 26 (12.8%) infants received early CP/high-risk diagnoses at 3&amp;amp;ndash;4 months&amp;amp;rsquo; CA. A lower gestational age (GA) (OR = 0.78; p = 0.029, 95% CI [0.26, 0.97]) and abnormal writhing GMs (OR 1.56; p = 0.019, 95% CI [1.07, 2.27]) were predictive of CP/high-risk diagnosis. Although after adjustment for sex, GA, birth weight, and growth restriction, GA (aOR = 0.67; p = 0.068, 95% CI [0.44, 1.03]) and writhing GMs (aOR = 1.44; p = 0.087, 95% CI [0.95, 2.20]) were not significant, a strong trend still persisted. The HNNE scores significantly correlated with both the HINE evaluation (rs = 0.43, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001, 95% CI [0.31, 0.56]) and fidgety GMs (rs = &amp;amp;minus;0.10, p = 0.012, 95% CI [&amp;amp;minus;0.32, &amp;amp;minus;0.04]). Linear regression confirmed the HNNE was highly predictive of the HINE (correlation coefficient 0.82; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001, 95% CI [0.48, 1.15]). Writhing GMs did not significantly correlate with either fidgety GMs (p = 0.723, 95% CI [&amp;amp;minus;0.12, 0.17]) or the HINE (p = 0.173, 95% CI [&amp;amp;minus;0.24, 0.04]). Conclusions: Abnormal writhing GMs in the neonatal period were non-significantly associated with early CP/high-risk diagnoses in extremely preterm infants in a multivariate analysis. Additionally, the HNNE significantly correlated with both fidgety GMs and the HINE.</p>

	<p>Curiosity benefits memory for target information and may also benefit memory for incidental information presented during curiosity states. However, it is not known whether incidental curiosity-enhanced memory depends on or is affected by the valence of the incidental information during curiosity states. Here, older and younger participants incidentally encoded unrelated face images (positive, negative, and neutral) while they anticipated answers to trivia questions. We found memory enhancements for answers to trivia questions and unrelated faces presented during high-curiosity compared with low-curiosity states in both younger and older adults. Interestingly, face valence did not modify memory for unrelated faces. This suggests processes associated with the elicitation of curiosity enhance memory for incidental information instead of valence.</p>

	<p>Background: Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease is a common neurodegenerative disease, with depression being a common non-motor symptom. Bilateral subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation is an effective method for the treatment of Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease. Thus, this study aimed to establish a nomogram of the possibility of achieving a better depression improvement rate after subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation in patients with Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 103 patients with Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease who underwent subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation and were followed up for the improvement of their Hamilton Depression scale scores 1 year postoperatively. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to select factors affecting the improvement rate of depression. A nomogram was then developed to predict the possibility of achieving better depression improvement. Furthermore, the discrimination and fitting performance was evaluated using a calibration diagram, receiver operating characteristics, and decision curve analysis. Results: The mean and median improvement rates of Hamilton Depression scores were 13.1 and 33.3%, respectively. Among the 103 patients, 70.8% had an improved depression, 23.3% had a worsened depression, and 5.8% remained unchanged. Logistic multivariate regression analysis showed that age, preoperative Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s Disease Questionnaire, Hamilton Anxiety, and Hamilton Depression scores were independent factors for the possibility of achieving a better depression improvement rate. Based on these results, a nomogram model was developed. The nomogram had a C-index of 0.78 (95% confidence interval: 0.69&amp;amp;ndash;0.87) and an area under the receiver operating characteristics of 0.78 (95% confidence interval: 0.69&amp;amp;ndash;0.87). The calibration plot and decision curve analysis further demonstrated goodness-of-fit between the nomogram predictions and actual observations. Conclusion: We developed a nomogram to predict the possibility of achieving good depression improvement 1 year after subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation in patients with Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease, which showed a certain value in judging the expected depression improvement of these patients.</p>

	<p>Cortical stimulation patterns in patients with Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) are asymmetric and get altered over time. This study examined cortical neurophysiological markers for PD and identified neurophysiological markers for lateralization in PD. We used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to study corticospinal and intracortical excitability in 21 patients with idiopathic PD. We used the Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s Disease Rating Scale for examination during on and off periods and evaluated inhibitory and facilitatory process markers using TMS, including resting motor thresholds (RMT), active motor thresholds, and motor evoked potential amplitude. The RMT in the more affected cortex was significantly shorter than in the less affected cortex, and was strongly correlated with improved motor function following medication. Patients in the tremor group exhibited significantly lower RMT compared to those in the akinetic-rigid group. Cortical electrophysiological laterality observed in patients with PD may be a useful marker for guiding treatment and identifying underlying compensatory mechanisms.</p>

	<p>Migraine is a chronic headache disease, which ranks second in years lost due to disability. However, the mechanism of migraines is still not clear. In migraine patients, fasting can trigger headache attacks. We explored the probable mechanism of why fasting can induce headaches. Nitroglycerin (NTG) was used to induce acute migraine attacks in mice. Primary astrocytes were used to study the pathophysiological mechanism and a Seahorse analyzer was used to detect mitochondrial function. NTG induced more serious headaches in the fasting group. Both the head-scratching times and climbing-cage times in the fasting group were higher than those in normal-diet group. More ROS and inflammatory factors, such as IL-6 and IL-1&amp;amp;beta;, were induced in low-glucose conditions. Seahorse showed that the basal oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and OCR for ATP production were lower in mice who had received NTG with low glucose levels than in other groups. The activity of AMPK was inhibited in this group, which may explain the Seahorse results. We concluded that in the low-glucose state, astrocytes produce more inflammatory factors, ROS, which may be a result of mitochondrial metabolism dysfunction. Improving mitochondrial function and supplying enough substrates may be an option for relieving migraine attacks.</p>

	<p>Memory encoding and retrieval deficits have been identified in atypical Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD), including posterior cortical atrophy (PCA) and logopenic variant primary progressive aphasia (lvPPA), despite these groups being referred to as &amp;amp;ldquo;non-amnestic&amp;amp;rdquo;. There is a critical need to better understand recognition memory in atypical AD. We investigated performance on the California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT-II-SF) in 23 amyloid-positive, tau-positive, and neurodegeneration-positive participants with atypical &amp;amp;ldquo;non-amnestic&amp;amp;rdquo; variants of AD (14 PCA, 9 lvPPA) and 14 amnestic AD participants. Recognition memory performance was poor across AD subgroups but trended toward worse in the amnestic group. Encoding was related to recognition memory in non-amnestic but not in amnestic AD. We also observed cortical atrophy in dissociable subregions of the distributed memory network related to encoding (left middle temporal and angular gyri, posterior cingulate and precuneus) compared to recognition memory (anterior medial temporal cortex). We conclude that recognition memory is not spared in all patients with atypical variants of AD traditionally thought to be &amp;amp;ldquo;non-amnestic&amp;amp;rdquo;. The non-amnestic AD patients with poor recognition memory were those who struggled to encode the material during the learning trials. In contrast, the amnestic AD group had poor recognition memory regardless of encoding ability.</p>

	<p>Listeners entertain hypotheses about how social characteristics affect a speaker&amp;amp;rsquo;s pronunciation. While some of these hypotheses may be representative of a demographic, thus facilitating spoken language processing, others may be erroneous stereotypes that impede comprehension. As a case in point, listeners&amp;amp;rsquo; stereotypes of language and ethnicity pairings in varieties of North American English can improve intelligibility and comprehension, or hinder these processes. Using audio-visual speech this study examines how listeners adapt to speech in noise from four speakers who are representative of selected accent-ethnicity associations in the local speech community: an Asian English-L1 speaker, a white English-L1 speaker, an Asian English-L2 speaker, and a white English-L2 speaker. The results suggest congruent accent-ethnicity associations facilitate adaptation, and that the mainstream local accent is associated with a more diverse speech community.</p>

	<p>The diagnosis of neurobehavioral problems in very preterm neonates helps with planning and applying proper and direct therapeutic interventions. (1) Background: The aim of this study was to determine the direct impact of neurobehavior on the sucking reflex and eating abilities of neonates. (2) Methods: We assessed 18 preterm neonates twice hospitalized at the Gynecology and Obstetrics Clinical Hospital through the use of the Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale (NBAS). (3) Results: We found that that a neonate&amp;amp;rsquo;s sucking ability positively correlated with the activity level item from the motor system cluster of the NBAS. (4) Conclusions: Neurobehavior should be closely assessed in very preterm neonates. Firstly, because assessments can detect fundamental problems and help a practitioner plan for early intervention. Secondly, the education of parents regarding the neurobehavior of their child can help in the facilitation of feeding skills and the planning of early rehabilitation.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Postnatal Development of Projections of the Postrhinal Cortex to the Entorhinal Cortex in the Rat</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The ability to encode and retrieve contextual information is an inherent feature of episodic memory that starts to develop during childhood. The postrhinal cortex (POR), an area of the parahippocampal region (PHR), has a crucial role in encoding object-space information and translating egocentric to allocentric representation of local space. The strong connectivity of POR with the adjacent entorhinal cortex (EC), and consequently the hippocampus, suggests that the development of these connections could support the postnatal development of contextual memory. Here, we report that POR projections of the rat develop progressively from the first to the third postnatal week starting in the medial EC (MEC) before spreading to the lateral EC (LEC). The increased spread and complexity of postrhinal axonal distributions is accompanied by an increased complexity of entorhinal dendritic trees and an increase of postrhinal-entorhinal synapses, which supports a gradual maturation in functional activity.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Inherited retinal degenerative diseases are a prominent cause of blindness. Although mutations causing death of photoreceptors are mostly known, the pathophysiology downstream in the inner retina and along the visual pathway is incompletely characterized in the earliest disease stages. Here, we investigated retinal, midbrain and cortical visual function using electroretinography (ERG), the optomotor response (OMR), visual evoked potentials (VEPs), respectively, and single unit electrophysiology at the primary visual cortex (V1) in light-adapted juvenile (approximately one-month-old) and young adult (three-month-old) <I>Rho</I><sup>P23H/WT</sup> mice, representative of early-stage retinitis pigmentosa (RP). Photopic ERG revealed up to ~30% hypersensitivity to light in <I>Rho</I><sup>P23H/WT</sup> mice, as measured by the light intensity required to generate half-maximal b-wave (I<SUB>50</SUB> parameter). <I>Rho</I><sup>P23H/WT</sup> mice also showed increased OMRs toward low spatial frequency (SF) drifting gratings, indicative of visual overexcitation at the midbrain level. At the V1 level, VEPs and single-cell recordings revealed prominent hyperexcitability in the juvenile <I>Rho</I><sup>P23H/WT</sup> mice. Mean VEP amplitudes for light ON stimuli were nearly doubled in one-month-old <I>Rho</I><sup>P23H/WT</sup> mice compared with controls, and more than doubled for light OFF. Single-cell recordings showed a significantly increased spontaneous V1 neuron firing in the <I>Rho</I><sup>P23H/WT</sup> mice, and persistent contrast and temporal sensitivities. In contrast, direction selectivity was severely compromised. Our data suggest that during early RP, the visual pathway becomes hyperexcited. This could have both compensatory and deleterious consequences for visual behavior. Further studies on the mechanisms of hyperexcitability are warranted as this could lead to therapeutic interventions for RP.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Impairments in Fear Extinction Memory and Basolateral Amygdala Plasticity in the TgF344-AD Rat Model of Alzheimers Disease Are Distinct from Nonpathological Aging</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Fear-based disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) steepen age-related cognitive decline and double the risk for developing Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease (AD). Because of the seemingly hyperactive properties of fear memories, PTSD symptoms can worsen with age. Perturbations in the synaptic circuitry supporting fear memory extinction are key neural substrates of PTSD. The basolateral amygdala (BLA) is a medial temporal lobe structure that is critical in the encoding, consolidation, and retrieval of fear memories. As little is known about fear extinction memory and BLA synaptic dysfunction within the context of aging and AD, the goal of this study was to investigate how fear extinction memory deficits and basal amygdaloid nucleus (BA) synaptic dysfunction differentially associate in nonpathologic aging and AD in the TgF344AD (TgAD) rat model of AD. Young, middle-aged, and older-aged WT and TgAD rats were trained on a delay fear conditioning and extinction procedure before <I>ex vivo</I> extracellular field potential recording experiments in the BA. Relative to young WT rats, long-term extinction memory was impaired, and in general, was associated with a hyperexcitable BA and impaired LTP in TgAD rats at all ages. In contrast, long-term extinction memory was impaired in aged WT rats and was associated with impaired LTP but not BA hyperexcitability. Interestingly, the middle-aged TgAD rats showed intact short-term extinction and BA LTP, which is suggestive of a compensatory mechanism, whereas differential neural recruitment in older-aged WT rats may have facilitated short-term extinction. As such, associations between fear extinction memory and amygdala deficits in nonpathologic aging and AD are dissociable.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">MEG Activity in Visual and Auditory Cortices Represents Acoustic Speech-Related Information during Silent Lip Reading</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Speech is an intrinsically multisensory signal, and seeing the speaker&rsquo;s lips forms a cornerstone of communication in acoustically impoverished environments. Still, it remains unclear how the brain exploits visual speech for comprehension. Previous work debated whether lip signals are mainly processed along the auditory pathways or whether the visual system directly implements speech-related processes. To probe this, we systematically characterized dynamic representations of multiple acoustic and visual speech-derived features in source localized MEG recordings that were obtained while participants listened to speech or viewed silent speech. Using a mutual-information framework we provide a comprehensive assessment of how well temporal and occipital cortices reflect the physically presented signals and unique aspects of acoustic features that were physically absent but may be critical for comprehension. Our results demonstrate that both cortices feature a functionally specific form of multisensory restoration: during lip reading, they reflect unheard acoustic features, independent of co-existing representations of the visible lip movements. This restoration emphasizes the unheard pitch signature in occipital cortex and the speech envelope in temporal cortex and is predictive of lip-reading performance. These findings suggest that when seeing the speaker&rsquo;s lips, the brain engages both visual and auditory pathways to support comprehension by exploiting multisensory correspondences between lip movements and spectro-temporal acoustic cues.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Ovarian Hormones Regulate Nicotine Consumption and Accumbens Glutamatergic Plasticity in Female Rats</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Women report greater cigarette cravings during the menstrual cycle phase with higher circulating levels of 17&beta;-estradiol (E2), which is metabolized to estrone (E1). Both E2 and E1 bind to estrogen receptors (ERs), which have been highly studied in the breast, uterus, and ovary. Recent studies have found that ERs are also located on GABAergic medium spiny neurons (MSNs) within the nucleus accumbens core (NAcore). Glutamatergic plasticity in NAcore MSNs is altered following nicotine use; however, it is unknown whether estrogens impact this neurobiological consequence. To test the effect of estrogen on nicotine use, we ovariectomized (OVX) female rats that then underwent nicotine self-administration acquisition and compared them to ovary-intact (sham) rats. The OVX animals then received either sesame oil (vehicle), E2, or E1+E2 supplementation for 4 or 20 d before nicotine sessions. While both ovary-intact and OVX females readily discriminated levers, OVX females consumed less nicotine than sham females. Further, neither E2 nor E1+E2 increased nicotine consumption back to sham levels following OVX, regardless of the duration of the treatment. OVX also rendered NAcore MSNs in a potentiated state following nicotine self-administration, which was reversed by 4 d of systemic E2 treatment. Finally, we found that E2 and E1+E2 increased ER&alpha; mRNA in the NAcore, but nicotine suppressed this regardless of hormone treatment. Together, these results show that estrogens regulate nicotine neurobiology, but additional factors may be required to restore nicotine consumption to ovary-intact levels.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Atypical odontalgia and trigeminal neuralgia: psychological, behavioral and psychopharmacological approach in a dental clinic – an overview of pathologies related to the challenging differential diagnosis in orofacial pain [version 3; peer review: 1 appro</a></h4>

              
                Orofacial pain represents a challenge for dentists, especially if it does not have an odontogenic origin. Orofacial neuropathic pain may be chronic, is arduous to localize and may develop without obvious pathology. Comorbid psychiatric disorders, such as anxiety and depression, coexist and negatively affect this condition. This article presents one case of atypical odontalgia and one of trigeminal neuralgia treated with psychological and psychopharmacological tailored and adapted therapies, after conventional medications had failed. Additionally, an overview of the pathologies related to the challenging differential diagnosis in orofacial pain is given.  A 68-year-old man complained of chronic throbbing and burning pain in a maxillary tooth, which worsened upon digital pressure. Symptoms did not abate after amitriptyline therapy; psychological intervention along with antianxiety drug were supplemented and antidepressant agent dosage were incremented. The patient reported improvement and satisfaction with the multidisciplinary approach to his pathology. A 72-year-old man complained of chronic stabbing, intermittent, sharp, shooting and electric shock-like pain in an upper tooth, radiating and following the distribution of the trigeminal nerve. Pain did not recur after psychological intervention and a prescription of antidepressant and antianxiety agents, while carbamazepine therapy had not been sufficient to control pain. Due to concerns with comorbid psychiatric disorders, we adopted a patient-centered, tailored and balanced therapy, favorably changing clinical outcomes. Comorbid psychiatric disorders have a negative impact on orofacial pain, and dentists should consider adopting tailored therapies, such as psychological counselling and behavioral and psychopharmacologic strategies, besides conventional treatments. They also must be familiar with the signs and symptoms of orofacial pain, obtaining a comprehensive view of the pathologies concerning the differential diagnosis. A prompt diagnosis may prevent pain chronicity, avoiding an increase in complexity and a shift to orofacial neuropathic pain and legal claims.

The use of an intensive care unit (ICU) diary for these patients could help fill in memory gaps and complete their fragmented illness narrative. Objectives: The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of an ICU diary on the occurrence of impaired mental health in patients admitted with a SARS-CoV-2 infection and their relatives. Methods: An observational cohort study of SARS-CoV-2 patients treated in the ICU of Elizabeth-Tweesteden Hospital (ETZ) in Tilburg, The Netherlands will be conducted. Adult patients admitted at the ICU because of respiratory insufficiency due to SARS-CoV-2, who are mechanically ventilated, are included. During treatment in the ICU a diary is kept of the patient. Anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, cognitive dysfunction and quality of life will be screened in patients and their relatives by using the psychosocial screening instrument for adult trauma patients (PSIT), the Cognitive Failure Questionnaire (CFQ) and the short-form health survey 36 (SF-36). The recollection of patients’ memory of the ICU stay will be evaluated by the ICU memory tool. The appreciation of the ICU diary will be assessed using a questionnaire. Results: Participants’ characteristics including how they valued the diary, and their memory of ICU treatment will be reported. Multiple logistic regression analysis will be performed for analyzing the relation between mental health outcome and the use of ICU diaries. Change in PICS symptoms over time will be analyzed using longitudinal data analysis. Missing values in questionnaires will be analyzed using missing value analysis and multiple imputations at item level will be performed if necessary. Conclusions: This study will contribute to the knowledge of mental health outcome in SARS-CoV-2 patients and the use of ICU diaries in this group.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A large-scale image dataset of wood surface defects for automated vision-based quality control processes [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                The wood industry is facing many challenges. The high variability of raw material and the complexity of manufacturing processes results in a wide range of visible structure defects, which have to be controlled by trained specialists. These manual processes are not only tedious and biased, but also less effective. To overcome the drawbacks of the manual quality control processes, several automated vision-based systems have been proposed. Even though some conducted studies achieved a higher recognition rate than trained experts, researchers have to deal with a lack of large-scale databases and authentic data in this field. To address this issue, we performed a data acquisition experiment set in the industrial environment, where we were able to acquire an extensive set of authentic data from a production line. For this purpose, we designed and implemented a complex technical solution suitable for high-speed acquisition during harsh manufacturing conditions. In this data note, we present a large-scale dataset of high-resolution sawn timber surface images containing more than 43 000 labelled surface defects and covering 10 types of the most common wood defects. Moreover, with each image record, we provide two types of labels allowing researchers to perform semantic segmentation, as well as defect classification, and localization.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Utilizing data sampling techniques on algorithmic fairness for customer churn prediction with data imbalance problems [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Customer churn prediction (CCP) refers to detecting which customers are likely to cancel the services provided by a service provider, for example, internet services. The class imbalance problem (CIP) in machine learning occurs when there is a huge difference in the samples of the positive class compared to the negative class. It is one of the major obstacles in CCP as it deteriorates performance in the classification process. Utilizing data sampling techniques (DSTs) helps to resolve the CIP to some extent. Methods: In this paper, we review the effect of using DSTs on algorithmic fairness, i.e., to investigate whether the results pose any discrimination between male and female groups and compare the results before and after using DSTs. Three real-world datasets with unequal balancing rates were prepared and four ubiquitous DSTs were applied to them. Six popular classification techniques were utilized in the classification process. Both classifier’s performance and algorithmic fairness are evaluated with notable metrics. Results: The results indicated that the Random Forest classifier outperforms other classifiers in all three datasets and, that using SMOTE and ADASYN techniques causes more discrimination in the female group. The rate of unintentional discrimination seems to be higher in the original data of extremely unbalanced datasets under the following classifiers: Logistics Regression, LightGBM, and XGBoost. Conclusions: Algorithmic fairness has become a broadly studied area in recent years, yet there is very little systematic study on the effect of using DSTs on algorithmic fairness. This study presents important findings to further the use of algorithmic fairness in CCP research.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Saudi Arabian students in postgraduate dental programs: Investigating factors associated with burnout [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Burnout related to emotional and physical study or work demands affects an individual’s performance and wellbeing. This study focused on Saudi Arabian dental residents studying in the United States and the United Kingdom who are faced with many challenges in the pursuit of a higher education degree.  Methods: A survey including demographic and Maslach Burnout inventory (MBI) questions was distributed to assess this population’s level of burnout. The MBI has been widely used in the literature to assess three components of burnout: emotional exhaustion (EE), depersonalization (DEP), and (diminished) personal accomplishment (PA). Potential predictors of burnout level, tested for statistical significance, included: (1) country (US vs UK), (2) hours of work, (3) sponsorship status, (4) marital status (5) gender, and (6) prior work experience.  Results: The number of participants from the UK was 29 and from the US was 64 (n=93). The total number of participants who completed the survey was 87. Using multiple regression analyses, those found to predict EE included hours of work, sponsorship status, and gender. Only gender was found to predict PA. None of the variables were predictive of DEP. Moreover, after controlling for the demographic variables, the country where studying did not help account for the level of burnout.  Conclusion: In the literature, burnout was found to be prevalent among dental postgraduate students. This study suggests that Saudi Arabian dental residents experience high burnout due to emotional exhaustion when compared to other medical professionals. Moreover, Female residents are more likely to report experiencing burnout than their male counterparts. Limitations of the study, implications for practice and suggestions for further research are offered in the discussion.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Leveraging on digital technology for financial inclusion of women agripreneurs in Southern Nigeria [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Women are key players in agriculture, but they are under-resourced, particularly in terms of finance. Microfinance has long been recognized as the most effective method of financially empowering these women, but using the benefits of digital technology can help scale it up and ensure its long-term viability. Methods The study area was Southern Nigeria. Respondents were women agripreneurs (n=479), from six states. 239 women agripreneurs who accessed digital financial products and 240 women agripreneurs who did not access financial products participated in the survey in 2019. Results The tests for significant difference between income of participants and non-participants in digital finance indicated a T-value of 3.214 (P< 0.001), which implies that there was a significant difference in the income of those that are accessing digital financial products (DFPs) and those that are not accessing DFPs. The tests for significant difference between savings of participants and non-participants indicated a T-value of 2.479 (p<0.05), which also implies that there was a significant difference in the women agripreneurs’ savings for participants and non-participants in DFPs. Only 2.5% of  women agripreneurs are participating in micro-insurance in Southern Nigeria. Conclusions Women agripreneurs who are accessing digital financial products earned more income and saved more than those who are not accessing digital financial products. This implies that you are more advantaged in using digital finance in business. Micro-insurance is poorly accessed in Nigeria, and awareness of insurance products is moderately low. This study recommends that Central Bank of Nigeria should engage in more outreach programmes to enable all women in Nigeria access digital financial products because of its convenience and contributions to success in business. Insurance companies should capitalize on business models that incorporate mobile technologies in order to increase insurance penetration in rural areas.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Bayesian subjectivism and psychosocial attitude toward COVID-19 vaccines [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: People resistant to vaccination against the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic have been counted in almost all countries worldwide. This anti-scientific subjectivity attitude could be explained by assuming as background the individual probability theory originally elaborated by the statistical school of de Finetti. Methods: This research method is based on a sample of 613 subjects from European countries who completed a questionnaire on attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccinations. On a six-value scale, a questionnaire investigated knowledge, assessments, degree of confidence, level of fear, anguish, and anger. Some items proposed an imaginary bet on the probability of not getting sick to deepen the possible presence of subjectivist assumptions about pandemics. Results: 50.4% were against vaccines and 52.5% against the so-called "Green Pass". Results of t-tests and correlations and stepwise regressions indicate that the sample’s reasons for opposing vaccination are related to an ego centred vision of the values that assign minor, if any, confidence to authority. Conclusions: This result supports the conclusion that No Vax decisions are more based on subjectivist probabilistic assumptions, thus in line with the significant social trend called "individualism".

                Background: Given the chemical richness of medicinal plants (Bidens pilosa L. and Croton floccosus) in Ecuador, they are considered the natural source of numerous medicines. Methods: The leaves were dried at 40°C and 50°C and the extracts were characterized by means of phytochemical screening, verifying the presence of secondary metabolites such as alkaloids, reducing sugars, phenols, flavonoids, tannins and saponins. Three extraction processes were carried out, with two solvents of different polarities: hexane and ethanol. The extraction methods that were applied to the leaves of the plants were Soxhlet, ultrasonic bath and maceration, the latter two at room temperature and Soxhlet at the boiling temperature of the solvent. Determination of the total content of phenols and flavonoids is carried out using the Follin-Ciocalteau colorimetric reaction, Quercetin standard, Aluminum Chloride solution measured with a UV-Vis spectrophotometer. The antioxidant activity was performed with the DPPH radical and measured with the same equipment. Results: The highest content of total phenols obtained by employing the Soxhlet method for extraction when the material was dried at 50°C was 48.609 ± 0.370 mg GAE/g of dry sample for Bidens pilosa L. while in the case of Croton floccosus it was 128.212 ± 0.601 mg GAE/g of dry sample obtained from the extraction by means of maceration. Finally, the antioxidant activity against the 1.1-diphenyl-2-picryl-hydrazyl radical was determined, and it was found that the Bidens pilosa L. species performed better and responded better to the test, with an IC50 value of 239.33 µg/mL, than Croton floccosus (IC50 of 644.125 µg/mL). Conclusions: The following preliminary phytochemical study of the Bidens pilosa L. and Croton floccosus plants provided important information on the content of secondary metabolites and response to the DPPH radical reported for the first time in Ecuador, which may be future use for medicinal application.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Characterizing superspreading potential of infectious disease: Decomposition of individual transmissibility</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Shi Zhao, Marc K. C. Chong, Sukhyun Ryu, Zihao Guo, Mu He, Boqiang Chen, Salihu S. Musa, Jingxuan Wang, Yushan Wu, Daihai He, Maggie H. Wang</p>

In the context of infectious disease transmission, high heterogeneity in individual infectiousness indicates that a few index cases can generate large numbers of secondary cases, a phenomenon commonly known as superspreading. The potential of disease superspreading can be characterized by describing the distribution of secondary cases (of each seed case) as a negative binomial (NB) distribution with the dispersion parameter, <i>k</i>. Based on the feature of NB distribution, there must be a proportion of individuals with individual reproduction number of almost 0, which appears restricted and unrealistic. To overcome this limitation, we generalized the compound structure of a Poisson rate and included an additional parameter, and divided the reproduction number into independent and additive fixed and variable components. Then, the secondary cases followed a Delaporte distribution. We demonstrated that the Delaporte distribution was important for understanding the characteristics of disease transmission, which generated new insights distinct from the NB model. By using real-world dataset, the Delaporte distribution provides improvements in describing the distributions of COVID-19 and SARS cases compared to the NB distribution. The model selection yielded increasing statistical power with larger sample sizes as well as conservative type I error in detecting the improvement in fitting with the likelihood ratio (LR) test. Numerical simulation revealed that the control strategy-making process may benefit from monitoring the transmission characteristics under the Delaporte framework. Our findings highlighted that for the COVID-19 pandemic, population-wide interventions may control disease transmission on a general scale before recommending the high-risk-specific control strategies.

                <p>by Raphael R. Eguchi, Christian A. Choe, Po-Ssu Huang</p>

While deep learning models have seen increasing applications in protein science, few have been implemented for protein backbone generation—an important task in structure-based problems such as active site and interface design. We present a new approach to building class-specific backbones, using a variational auto-encoder to directly generate the 3D coordinates of immunoglobulins. Our model is torsion- and distance-aware, learns a high-resolution embedding of the dataset, and generates novel, high-quality structures compatible with existing design tools. We show that the Ig-VAE can be used with Rosetta to create a computational model of a SARS-CoV2-RBD binder via latent space sampling. We further demonstrate that the model’s generative prior is a powerful tool for guiding computational protein design, motivating a new paradigm under which backbone design is solved as constrained optimization problem in the latent space of a generative model.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Data-based stochastic modeling reveals sources of activity bursts in single-cell TGF-β signaling</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Niklas Kolbe, Lorenz Hexemer, Lukas-Malte Bammert, Alexander Loewer, Mária Lukáčová-Medvid’ová, Stefan Legewie</p>

Cells sense their surrounding by employing intracellular signaling pathways that transmit hormonal signals from the cell membrane to the nucleus. TGF-β/SMAD signaling encodes various cell fates, controls tissue homeostasis and is deregulated in diseases such as cancer. The pathway shows strong heterogeneity at the single-cell level, but quantitative insights into mechanisms underlying fluctuations at various time scales are still missing, partly due to inefficiency in the calibration of stochastic models that mechanistically describe signaling processes. In this work we analyze single-cell TGF-β/SMAD signaling and show that it exhibits temporal stochastic bursts which are dose-dependent and whose number and magnitude correlate with cell migration. We propose a stochastic modeling approach to mechanistically describe these pathway fluctuations with high computational efficiency. Employing high-order numerical integration and fitting to burst statistics we enable efficient quantitative parameter estimation and discriminate models that assume noise in different reactions at the receptor level. This modeling approach suggests that stochasticity in the internalization of TGF-β receptors into endosomes plays a key role in the observed temporal bursting. Further, the model predicts the single-cell dynamics of TGF-β/SMAD signaling in untested conditions, e.g., successfully reflects memory effects of signaling noise and cellular sensitivity towards repeated stimulation. Taken together, our computational framework based on burst analysis, noise modeling and path computation scheme is a suitable tool for the data-based modeling of complex signaling pathways, capable of identifying the source of temporal noise.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Increasing reproducibility, robustness, and generalizability of biomarker selection from meta-analysis using Bayesian methodology</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Laurynas Kalesinskas, Sanjana Gupta, Purvesh Khatri</p>

A major limitation of gene expression biomarker studies is that they are not reproducible as they simply do not generalize to larger, real-world, heterogeneous populations. Frequentist multi-cohort gene expression meta-analysis has been frequently used as a solution to this problem to identify biomarkers that are truly differentially expressed. However, the frequentist meta-analysis framework has its limitations–it needs at least 4–5 datasets with hundreds of samples, is prone to confounding from outliers and relies on multiple-hypothesis corrected p-values. To address these shortcomings, we have created a Bayesian meta-analysis framework for the analysis of gene expression data. Using real-world data from three different diseases, we show that the Bayesian method is more robust to outliers, creates more informative estimates of between-study heterogeneity, reduces the number of false positive and false negative biomarkers and selects more generalizable biomarkers with less data. We have compared the Bayesian framework to a previously published frequentist framework and have developed a publicly available R package for use.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Computational analysis of memory consolidation following inhibitory avoidance (IA) training in adult and infant rats: Critical roles of CaMKIIα and MeCP2</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yili Zhang, Paul Smolen, Cristina M. Alberini, Douglas A. Baxter, John H. Byrne</p>

Key features of long-term memory (LTM), such as its stability and persistence, are acquired during processes collectively referred to as consolidation. The dynamics of biological changes during consolidation are complex. In adult rodents, consolidation exhibits distinct periods during which the engram is more or less resistant to disruption. Moreover, the ability to consolidate memories differs during developmental periods. Although the molecular mechanisms underlying consolidation are poorly understood, the initial stages rely on interacting signaling pathways that regulate gene expression, including brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II α (CaMKIIα) dependent feedback loops. We investigated the ways in which these pathways may contribute to developmental and dynamical features of consolidation. A computational model of molecular processes underlying consolidation following inhibitory avoidance (IA) training in rats was developed. Differential equations described the actions of CaMKIIα, multiple feedback loops regulating BDNF expression, and several transcription factors including methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2), histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2), and SIN3 transcription regulator family member A (Sin3a). This model provides novel explanations for the (apparent) rapid forgetting of infantile memory and the temporal progression of memory consolidation in adults. Simulations predict that dual effects of MeCP2 on the expression of <i>bdnf</i>, and interaction between MeCP2 and CaMKIIα, play critical roles in the rapid forgetting of infantile memory and the progress of memory resistance to disruptions. These insights suggest new potential targets of therapy for memory impairment.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Mathematical modeling of the microtubule detyrosination/tyrosination cycle for cell-based drug screening design</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jeremy Grignard, Véronique Lamamy, Eva Vermersch, Philippe Delagrange, Jean-Philippe Stephan, Thierry Dorval, François Fages</p>

Microtubules and their post-translational modifications are involved in major cellular processes. In severe diseases such as neurodegenerative disorders, tyrosinated tubulin and tyrosinated microtubules are in lower concentration. We present here a mechanistic mathematical model of the microtubule tyrosination cycle combining computational modeling and high-content image analyses to understand the key kinetic parameters governing the tyrosination status in different cellular models. That mathematical model is parameterized, firstly, for neuronal cells using kinetic values taken from the literature, and, secondly, for proliferative cells, by a change of two parameter values obtained, and shown minimal, by a continuous optimization procedure based on temporal logic constraints to formalize experimental high-content imaging data. In both cases, the mathematical models explain the inability to increase the tyrosination status by activating the Tubulin Tyrosine Ligase enzyme. The tyrosinated tubulin is indeed the product of a chain of two reactions in the cycle: the detyrosinated microtubule depolymerization followed by its tyrosination. The tyrosination status at equilibrium is thus limited by both reaction rates and activating the tyrosination reaction alone is not effective. Our computational model also predicts the effect of inhibiting the Tubulin Carboxy Peptidase enzyme which we have experimentally validated in MEF cellular model. Furthermore, the model predicts that the activation of two particular kinetic parameters, the tyrosination and detyrosinated microtubule depolymerization rate constants, in synergy, should suffice to enable an increase of the tyrosination status in living cells.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">An ensemble forecast system for tracking dynamics of dengue outbreaks and its validation in China</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yuliang Chen, Tao Liu, Xiaolin Yu, Qinghui Zeng, Zixi Cai, Haisheng Wu, Qingying Zhang, Jianpeng Xiao, Wenjun Ma, Sen Pei, Pi Guo</p>

As a common vector-borne disease, dengue fever remains challenging to predict due to large variations in epidemic size across seasons driven by a number of factors including population susceptibility, mosquito density, meteorological conditions, geographical factors, and human mobility. An ensemble forecast system for dengue fever is first proposed that addresses the difficulty of predicting outbreaks with drastically different scales. The ensemble forecast system based on a susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) type of compartmental model coupled with a data assimilation method called the ensemble adjusted Kalman filter (EAKF) is constructed to generate real-time forecasts of dengue fever spread dynamics. The model was informed by meteorological and mosquito density information to depict the transmission of dengue virus among human and mosquito populations, and generate predictions. To account for the dramatic variations of outbreak size in different seasons, the effective population size parameter that is sequentially updated to adjust the predicted outbreak scale is introduced into the model. Before optimizing the transmission model, we update the effective population size using the most recent observations and historical records so that the predicted outbreak size is dynamically adjusted. In the retrospective forecast of dengue outbreaks in Guangzhou, China during the 2011–2017 seasons, the proposed forecast model generates accurate projections of peak timing, peak intensity, and total incidence, outperforming a generalized additive model approach. The ensemble forecast system can be operated in real-time and inform control planning to reduce the burden of dengue fever.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Inferring the effective reproductive number from deterministic and semi-deterministic compartmental models using incidence and mobility data</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jair Andrade, Jim Duggan</p>

The effective reproduction number (ℜ<sub>t</sub>) is a theoretical indicator of the course of an infectious disease that allows policymakers to evaluate whether current or previous control efforts have been successful or whether additional interventions are necessary. This metric, however, cannot be directly observed and must be inferred from available data. One approach to obtaining such estimates is fitting compartmental models to incidence data. We can envision these dynamic models as the ensemble of structures that describe the disease’s natural history and individuals’ behavioural patterns. In the context of the response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the assumption of a constant transmission rate is rendered unrealistic, and it is critical to identify a mathematical formulation that accounts for changes in contact patterns. In this work, we leverage existing approaches to propose three complementary formulations that yield similar estimates for ℜ<sub>t</sub> based on data from Ireland’s first COVID-19 wave. We describe these Data Generating Processes (DGP) in terms of State-Space models. Two (DGP1 and DGP2) correspond to stochastic process models whose transmission rate is modelled as Brownian motion processes (Geometric and Cox-Ingersoll-Ross). These DGPs share a measurement model that accounts for incidence and transmission rates, where mobility data is assumed as a proxy of the transmission rate. We perform inference on these structures using Iterated Filtering and the Particle Filter. The final DGP (DGP3) is built from a pool of deterministic models that describe the transmission rate as information delays. We calibrate this pool of models to incidence reports using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. By following this complementary approach, we assess the tradeoffs associated with each formulation and reflect on the benefits/risks of incorporating proxy data into the inference process. We anticipate this work will help evaluate the implications of choosing a particular formulation for the dynamics and observation of the time-varying transmission rate.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">The topology of genome-scale metabolic reconstructions unravels independent modules and high network flexibility</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Verónica S. Martínez, Pedro A. Saa, Jason Jooste, Kanupriya Tiwari, Lake-Ee Quek, Lars K. Nielsen</p>

The topology of metabolic networks is recognisably modular with modules weakly connected apart from sharing a pool of currency metabolites. Here, we defined modules as sets of reversible reactions isolated from the rest of metabolism by irreversible reactions except for the exchange of currency metabolites. Our approach identifies topologically independent modules under specific conditions associated with different metabolic functions. As case studies, the <i>E</i>.<i>coli i</i>JO1366 and Human Recon 2.2 genome-scale metabolic models were split in 103 and 321 modules respectively, displaying significant correlation patterns in expression data. Finally, we addressed a fundamental question about the metabolic flexibility conferred by reversible reactions: “Of all Directed Topologies (DTs) defined by fixing directions to all reversible reactions, how many are capable of carrying flux through all reactions?”. Enumeration of the DTs for <i>i</i>JO1366 model was performed using an efficient depth-first search algorithm, rejecting infeasible DTs based on mass-imbalanced and loopy flux patterns. We found the direction of 79% of reversible reactions must be defined before all directions in the network can be fixed, granting a high degree of flexibility.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Covalent docking and molecular dynamics simulations reveal the specificity-shifting mutations Ala237Arg and Ala237Lys in TEM beta-lactamase</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Gabriel Monteiro da Silva, Jordan Yang, Bunlong Leang, Jessie Huang, Daniel M. Weinreich, Brenda M. Rubenstein</p>

The rate of modern drug discovery using experimental screening methods still lags behind the rate at which pathogens mutate, underscoring the need for fast and accurate predictive simulations of protein evolution. Multidrug-resistant bacteria evade our defenses by expressing a series of proteins, the most famous of which is the 29-kilodalton enzyme, TEM β-lactamase. Considering these challenges, we applied a covalent docking heuristic to measure the effects of all possible alanine 237 substitutions in TEM due to this codon’s importance for catalysis and effects on the binding affinities of commercially-available β-lactam compounds. In addition to the usual mutations that reduce substrate binding due to steric hindrance, we identified two distinctive specificity-shifting TEM mutations, Ala237Arg and Ala237Lys, and their respective modes of action. Notably, we discovered and verified through minimum inhibitory concentration assays that, while these mutations and their bulkier side chains lead to steric clashes that curtail ampicillin binding, these same groups foster salt bridges with the negatively-charged side-chain of the cephalosporin cefixime, widely used in the clinic to treat multi-resistant bacterial infections. To measure the stability of these unexpected interactions, we used molecular dynamics simulations and found the binding modes to be stable despite the application of biasing forces. Finally, we found that both TEM mutants also bind strongly to other drugs containing negatively-charged R-groups, such as carumonam and ceftibuten. As with cefixime, this increased binding affinity stems from a salt bridge between the compounds’ negative moieties and the positively-charged side chain of the arginine or lysine, suggesting a shared mechanism. In addition to reaffirming the power of using simulations as molecular microscopes, our results can guide the rational design of next-generation β-lactam antibiotics and bring the community closer to retaking the lead against the recurrent threat of multidrug-resistant pathogens.

<h2>Graphical Abstract</h2>
<p>The LXRs agonist GW3965 ameliorates chronic unpredictable stress-induced depression-like behaviors. LXRs agonist treatment can inhibit hippocampal neuroinflammation of CUS model mice, reverse the increase in the number of Iba1<sup>+</sup> cells in the hippocampal subregions, inhibit the activation of microglia in hippocampal CA2/3 and DG regions, and significantly increase the branch length and endpoints of microglia in the DG of CUS model mice.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Liver X receptors (LXRs) have recently been reported to be novel and potential targets for the reversal of depressive-like behaviors, but the mechanism remains unclear. Hippocampal neuroinflammation and impairment of the normal structure and function of microglia are closely associated with depression. To investigate the effects of LXRs agonist (GW3965) on neuroinflammation and microglia in the hippocampal formation of mice with chronic unpredictable stress (CUS)-induced depression, depressive-like behaviors were evaluated by behavioral tests, hippocampal LXRs gene expression were evaluated by qRT-PCR, the protein expression levels of interleukin-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α, inducible nitric oxide synthase, nuclear factor kappa B, and cluster of differentiation 206 were estimated by western blotting, modern stereological methods were used to precisely quantify the total number of microglia in each hippocampal subregion, and immunofluorescence was used to detect the density of activated microglia and the morphology of microglia. We found that GW3965 alleviated the depressive-like behavior induced by CUS, reversed the decrease in hippocampal LXRα and LXRβ induced by CUS, increased the protein expression of pro-inflammatory factors, and decreased the protein expression of antiinflammatory factors induced by CUS. Moreover, CUS intervention significantly increased the number of microglia in the CA1 region, CA2/3 region, and dentate gyrus and the density of activated microglia in the CA2/3 region and dentate gyrus and significantly decreased the endpoints of microglial branches and process length of microglia in the dentate gyrus, while 4 weeks of injections with GW3965 reversed these changes. These findings suggest that regulating the number, activated state, and morphology of microglia in hippocampal subregions might be an important basis for the antidepressant effects of LXRs.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The integrated stress response remodels the microtubule organizing center to clear unfolded proteins following proteotoxic stress</a></h4>

              
                Cells encountering stressful situations activate the integrated stress response (ISR) pathway to limit protein synthesis and redirect translation to better cope. The ISR has also been implicated in cancers, but redundancies in the stress-sensing kinases that trigger the ISR have posed hurdles to dissecting physiological relevance. To overcome this challenge, we targeted the regulatory node of these kinases, namely the S51 phosphorylation site of eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF2α and genetically replaced eIF2α with eIF2α-S51A in mouse squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) stem cells of skin. While inconsequential under normal growth conditions, the vulnerability of this ISR-null state was unveiled when SCC stem cells experienced proteotoxic stress. Seeking mechanistic insights into the protective roles of the ISR, we combined ribosome profiling and functional approaches to identify and probe the functional importance of translational differences between ISR-competent and ISR-null SCC stem cells when exposed to proteotoxic stress. In doing so, we learned that the ISR redirects translation to centrosomal proteins that orchestrate the microtubule dynamics needed to efficiently concentrate unfolded proteins at the microtubule organizing center so that they can be cleared by the perinuclear degradation machinery. Thus, rather than merely maintaining survival during proteotoxic stress, the ISR also functions in promoting cellular recovery once the stress has subsided. Remarkably, this molecular program is unique to transformed skin stem cells hence exposing a vulnerability in cancer that could be exploited therapeutically.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Integration of visual and antennal mechanosensory feedback during head stabilization in hawkmoths</a></h4>

              
                During flight maneuvers, insects exhibit compensatory head movements which are essential for stabilizing the visual field on their retina, reducing motion blur, and supporting visual self-motion estimation. In Diptera, such head movements are mediated <i>via</i> visual feedback from their compound eyes that detect retinal slip, as well as rapid mechanosensory feedback from their halteres - the modified hindwings that sense the angular rates of body rotations. Because non-Dipteran insects lack halteres, it is not known if mechanosensory feedback about body rotations plays any role in their head stabilization response. Diverse non-Dipteran insects are known to rely on visual and antennal mechanosensory feedback for flight control. In hawkmoths, for instance, reduction of antennal mechanosensory feedback severely compromises their ability to control flight. Similarly, when the head movements of freely-flying moths are restricted, their flight ability is also severely impaired. The role of compensatory head movements as well as multimodal feedback in insect flight raises an interesting question: in insects that lack halteres, what sensory cues are required for head stabilization? Here, we show that in the nocturnal hawkmoth <i>Daphnis nerii</i>, compensatory head movements are mediated by combined visual and antennal mechanosensory feedback. We subjected tethered moths to open-loop body roll rotations under different lighting conditions, and measured their ability to maintain head angle in the presence or absence of antennal mechanosensory feedback. Our study suggests that head stabilization in moths is mediated primarily by visual feedback during roll movements at lower frequencies, whereas antennal mechanosensory feedback is required when roll occurs at higher frequency. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that control of head angle results from a multimodal feedback loop that integrates both visual and antennal mechanosensory feedback, <i>albeit</i> at different latencies. At adequate light levels, visual feedback is sufficient for head stabilization primarily at low frequencies of body roll. However, under dark conditions, antennal mechanosensory feedback is essential for the control of head movements at high of body roll.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Phosphoregulation of DSB-1 mediates control of meiotic double-strand break activity</a></h4>

              
                In the first meiotic cell division, proper segregation of chromosomes in most organisms depends on chiasmata, exchanges of continuity between homologous chromosomes that originate from the repair of programmed double-strand breaks (DSBs) catalyzed by the Spo11 endonuclease. Since DSBs can lead to irreparable damage in germ cells, while chromosomes lacking DSBs also lack chiasmata, the number of DSBs must be carefully regulated to be neither too high nor too low. Here, we show that in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>, meiotic DSB levels are controlled by the phosphoregulation of DSB-1, a homolog of the yeast Spo11 cofactor Rec114, by the opposing activities of PP4<sup>PPH-4.1</sup> phosphatase and ATR<sup>ATL-1</sup> kinase. Increased DSB-1 phosphorylation in <i>pph-4.1</i> mutants correlates with reduction in DSB formation, while prevention of DSB-1 phosphorylation drastically increases the number of meiotic DSBs both in <i>pph-4.1</i> mutants as well as in the wild type background. <i>C. elegans</i> and its close relatives also possess a diverged paralog of DSB-1, called DSB-2, and loss of <i>dsb-2</i> is known to reduce DSB formation in oocytes with increasing age. We show that the proportion of the phosphorylated, and thus inactivated, form of DSB-1 increases with age and upon loss of DSB-2, while non-phosphorylatable DSB-1 rescues the age-dependent decrease in DSBs in <i>dsb-2</i> mutants. These results suggest that DSB-2 evolved in part to compensate for the inactivation of DSB-1 through phosphorylation, to maintain levels of DSBs in older animals. Our work shows that PP4<sup>PPH-4.1</sup>, ATR<sup>ATL-1</sup>, and DSB-2 act in concert with DSB-1 to promote optimal DSB levels throughout the reproductive lifespan.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Transferrin receptor 1-mediated iron uptake regulates bone mass in mice via osteoclast mitochondria and cytoskeleton</a></h4>

              
                Increased intracellular iron spurs mitochondrial biogenesis and respiration to satisfy high-energy demand during osteoclast differentiation and bone-resorbing activities. Transferrin receptor 1 (Tfr1) mediates cellular iron uptake through endocytosis of iron-loaded transferrin and its expression increases during osteoclast differentiation. Nonetheless, the precise functions of Tfr1 and Tfr1-mediated iron uptake in osteoclast biology and skeletal homeostasis remain incompletely understood. To investigate the role of Tfr1 in osteoclast lineage cells <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i>, we crossed <i>Tfrc </i>(encoding Tfr1)-floxed mice with <i>Lyz2 (LysM)-</i>Cre and <i>Cathepsin K</i> (<i>Ctsk)</i>-Cre mice to generate <i>Tfrc</i> conditional knockout mice in myeloid osteoclast precursors (Tfr1<sup>ΔLysM</sup>) or differentiated osteoclasts (Tfr1<sup>ΔCtsk</sup>), respectively. Skeletal phenotyping by µCT and histology unveiled a significant increase in trabecular bone mass with normal osteoclast number in long bones of 10-week-old young and 6-month-old adult female but not male Tfr1<sup>ΔLysM</sup> mice. Although high trabecular bone volume in long bones was observed in both male and female Tfr1<sup>ΔCtsk</sup> mice, this phenotype was more pronounced in female knockout mice. Consistent with this gender-dependent phenomena, estrogen-deficiency induced by ovariectomy decreased trabecular bone mass in Tfr1<sup>ΔLysM</sup> mice. Mechanistically, disruption of Tfr1 expression attenuated mitochondrial metabolism and cytoskeletal organization in mature osteoclasts <i>in vitro </i>by attenuating mitochondrial respiration and activation of the Src-Rac1-WAVE regulatory complex (WRC) axis, respectively, leading to decreased bone resorption with little impact on osteoclast differentiation. These results indicate that Tfr1-mediated iron uptake is specifically required for osteoclast function and is indispensable for bone remodeling in a gender-dependent manner.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Cystathionine-β-synthase is essential for AKT-induced senescence and suppresses the development of gastric cancers with PI3K/AKT activation</a></h4>

              
                Hyperactivation of oncogenic pathways downstream of RAS and PI3K/AKT in normal cells induces a senescence-like phenotype that acts as a tumor-suppressive mechanism that must be overcome during transformation. We previously demonstrated that AKT-induced senescence (AIS) is associated with profound transcriptional and metabolic changes. Here, we demonstrate that human fibroblasts undergoing AIS display upregulated cystathionine-β-synthase (CBS) expression and enhanced uptake of exogenous cysteine, which lead to increased hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) and glutathione (GSH) production, consequently protecting senescent cells from oxidative stress-induced cell death. CBS depletion allows AIS cells to escape senescence and re-enter the cell cycle, indicating the importance of CBS activity in maintaining AIS. Mechanistically, we show this restoration of proliferation is mediated through suppressing mitochondrial respiration and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by reducing mitochondrial localized CBS while retaining antioxidant capacity of transsulfuration pathway. These findings implicate a potential tumor-suppressive role for CBS in cells with aberrant PI3K/AKT pathway activation. Consistent with this concept, in human gastric cancer cells with activated PI3K/AKT signaling, we demonstrate that CBS expression is suppressed due to promoter hypermethylation. CBS loss cooperates with activated PI3K/AKT signaling in promoting anchorage-independent growth of gastric epithelial cells, while CBS restoration suppresses the growth of gastric tumors in vivo. Taken together, we find that CBS is a novel regulator of AIS and a potential tumor suppressor in PI3K/AKT-driven gastric cancers, providing a new exploitable metabolic vulnerability in these cancers.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Global cellular response to chemical perturbation of PLK4 activity and abnormal centrosome number</a></h4>

              
                Centrosomes act as the main microtubule organizing center (MTOC) in metazoans. Centrosome number is tightly regulated by limiting centriole duplication to a single round per cell cycle. This control is achieved by multiple mechanisms, including the regulation of the protein kinase PLK4, the most upstream facilitator of centriole duplication. Altered centrosome numbers in mouse and human cells cause p53-dependent growth arrest through poorly defined mechanisms. Recent work has shown that the E3 ligase TRIM37 is required for cell cycle arrest in acentrosomal cells. To gain additional insights into this process, we undertook a series of genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screens to identify factors important for growth arrest triggered by treatment with centrinone B, a selective PLK4 inhibitor. We found that TRIM37 is a key mediator of growth arrest after partial or full PLK4 inhibition. Interestingly, PLK4 cellular mobility decreased in a dose-dependent manner after centrinone B treatment. In contrast to recent work, we found that growth arrest after PLK4 inhibition correlated better with PLK4 activity than with mitotic length or centrosome number. These data provide insights into the global response to changes in centrosome number and PLK4 activity and extend the role for TRIM37 in regulating the abundance, localization, and function of centrosome proteins.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Cardiac differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells using defined extracellular matrix proteins reveals essential role of fibronectin</a></h4>

              
                Research and therapeutic applications using human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hPSC-CMs) require robust differentiation strategies. Efforts to improve hPSC-CM differentiation have largely overlooked the role of extracellular matrix (ECM). The present study investigates the ability of defined ECM proteins to promote hPSC cardiac differentiation. Fibronectin (FN), laminin-111, and laminin-521 enabled hPSCs to attach and expand. However, only addition of FN promoted cardiac differentiation in response to growth factors Activin A, BMP4, and bFGF in contrast to the inhibition produced by laminin-111 or laminin-521. hPSCs in culture produced endogenous FN which accumulated in the ECM to a critical level necessary for effective cardiac differentiation. Inducible shRNA knockdown of FN prevented Brachyury<sup>+</sup> mesoderm formation and subsequent hPSC-CM generation. Antibodies blocking FN binding integrins α4β1 or αVβ1, but not α5β1, inhibited cardiac differentiation. Furthermore, inhibition of integrin-linked kinase led to a decrease in phosphorylated AKT, which was associated with increased apoptosis and inhibition of cardiac differentiation. These results provide new insights into defined matrices for culture of hPSCs that enable production of FN-enriched ECM which is essential for mesoderm formation and efficient cardiac differentiation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Cryo-electron tomography of Birbeck granules reveals the molecular mechanism of langerin lattice formation</a></h4>

              
                Langerhans cells are specialized antigen-presenting cells localized within the epidermis and mucosal epithelium. Upon contact with Langerhans cells, pathogens are captured by the C-type lectin langerin and internalized into a structurally unique vesicle known as a Birbeck granule. Although the immunological role of Langerhans cells and Birbeck granules have been extensively studied, the mechanism by which the characteristic zippered membrane structure of Birbeck granules is formed remains elusive. In this study, we observed isolated Birbeck granules using cryo-electron tomography and reconstructed the 3D structure of the repeating unit of the honeycomb lattice of langerin at 6.4 Å resolution. We found that the interaction between the two langerin trimers was mediated by docking the flexible loop at residues 258-263 into the secondary carbohydrate-binding cleft. Mutations within the loop inhibited Birbeck granule formation and the internalization of HIV pseudovirus. These findings suggest a molecular mechanism for membrane zippering during Birbeck granule biogenesis and provide insight into the role of langerin in the defense against viral infection.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Diverse thermosensory receptors and neurons mediate the neural coding of oral cooling in the mouse trigeminothalamic tract</a></h4>

              
                Different sets of peripheral and medullary trigeminal neurons respond across a cooling gradient applied to intraoral skin. Here we applied electrophysiology to anesthetized mice to study if different types of cool-driven trigeminothalamic neurons convey oral cooling information to the thalamus. We monitored spiking responses to oral stimulation with cold ([&le;]13{degrees}C), cool (21{degrees}C to 28{degrees}C), neutral (35{degrees}C), and warm/hot ([&ge;]40{degrees}C) water in single trigeminal nucleus caudalis (Vc) neurons physiologically tested for projections to the thalamus. We also recorded oral thermal responses from Vc neurons in mice gene deficient for the cooling and menthol receptor TRPM8 to study afferent mechanisms of central oral thermosensory activity. We found that thalamic-projecting Vc neurons that respond to oral cooling comprise heterogeneous cell types. These cell types showed unique temporal response kinetics across cool and cold temperatures, with tuning to select ranges of a cooling gradient. The combined thermal activity of multiple, differently tuned types of trigeminothalamic cooling neurons offered greater contrast between cold, cool, and warm temperatures in multivariate analysis than the responses of the individual neural types alone, agreeing with a neural population code for cooling information. Compared to control, TRPM8 deficient mice demonstrated a loss of Vc neurons tuned to mild oral cooling, but maintained Vc cells responsive to intense cold. Notably, distinctions between Vc population responses to mild cool and warm temperatures were impaired in TRPM8 deficient mice, suggesting a role for TRPM8 in oral warmth recognition. Diverse receptors and neurons mediate oral cooling signals carried by the trigeminothalamic pathway.

                Mitochondrial dysfunction has been the primary suspect for central nervous system (CNS) disorders such as glaucoma, Parkinsons disease (PD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). It is still unclear the fundamental mitochondrial quality control (MQC) step that could be improved for developing CNS neuroprotection. Here, we used human stem cell differentiated retinal ganglion cells (hRGCs) of CNS which are the neurons most sensitive towards mitochondrial dysfunction, to identify mechanism of improving MQC. We found hRGCs are highly efficient in promoting mitochondrial biogenesis, a critical step of MQC to compensate for the loss of damaged mitochondria. Pharmacological activation of the cellular energy sensor AMPK resulted in increased mitochondrial biogenesis and energy homeostasis as revealed by biochemical, imaging, metabolic and ultrastructure analysis. This led to enhanced cell survival for both the wild-type and glaucomatous (OPTN-E50K) hRGCs providing a foundation for developing neuroprotection for broad range of optic neuropathies and CNS disorders irrespective of genetic mutations.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Electrophysiological properties of neurons in the intermediate thoracolumbar spinal cord mediating proprioception.</a></h4>

              
                Animals must know where their body is in relationship to their environment to move appropriately. Proprioception, the sense of limb and body position, is required to produce feedforward predictions of future movement as well as provide feedback information during movement to update the system. How proprioception is processed at the level of the spinal cord is not well understood. Most work has focused on Clarkes column (CC) neurons, a component of the dorsal spinocerebellar tract (DSCT). CC neurons receive hindlimb proprioceptive information and send it directly to the cerebellum with no axon collaterals to other neurons in the spinal cord. In contrast to CC neurons, we previously found that a subset of thoracolumbar Atoh1-lineage neurons also receives proprioceptive afferent inputs, but project locally within the spinal cord including synapsing on motor neurons. We set out to understand how CC and Atoh1-lineage neurons in the thoracolumbar spinal cord respond to electrical activity. Using in vitro acute spinal cord slices and whole-cell patch clamp, we characterized the passive and active electrical properties of CC and thoracolumbar Atoh1-lineage neurons. We find that most CC neurons increase their action potential firing frequency linearly upon increased current injection up to high frequencies likely due to a hyperpolarization-activated current (Ih). In contrast, most Atoh1-lineage neurons do not have an Ih current and therefore, their firing frequency fades with increasing current injection. Interestingly, although Atoh1-lineage neurons are classically subdivided into a contralaterally-projecting Medial and ipsilaterally-projecting Lateral population, we find no obvious electrophysiological signatures that could distinguish these spatially distinct populations. Finally, we set out to determine the organization of the inputs to CC and Atoh1-lineage neurons. In a hemisected spinal cord preparation, while recording from neurons in the lower thoracic to upper lumbar segments, we find that CC neurons receive low threshold inputs (proprioceptive or low threshold mechanoreceptor) from lumbar 2 to 4 dorsal roots, while Atoh1-lineage Medial neurons do not. This raises the possibility that Atoh1-lineage Medial neurons receive proprioceptive inputs from more local dorsal roots. Altogether, we find that CC and Atoh1-lineage neurons have distinct membrane properties and sensory input organization even though they are both reported to receive proprioceptive information and are in close proximity in lamina V-VII of the thoracolumbar spinal cord.

	<p>Central post-stroke pain (CPSP) is an intractable neuropathic pain that can occur following central nervous system injuries. Spino-thalamo-cortical pathway damage contributes to CPSP development. However, brain regions involved in CPSP are unknown and previous studies were limited to supratentorial strokes with cortical lesion involvement. We analyzed the brain metabolism changes associated with CPSP following pontine hemorrhage. Thirty-two patients with isolated pontine hemorrhage were examined; 14 had CPSP, while 18 did not. Brain glucose metabolism was evaluated using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography images. Additionally, regions revealing metabolic correlation with CPSP severity were analyzed. Patients with CPSP showed changes in the brain metabolism in the cerebral cortices and cerebellum. Compared with the control group, the CPSP group showed significant hypometabolism in the contralesional rostral anterior cingulum and ipsilesional primary motor cortex (Puncorrected &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). However, increased brain metabolism was observed in the ipsilesional cerebellum (VI) and contralesional cerebellum (lobule VIIB) (Puncorrected &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Moreover, increased pain intensity correlated with decreased metabolism in the ipsilesional supplementary motor area and contralesional angular gyrus. This study emphasizes the role of the many different areas of the cortex that are involved in affective and cognitive processing in the development of CPSP.</p>

	<p>In recent years, the potential of non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) for the therapeutic effect of post-stroke spasticity has been explored. There are various NIBS methods depending on the stimulation modality, site and parameters. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of NIBS on spasticity in patients after stroke. This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. PUBMED (MEDLINE), Web of Science, Cochrane Library and Excerpta Medica Database (EMBASE) were searched for all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published before December 2021. Two independent researchers screened relevant articles and extracted data. This meta-analysis included 14 articles, and all included articles included 18 RCT datasets. The results showed that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) (MD = &amp;amp;minus;0.40, [95% CI]: &amp;amp;minus;0.56 to &amp;amp;minus;0.25, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01) had a significant effect on improving spasticity, in which low-frequency rTMS (LF-rTMS) (MD = &amp;amp;minus;0.51, [95% CI]: &amp;amp;minus;0.78 to &amp;amp;minus;0.24, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01) and stimulation of the unaffected hemisphere (MD = &amp;amp;minus;0.58, [95% CI]: &amp;amp;minus;0.80 to &amp;amp;minus;0.36, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01) were beneficial on Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) in patients with post-stroke spasticity. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) (MD = &amp;amp;minus;0.65, [95% CI]: &amp;amp;minus;1.07 to &amp;amp;minus;0.22, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01) also had a significant impact on post-stroke rehabilitation, with anodal stimulation (MD = &amp;amp;minus;0.74, [95% CI]: &amp;amp;minus;1.35 to &amp;amp;minus;0.13, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05) being more effective in improving spasticity in patients. This meta-analysis revealed moderate evidence that NIBS reduces spasticity after stroke and may promote recovery in stroke survivors. Future studies investigating the mechanisms of NIBS in addressing spasticity are warranted to further support the clinical application of NIBS in post-stroke spasticity.</p>

                Chen et al. find that BET inactivation, by suppressing antiviral responses, enhances SARS-CoV-2 infection. This effect is phenocopied by the viral envelope (E) protein that is acetylated in cells and has evolved to antagonize the induction of the interferon response by binding and inhibiting BET proteins through their bromodomains.

                Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an auto-immune inflammatory disorder affecting the central nervous system. The cause of the disease is unknown but both genetic and environmental factors are implicated in the pathogenesis. We derived cerebral organoids from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) of healthy control subjects as well as from primary progressive MS (PPMS), secondary progressive MS (SPMS) and relapsing remitting MS (RRMS) patients to better understand the pathologic basis of the varied clinical phenotypic expressions of MS. In MS organoids, most notably in PPMS, we observed a decrease of proliferation marker Ki67 and a reduction of the SOX2+ stem cell pool associated with an increased expression of neuronal markers CTIP2 and TBR1. This dysregulation of the stem cell pool is associated with a decreased expression of the cell cycle inhibitor p21. Our findings show that the genetic background of a patient can directly alter stem cell function. This study also provides new insights on the innate cellular dysregulation in MS and identifies p21 pathway as a new potential target for therapeutic strategies in MS.

                The impact of overnutrition early in life is not restricted to the onset of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, but also affects critical brain functions related to cognition. This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between peripheral metabolic and bioenergetic changes induced by high-fat diet (HFD) and their impact on hippocampal cognitive functions in juvenile mice. To this purpose, three-week-old male C57BL/6 mice received a HFD or control diet for seven weeks, associated with two low doses of streptozotocin (STZ) or vehicle, to accelerate the metabolic dysfunction. HFD induced metabolic changes in mice, particularly related to glucose metabolism, in spite of the absence of obesity and changes in lipid profile. HFD exposure starting from weaning impaired recognition and spatial memories in mice, without inducing a depressive-like behavior. Increased immunoreactivity for GFAP and a trend towards a decrease in NeuN staining were verified in the hippocampus of HFD-fed mice. HFD caused a bioenergetic impairment in the hippocampus, characterized by a decrease in both O2 consumption related to ATP production and in the maximum respiratory capacity. The thermogenic capacity of brown adipose tissue was impaired by HFD, here verified through the absence of a decrease in O2 consumption after UCP-1 inhibition and increase in the reserve respiratory capacity. Impaired mitochondria function was also observed in the liver of HFD mice, while no changes were verified in O2 consumption in the heart of juvenile mice. These results indicate that the introduction of a HFD early in life has a detrimental impact on bioenergetic and mitochondrial function of tissues with metabolic and thermogenic activities, which is likely related to hippocampal metabolic changes and cognitive impairment.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The Intrinsic Hierarchy of Self - Converging Topography and Dynamics</a></h4>

              
                The brain can be characterized by an intrinsic hierarchy in its topography which, as recently shown for the uni-transmodal distinction of core and periphery, converges with its dynamics. Does such intrinsic hierarchical organization in both topography and dynamic also apply to the brains inner core itself and its higher-order cognitive functions like self? Applying multiple fMRI data sets, we show how the recently established three-layer topography of self (internal, external, mental) is already present during the resting state and carried over to task states including both task-specific and -unspecific effects. Moreover, the topographic hierarchy converges with corresponding dynamic changes (measured by power-law exponent, autocorrelation window, median frequency, sample entropy, complexity) during both rest and task states. Finally, analogous to the topographic hierarchy, we also demonstrate hierarchy among the different dynamic measures themselves according to background and foreground. Finally, we show task-specific- and un-specific effects in the hierarchies of both dynamics and topography. Together, we demonstrate the existence of an intrinsic topographic hierarchy of self and its convergence with dynamics.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">An action-observation network in the common marmoset identified by ultra-high field fMRI</a></h4>

              
                Thirty years have passed since the first description of neurons in Old World macaque monkeys that fire both during the execution and observation of goal-directed actions. Since then, these so-called "mirror neurons" have been shown to play important roles in understanding the actions of others, learning by imitation, and social cognition in macaques and humans. In contrast to Old World primates, an action-observation network has not yet been identified in New World primates. Here we used ultra-high field fMRI at 9.4T in awake common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) while they watched videos depicting the upper-limb of marmosets performing goal-directed (grasping food) or non-goal-directed actions. We found that the observation of goal-directed actions, compared to non-goal directed ones, activated a frontotemporoparietal network, including areas 6 and 45 in premotor and prefrontal cortices, and areas PGa-IPa, FST, and the TE complex in temporoparietal regions. These results demonstrate the existence of an evolutionarily conserved action observation network in primates that likely predates the separation of Old and New World monkeys.

                Identifying genetic variants associated with nicotine-motivated behavioral traits is an important strategy to understand the fundamental mechanisms underpinning smoking and tobacco abuse. For suitable emulation of behavioral phenotype with the full advantage of this invertebrate model, we newly established a worm model of nicotine seeking by Conditioned Cue Preference (CCP). We demonstrated that C. elegans also exhibited pivotal features of nicotine-motivated behaviors as in mammals. First, we identified the nicotine-elicited cue preference is mediated by nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in worms. Additionally, we exhibited dopamine is also required for the development of CCP. Subsequently, we identified the nAChRs subunits associated with the facilitation of nicotine preference. Accordingly, we validated human GWAS candidates associated with nicotine dependence involved in the role of those nAChR subunits. we addressed the cross-species functional validation to determine the GWAS candidate genes have authentic roles in nicotine seeking associated with tobacco abuse. The loss of function strain of CACNA2D3 orthologue, calcium voltage-gated channel auxiliary subunit alpha2delta 3, was tested for CCP. We also tested the knock-out (KO) strain of the CACNA2D2 orthologue, calcium voltage-gated channel auxiliary subunit alpha2delta 2, which is closely related to CACNA2D3 in the same family and shared the human smoking phenotypes. Our orthogonal test suggests the functional conservation of the 2{delta} subunit of calcium channel in nicotine motivated behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Replicable multivariate BWAS with moderate sample sizes</a></h4>

              
                Brain-Wide Association Studies (BWAS) have become a dominant method for linking mind and brain over the past 30 years. Univariate models test tens to hundreds of thousands of brain voxels individually, whereas multivariate models ( multivariate BWAS) integrate signals across brain regions into a predictive model. Numerous problems have been raised with univariate BWAS, including lack of power and reliability and an inability to account for pattern-level information embedded in distributed neural circuits1-3. Multivariate predictive models address many of these concerns, and offer substantial promise for delivering brain-based measures of behavioral and clinical states and traits2,3.

In their recent paper4, Marek et al. evaluated the effects of sample size on univariate and multivariate BWAS in three large-scale neuroimaging dataset and came to the general conclusion that "BWAS reproducibility requires samples with thousands of individuals". We applaud their comprehensive analysis, and we agree that (a) large samples are needed when conducting univariate BWAS of individual differences in trait measures, and (b) multivariate BWAS reveal substantially larger effects and are therefore more highly powered. However, we disagree with Marek et al.s claims that multivariate BWAS provide "inflated in-sample associations" that often fail to replicate (i.e., are underpowered), and that multivariate BWAS consequently require thousands of participants when predicting trait-level individual differences. Here we substantiate that (i) with appropriate methodology, the reported in-sample effect size inflation in multivariate BWAS can be entirely eliminated, and (ii) in most cases, multivariate BWAS effects are replicable with substantially smaller sample sizes (Figure 1).

(a) In-sample effects in multivariate BWAS are only inflated if estimates are obtained without cross-validation. (b) Cross-validation fully eliminates in-sample effect size inflation and, as a consequence, provides higher replicability. Each point in (a) and (b) corresponds to one bootstrap subsample, as in Fig. 4b of Marek et al. Dotted lines denote the threshold for p=0.05 with n=495. (c) The inflation of in-sample effect size obtained without cross-validation (red) is reduced, but does not disappear, at higher sample sizes. Conversely, cross-validated estimates (blue) are slightly pessimistic with low sample sizes and become quickly unbiased as sample size is increased. (d) Without cross-validation, in-sample effect size estimates are non-zero (r{approx}0.5, red) even when predicting permuted outcome data. Cross-validation eliminates systematic bias across all sample sizes (blue). Dashed lines in (c) and (d) denote 95% parametric confidence intervals, and shaded areas denote bootstrap and permutation-based confidence intervals. (e-f) Cross-validated analysis reveals that sufficient in-sample power (e) and out-of-sample replication probability (P(rep)) (f) can be achieved for a variety of phenotypes at low or moderate sample sizes. 80% power and P(rep) are achievable in <500 participants for half the phenotypes tested (colored bars) using the prediction algorithm in Marek et al. (top panels in (e) and (f), sample size required for 80% power or P(rep) shown). Other phenotypes require sample sizes >500 (bars with arrows). Power and P(rep) can be substantially improved with a ridge regression-based model recommended in some comparison studies10,11 (bottom panels in (e) and (f)), with 80% power and P(rep) with sample sizes as low as n=100 and n=75, respectively, when predicting cognitive ability, and sample sizes between 75 and 375 for other investigated variables, except inhibition assessed with the flanker task. (g) We estimated interactions between sample size and publication bias by computing effect size inflation (rdiscovery - rreplication) only for those bootstrap cases where prediction performance was significant (p>0.05) in the replication sample. Our analysis shows that the effect size inflation due to publication bias is modest (<10%) with <500 participants for half the phenotypes using the Marek et al. model and all phenotypes but the flanker using the ridge model.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Detection of Autism Spectrum Disorder Using Graph Representation Learning Algorithms and Deep Neural Network, Based on fMRI Signals</a></h4>

              
                In this paper, we are going to apply graph representation learning algorithms to identify autism spectrum disorder (ASD) patients within a large brain imaging dataset. Since ASD is characterized by social deficits and repetitive behavioral symptoms, it is mainly identified by brain functional connectivity patterns. Attempts to unveil the neural patterns that emerged from ASD are the essence of ASD classification. We claim that considering the connectivity patterns of the brain can be appropriately executed by graph representation learning methods. These methods can capture the whole structure of the brain, both local and global properties. The investigation is done for the brain imaging worldwide multi-site database known as ABIDE (Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange). The classifier adapted to the features embedded in graphs is a LeNet deep neural network. Among different graph representation techniques, we used AWE, Node2vec, Struct2vec, multi node2vec, and Graph2Img. The best approach was Graph2Img, in which after extracting the feature vectors representative of the brain nodes, the PCA algorithm is applied to the matrix of feature vectors. Although we could not outperform the previous 70% accuracy of 10-fold cross-validation in the identification of ASD versus control patients in the dataset, for leave-one-site-out cross-validation, we could obtain better results (our accuracy: 80%). It is evident that the effect of graph embedding methods is making the connectivity matrix more suitable for applying to a deep network.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural circuits underlying habituation of visually evoked escape behaviors in larval zebrafish</a></h4>

              
                Larval zebrafish that are exposed repeatedly to dark looming stimuli will quickly habituate to these aversive signals and cease to respond with their stereotypical escape swims. A dark looming stimulus can be separated into two independent components: one that is characterized by an overall spatial expansion, where overall luminance is maintained at the same level, and a second, that represents an overall dimming within the whole visual field in the absence of any motion energy. Using specific stimulation patterns that isolate these independent components, we first extracted the behavioral algorithms that dictate how these separate information channels interact with each other and across the two eyes during the habituation process. Concurrent brain wide imaging experiments then permitted the construction of circuit models that suggest the existence of three separate neural pathways. The first is a looming channel which responds specifically to concentrically expanding edges and relays that information to the brain stem escape network to generate directed escapes. The second is a dimming specific channel that serves to support and amplify the looming pathway. While the looming channel operates in a purely monocular fashion where stimuli are relayed exclusively to the contralateral hemisphere, dimming responses are processed in both monocular and binocular pathways. Finally, we identify a third, separate and largely monocular, dimming channel that appears to specifically inhibit escape responses when activated. We propose that, unlike the first two channels, this third channel is under strong contextual modulation and that it is primarily responsible for the incremental silencing of successive dark looming evoked escapes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The polycomb repressor complex 2 and Enhancer of Zeste 2 regulate glial reactivity and are required for the formation of Muller glia-derived progenitor cells in the retina</a></h4>

              
                EZH2 (Enhancer of Zeste 2), a key component of the Polycomb Repressor Complex 2 (PRC2), is required for the differentiation of Muller glia (MG) during retinal development. However, nothing is known about the roles of EZH2 and PRC2 in mature or damaged retinas. Herein, we investigate the expression of PRC2-related factors and roles during the formation of Muller glia-derived progenitor cells (MGPCs) in the chick and mouse retinas. In chick, EZH2, PRC2-related factors, and EZH2-activators, JARID2 and AEBP1, are dynamically expressed by MG and MGPCs in damaged retinas. Inhibition of EZH2, EED or JARID2 blocks the formation of MGPCs. Similarly, inhibition of EZH2 suppresses the proliferation of progenitors in the circumferential marginal zone. By using a combination of single cell RNA-seq and single cell ATAC-seq, we find significant changes in gene expression and chromatin access in MG with EZH2 inhibition and NMDA-treatment, and many of these genes are associated with glial and neuronal differentiation. Correlation across gene expression, chromatin access and transcription factor motif access in MG was observed for transcription factors known to covey glial identity and promote retinal development. In the mouse retina, components of the PRC2 complex are downregulated in MG in damaged retinas and inhibition of EZH2 has no effect upon the formation of neuron-like cells from Ascl1-overexpressing MG. We conclude that in the chick, but not mouse, the activity of EZH2 is required for the reprogramming of MG into MGPCs by regulating chromatin access to transcription factors associated with glial differentiation and retinal development.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Explicitly Nonlinear Dynamic Functional Network Connectivity In Resting-State fMRI Data</a></h4>

              
                Most dynamic functional connectivity in fMRI data is focused on linear correlations, and to our knowledge, no study has studied whole brain explicitly nonlinear dynamic relationships within the data. While some approaches have attempted to study overall connectivity more generally using flexible models, we are particularly interested in whether the non-linear relationships, above and beyond linear, are capturing unique information. This study thus proposes an approach to assess the explicitly nonlinear dynamic functional network connectivity derived from the relationship among independent component analysis time courses. Linear relationships were removed at each time point to evaluate, typically ignored, explicitly nonlinear dFNC using normalized mutual information. Simulations showed the proposed method accurately estimated NMI over time, even within relatively short windows of data. Results on fMRI data included 151 schizophrenia patients, and 163 healthy controls showed three unique, highly structured, mostly long-range, functional states that also showed significant group differences. This analysis identifies a higher level of explicitly nonlinear dependencies in transient connectivity within the visual network in healthy controls compared to schizophrenia patients. In particular, nonlinear relationships tend to be more widespread than linear ones. We also find highly significant differences in the relative co-occurrence of linear and explicitly nonlinear states in HC and SZ, suggesting these may be an important aspect of the disorder. Overall, this work suggests that quantifying nonlinear dependencies of dynamic functional connectivity may provide a complementary and potentially valuable tool for studying brain function by exposing relevant variation that is typically ignored.

                Social decision-making requires the integration of reward valuation and social cognition systems, both dependent on the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). How these two OFC functions interact is largely unknown. We recorded intracranial activity from the OFC of ten patients making choices in the context of different types of inequity (disadvantageous vs. advantageous). We found that high-frequency activity (70-150 HZ) encoded the amount of self-reward, consistent with previous reports. We also observed novel evidence for encoding in human OFC of the social counterparts reward as well as the type of inequity being experienced. Additionally, we find social context modulates reward encoding: depending on inequity type, reward encoding was switched on and off rapidly within electrodes, across trials. These results provide direct evidence for explicit encoding of self- and other- rewards in the human OFC, and for rapid and reversible changes in encoding schemes driven by socially relevant contexts.

                Numerous tau immunotherapies are being developed against Alzheimers disease (AD), but it has been challenging to specifically target early-stage tau aggregates using conformation-dependent antibodies. Here, we report a monoclonal antibody, APNmAb005, that recognized a conformational epitope associated with tau oligomers. In AD brain extracts, mAb005 preferentially recognized oligomeric tau in the synapse over monomeric tau in the cytosol. In the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, mAb005 immunoreactivity was strongly present in early-stage AD but surprisingly diminished in late-stage AD (Braak stage VI). mAb005 also recognized aggregates in 3R tauopathies (Picks disease) and 4R tauopathies (corticobasal degeneration and progressive supranuclear palsy), including those in astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. In rTg4510 mice (P301L tau), mAb005 immunoreactivity first appeared in distal neurites but much later in neuronal somas. Thus, the mAb005 epitope appears to be associated with early-stage oligomers of tau (esoTau) that accumulate around synapses in AD, which is also detectable in both 3R and 4R tauopathies. In cellular uptake models of tauopathy transmission, mAb005 blocked the formation of intracellular inclusions induced by incubation with rTg4510 mouse brain extracts. Long-term treatments with mAb005 in rTg4510 mice partially rescued synaptic and neuronal loss in the hippocampus without promoting overall tau clearance. Our data suggest that immunotherapies targeting esoTau enriched around synaptic sites may alleviate tau toxicity against synapses and neurons, which may be a promising treatment strategy against AD.

One Sentence SummaryA tau-conformer antibody recognizing synaptic oligomers and 3R, 4R, and mixed aggregates in humans rescues neuronal loss in mouse tauopathy models.

                Sensory cortex amplifies relevant features of external stimuli. This sensitivity and selectivity arise through the transformation of inputs by cortical circuitry. We characterize the circuit mechanisms and dynamics of cortical amplification by making large-scale simultaneous measurements of single cells in awake primates and by testing computational models. By comparing network activity in both driven and spontaneous states with models, we identify the circuit as operating in a regime of balanced amplification. Incoming inputs are strongly but transiently amplified by recurrent excitation. Inhibition acts to counterbalance this excitation by rapidly quenching responses, thereby permitting tracking of time-varying stimuli.

One-Sentence SummarySensory cortex uses balanced excitatory and inhibitory circuitry to boost weak signals while maintaining fast sensory dynamics in a changing environment.

In static study, flagplots and brain rendered kmax-core display showed the changes of hierarchical structures of voxels belonging to functional independent components (IC). In this dynamic sliding-window study, temporal progress of hierarchical structure of voxels were investigated in individuals and in sessions of an individual. kmax-core and coreness k values characterizing time-varying core voxels were visualized on animated stacked-histogram/flagplots and animated brain-rendered images. Resting-state fMRI of Human Connectome Project and of Kirby weekly revealed the slow progress and multiple abrupt state transitions of the voxels of coreness k and at the uppermost hierarchy, representing their correlative time-varying mental states in individuals and in sessions. We suggest this characteristic core voxels-IC compositions on dynamic study fingerprint the time-varying resting states of human minds.

                The cerebrovasculature plays an essential role in neurovascular and homeostatic functions in health and disease conditions. Many efforts have been made for developing vascular thrombosis methods to study vascular dysfunction in vivo, while technical challenges remain, such as accuracy and depth-selectivity to target single vessel in the cerebral cortex. Herein, we first demonstrates the evaluation and quantification of the feasibility and effects of Rose Bengal (RB)-induced photothrombosis with 720-1070 nm ultrafast lasers in raster scan. A flexible and reproducible approach is then proposed to employ a 1070 nm ultrafast laser with spiral scan for producing RB-induced occlusion, which is described as precision ultrafast laser-induced photothrombosis (PLP). Combine with two-photon microscopy imaging, this PLP displays highly precise and fast occlusion induction of various vessel types, sizes, and depths, which enhances the precision and power of the photothrombosis protocol. Overall, the PLP method provides a real-time, practical, precise, and depth-selected single-vessel photothrombosis technology in cerebral cortex with commercially available optical equipment, which is crucial for exploring brain vascular function with high spatial temporal resolution in brain.

                Studies using magnetoencephalography (MEG) have identified the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) to be an important early hub for a  parental instinct in the brain. This complements the finding from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies linking reward, emotion regulation, empathy and mentalisation networks to the  parental brain. Here, we used MEG in 43 first-time mothers listening to infant and adult cry vocalisations to investigate the link with mother-infant postpartum bonding scores and their level of sleep deprivation (assessed using both actigraphy and sleep logs). We found significant differences 800-1000ms after onset of infant compared to adult cries in source-reconstructed brain activity in areas previously linked to the parental brain. Importantly, mothers with weaker bonding scores showed decreased brain responses to infant cries in the auditory cortex, middle and superior temporal gyrus, OFC, hippocampal areas, supramarginal gyrus and inferior frontal gyrus at around 100-200ms after stimulus onset. In contrast, we did not find correlations with sleep deprivation scores. The significant changes in brain processing of an infants distress signals could be a novel marker of weaker infant bonding in new mothers and should be investigated in vulnerable populations.

                The brain interprets sensory inputs to guide behavior, but behavior disrupts sensory inputs. In primates, saccadic eye movements displace visual images on the retina and yet the brain perceives visual stability, a process called active vision. We studied whether active vision is Bayesian. Humans and monkeys reported whether an image moved during saccades. We tested whether they used prior expectations to account for sensory uncertainty in a Bayesian manner. For continuous judgments, subjects were Bayesian. For categorical judgments, they were anti-Bayesian for uncertainty due to external, image noise but Bayesian for uncertainty due to internal, motor-driven noise. A discriminative learning model explained the anti-Bayesian effect. Therefore, active vision uses both Bayesian and discriminative models depending on task requirements (continuous vs. categorical) and the source of uncertainty (image noise vs. motor-driven noise), suggesting that active perceptual mechanisms are governed by the interaction of both models.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Scene-selective brain regions respond to embedded objects of a scene</a></h4>

              
                Objects are fundamental to scene understanding. Scenes are defined by embedded objects and how we interact with them. Paradoxically, scene processing in the brain is typically discussed in contrast to object processing. Using the BOLD5000 dataset (Chang et al., 2019), we examined whether objects within a scene predicted the neural representation of scenes, as measured by fMRI in humans. Stimuli included 1,179 unique scenes across 18 semantic categories. Object composition of scenes were compared across scene exemplars in different semantic categories, and separately, in exemplars of the same category. Neural representations in scene- and object- preferring brain regions were significantly related to which objects were in a scene, with the effect at times stronger in the scene-preferring regions. The object model accounted for more variance when comparing scenes within the same semantic category to scenes from different categories. Thus, the functional role of scene-preferring regions should include the processing of objects. This suggests visual processing regions may be better characterized with respect to which processes are engaged when interacting with the stimulus category, such as processing groups of objects in scenes, or processing a single object in our foreground, rather than the stimulus category itself.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Scene-relative object motion biases depth percepts</a></h4>

              
                An important function of the visual system is to represent 3D scene structure from a sequence of 2D images projected onto the retinae. During observer translation, the relative image motion of stationary objects at different distances (motion parallax) provides potent depth information. However, if an object moves relative to the scene, this complicates the computation of depth from motion parallax since there will be an additional component of image motion related to scene-relative object motion. To correctly compute depth from motion parallax, only the component of image motion caused by self-motion should be used by the brain. Previous experimental and theoretical work on perception of depth from motion parallax has assumed that objects are stationary in the world. Thus, it is unknown whether perceived depth based on motion parallax is biased by object motion relative to the scene. Naive human subjects viewed a virtual 3D scene consisting of a ground plane and stationary background objects, while lateral self-motion was simulated by optic flow. A target object could be either stationary or moving laterally at different velocities, and subjects were asked to judge the depth of the object relative to the plane of fixation. Subjects showed a far bias when object and observer moved in the same direction, and a near bias when object and observer moved in opposite directions. This pattern of biases is expected if subjects confound image motion due to self-motion with that due to scene-relative object motion. These biases were large when the object was viewed monocularly, and were greatly reduced, but not eliminated, when binocular disparity cues were provided. Our findings establish that scene-relative object motion can confound perceptual judgements of depth during self-motion.

                Although touch and itch are coded by distinct neuronal populations, light touch also provokes itch in the presence of exogenous pruritogens, resulting in a phenomenon called alloknesis. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the initiation of pruritogen-induced mechanical itch sensitization are poorly understood. Here we show that intradermal injections of histamine or chloroquine (CQ) provoke alloknesis through activation of TRPV1- and MrgprA3-expressing prurioceptors, and functional ablation of these neurons reverses pruritogen-induced alloknesis. Moreover, genetic ablation of mechanosensitive Piezo2 channel function from MrgprA3-expressing prurioceptors also dampens pruritogen-induced alloknesis. Mechanistically, histamine and CQ sensitize Piezo2 channel function through activation of the PLC-PKC{delta} signaling. Collectively, our data uncovered a TRPV1+/MrgprA3+ prurioceptor-Piezo2 signaling axis in the initiation of pruritogen-induced mechanical itch sensitization in the skin.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Radiochemical Synthesis and Evaluation of 3-methyl-4-aminopyridine in Rodents and Non-Human Primates for Imaging Potassium Channels in the CNS</a></h4>

              
                Demyelination, the loss of the insulating sheath of neurons, causes failed or slowed neuronal conduction and contributes to the neurological symptoms in multiple sclerosis, traumatic brain and spinal cord injuries, stroke, and dementia. In demyelinated neurons, the axonal potassium channels Kv1.1 and Kv1.2, normally under the myelin sheath, become exposed and upregulated. Imaging these channels using positron emission tomography can provide valuable information for disease diagnosis and monitoring. Here, we describe the novel tracer for Kv1 channels [11C]3-methyl-4-aminopyridine ([11C]3Me4AP). [11C]3Me4AP was efficiently synthesized via Pd(0)-Cu(I) co-mediated Stille cross-coupling of a stannyl precursor containing a free amino group. Evaluation of its imaging properties in rats and nonhuman primates showed that [11C]3Me4AP has moderate brain permeability and slow kinetics. Additional evaluation in monkeys showed that the tracer is metabolically stable and that regional brain time-activity curves can be accurately modeled by a 1-tissue compartment model. Compared to the related tracers [18F]3-fluoro-4-aminopyridine ([18F]3F4AP) and [11C]3-methoxy-4-aminopyridine ([11C]3MeO4AP), [11C]3Me4AP shows lower initial brain uptake indicating reduced permeability to the blood-brain-barrier and slower kinetics suggesting higher binding affinity consistent with in vitro studies. While the slow kinetics and strong binding affinity are favorable attributes for its potential use as a therapeutic drug, our results suggest that [11C]3Me4AP is not as promising as its predecessors for PET imaging of the brain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Acute inhibition of the STA3 signaling pathway during epileptogenesis prevent GABAergic cells loss and imprinting of epileptic state: an in-vitro proof</a></h4>

              
                Epilepsy, the condition of recurrent unprovoked seizures resulting from a wide variety of causes, is one of the worlds most prominent brain syndrome. Seizures which are an expression of neuronal network dysfunction occur in a positive feedback loop of concomitant factors where seizures generate more seizures, including also neuro-inflammatory responses. Among other pathways involved in inflammatory responses, the JAK/STAT signaling pathway has been proposed to prevent epilepsy. In this work we tested on a model of temporal lobe epilepsy in-vitro, the hypothesis that acute inhibition of STAT3-phosphorylation - during epileptogenesis, can prevent structural damages in the hippocampal circuits, and the imprinting both of neural epileptic activity and inflammatory glial states. We performed calcium imaging of spontaneous circuits dynamics in organotypic hippocampal slices previously exposed to hyper-excitable conditions through the blockage of GABAergic synaptic transmission. Epileptogenic conditions lead to imprinted epileptic dynamics in the circuits in terms of higher frequency of neuronal firing and circuits synchronizations, higher correlated activity in neuronal pairs and decreased complexity in synchronization patterns. Acute inhibition of the STAT3-phosphorylation during epileptogenesis, prevented the imprinting of epileptic activity patterns, general cell loss, GABAergic cells loss and the persistence of inflammatory reactive glial states. This work provides further evidence that inhibiting the STAT3 signaling pathway under epileptogenesis can prevent patho-topological reorganization of neuro-glial circuits.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Thermal Pain and Detection Threshold Modulation in Augmented Reality</a></h4>

              
                Augmented Reality (AR) overlays computer-generated visual, auditory or other sensory information on the real world. Due to recent advancements in AR it can be difficult for the user to differentiate between sensory information coming from real and virtual objects, leading to interesting phenomena. For example, an AR experience in which users can experience their own hands in flames has been shown to elicit heat illusions on the affected hands. In this study, we investigate the potential that AR has for top-down modulation of pain and thermal perception. We assessed thermal pain and detection thresholds on the participant's right hand when they experienced that hand covered in virtual flames in AR. We compared that experience to a baseline condition with no additional stimuli as well to a control condition that sees the hand covered by unrealistic blue flames to compensate the distraction factor. We found that experiencing a burning hand in AR induced analgesic and hyperalgesic effects as participants began to feel heat related pain on lower temperatures and cold related pain on higher temperatures. That experience also significantly changed the lowest temperature at which participants started perceiving warmth. These results demonstrate that pain and thermal perception can be manipulated by altering the perception of our body in AR.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Kiaa1024L/Minar2 is essential for hearing by regulating cholesterol distribution in hair bundles</a></h4>

              
                Unbiased genetic screens implicated a number of uncharacterized genes in hearing loss, suggesting some biological processes required for auditory function remain unexplored. Loss of Kiaa1024L/Minar2, a previously understudied gene, caused deafness in mice, but how it functioned in hearing was unclear. Here we show that disruption of kiaa1024L/minar2 causes hearing loss in the zebrafish. Defects in mechanotransduction, longer and thinner hair bundles, and enlarged apical lysosomes in hair cells are observed in kiaa1024L/minar2 mutant. In cultured cells, Kiaa1024L/Minar2 is mainly localized to lysosomes and its overexpression recruits cholesterol and increases cholesterol labeling. Strikingly, an accessible pool of cholesterol is highly enriched in the hair bundle membrane, and loss of kiaa1024L/minar2 reduces cholesterol localization to the hair bundles. Decreasing cholesterol levels aggravates, while increasing cholesterol levels rescues hair cell defects in kiaa1024L/minar2 mutant. Therefore cholesterol plays an essential role in the hair bundles, and Kiaa1024L/Minar2 regulates cholesterol distribution and homeostasis to ensure normal hearing.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Automatically annotated motion tracking identifies a distinct social behavioral profile following chronic social defeat stress</a></h4>

              
                Severe stress exposure is a global problem with long-lasting negative behavioral and physiological consequences, which increases the risk of stress-related disorders such as major depressive disorder (MDD). An essential characteristic of MDD is the impairment of social functioning and lack of social motivation. Chronic social defeat stress is an established animal model for MDD research, which induces a cascade of physiological and social behavioral changes. The current developments of markerless pose estimation tools allow for more complex and socially relevant behavioral tests, but the application of these tools to social behavior remains to be explored. Here, we introduce the open-source tool DeepOF to investigate the individual and social behavioral profile in mice by providing supervised and unsupervised pipelines using DeepLabCut-annotated pose estimation data. The supervised pipeline relies on pre-trained classifiers to detect defined traits for both single and dyadic animal behaviors. Subsequently, the unsupervised pipeline explores the behavioral repertoire of the animals without label priming, which has the potential of pointing towards previously unrecognized motion motifs that are systematically different across conditions. We here provide evidence that the DeepOF supervised and unsupervised pipelines detect a distinct stress-induced social behavioral pattern, which was particularly observed at the beginning of a novel social encounter. The stress-induced social behavior shows a state of arousal that fades with time due to habituation. In addition, while the classical social avoidance task does identify the stress-induced social behavioral differences, both DeepOF behavioral pipelines provide a clearer and more detailed profile. DeepOF aims to facilitate reproducibility and unification of behavioral classification of social behavior by providing an open-source tool, which can significantly advance the study of rodent individual and social behavior, thereby enabling novel biological insights and subsequent drug development for psychiatric disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Binge alcohol drinking alters the differential control of cholinergic interneurons over nucleus accumbens D1 and D2 medium spiny neurons</a></h4>

              
                Background: Ventral striatal cholinergic interneurons (ChIs) play a central role in basal ganglia function by regulating associative learning and reward processing. In the nucleus accumbens (NAc), ChIs regulate glutamatergic, dopaminergic, and GABAergic neurotransmission. However, it is unclear how ChIs orchestrate the control of these neurotransmitters to determine the excitability of medium spiny neurons (MSNs) expressing either dopamine D1 or D2 receptors. Additionally, the effects of binge alcohol drinking on ChIs-mediated modulation of glutamatergic synaptic transmission in NAc MSNs are also undefined. Methods: We optogenetically stimulated ChIs while recording evoked and spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs) in D1- and D2-MSN of ChAT.ChR2.eYFPxDrd1.tdtomato mice. To determine the effect of ChIs on mouse behavior and alcohol consumption, we implanted ChAT.ChR2.eYFP mice with fiber optic cannulas and stimulated ChIs while mice were allowed to drink 20% alcohol using the binge alcohol drinking-in-the-dark (DID) paradigm. Results: We demonstrated that NAc ChIs decrease the frequency of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs) in both D1- and D2-MSNs. While inhibition of D1-MSNs glutamate release by ChIs depends on dopamine release, that of D2-MSNs results from a direct interactions between ChIs and glutamatergic terminals. Interestingly, after two weeks of binge alcohol drinking, the effect of ChIs stimulation on glutamate release was reversed in D1-MSNs, while its effect on D2-MSNs remained unchanged. Finally, in vivo optogenetic stimulation of NAc ChIs significantly increased alcohol consumption. Conclusions: These results identify ChIs as a key target for the regulation of NAc circuitry and as a potential treatment of alcohol addiction.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Postsynaptic GluA3 subunits are required for the appropriate assembly of AMPA receptor GluA2 and GluA4 subunits on mammalian cochlear afferent synapses and for presynaptic ribbon modiolar-pillar morphological distinctions</a></h4>

              
                The encoding of acoustic signals in the cochlea depends on -amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4- isoxazole propionic acid receptors (AMPARs), but relatively little is known about their reliance on specific pore-forming subunits. With 5-week-old male GluA3KO mice, we determined cochlear function, synapse ultrastructure, and AMPAR subunit molecular anatomy at ribbon synapses between inner hair cells (IHCs) and spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs). GluA3KO and wild-type (GluA3WT) mice reared in ambient sound pressure level (SPL) of 55-75 dB had similar ABR thresholds, wave-1 amplitudes, and latencies. Ultrastructurally, the IHC modiolar-pillar differences in presynaptic ribbon size and shape, and synaptic vesicle size seen in GluA3WT were diminished or reversed in GluA3KO. The quantity of paired synapses (presynaptic ribbons juxtaposed with postsynaptic GluA2 and GluA4) was similar, however, GluA2-lacking synapses (ribbons paired with GluA4 but not GluA2) were observed only in GluA3KO. SGNs of GluA3KO mice had AMPAR arrays of smaller overall volume, containing less GluA2 and greater GluA4 immunofluorescence intensity relative to GluA3WT (3-fold difference in mean GluA4:GluA2 ratio). The expected modiolar-pillar gradient in ribbon volume was observed in IHCs of GluA3WT but not GluA3KO. Unexpected modiolar-pillar gradients in GluA2 and GluA4 volume were present in GluA3KO. GluA3 is essential to the morphology and molecular composition of IHC-ribbon synapses. We propose the hearing loss seen in older male GluA3KO mice results from progressive synaptopathy evident in 5-week-old mice as increased abundance of GluA2-lacking, GluA4 monomeric, Ca2+- permeable AMPARs.

                Representation of the context in which events occur is essential for episodic memory. Yet context is also important for other cognitive processes including, for example, making decisions, sequencing behavior, and associative learning. The rodent postrhinal cortex and its primate homolog, the parahippocampal cortex, are thought to preferentially process visuospatial information in order to represent the spatial features of contexts and scenes. An open question, however, is whether the postrhinal cortex is also involved in representing non-spatial contexts. Here, we used electrophysiology in behaving rats to show that postrhinal contextual representations extend to the non-spatial domain. Based on the pattern of results, we suggest that postrhinal representations of context, whether spatial or nonspatial, behave like occasion setters by modulating the meaning of other items in the environment.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Pop-in: the inversion of pop-out for a feature dimension during visual search in area V4 of the monkey cortex</a></h4>

              
                During visual search, it is important to reduce the interference of distracting objects in the scene. The neuronal responses elicited by the search target stimulus are typically enhanced. However, it is equally important to suppress the representations of distracting stimuli, especially if they are salient and capture attention. We trained monkeys to make an eye movement to a unique 'pop-out' shape stimulus among an array of distracting stimuli. One of these distractors had a salient color that varied across trials and differed from the color of the other stimuli, causing it to also pop-out. The monkeys were able to select the pop-out shape target with high accuracy and actively avoided the pop-out color distractor. This behavioral pattern was reflected in the activity of neurons in area V4. Responses to the shape targets were enhanced, while the activity evoked by the pop-out color distractor was only briefly enhanced, directly followed by a sustained period of pronounced suppression. These behavioral and neuronal results demonstrate a cortical selection mechanism that rapidly inverts a pop-out signal to 'pop-in' for an entire feature dimension thereby facilitating goal-directed visual search in the presence of salient distractors.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Penetratin inhibits α-synuclein fibrillation and improves locomotor functions in mice model of Parkinsons disease</a></h4>

              
                Parkinsons disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease. The presence of lewy bodies, primarily consisting of -synuclein (-syn) aggregates is one of the common features seen in the substantia nigra region of the brain in PD patients. The disease remains incurable and only symptomatic relief is available. We screened various cell-penetrating peptides and reveal that penetratin is a potent inhibitor of -syn aggregation in-vitro, and significantly improved locomotor coordination in mice models of PD in-vivo. The peptide inhibits -syn aggregation in vitro as well as in yeast, and C.elegans models. We further made a cyclic derivative of penetratin by disulfide coupling of N- and C-terminal cysteine residues. Both penetratin and its cyclized derivative interact with -syn. NMR studies show that both linear as well as cyclic derivative interact at the acidic C-terminal tail of the protein. Similar to penetratin, its cyclic derivative inhibited -syn aggregation in the C.elegans model of Parkinsons disease, and also improved worm motility. Molecular Dynamics studies show that penetratin interacts with -synuclein and prevents its conformational transition from disordered into {beta}-sheet rich structure. The therapeutic efficacy of penetratin was further confirmed in a transgenic mice model of the disease, wherein penetratin treatment over a period of 90 days improved locomotor coordination, and halted disease progression. Overall, the present work provides a potent therapeutic agent that could be further explored in the management of PD.
