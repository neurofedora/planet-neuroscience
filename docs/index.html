                arXiv:2511.00013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces a novel method for predicting cognitive age using psychophysiological tests. To determine cognitive age, subjects were asked to complete a series of psychological tests measuring various cognitive functions, including reaction time and cognitive conflict, short-term memory, verbal functions, and color and spatial perception. Based on the tests completed, the average completion time, proportion of correct answers, average absolute delta of the color campimetry test, number of guessed words in the M\"unsterberg matrix, and other parameters were calculated for each subject. The obtained characteristics of the subjects were preprocessed and used to train a machine learning algorithm implementing a regression task for predicting a person's cognitive age. These findings contribute to the field of remote screening using mobile devices for human health for diagnosing and monitoring cognitive aging.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01784">Variational Representational Similarity Analysis (vRSA) for M/EEG</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2511.01784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces variational representational similarity analysis RSA (vRSA) for electromagnetic recordings of neural responses (e.g., EEG, MEG, ECoG or LFP). Variational RSA is a Bayesian approach for testing whether the similarity of stimuli or experimental conditions is expressed in univariate or multivariate neural recordings. Extending an approach previously introduced in the context of functional MRI, vRSA decomposes the condition-by-condition data covariance matrix into hypothesised effects and observation noise, thereby casting RSA as a covariance component estimation problem. In this context, peristimulus time may be treated as an experimental factor, enabling one to test for the probability that different experimental effects are expressed in data at different times. Variational Bayesian methods are used for model estimation and model comparison, which confer a number of advantages over classical approaches, including statistically efficient hypothesis testing, quantification of uncertainty using Bayesian credible intervals and computational efficiency. After introducing the theory, we provide a worked example using openly available EEG data. Software functions implementing vRSA for the SPM software package accompany this paper, together with exemplar analysis scripts.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00745">High-Power Dual-Channel Field Chamber for High-Frequency Magnetic Neuromodulation</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2511.00745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several novel methods, including magnetogenetics and magnetoelectric stimulation, use high frequency alternating magnetic fields to precisely manipulate neural activity. To quantify the behavioral effects of such interventions in a freely moving mouse, we developed a dual-channel magnetic chamber, specifically designed for rate-sensitive magnetothermal-genetic stimulation, and adaptable for other uses of alternating magnetic fields. Through an optimized coil design, the system allows independent control of two spatially orthogonal uniform magnetic fields delivered at different frequencies within a 10 cm x 10 cm x 6 cm chamber. The two channels have nominal frequencies of 50 and 550 kHz with peak magnetic field strengths of 88 and 12.5 mT, achieved with resonant coil drives having peak voltages of 1.6 and 1.8 kV and currents of 1.0 and 0.26 kA, respectively. Additionally, a liquid cooling system enables magnetic field generation for second-level duration, and an observation port and camera allow video capture of the animal's behavior within the chamber. The system generates high-amplitude magnetic fields across two widely separated frequency channels with negligible interference (< 1%). Relatively uniform magnetic field distribution (+/-10% across 94% of the chamber volume) is maintained throughout the chamber, and temperature increase of the inner side of the coil enclosure during the operation is limited to < 0.35 {\deg}C/s to ensure in vivo safety. Using cobalt-doped and undoped iron oxide nanoparticles, we demonstrate channel-specific heating rates of 3.5 {\deg}C/s and 1.5 {\deg}C/s, respectively, validating frequency-selectivity. Both channels can run continuously for four seconds stably.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04525">Augmenting learning in neuro-embodied systems through neurobiological first principles</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2407.04525v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent progress in artificial intelligence (AI) has been driven by insights from physics and neuroscience, particularly through the development of artificial neural networks (ANNs) capable of complex cognitive tasks such as vision and language processing. Despite these advances, they struggle with continual learning, adaptable knowledge transfer, robustness, and resource efficiency -- capabilities that biological systems handle seamlessly. Specifically, neuromorphic systems and artificial neural networks often overlook two key biophysical properties of neural circuits: neuronal diversity and cell-specific neuromodulation. These mechanisms, essential for regulating dynamic learning across brain scales, allow neuromodulators to introduce degeneracy in biological neural networks, ensuring stability and adaptability under changing conditions. In this article, we summarize recent bioinspired models, learning rules, and architectures, and propose a framework for augmenting ANNs, which has the potential to bridge the gap between neuroscience and AI through neurobiological first principles. Our proposed dual-framework approach leverages spiking neural networks to emulate diverse spiking behaviors and dendritic compartmental dynamics, thereby simulating the morphological and functional diversity of neuronal computations. Finally, we outline how integrating these biophysical principles into task-driven spiking neural networks and neuromorphic systems provides scalable solutions for continual learning, adaptability, robustness, and resource-efficiency. Additionally, this approach will not only provide insights into how emergent behaviors arise in neural networks but also catalyze the development of more efficient, reliable, and intelligent neuromorphic systems and robotic agents.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03385">From Epilepsy Seizures Classification to Detection: A Deep Learning-based Approach for Raw EEG Signals</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.03385v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Epilepsy represents the most prevalent neurological disease in the world. One-third of people suffering from mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) exhibit drug resistance, urging the need to develop new treatments. A key part in anti-seizure medication (ASM) development is the capability of detecting and quantifying epileptic seizures occurring in electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, which is crucial for treatment efficacy evaluation. In this study, we introduced a seizure detection pipeline based on deep learning models applied to raw EEG signals. This pipeline integrates: a new pre-processing technique which segments continuous raw EEG signals without prior distinction between seizure and seizure-free activities; a post-processing algorithm developed to reassemble EEG segments and allow the identification of seizures start/end; and finally, a new evaluation procedure based on a strict seizure events comparison between predicted and real labels. Models training have been performed using a data splitting strategy which addresses the potential for data leakage. We demonstrated the fundamental differences between a seizure classification and a seizure detection task and showed the differences in performance between the two tasks. Finally, we demonstrated the generalization capabilities across species of our best architecture, combining a Convolutional Neural Network and a Transformer encoder. The model was trained on animal EEGs and tested on human EEGs with a F1-score of 93% on a balanced Bonn dataset.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25943">InputDSA: Demixing then Comparing Recurrent and Externally Driven Dynamics</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.25943v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In control problems and basic scientific modeling, it is important to compare observations with dynamical simulations. For example, comparing two neural systems can shed light on the nature of emergent computations in the brain and deep neural networks. Recently, Ostrow et al. (2023) introduced Dynamical Similarity Analysis (DSA), a method to measure the similarity of two systems based on their recurrent dynamics rather than geometry or topology. However, DSA does not consider how inputs affect the dynamics, meaning that two similar systems, if driven differently, may be classified as different. Because real-world dynamical systems are rarely autonomous, it is important to account for the effects of input drive. To this end, we introduce a novel metric for comparing both intrinsic (recurrent) and input-driven dynamics, called InputDSA (iDSA). InputDSA extends the DSA framework by estimating and comparing both input and intrinsic dynamic operators using a variant of Dynamic Mode Decomposition with control (DMDc) based on subspace identification. We demonstrate that InputDSA can successfully compare partially observed, input-driven systems from noisy data. We show that when the true inputs are unknown, surrogate inputs can be substituted without a major deterioration in similarity estimates. We apply InputDSA on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) trained with Deep Reinforcement Learning, identifying that high-performing networks are dynamically similar to one another, while low-performing networks are more diverse. Lastly, we apply InputDSA to neural data recorded from rats performing a cognitive task, demonstrating that it identifies a transition from input-driven evidence accumulation to intrinsically-driven decision-making. Our work demonstrates that InputDSA is a robust and efficient method for comparing intrinsic dynamics and the effect of external input on dynamical systems.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15542">SpikeFit: Towards Optimal Deployment of Spiking Networks on Neuromorphic Hardware</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.15542v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces SpikeFit, a novel training method for Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) that enables efficient inference on neuromorphic hardware, considering all its stringent requirements: the number of neurons and synapses that can fit on a single device, and lower bit-width representations (e.g., 4-bit, 8-bit). Unlike conventional compressing approaches that address only a subset of these requirements (limited numerical precision and limited number of neurons in the network), SpikeFit treats the allowed weights' discrete values themselves as learnable parameters co-optimized with the model, allowing for optimal Clusterization-Aware Training (CAT) of the model's weights at low precision (2-, 4-, or 8-bit) which results in higher network compression efficiency, as well as limiting the number of unique synaptic connections to a value required by neuromorphic processor. This joint optimization allows SpikeFit to find a discrete weight set aligned with hardware constraints, enabling the most complete deployment across a broader range of neuromorphic processors than existing methods of SNN compression support. Moreover, SpikeFit introduces a new hardware-friendly Fisher Spike Contribution (FSC) pruning method showing the state-of-the-art performance. We demonstrate that for spiking neural networks constrained to only four unique synaptic weight values (M = 4), our SpikeFit method not only outperforms state-of-the-art SNNs compression methods and conventional baselines combining extreme quantization schemes and clustering algorithms, but also meets a wider range of neuromorphic hardware requirements and provides the lowest energy use in experiments.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00042">Bio-Inspired Neuron Synapse Optimization for Adaptive Learning and Smart Decision-Making</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2511.00042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: Optimization challenges in science, engineering, and real-world applications often involve complex, high-dimensional, and multimodal search spaces. Traditional optimization methods frequently struggle with local optima entrapment, slow convergence, and inefficiency in large-scale environments. This study aims to address these limitations by proposing a novel optimization algorithm inspired by neural mechanisms. Design/methodology/approach: The paper introduces Neuron Synapse Optimization (NSO), a new metaheuristic algorithm inspired by neural interactions. NSO features key innovations such as fitness-based synaptic weight updates to improve search influence, adaptive pruning to minimize computational overhead, and dual guidance from global and local best solutions to balance exploration and exploitation. The algorithm was benchmarked against popular metaheuristics and the recently published Hippopotamus Optimization Algorithm (HOA) using the CEC 2014 test suite, encompassing unimodal, multimodal, and composition function landscapes. Findings: Benchmark results reveal that NSO consistently outperforms HOA and other major algorithms in terms of convergence speed, robustness, and scalability. NSO demonstrates superior adaptability and efficiency, particularly in complex, high-dimensional search spaces. Originality: NSO introduces a unique blend of neural-inspired mechanisms with dynamic resource allocation, setting it apart from existing algorithms. Its innovative design enhances search performance while reducing computational cost. With promising applications in technology, healthcare, data science, and engineering, NSO paves the way for future research into dynamic and multi-objective optimization, machine learning hyperparameter tuning, and real-world engineering design problems.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00634">Node Preservation and its Effect on Crossover in Cartesian Genetic Programming</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2511.00634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While crossover is a critical and often indispensable component in other forms of Genetic Programming, such as Linear- and Tree-based, it has consistently been claimed that it deteriorates search performance in CGP. As a result, a mutation-alone $(1+\lambda)$ evolutionary strategy has become the canonical approach for CGP. Although several operators have been developed that demonstrate an increased performance over the canonical method, a general solution to the problem is still lacking. In this paper, we compare basic crossover methods, namely one-point and uniform, to variants in which nodes are ``preserved,'' including the subgraph crossover developed by Roman Kalkreuth, the difference being that when ``node preservation'' is active, crossover is not allowed to break apart instructions. We also compare a node mutation operator to the traditional point mutation; the former simply replaces an entire node with a new one. We find that node preservation in both mutation and crossover improves search using symbolic regression benchmark problems, moving the field towards a general solution to CGP crossover.

                arXiv:2511.00732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are a promising, energy-efficient alternative to standard Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and are particularly well-suited to spatio-temporal tasks such as keyword spotting and video classification. However, SNNs have a much lower arithmetic intensity than ANNs and are therefore not well-matched to standard accelerators like GPUs and TPUs. Field Programmable Gate Arrays(FPGAs) are designed for such memory-bound workloads and here we develop a novel, fully-programmable RISC-V-based system-on-chip (FeNN-DMA), tailored to simulating SNNs on modern UltraScale+ FPGAs. We show that FeNN-DMA has comparable resource usage and energy requirements to state-of-the-art fixed-function SNN accelerators, yet it is capable of simulating much larger and more complex models. Using this functionality, we demonstrate state-of-the-art classification accuracy on the Spiking Heidelberg Digits and Neuromorphic MNIST tasks.

                arXiv:2511.00750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bayesian optimisation (BO) is a surrogate-based optimisation technique that efficiently solves expensive black-box functions with small evaluation budgets. Recent studies consider trust regions to improve the scalability of BO approaches when the problem space scales to more dimensions. Motivated by this research, we explore the effectiveness of trust region-based BO algorithms for diversity optimisation in different dimensional black box problems. We propose diversity optimisation approaches extending TuRBO1, which is the first BO method that uses a trust region-based approach for scalability. We extend TuRBO1 as divTuRBO1, which finds an optimal solution while maintaining a given distance threshold relative to a reference solution set. We propose two approaches to find diverse solutions for black-box functions by combining divTuRBO1 runs in a sequential and an interleaving fashion. We conduct experimental investigations on the proposed algorithms and compare their performance with that of the baseline method, ROBOT (rank-ordered Bayesian optimisation with trust regions). We evaluate proposed algorithms on benchmark functions with dimensions 2 to 20. Experimental investigations demonstrate that the proposed methods perform well, particularly in larger dimensions, even with a limited evaluation budget.

                arXiv:2511.00762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of managing perishable inventory under multiple sources of uncertainty, including stochastic demand, unreliable supplier fulfillment, and probabilistic product shelf life. We develop a discrete-event simulation environment to compare two optimization strategies for this multi-item, multi-supplier problem. The first strategy optimizes uniform classic policies (e.g., Constant Order and Base Stock) by tuning their parameters globally, complemented by a direct search to select the best-fitting suppliers for the integrated problem. The second approach is a hyper-heuristic approach, driven by metaheuristics such as a Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). This framework constructs a composite policy by automating the selection of the heuristic type, its parameters, and the sourcing suppliers on an item-by-item basis. Computational results from twelve distinct instances demonstrate that the hyper-heuristic framework consistently identifies superior policies, with GA and EGA exhibiting the best overall performance. Our primary contribution is verifying that this item-level policy construction yields significant performance gains over simpler global policies, thereby justifying the associated computational cost.

Abstract: Synaptic delay has attracted significant attention in neural network dynamics for integrating and processing complex spatiotemporal information. This paper introduces a high-throughput Spiking Neural Network (SNN) processor that supports synaptic delay-based emulation for edge applications. The processor leverages a multicore pipelined architecture with parallel compute engines, capable of real-time processing of the computational load associated with synaptic delays. We develop a SoC prototype of the proposed processor on PYNQ Z2 FPGA platform and evaluate its performance using the Spiking Heidelberg Digits (SHD) benchmark for low-power keyword spotting tasks. The processor achieves 93.4% accuracy in deployment and an average throughput of 104 samples/sec at a typical operating frequency of 125 MHz and 282 mW power consumption.

                arXiv:2511.01632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biological neural networks exist in physical space where distance determines communication delays: a fundamental space-time coupling absent in most artificial neural networks. While recent work has separately explored spatial embeddings and learnable synaptic delays in spiking neural networks, we unify these approaches through a novel neuron position learning algorithm where delays relate to the Euclidean distances between neurons. We derive gradients with respect to neuron positions and demonstrate that this biologically-motivated constraint acts as an inductive bias: networks trained on temporal classification tasks spontaneously self-organize into local, small-world topologies with modular structure emerging under distance-dependent connection costs. Remarkably, we observe unprompted functional specialization aligned with spatial clustering without explictly enforcing it. These findings lay the groundwork for networks in which space and time are intrinsically coupled, offering new avenues for mechanistic interpretability, biologically inspired modelling, and efficient implementations.

                arXiv:2511.00369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Achieving both accurate and interpretable classification of motor imagery EEG remains a key challenge in brain computer interface (BCI) research. This paper compares a transparent fuzzy reasoning approach (ANFIS-FBCSP-PSO) with a deep learning benchmark (EEGNet) using the BCI Competition IV-2a dataset. The ANFIS pipeline combines filter bank common spatial pattern feature extraction with fuzzy IF-THEN rules optimized via particle swarm optimization, while EEGNet learns hierarchical spatial temporal representations directly from raw EEG data. In within-subject experiments, the fuzzy neural model performed better (68.58 percent +/- 13.76 percent accuracy, kappa = 58.04 percent +/- 18.43), while in cross-subject (LOSO) tests, the deep model exhibited stronger generalization (68.20 percent +/- 12.13 percent accuracy, kappa = 57.33 percent +/- 16.22). The study provides practical guidance for selecting MI-BCI systems according to design goals: interpretability or robustness across users. Future investigations into transformer based and hybrid neuro symbolic frameworks are expected to advance transparent EEG decoding.

                arXiv:2511.00529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Improvisation-the art of spontaneous creation that unfolds moment-to-moment without a scripted outcome-requires practitioners to continuously sense, adapt, and create anew. It is a fundamental mode of human creativity spanning music, dance, and everyday life. The open-ended nature of improvisation produces a stream of novel, unrepeatable moments-an aspect highly valued in artistic creativity. In parallel, open-endedness (OE)-a system's capacity for unbounded novelty and endless "interestingness"-is exemplified in natural or cultural evolution and has been considered "the last grand challenge" in artificial life (ALife). The rise of generative AI now raises the question in computational creativity (CC) research: What makes a "good" improvisation for AI? Can AI learn to improvise in a genuinely open-ended way? In this work-in-progress paper, we report insights from in-depth interviews with 6 experts in improvisation across dance, music, and contact improvisation. We draw systemic connections between human improvisational arts and the design of future experiential AI agents that could improvise alone or alongside humans-or even with other AI agents-embodying qualities of improvisation drawn from practice: active listening (umwelt and awareness), being in the time (mindfulness and ephemerality), embracing the unknown (source of randomness and serendipity), non-judgmental flow (acceptance and dynamical stability, balancing structure and surprise (unpredictable criticality at edge of chaos), imaginative metaphor (synaesthesia and planning), empathy, trust, boundary, and care (mutual theory of mind), and playfulness and intrinsic motivation (maintaining interestingness).

Abstract: Eigenvalue problems have a distinctive forward-inverse structure and are fundamental to characterizing a system's thermal response, stability, and natural modes. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) offer a mesh-free alternative for solving such problems but are often orders of magnitude slower than classical numerical schemes. In this paper, we introduce a reformulated PINN approach that casts the search for eigenpairs as a biconvex optimization problem, enabling fast and provably convergent alternating convex search (ACS) over eigenvalues and eigenfunctions using analytically optimal updates. Numerical experiments show that PINN-ACS attains high accuracy with convergence speeds up to 500$\times$ faster than gradient-based PINN training. We release our codes at https://github.com/NeurIPS-ML4PS-2025/PINN_ACS_CODES.

                arXiv:2511.01254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformers have become state-of-the-art (SOTA) for time-series classification, with models like PatchTST demonstrating exceptional performance. These models rely on patching the time series and learning relationships between raw temporal data blocks. We argue that this approach is blind to critical, non-obvious high-frequency information that is complementary to the temporal dynamics. In this letter, we propose Hi-WaveTST, a novel Hybrid architecture that augments the original temporal patch with a learnable, High-Frequency wavelet feature stream. Our wavelet stream uses a deep Wavelet Packet Decomposition (WPD) on each patch and extracts features using a learnable Generalized Mean (GeM) pooling layer. On the UCI-HAR benchmark dataset, our hybrid model achieves a mean accuracy of 93.38 percent plus-minus 0.0043, significantly outperforming the SOTA PatchTST baseline (92.59 percent plus-minus 0.0039). A comprehensive ablation study proves that every component of our design-the hybrid architecture, the deep high-frequency wavelet decomposition, and the learnable GeM pooling-is essential for this state-of-the-art performance.

                arXiv:2511.01553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI systems on edge devices face a critical challenge in open-world environments: adapting when data distributions shift and novel classes emerge. While offline training dominates current paradigms, online continual learning (OCL)--where models learn incrementally from non-stationary streams without catastrophic forgetting--remains challenging in power-constrained settings. We present a neuromorphic solution called CLP-SNN: a spiking neural network architecture for Continually Learning Prototypes and its implementation on Intel's Loihi 2 chip. Our approach introduces three innovations: (1) event-driven and spatiotemporally sparse local learning, (2) a self-normalizing three-factor learning rule maintaining weight normalization, and (3) integrated neurogenesis and metaplasticity for capacity expansion and forgetting mitigation. On OpenLORIS few-shot learning experiments, CLP-SNN achieves accuracy competitive with replay methods while being rehearsal-free. CLP-SNN delivers transformative efficiency gains: 70\times faster (0.33ms vs 23.2ms), and 5,600\times more energy efficient (0.05mJ vs 281mJ) than the best alternative OCL on edge GPU. This demonstrates that co-designed brain-inspired algorithms and neuromorphic hardware can break traditional accuracy-efficiency trade-offs for future edge AI systems.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01838">Efficient Vector Symbolic Architectures from Histogram Recovery</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2511.01838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vector symbolic architectures (VSAs) are a family of information representation techniques which enable composition, i.e., creating complex information structures from atomic vectors via binding and superposition, and have recently found wide ranging applications in various neurosymbolic artificial intelligence (AI) systems. Recently, Raviv proposed the use of random linear codes in VSAs, suggesting that their subcode structure enables efficient binding, while preserving the quasi-orthogonality that is necessary for neural processing. Yet, random linear codes are difficult to decode under noise, which severely limits the resulting VSA's ability to support recovery, i.e., the retrieval of information objects and their attributes from a noisy compositional representation.
  In this work we bridge this gap by utilizing coding theoretic tools. First, we argue that the concatenation of Reed-Solomon and Hadamard codes is suitable for VSA, due to the mutual quasi-orthogonality of the resulting codewords (a folklore result). Second, we show that recovery of the resulting compositional representations can be done by solving a problem we call histogram recovery. In histogram recovery, a collection of $N$ histograms over a finite field is given as input, and one must find a collection of Reed-Solomon codewords of length $N$ whose entry-wise symbol frequencies obey those histograms. We present an optimal solution to the histogram recovery problem by using algorithms related to list-decoding, and analyze the resulting noise resilience. Our results give rise to a noise-resilient VSA with formal guarantees regarding efficient encoding, quasi-orthogonality, and recovery, without relying on any heuristics or training, and while operating at improved parameters relative to similar solutions such as the Hadamard code.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16336">Runtime Analysis of Evolutionary Algorithms for Multi-party Multi-objective Optimization</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2501.16336v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In scenarios where multiple decision-makers operate within a common decision space, each focusing on their own multi-objective optimization problem (e.g., bargaining games), the problem can be modeled as a multi-party multi-objective optimization problem (MPMOP). While numerous evolutionary algorithms have been proposed to solve MPMOPs, most results remain empirical. This paper presents the first theoretical analysis of the expected runtime of evolutionary algorithms on bi-party multi-objective optimization problems (BPMOPs). Our findings demonstrate that employing traditional multi-objective optimization algorithms to solve MPMOPs is both time-consuming and inefficient, as the resulting population contains many solutions that fail to achieve consensus among decision-makers. An alternative approach involves decision-makers individually solving their respective optimization problems and seeking consensus only in the final stage. While feasible for pseudo-Boolean optimization problems, this method may fail to guarantee approximate performance for one party in NP-hard problems. Finally, we propose evolutionary multi-party multi-objective optimizers (EMPMO) for pseudo-Boolean optimization and shortest path problems within a multi-party multi-objective context, maintain a common solution set among all parties. Theoretical and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed \( \text{EMPMO}_{\text{random}} \) outperforms previous algorithms in terms of the lower bound on the expected runtime for pseudo-Boolean optimization problems. Additionally, the consensus-based evolutionary multi-party multi-objective optimizer( \( \text{EMPMO}_{\text{cons}}^{\text{SP}} \) ) achieves better efficiency and precision in solving shortest path problems compared to existing algorithms.

                arXiv:2508.06389v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural Cellular Automata (NCAs) offer a way to study the growth of two-dimensional artificial organisms from a single seed cell. From the outset, NCA-grown organisms have had issues with stability, their natural boundary often breaking down and exhibiting tumour-like growth or failing to maintain the expected shape. In this paper, we present a method for improving the stability of NCA-grown organisms by introducing an 'identity' layer with simple constraints during training.
  Results show that NCAs grown in close proximity are more stable compared with the original NCA model. Moreover, only a single identity value is required to achieve this increase in stability. We observe emergent movement from the stable organisms, with increasing prevalence for models with multiple identity values.
  This work lays the foundation for further study of the interaction between NCA-grown organisms, paving the way for studying social interaction at a cellular level in artificial organisms.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08244">APALU: A Trainable, Adaptive Activation Function for Deep Learning Networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2402.08244v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Activation function is a pivotal component of deep learning, facilitating the extraction of intricate data patterns. While classical activation functions like ReLU and its variants are extensively utilized, their static nature and simplicity, despite being advantageous, often limit their effectiveness in specialized tasks. The trainable activation functions also struggle sometimes to adapt to the unique characteristics of the data. Addressing these limitations, we introduce a novel trainable activation function, adaptive piecewise approximated activation linear unit (APALU), to enhance the learning performance of deep learning across a broad range of tasks. It presents a unique set of features that enable it to maintain stability and efficiency in the learning process while adapting to complex data representations. Experiments reveal significant improvements over widely used activation functions for different tasks. In image classification, APALU increases MobileNet and GoogleNet accuracy by 0.37% and 0.04%, respectively, on the CIFAR10 dataset. In anomaly detection, it improves the average area under the curve of One-CLASS Deep SVDD by 0.8% on the MNIST dataset, 1.81% and 1.11% improvements with DifferNet, and knowledge distillation, respectively, on the MVTech dataset. Notably, APALU achieves 100% accuracy on a sign language recognition task with a limited dataset. For regression tasks, APALU enhances the performance of deep neural networks and recurrent neural networks on different datasets. These improvements highlight the robustness and adaptability of APALU across diverse deep-learning applications.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14500">The Digital Ecosystem of Beliefs: does evolution favour AI over humans?</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2412.14500v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As AI systems are integrated into social networks, there are AI safety concerns that AI-generated content may dominate the web, e.g. in popularity or impact on beliefs. To understand such questions, this paper proposes the Digital Ecosystem of Beliefs (Digico), the first evolutionary framework for controlled experimentation with multi-population interactions in simulated social networks. Following a Universal Darwinism approach, the framework models a population of agents which change their messaging strategies due to evolutionary updates. They interact via messages, update their beliefs following a contagion model, and maintain their beliefs through cognitive Lamarckian inheritance. Initial experiments with Digico implement two types of agents, which are modelled to represent AIs vs humans based on higher rates of communication, higher rates of evolution, seeding fixed beliefs with propaganda aims, and higher influence on the recommendation algorithm. These experiments show that: a) when AIs have faster messaging, evolution, and more influence on the recommendation algorithm, they get 80% to 95% of the views; b) AIs designed for propaganda can typically convince 50% of humans to adopt extreme beliefs, and up to 85% when agents believe only a limited number of channels; c) a penalty for content that violates agents' beliefs reduces propaganda effectiveness up to 8%. We further discuss Digico as a tool for systematic experimentation across multi-agent configurations, the implications for legislation, personal use, and platform design, and the use of Digico for studying evolutionary principles.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14951">Flat Channels to Infinity in Neural Loss Landscapes</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.14951v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The loss landscapes of neural networks contain minima and saddle points that may be connected in flat regions or appear in isolation. We identify and characterize a special structure in the loss landscape: channels along which the loss decreases extremely slowly, while the output weights of at least two neurons, $a_i$ and $a_j$, diverge to $\pm$infinity, and their input weight vectors, $\mathbf{w_i}$ and $\mathbf{w_j}$, become equal to each other. At convergence, the two neurons implement a gated linear unit: $a_i\sigma(\mathbf{w_i} \cdot \mathbf{x}) + a_j\sigma(\mathbf{w_j} \cdot \mathbf{x}) \rightarrow \sigma(\mathbf{w} \cdot \mathbf{x}) + (\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{x}) \sigma'(\mathbf{w} \cdot \mathbf{x})$. Geometrically, these channels to infinity are asymptotically parallel to symmetry-induced lines of critical points. Gradient flow solvers, and related optimization methods like SGD or ADAM, reach the channels with high probability in diverse regression settings, but without careful inspection they look like flat local minima with finite parameter values. Our characterization provides a comprehensive picture of these quasi-flat regions in terms of gradient dynamics, geometry, and functional interpretation. The emergence of gated linear units at the end of the channels highlights a surprising aspect of the computational capabilities of fully connected layers.

                arXiv:2507.19109v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Pareto-NRPA, a new Monte-Carlo algorithm designed for multi-objective optimization problems over discrete search spaces. Extending the Nested Rollout Policy Adaptation (NRPA) algorithm originally formulated for single-objective problems, Pareto-NRPA generalizes the nested search and policy update mechanism to multi-objective optimization. The algorithm uses a set of policies to concurrently explore different regions of the solution space and maintains non-dominated fronts at each level of search. Policy adaptation is performed with respect to the diversity and isolation of sequences within the Pareto front. We benchmark Pareto-NRPA on two classes of problems: a novel bi-objective variant of the Traveling Salesman Problem with Time Windows problem (MO-TSPTW), and a neural architecture search task on well-known benchmarks. Results demonstrate that Pareto-NRPA achieves competitive performance against state-of-the-art multi-objective algorithms, both in terms of convergence and diversity of solutions. Particularly, Pareto-NRPA strongly outperforms state-of-the-art evolutionary multi-objective algorithms on constrained search spaces. To our knowledge, this work constitutes the first adaptation of NRPA to the multi-objective setting.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106122">Correlation detection as a stimulus computable account for audiovisual perception, causal inference, and saliency maps in mammals</a></h4>

              
                Animals excel at seamlessly integrating information from different senses, a capability critical for navigating complex environments. Despite recent progress in multisensory research, the absence of stimulus-computable perceptual models fundamentally limits our understanding of how the brain extracts and combines task-relevant cues from the continuous flow of natural multisensory stimuli. Here, we introduce an image- and sound-computable population model for audiovisual perception, based on biologically plausible units that detect spatiotemporal correlations across auditory and visual streams. In a large-scale simulation spanning 69 psychophysical, eye-tracking, and pharmacological experiments, our model replicates human, monkey, and rat behaviour in response to diverse audiovisual stimuli with an average correlation exceeding 0.97. Despite relying on as few as 0–4 free parameters, our model provides an end-to-end account of audiovisual integration in mammals—from individual pixels and audio samples to behavioural responses. Remarkably, the population response to natural audiovisual scenes generates saliency maps that predict spontaneous gaze direction, Bayesian causal inference, and a variety of previously reported multisensory illusions. This study demonstrates that the integration of audiovisual stimuli, regardless of their spatiotemporal complexity, can be accounted for in terms of elementary joint analyses of luminance and sound level. Beyond advancing our understanding of the computational principles underlying multisensory integration in mammals, this model provides a bio-inspired, general-purpose solution for multimodal machine perception.

                <p>Emotional dysregulation is highly comorbid with sleep disturbances. Sleep is composed of unique physiological states that are reflected by conserved brain oscillations. Though the role of these state-dependent oscillations in cognitive function has been well established, less is known regarding the nature of state-dependent oscillations across brain regions that strongly contribute to emotional function. To characterize these dynamics, we recorded local field potentials simultaneously from multiple cortical and subcortical regions implicated in sleep and emotion regulation and characterized widespread patterns of spectral power and synchrony between brain regions during sleep-wake states in male and female mice. First, we showed that single brain regions encode sleep state, albeit to various degrees of accuracy. We then identified network-based classifiers of sleep based on the combination of features from all recorded brain regions. Spectral power and synchrony from brain networks allowed for automatic, accurate, and rapid discrimination of wake, non-REM sleep (NREM), and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. When we examined the impact of commonly prescribed sleep-promoting medications on neural dynamics across these regions, we found disparate alterations to both cortical and subcortical activity across all three states. Finally, we found that a stress manipulation that disrupts circadian rhythm in male mice increased sleep fragmentation without altering the underlying average brain dynamics across sleep-wake states. Thus, we characterized state-dependent brain dynamics across regions canonically associated with emotions.</p>

                Background Neonatal hypothermia is a major cause of neonatal morbidity and death in the world, especially in low-income countries like Ethiopia. In Ethiopia, despite many studies being conducted on neonatal hypothermia, the reported findings are inconsistent. Therefore, the main aim of this study is to assess the pooled prevalence and factors associated with neonatal hypothermia in Ethiopia. Objectives This study aims to assess the pooled prevalence and factors associated with neonatal hypothermia in Ethiopia. Methods An extensive systematic review and meta-analysis were performed to extract studies on the pooled prevalence of neonatal hypothermia in Ethiopia. The PubMed, Medline, Google, Google Scholar, CINAL, and EMBASE were systematically searched. Nine articles assessed the pooled prevalence of neonatal hypothermia and associated factors in Ethiopia were included. Articles selected and extracted using a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet and exported to Stata version 14 for analysis. I-squared was used to assess the heterogeneity of the included papers, while Egger’s regression test and the funnel plot were used to check publication bias. Results A total of nine primary articles that going well together the inclusion criteria with a total population of 4075 were included in this meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence of neonatal hypothermia in Ethiopia was found to be 61.81% (95% CI: 57.21%, 66.41%). Neonates who had delayed initiation of breast feeding (Odds Ratio: 3.1; 95% CI: 2.37, 4.05), neonates who had no skin to skin contact (Odds Ratio: 4.4; 95% CI: 3.08, 6.27), neonates delivered at night time (Odds Ratio: 2.99; 95% CI: 1.90, 4.69), being low birth weight (Odds Ratio: 3.61; 95% CI: 2.35, 5.54) and neonates who had early bathing (Odds Ratio: 5.27; 95% CI: 2.73, 10.17) were factors significantly associated with hypothermia. Conclusion We found that the pooled prevalence of neonatal hypothermia was high. Thus, The concerned stakeholders should work to strengthen the neonatal care practice to include the possible significant factors of neonatal hypothermia.

                Background The global age-standardised suicide rate is estimated at 8.9/100 000, while South Africa is at 23.5/100 000. The prehospital Emergency Medical Services is located within this burden of health. Emergency Care providers have a duty to assess, treat and transport healthcare consumers with suicidality, when attending to the suicide caseload. The aim was to appraise suicidality case frequency and typology and estimate the scope of the challenge faced by a jurisdictional emergency medical service and its care providers. Methods Using a retrospective cross-sectional design and a novel data collection instrument, a census of three years of Ambulance Incident Management Records was undertaken in a rural district of the Western Cape, South Africa. Results Of 413,712 records, 2,976 (N) mental health-related incidents were sampled. Fourteen percent (n = 412) were assessed to have descriptors of suicidal ideation (n = 227), attempted suicide (n = 83) or death by suicide (n = 102). There were, on average, 2.8 deaths by suicide per month over the 3-year study period in the Garden Route District. Women were reported to mostly ingest poison and overdose on medication, while men used strangulation and were 5 times more likely to die by suicide than women. Conclusion This study estimates the prehospital suicide and suicidality burden for the Western Cape Government Emergency Medical Services, elucidating an under-researched health concern within the South African prehospital space. Further study is required on the risk of emergency care provider stigmatisation towards suicide and suicidality cases, while auditing the need to assess policy, praxis, medical surveillance, EC provider clinical capacity and victim needs and experiences. Suicidality and suicide in Southern Africa could require a ‘Syndemic’ approach for the emergency service to interrupt suicidality and advance professional relevance.

                Background The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms in military targeting systems represents one of the most significant technological shifts in modern warfare, fundamentally altering the speed, precision, and scale of military operations. In the context of the Iranian-Israeli conflict, both nations have emerged as early adopters of AI-enhanced military technologies, albeit through markedly different strategic approaches and technological implementations. Method This study employs a mixed-method analytical approach that combines technical system assessment, comparative case study analysis, and evaluation of the international legal framework. Data collection utilized cross-checking methodology across multiple source types, including investigative journalism, open-source intelligence (OSINT) platforms, military data, and peer-reviewed studies to address three core research questions regarding technical architecture differences, operational effectiveness metrics, and compliance with International Humanitarian Law. Results The analysis reveals substantial differences in both approach and capability. Israeli systems exhibit advanced data integration and surveillance architectures, emphasizing precision and human machine collaboration through platforms such as the Iron Dome, Lavender, and various targeting support technologies. In contrast, Iranian systems prioritize cost-effectiveness and asymmetric capabilities, focusing on autonomous drone operations and cyber warfare integration, albeit with limited independently verified performance metrics. Notable divergences exist in operational doctrine, human oversight mechanisms, and legal compliance frameworks. While field results reveal that the use of artificial intelligence technologies in warfare must be subject to international law to avoid significant civilian casualties. Conclusion While both countries have incorporated AI technologies into military operations, critical gaps in international governance underscore the urgent need for robust regulatory mechanisms to oversee autonomous weapon systems. These findings contribute to academic understanding of military AI implementation patterns and inform policy debates on the ethical and legal dimensions of algorithmic warfare

                This study presents a high-fidelity computational investigation of the aerodynamic performance of a Baja SAE off-road vehicle using a hybrid Reynolds-Averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) and Large Eddy Simulation (LES) turbulence modeling approach. The methodology combines the Spalart–Allmaras RANS model for near-wall flow treatment with Detached Eddy Simulation (DES) for resolving large-scale unsteady turbulent structures in the vehicle’s wake. A detailed computational domain and refined meshing strategy were implemented using ANSYS Fluent, including mesh adaptation based on the LES filter size (Δ = 23.5 mm) and mesh independence validation. Simulations were performed under steady (RANS) and unsteady (DES) conditions at 30 km/h, yielding a drag coefficient (Cd) of 1.290 for RANS and 1.249 for DES. While RANS provided stable results with low variance (σ = 0.005), the DES model captured transient phenomena such as vortex shedding and near-wake recirculation with higher accuracy (σ = 0.024), enhancing the prediction of flow separation zones and aerodynamic forces. Pressure and velocity field analyses revealed improved resolution of stagnation zones and vortex dynamics under the DES framework, particularly around the roof, rear, and underbody regions. The Q-criterion visualization showed that DES allowed the identification of both large-scale and fine-scale vortex structures in the near and far wake, offering a comprehensive representation of turbulence intensity and flow instabilities. These findings confirm the suitability of hybrid RANS–LES methods for aerodynamic optimization of complex vehicle geometries, providing enhanced predictive capabilities compared to traditional steady-state models.

                Background The use of artificial intelligence or machine learning in the development of prediction models is increasing exponentially but the present model is associated with a high degree of heterogeneity and associated bias. The present model is associated with a difficult learning curve and we aimed to develop a tool evaluating risk of bias in cardiology research which was succinct and effective. Methods Our tool (AIr) consists of 10 questions and can be utilised to assess the risk of bias in model development, external validation, and the combination of the two in machine-learned or artificial intelligence models. Results AIr was as effective as the current risk of bias tool, PROBAST, however, was significantly more succinct and had a greater inter-rater reliability than PROBAST. Conclusion We propose that our tool maintains validity regarding the assessment of the risk of bias in cardiology publications whilst increasing reliability when compared with PROBAST.

                <p>by Yihao Yin, Linzhi Zhuang, Yulei Wang, Yazhou Shi, Bengong Zhang</p>

Understanding gene regulation during cell differentiation requires effective integration of multi-omics single-cell data. In this study, we propose BranchKGN, a heterogeneous graph transformer-based framework for identifying branch-specific key genes along cell differentiation trajectories. By integrating scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data into a unified gene representation, we infer differentiation trajectories using Slingshot and construct a heterogeneous graph capturing gene–cell relationships. Through attention-based graph learning, BranchKGN assigns gene importance scores within each cell, enabling the identification of genes consistently informative across branch point cells and their descendant lineages. These genes are then used to reconstruct gene regulatory networks and differentiation trajectories. Validation on three independent datasets demonstrates that the identified gene sets not only capture key regulators of cell fate bifurcation but also support accurate reconstruction of differentiation trajectories. Our results highlight the effectiveness of BranchKGN in dissecting gene regulation dynamics during cellular transitions and provide a valuable tool for multi-omics single-cell analysis.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-protein-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression in many eukaryotes. Next-generation sequencing of small RNAs (small RNA-seq) is central to the discovery and annotation of miRNAs. Newly annotated miRNAs and their longer precursors encoded by <i>MIRNA</i> loci are typically submitted to databases such as the miRBase microRNA registry following the publication of a peer-reviewed study. However, genome-wide scans using small RNA-seq data often yield high rates of false-positive <i>MIRNA</i> annotations, highlighting the need for more robust validation methods. miRScore was developed as an independent and efficient tool for evaluating new <i>MIRNA</i> annotations using sRNA-seq data. miRScore combines structural and expression-based analyses to provide rapid and reliable validation of new <i>MIRNA</i> annotations. By providing users with detailed metrics and visualization, miRScore enhances the ability to assess confidence in <i>MIRNA</i> annotations. miRScore has the potential to advance the overall quality of <i>MIRNA</i> annotations by improving accuracy of new submissions to miRNA databases and serving as a resource for re-evaluating existing annotations.

                <p>by Aitor Oviedo-Madrid, José González-Gomariz, Ruben Armañanzas</p>

Micro-RNAs (miRNA) and their relationship with messenger RNAs (mRNA) have been widely associated with disease development and progression. Post-transcriptional coregulatory networks are sets of miRNA-mRNA interactions that regulate specific genetic behaviors through their combined activity. However, identifying reliable sets of such interactions associated with specific diseases remains challenging, partly due to the high rate of false positives and the lack of user-friendly tools developed for this purpose. In this work, we introduce a new Python package called RNACOREX (RNA CORegulatory network EXplorer and classifier). RNACOREX is a new, easy-to-use tool that allows researchers to find disease associated post-transcriptional coregulatory networks and use them to classify new unseen observations of miRNA and mRNA quantifications. RNACOREX combines structural information from curated databases with expression data analysis, using conditional mutual information to infer reliable sets of miRNA–mRNA interactions. These sets are then used to build probabilistic models based on Conditional Linear Gaussian (CLG) classifiers, which allow both prediction on new samples and validation of the inferred networks.
To demonstrate its capabilities, we tested RNACOREX in 13 different databases from the The Cancer Genome Atlas Program, generating the associated post-transcriptional coregulatory networks and extracting classification performance metrics for each tumor type. Specifically, we used RNACOREX to classify patients according to their survival time in each cancer type, highlighting miRNA–mRNA interactions that consistently appeared across different cancer types. The results show that RNACOREX achieves competitive predictive performance compared to widely used classification algorithms, while offering the added benefit of interpretability through its graph-based modeling framework.

The Cellular-Potts model is a powerful and ubiquitous framework for developing computational models for simulating complex multicellular biological systems. Cellular-Potts models (CPMs) are often computationally expensive due to the explicit modeling of interactions among large numbers of individual model agents and diffusive fields described by partial differential equations (PDEs). In this work, we develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) surrogate model using a U-Net architecture that accounts for periodic boundary conditions. We use this model to accelerate the evaluation of a mechanistic CPM previously used to investigate <i>in vitro</i> vasculogenesis. The surrogate model was trained to predict 100 computational steps ahead (Monte-Carlo steps, MCS), accelerating simulation evaluations by a factor of 562 times compared to single-core CPM code execution on CPU. Over short timescales of up to 3 recursive evaluations, or 300 MCS, our model captures the emergent behaviors demonstrated by the original Cellular-Potts model such as vessel sprouting, extension and anastomosis, and contraction of vascular lacunae. This approach demonstrates the potential for deep learning to serve as a step toward efficient surrogate models for CPM simulations, enabling faster evaluation of computationally expensive CPM simulations of biological processes.

                <p>by Frances K. Clark, Gauthier Weissbart, Xihang Wang, Kate Harline, Chun-Biu Li, Pau Formosa-Jordan, Adrienne H. K. Roeder</p>

Arabidopsis leaf epidermal cells have a wide range of sizes and ploidies, but the mechanisms patterning their size and spatial distribution remain unclear. Here, we show that the same genetic pathway creating giant cells in sepals also regulates cell size in the leaf epidermis, leading to the formation of giant cells. In both sepals and leaves, giant cells are scattered among smaller cells; therefore, we asked whether their spatial arrangement is random. By comparing sepal and leaf epidermises with computationally generated randomized tissues, we show that the giant cell pattern becomes less random across the epidermis as the cells surrounding giant cells divide, leading to clustered patterns in mature tissues. Our cell-autonomous and stochastic computational model reproduces the giant cell organization, suggesting that random giant cell initiation together with the divisions of surrounding cells lead to the observed clustered pattern. These findings reveal that cell-size patterning is developmentally regulated by common mechanisms in leaves and sepals, and the spatial pattern of giant cells emerges from the interplay between stochastic cell-autonomous gene expression and tissue growth.

                <p>by J. Benito Wainwright, Charlotte E. J. Rolfe, Graeme D. Ruxton, Nathan W. Bailey</p>

One of the most enduring mysteries in biology concerns the evolution of complex adaptations made up of interacting component traits. When these component traits do not enhance fitness independently of one another, their origin requires that they evolve sequentially through intermediate steps that do not produce their full adaptive value as a combined trait, or alternatively, that they arise via simultaneous, synergistic evolution. We tested these alternatives using the powerful but accessible example of leaf masquerade in katydids, where in some species, highly modified wings strikingly mimic vegetation to avoid predator recognition. Combining a field predation experiment with a phylogenetic comparative analysis of wing morphology in 58 Neotropical katydid species, we show that color and shape synergistically interact to enhance survival in the wild, and modifications in both traits evolved concurrently during diversification of this clade. Our findings identify the adaptive value of masquerade camouflage in the wild and show how concordant evolutionary change in separate traits—evolutionary synergy—can generate extraordinarily specialized, multi-component adaptations.

Haplodiploid inheritance, in which females are diploid and males are haploid, is found in all species of Hymenoptera. Sex in haplodiploids is commonly determined by the alleles present at a complementary sex determination (CSD) locus, with heterozygosity triggering the female developmental pathway. The identity of this locus differs among taxa and is only known in a few species. Here, we map a single CSD locus to a 2 kbp region in the genome of the red mason bee <i>Osmia bicornis.</i> It overlaps the long noncoding RNA <i>ANTSR</i>, which has been identified as the sex-determining gene in the invasive ant <i>Linepithema humile</i>. This locus is homozygous in diploid males and exhibits extremely high levels of haplotype diversity, consistent with the action of frequency-dependent selection. The elevated levels of heterozygosity in the CSD locus enable us to fine-map potentially functional genetic variation within it. We also identify elevated levels of genetic diversity in the ortholog of the CSD locus in five other bee and ant genera, suggesting that it may govern sex determination widely in Hymenoptera. Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that <i>ANTSR</i> evolved a role in sex determination over 150 million years ago and is the ancestral sex-determination locus of bees and ants.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1196/v1?src=rss">Knowledge, attitude, perception, and factors associated with eye donation and corneal transplantation among the Trinidadian population. [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Corneal diseases, if untreated, can result in irreversible blindness. Corneal transplantation is an established treatment that restores vision in affected individuals. Expanding public awareness of eye donation is essential to increase the availability of donor corneas and reduce the burden of corneal blindness. This study investigated the knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions of Trinidadians toward eye donation. Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted between January and March 2020 among 398 adults (≥18 years) across eight counties in Trinidad. Data were collected using a predesigned, pre-tested structured questionnaire. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the findings, and the results were presented as percentages. Cross-tabulations and multivariable logistic regression were performed to assess the associations between sociodemographic factors and the knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions of eye donation. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. Results Of the 398 participants, 57.3% (n = 228) were female and 32.7% (n = 130) were younger than 24 years. Nearly all (99.5%, n = 396) had formal education, with 47.9% (n = 191) holding graduate degrees. Just over half (54.3%, n = 216) were aware that the cornea could be donated. Among these, the internet (15.9%, n = 63) and television (15.3%, n = 61) were the primary information sources. Only 14.6% (n = 58) correctly identified the ideal timeframe (within six hours of death) for eye harvesting. Multivariable regression showed that sex (OR 1.80, 95% CI: 1.18–2.74) and education (OR 0.44, 95% CI: 0.28–0.71) were associated with knowledge, while religion (OR 2.91, 95% CI: 1.03–8.28) influenced perception. Conclusions Trinidadians demonstrated moderate knowledge but poor attitudes toward eye donation. Sex, education, and religion were the key predictors of awareness and perception. To improve donor cornea availability, public awareness must be strengthened through culturally sensitive national strategies such as digital campaigns, televised programs, workshops, and educational outreach.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1195/v1?src=rss">How to Achieve Near-Perfect Gender Inference Accuracy in Medicine Using ChatGPT [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Gender inference from names is widely used in bibliometric and epidemiologic research, including in general internal medicine. Traditional tools such as Gender API and NamSor are considered accurate but remain limited by misclassifications and unclassified cases. Recent studies suggest that ChatGPT may perform comparably to these tools. We aimed to test whether a two-step procedure could further improve ChatGPT’s performance. Methods We evaluated ChatGPT-5 against Gender API using a random sample of 1,000 Swiss physicians. A two-step one-shot prompt was applied: 1-assign gender directly from the name if reliable; 2-otherwise, verify using the internet. Gender API was applied to the same dataset with no threshold and at probability thresholds of ≥60%, ≥70%, ≥80%, and ≥90%. Confusion matrices, McNemar’s test, and accuracy metrics (errorCoded, errorCodedWithoutNA, naCoded) were computed. Results Of 1,000 physicians, 523 (52.3%) were women and 477 (47.7%) were men. ChatGPT-5 achieved 996 correct classifications (99.6%), with 4 errors and no unclassified cases, whereas Gender API (whole sample) achieved 977 correct classifications (97.7%), 18 errors, and 5 unclassified cases (p-value<0.001). At higher thresholds, Gender API reduced errors but produced up to 6.5% unclassified cases. Overall error rates (errorCoded) were 0.4% for ChatGPT-5 versus 2.3% for Gender API. ChatGPT-5 marked 10.1% of names as “checked” through internet verification, increasing to 69.6% among cases that Gender API misclassified or left unclassified. Conclusion ChatGPT-5 substantially outperformed Gender API in gender inference from physicians’ names, achieving near-perfect accuracy without unclassified cases. Its adaptive use of internet verification for difficult names may offer a robust and efficient approach for large-scale research.

     alt="Adult Striatal Neurogenesis—A Comparative Approach Between Pigeons, Mice, Macaques, and Human"/>
<p>Striatal adult neurogenesis is an understudied field. Here, we add new quantitative data showing that pigeons provide high levels of adult neurogenesis in the striatum compared to mice. Besides, we show that macaque and human differ in their potential to produce adult-born neurons at least in the caudate nucleus.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Adult neurogenesis describes the formation of new neurons in the adult brain, a process that is fundamental to related functions, particularly in the hippocampus. Although studies reported adult striatal neurogenesis in humans, the phenomenon is still understudied in those regions. Thus, to gain a deeper understanding in different species, the expression of neurogenic markers was quantitatively analyzed in striatal subregions of pigeons and mice. Further, in macaques and human a detailed analysis of the subventricular zone (SVZ) was performed and the human caudate nucleus was qualitatively examined. The results show higher neuronal plasticity in striatal subregions of pigeons compared to mice, as reflected by higher numbers of Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)+, BrdU+/Doublecortin+, Doublecortin+, and BrdU+/Neuronal nuclei marker+ cells. Analysis of BrdU+/glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)+ signals indicated further higher gliogenesis/potential stem cell division in pigeons. As newborn striatal neurons may arise from stem cell niches in the SVZ, active proliferation was analyzed with (sex determining region Y)-box 2, GFAP, and Ki-67 in macaques and humans. Specific subdivisions of the SVZ were identified, with GFAP and Ki-67 differentially distributed. Additionally, signs of persistent neuronal plasticity were observed with Doublecortin+ cells in the human caudate nucleus but not in the macaque. The higher levels of striatal adult neurogenesis in pigeons and perspectives of useful methods may encourage the use of birds to investigate the functional role of this phenomenon and may facilitate our understanding of neuronal plasticity even in the human striatum in the future.</p>

                Huang et al. show that Stra8, a gene previously thought to be germline specific, is expressed in the adult mouse hippocampus in an activity-dependent manner. Stra8 protects neuronal integrity and cognition by regulating neuromodulator genes and preserving inhibitory circuit function.

                Barber et al. reveal that radial astroglia participate in efferocytosis during a wave of developmental cell death by surrounding dying neuronal cell bodies in structures called scyllate heads. They demonstrate that scyllate heads transfer contents to microglia and that microglial depletion leads to prolonged scyllate head presence.

Impairment of this process promotes ATM inflammatory polarization, while ADSC injection restores mitochondrial transfer and improves metabolic outcomes in GDM.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99937">Short heat shock factor A2 regulates heat resistance and growth balance in Arabidopsis</a></h4>

              
                Cells prevent heat damage through the highly conserved canonical heat stress response (HSR), where heat shock factors (HSFs) bind heat shock elements (HSEs) to activate heat shock proteins (HSPs). Plants generate short HSFs (S-HSFs) derived from <i>HSF</i> splicing variants, yet their functions remain poorly understood. While an enhanced canonical HSR confers thermotolerance, its hyperactivation inhibits plant growth. How plants prevent this hyperactivation to ensure proper growth remains unknown. Here, we report that <i>Arabidopsis</i> S-HsfA2, S-HsfA4c, and S-HsfB1 confer sensitivity to extreme heat (45°C) and constitute new HSF types featuring a unique truncated DNA-binding domain (tDBD). This tDBD binds a new heat-regulated element (HRE), which confers minimal promoter heat-responsiveness and exhibits heat stress sensing and transmission patterns. Using S-HsfA2, we investigated whether and how S-HSFs prevent canonical HSR hyperactivation. <i>HSP17.6B</i>, a common direct target of HsfA2 and S-HsfA2, confers thermotolerance; however, its overexpression partially causes HSR hyperactivation. Moreover, HRE–HRE-like and HSE elements mediate the <i>HSP17.6B</i> promoter’s heat response. We further show S-HsfA2 alleviates hyperactivation via two mechanisms: (1) S-HsfA2 negatively regulates <i>HSP17.6B</i> via the HRE–HRE-like element, establishing a noncanonical HSR (S-HsfA2-HRE-<i>HSP17.6B</i>) that antagonistically represses HsfA2-activated <i>HSP17.6B</i> expression. (2) S-HsfA2 binds the HsfA2 DBD, preventing HsfA2 from binding HSEs and thereby attenuating HsfA2-activated <i>HSP17.6B</i> promoter activity. Overall, our findings highlight the essential role of S-HsfA2 in preventing hyperactivation of plant heat tolerance to maintain proper growth.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/107598">Insight into the bioactivity and action mode of betulin, a candidate aphicide from plant metabolite, against aphids</a></h4>

              
                Pest-resistant plants usually utilize secondary metabolites to cope with insect infestation. Betulin, a key bioactive compound in aphid-resistant wild peach, possesses promising applications in crop protection. Here, betulin, in both greenhouse and field experiments, displayed excellent control efficacy against <i>Myzus persicae</i>. RNA-seq, quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), and western blotting revealed that betulin significantly inhibited the expression of <i>MpGABR</i> (encoding a GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor). Besides, RNAi-mediated silencing of <i>MpGABR</i> markedly increased aphid sensitivity to betulin. Furthermore, microscale thermophoresis (MST) and voltage-clamp assays indicated that betulin bound to MpGABR (<i>K<sub>d</sub></i> = 2.24 µM) and acted as an inhibitor of MpGABR. Molecular docking, mutagenesis, and genome editing suggested that THR228 is a critical and highly conserved site in MpGABR that betulin binds to specifically, causing aphid death. Overall, the activity of betulin depends on specific targeting and inhibition of MpGABR. Elucidating the mechanism of action of this peach-derived insecticide may offer a sustainable green strategy for aphid control.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105842">Relative timescale of channel voltage dependence and channel density regulation impacts assembly and recovery of activity</a></h4>

              
                Neurons can maintain stable activity profiles over their lifetimes despite ion channel turnover over minutes to weeks. Neuronal activity is also influenced by regulating the voltage dependence of ion channels. How do these two forms of plasticity work together to maintain a stable activity profile? We augment a classical model of activity-dependent ion channel density regulation with a mechanism that adjusts channel voltage dependence based on activity. These findings reveal that the timescale of these mechanisms shapes the specific electrical activity patterns that achieve a target activity profile. Moreover, alterations in channel voltage dependence can impact a neuron’s ability to recover from perturbations. These results highlight a potentially distinct role for activity-dependent regulation of channel voltage dependence in maintaining stable neuronal activity profiles.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89596">Glucose-stimulated KIF5B-driven microtubule sliding organizes microtubule networks in mouse pancreatic β cells</a></h4>

              
                In pancreatic islet β cells, molecular motors use cytoskeletal polymers microtubules as tracks for intracellular transport of insulin secretory granules. The β-cell microtubule network has a complex architecture and is nondirectional, which provides insulin granules at the cell periphery for rapid secretion response, yet to avoid oversecretion and subsequent hypoglycemia. We have previously characterized a peripheral sub-membrane microtubule array, which is critical for the withdrawal of excessive insulin granules from the secretion sites. Microtubules in β cells originate at the Golgi in the cell interior, and how the peripheral array is formed remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that kinesin KIF5B, a motor protein with the capacity to transport microtubules as cargos, is needed to align sub-membrane microtubules in clonal mouse β cells MIN6 and β cells within intact mouse islets. Real-time imaging and photokinetics approaches indicate that KIF5B actively slides existing microtubules to the β-cell periphery. Moreover, like many physiological β-cell features, microtubule sliding is facilitated by a high glucose stimulus. These new data, together with our previous report that high glucose destabilizes the sub-membrane microtubule array to allow for robust secretion, indicate that MT sliding is another integral part of glucose-triggered microtubule remodeling, likely replacing destabilized peripheral microtubules to prevent their loss over time and β-cell malfunction.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98798">Characterization of binding kinetics and intracellular signaling of new psychoactive substances targeting cannabinoid receptor using transition-based reweighting method</a></h4>

              
                New psychoactive substances (NPS) targeting human cannabinoid receptor 1 pose a significant threat to society as recreational abusive drugs that have pronounced physiological side effects. These greater adverse effects compared to classical cannabinoids have been linked to the higher downstream <i>β</i>-arrestin signaling. Thus, understanding the mechanism of differential signaling will reveal an important structure-activity relationship essential for identifying and potentially regulating NPS molecules. In this study, we simulate the slow (un)binding process of NPS MDMB-Fubinaca and classical cannabinoid HU-210 from CB<sub>1</sub> using multi-ensemble simulation to decipher the effects of ligand binding dynamics on downstream signaling. The transition-based reweighing method is used for the estimation of transition rates and underlying thermodynamics of (un)binding processes of ligands with nanomolar affinities. Our analyses reveal major interaction differences with transmembrane TM7 between NPS and classical cannabinoids. A variational autoencoder-based approach, neural relational inference (NRI), is applied to assess the allosteric effects on intracellular regions attributable to variations in binding pocket interactions. NRI analysis indicates a heightened level of allosteric control of NPxxY motif for NPS-bound receptors, which contributes to the higher probability of formation of a crucial triad interaction (Y<sup>7.53</sup>-Y<sup>5.58</sup>-T<sup>3.46</sup>) necessary for stronger <i>β</i>-arrestin signaling. Hence, in this work, MD simulation, data-driven statistical methods, and deep learning point out the structural basis for the heightened physiological side effects associated with NPS, contributing to efforts aimed at mitigating their public health impact.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/107069">Engineering NIR-sighted bacteria</a></h4>

              
                Spatially and temporally orchestrated gene expression underpins organismal development, physiology, and adaptation. In bacteria, two-component systems (TCS) translate environmental cues into inducible expression outputs. Inducible expression also serves as a versatile instrument in both basic and applied science. Here, we harness the photosensors of rhizobial bathy-phytochromes to construct synthetic TCSs for stringent activation of gene expression by near-infrared (NIR) light in laboratory and probiotic <i>Escherichia coli</i> strains, and in <i>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</i>. Orthogonal TCSs afford the multiplexed expression control of several genes by NIR and visible light. Notwithstanding substantial photochemical activation of bathy-phytochromes by visible radiation, the NIR-light-responsive systems hardly responded to red light. Evidently, light signals can be processed by TCSs into highly nonlinear responses at the physiologically relevant level of gene expression. These fundamental aspects likely extend to naturally occurring TCSs. Depending on their photosensor traits and environmental conditions, bathy-phytochromes may thus either be NIR-specific or function as colorblind receptors of light vs. darkness.

">Ultra-High Field 31P functional Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy Reveals NAD+ Dynamics in Brain Energy Metabolism during Visual Stimulation.</a></h4>

              
                We investigated dynamic changes in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) metabolism in the human occipital lobe using ultra-high field 31P functional magnetic resonance spectroscopy (fMRS) at 7 Tesla. Twenty-five healthy volunteers (mean age 24 {+/-} 4 years, 10 female) performed a visual task alternating between fixation and flashing checkerboard stimuli. 31P MRS spectra were acquired from a visual cortex voxel functionally localized by prior fMRI. Linear mixed-effects modelling revealed a significant reduction in NAD+; concentrations during the first stimulation block, while no significant change was observed during the second block. No significant changes were observed for other high-energy phosphate metabolites (ATP, phosphocreatine, and inorganic phosphate), indicating specificity in the NAD+; response. Exploratory analyses, dividing the blocks in two halves, suggested further reductions in NAD+; and tNAD in the second halves of both stimulation blocks, though these trends were not statistically significant. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of using fMRS at 7T to detect stimulus-induced dynamics in cerebral NAD+; metabolism in vivo, providing insights into the interplay between glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation during neural activation.

">Loss of the Parkinson's disease-associated protein DJ-1 impacts dopamine metabolism in astrocytes</a></h4>

              
                The selective loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra is a hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD), yet the contribution of glial cells to this vulnerability is not fully understood. Studies in rodent models suggest that astrocytes can take up and metabolize dopamine (DA), potentially protecting neurons by detoxifying reactive DA metabolites via glutathione S-transferase mu 2 (GSTM2) release. However, these mechanisms remain underexplored in human systems, particularly in the context of PD. Here, we used CRISPR-engineered iPSC-derived human astrocytes with a PD-linked DJ-1 mutation and isogenic controls to investigate astrocytic DA metabolism. Upon DA exposure, control astrocytes upregulated quinone-reducing enzymes NAD(P)H quinone dehydrogenase 1 (NQO1) and GSTM2, whereas DJ-1 mutant astrocytes failed to adaptively respond. In addition, only control astrocytes presented with increased DA quinone products upon DA exposure, not DJ-1 mutants. These results demonstrate astrocytic DA handling being disrupted in DJ-1-linked PD, implicating astroglial dysfunction as an important contributor to PD pathogenesis and potential target for therapeutic intervention.

">Functional clusters for shape, texture, and motion encoding in macaque V2</a></h4>

              
                Macaque primary visual cortex (V1) exhibits exquisite columnar organization, while midlevel area V4 does not. Here we investigated the functional organization and representational bases of intervening area V2 with high-density Neuropixels recordings and a variety of visual stimuli: shape, texture, drifting grating, and translational motion patches. We observed dense clusters of similarly tuned neurons often spanning ~500 micrometer for shape and motion stimuli, and larger for texture stimuli, consistent with a columnar structure. In terms of representational bases, V2 responses were largely explained by stimulus features based on local image statistics: shape tuning is well-modeled by a linear combination of orientation filters, and direction selectivity is stronger with surface compared to object motion, in striking contrast to V4. Overall, our results support the progression from columns to sparse clusters as neuronal representations transform from encoding local features and feature conjunctions in V1/V2 to a high-dimensional object-based code in V4.

">Simultaneous detection and estimation in olfactory sensing</a></h4>

              
                The mammalian olfactory system shows an exceptional ability for rapid and accurate decoding of both the identity and concentration of odorants. Previous works have used the theory of compressed sensing to elucidate the algorithmic basis for this capability: decoding odor information from the responses of a restricted repertoire of receptors is possible because only a few relevant odorants are present in any given sensory scene. However, existing circuit models for olfactory decoding still cannot contend with the complexity of naturalistic olfactory scenes; they are limited to detection of a handful of odorants. Here, we propose a model for olfactory compressed sensing inspired by simultaneous localization and mapping algorithms in navigation: the set of odors that are present in a given scene, and the concentration of those present odors, are inferred separately. To enable rapid inference of odor presence in a biologically-plausible recurrent circuit, our model leverages the framework of Mirrored Langevin Dynamics, which gives a general recipe for sampling from constrained distributions using rate-based dynamics. This results in a recurrent circuit model that can accurately infer presence and concentration at scale and can be mapped onto the primary cell types of the olfactory bulb. This framework offers a path towards circuit models---for olfactory sensing and beyond---that both perform well in naturalistic environments and make experimentally-testable predictions for neural response dynamics.

">Functional Connectivity Localizes a Distributed Supramodal Core for Naturalistic Viewing</a></h4>

              
                Understanding the brain mechanisms that support naturalistic perception is a central goal of cognitive neuroscience. Research has progressed from studying the brain with simple unimodal stimuli to employing richer paradigms that engage visual, auditory, and language modalities in naturalistic environments. Recent multimodal encoding models have shown strong promise in modeling and predicting neural responses to such complex stimuli. Previous studies, however, have primarily focused on two modalities (visual and auditory) and often highlight regions implicated in audiovisual processing (e.g., posterior STS), but do not delineate a compact, replicable subnetwork for multimodal, naturalistic stimuli. While these studies produced valuable maps of sensory integration, their scope was restricted to two modalities and they lacked replication, leaving the full picture of the multimodal integration uncertain. Moreover, no studies have localized a compact, replicable subnetwork via FC-guided ablation under naturalistic viewing. The present study advances our understanding of naturalistic perception by identifying the most informative parcels in Schaefer's brain atlas that contribute to this task. Building on our earlier work demonstrating that functional connectivity can reveal parcels critical for naturalistic perception, we refine this approach by applying "top drop/bottom drop" and "top keep/bottom keep" selection strategies as well as "broken-stick" analysis to focus on regions most relevant for multimodal integration during naturalistic viewing.

">Dynamic Causal Modelling for Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy Using Spatial Priors Derived from Diffuse Optical Tomography</a></h4>

              
                Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is an optical neuroimaging technique that measures brain activity by detecting changes in oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin concentrations. Although methods exist for estimating causal interactions among brain regions using fNIRS data, current approaches typically rely on node locations defined at the sensor measurement level near the cortical surface. To address this limitation, this study extends dynamic causal modeling (DCM) for fNIRS by incorporating source-level locations derived from diffuse optical tomography (DOT). The proposed method was applied to an experimental dataset comprising 104 participants recorded during a Go/No-Go response inhibition task. Bayesian model selection confirmed that DCM models using DOT-informed neuronal source locations outperformed models using sensor-level locations. Furthermore, posterior means of effective connectivity parameters validated the inhibitory influence of the right inferior frontal gyrus on regions within the motor network during response inhibition. By providing precise neuronal source localization informed by statistical parametric mapping of DOT-reconstructed data, the proposed DCM approach enables more accurate inference of directed connectivity at the neuronal level from optical density measurements. Given the compact and portable nature of fNIRS systems, this method can readily be applied in realistic, naturalistic environments to investigate network-level modulation of brain responses.

">Argon inhibits autophagy and improves cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury via PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway</a></h4>

              
                It has been reported that argon has neuroprotective effects during cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury (CIRI). However, the specific mechanism is not fully understood. The aim of this study is to investigate if argon could regulate autophagy to exert a neuroprotective function. A temporary middle cerebral artery ischemia mouse model (tMCAO, ischemia 3h, reperfusion 1h) and the HT22 cell line Oxygen glucose deprivation reperfusion (OGDR) model were used for argon treatment. Transcriptome sequencing and bioinformatics analysis were performed on HT22 OGDR models. Western blot, CCK-8, LDH, transmission electron microscopy, agonists and inhibitors of autophagy and PI3K/Akt/mTOR were used to investigate the specific mechanism. Argon could reduce infarct volume, improve weight recovery, and neurological scores. Enrichment analysis of the KEGG signaling pathway was highly correlated with the PI3K/Akt pathway. Western blot, CCK-8, LDH, and transmission electron microscopy showed that argon could activate the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway and inhibit autophagy, promoting a neuroprotective function. After the combined use of autophagy inducer 3, Akt inhibitor MK2206, and mTOR inhibitor rapamycin, respectively, the neuroprotective function of argon was significantly reversed. Our study suggests that argon activating the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway and inhibiting autophagy is an important mechanism for its neuroprotective function.

">Intrinsic electrophysiological activity maps a latent dimension of poor sleep quality and reduced cognitive performance: a magnetoencephalography study using Cam-CAN data.</a></h4>

              
                Sleep quality and cognition vary as functions of lifestyle, genetics, and health. However, poor sleep quality is prevalent, reportedly affecting approximately 38% of the adult population. Poor sleep quality is a significant risk factor for mood disorders, a predictive factor in cognitive decline in later life, and sleep disturbance is a putative precursor to severe cognitive impairment and is predictive of dementia onset. The direct relationship between these factors and intrinsic neural function is poorly understood. Integrating neurophysiology, cognition, and sleep quality to reveal latent factors would help understand the neurophysiology of sleep disturbances and their relation to cognitive performance. Here, we used data from the Cam-CAN dataset with a partial least squares (PLS) approach, producing a multivariate cross-decomposition model to map resting-state magnetoencephalography (MEG) data and cognitive/sleep scores of healthy controls (n = 490, age 18-86). Normative modelling was applied to MEG data, correcting for effects of age, sex, and handedness. We identify a significant relationship between poorer self-reported sleep quality and lower cognitive performance across multiple domains, characterised by excess low-frequency neural activity and reduced high-frequency activity, particularly in the alpha band. Moreover, globally increased low frequency and decreased alpha-beta functional connectivity, the dominant frequency channel in neural connectivity at rest across the brain, contribute significantly to this relationship. Our multivariate mapping approach enabled us to parse the electrophysiological signatures directly related to sleep quality and cognitive performance, independent of the confounding effects of age, and show that neural slowing and dysconnectivity are intrinsically linked to self-reported sleep quality and cognitive performance.

To study the route by which internalized tau seeds access cytosolic monomers and to identify the site of aggregate growth, we imaged live human iPSC-derived neurons (iNs) expressing tau P301L--eGFP after exposure to recombinant tau pre-formed fibrils (PFFs) or Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain--derived oligomers or fibrils. We detected seeded tau P301L--eGFP aggregation within late endosomes/lysosomes of iNs but not in undifferentiated iPSCs. Colocalization with a Dextran pH biosensor showed that the aggregates remained within the lumen of an intact, low-pH compartment. Reporters of endolysosomal injury and repair (endolysosomal recruitment cytosolic galectin-3 and the ESCRT-III component IST1) did not change during seeding. Volume focused-ion-beam scanning electron microscopy showed fibrillar material exclusively inside membrane-bounded endolysosomes, with no membrane discontinuities in the fibril-containing compartments and with no evidence of cytosolic aggregates. Because tau and -synuclein can cross-seed, we adapted a HaloTag pulse--chase assay to test for the persistence of trans-membrane access. AD fiber--containing endolysosomes progressively recruited cytosolic -synuclein--Halo over days, with heterogeneous incorporation histories consistent with recurrent, self-limited access events rather than persistent rupture or terminal sealing. Pharmacologic inhibition of the endolysosomal lipid kinase PIKfyve with apilimod suppressed seeded tau aggregation and prevented neuronal toxicity. These data indicate that templated conversion proceeds within acidic, membrane-intact endolysosomes; tau seeding in neurons is enabled by transient, self-limited endolysosomal perforations yet remains confined to the endolysosomal lumen, and it requires PIKfyve-dependent PI(3,5)P2.

">Contextual Scaling of Representational Uncertainty for Size and Number</a></h4>

              
                Accurate discrimination of magnitudes, such as object size and quantity, is crucial for effective action selection and decision-making. A fundamental principle in magnitude discrimination is that discriminability is determined by the ratio of the stimulus values being compared, as formalized by Weber-Fechner's law. Here, we show evidence that the discriminability of numerosity is not as robust as previously thought; rather, it is influenced by task-irrelevant environmental statistics. We measured discrimination thresholds in 24 participants performing a numerosity discrimination task in which pairs of dot arrays were presented either simultaneously or sequentially. Stimulus values were sampled from either narrow or wide ranges. Our findings revealed that, although the magnitude pairs were identical, discrimination performance was significantly better (i.e., lower threshold) when stimulus values were sampled from a narrow-range compared to a wide-range. Strikingly, this improvement was observed only when the stimuli were presented sequentially. A similar pattern emerged in a size discrimination task with analogous manipulations. A control experiment ruled out potential confounding variables related to stimulus variety, emphasizing the importance of the stimulus range in gaining this benefit. Together, these findings suggest that perceptual variability is flexibly scaled according to context, particularly when the representations are less reliable. Our study highlights the adaptive nature of stimulus encoding strategies, whereby the brain minimizes representational uncertainty by dynamically leveraging contextual information.

">Absence of cortical reorganization following an internal capsule stroke in rodents</a></h4>

              
                Stroke is a leading cause of disability, causing chronic motor impairments in many survivors. Although recovery is correlated with cortical reorganization, the impact of lesion location on post-stroke reorganization is uncertain. We compared movement-related neural activity following experimental infarcts to the motor cortex (M1) or internal capsule in rats. Neural activity was recorded from motor and somatosensory regions during a skilled pellet retrieval task longitudinally during the course of recovery. Cortical lesions resulted in early behavioral recovery accompanied by widespread reductions in neural activity across ipsilesional regions, indicative of large-scale reorganization. In contrast, internal capsule lesions produced delayed recovery with no evidence of long-term ipsilesional cortical reorganization. These findings challenge the relevance of cortical reorganization for recovery from subcortical lesions and indicate that post-stroke recovery mechanisms are lesion-specific and that models targeting subcortical white matter are essential for maximizing translational relevance.

">Spatial Attention and Session Day Independently Modulate Human Visual Cortical Plasticity</a></h4>

              
                Stimulus-specific response potentiation (SSRP) is a non-invasive form of cortical neuroplasticity that can be induced through repeated presentation of high-contrast visual stimuli. Classically, SSRP, like long-term potentiation and related plasticity mechanisms, has been hypothesized to demonstrate input specificity, such that potentiation is confined to the neural populations and synapses driven by the induction stimulus. In addition, SSRP is observed to accumulate across days in rodent models. Despite growing interest in this phenomenon, it remains unclear whether factors such as selective attention influence the magnitude or specificity of a potentiated response. This study investigated whether covert endogenous attention could modulate the strength of SSRP in high-density EEG recordings from neurotypical human participants. An established SSRP paradigm was modified to include an attention task during induction. Pre-post response amplitudes were measured with frequency-tagged (6 and 7.5 reversals-per-second) bilateral hemifield contrast-sweep checkerboard steady-state visual-evoked potential stimuli. The 10-minute high-contrast 2 Hz sign-reversing SSRP induction stimulus was presented only in the left hemifield, with the right hemifield serving as a control. On two different experimental days, each participant deployed attention either toward or away from the potentiated hemifield during induction. Response amplitudes increased after SSRP, with increases in response amplitude manifesting in both the potentiated and control non-potentiated hemifields, weighing against the idea that SSRP is input-specific. Interestingly, significantly more response potentiation observed on the second session day compared to the first, independent of attention condition. Finally, we observed that attention enhanced SSRP in naive but not experienced observers (i.e. on Session-Day 1 but not Session-Day 2), identifying a significant interaction between attention condition and session day. Overall our results suggest that (1) SSRP in humans may not in fact be stimulus-specific (potentiation effects are not input- or retinotopically- specific), (2) visual spatial attention has a modest enhancing effect on SSRP in first-session participants, and (3) a second session of SSRP leads to a pronounced plasticity effect compared to the first session that occludes any attentional modulation.

">SNNs Are Not Transformers (Yet): The Architectural Problems for SNNs in Modeling Long-Range Dependencies</a></h4>

              
                Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have gained increasing attention for their ability to operate on low-power neuromorphic hardware, offering a pathway toward energy-efficient large language models (LLMs). However, they continue to underperform state-of-the-art artificial neural networks (ANNs) on tasks such as language modeling, limiting their broader adoption. Here, we present an explicit covering-number analysis of SNNs, focusing on the non-leaky integrate-and fire (nLIF) model. Building on recent advances in causal-piece analysis and local Lipschitz continuity, we derive a global Lipschitz constant for nLIF networks and extend this framework from single-token inputs to full sequences. Our analysis reveals that the sample complexity of nLIF architectures grows quadratically with sequence length, in contrast to the linear or logarithmic scaling observed in recurrent and Transformer models. These findings expose a fundamental architectural limitation in SNNs and suggest targeted architectural and biological modifications needed to overcome it. Finally, we show that the same assumptions emerge in biological circuits, emphasizing the critical role of inhibitory interactions in enabling efficient learning of long-range dependencies.

">Probabilistic Cognitive State Modeling (PCSM): Decoding Latent Spatiotemporal Dynamics to Reveal Serial-Parallel Processing, Cognitive Demand, and Serial Bottleneck in Task-Based fMRI</a></h4>

              
                Studying flexible, adaptive transitions between cognitive tasks and serial-parallel processing under changing task demands has been a central focus for understanding human cognition. Advances in neuroimaging analysis have improved the ability to link cognition with brain function, providing a foundation for developing methods that capture brain dynamics for quantitating emergent cognitive properties during task-based fMRI paradigms. Probabilistic Cognitive State Modeling (PCSM) combines Finite Impulse Response (FIR) modeling of BOLD activity with a Gaussian Mixture Model-Hidden Markov Model (GMM-HMM) to quantify dynamic, spatially distributed brain states. From these posteriors, PCSM derives interpretable, emergent properties including serial-parallel processing, cognitive demand, resource level, and serial bottleneck. A ground-truth simulation evaluated PCSM across systematically varied noise and transition probabilities. Results show that PCSM accurately recovers ground-truth latent states (> 98 %) and produces stable parameter estimates across conditions. Threshold analyses identify reliable boundaries between parallel, mixed, and serial processing modes and recover expected relations among demand, resource availability, and bottleneck persistence. These findings demonstrate that PCSM can reveal how dynamic brain states contribute to adaptive processing architectures, providing a framework for mapping individual-specific cognitive dynamics and examining cognitive processing, demand, and serial bottleneck in task-based fMRI.

">Retrosplenial cortex enables context-dependent goal-directed sensorimotor transformation</a></h4>

              
                The ability to dynamically adjust a behavioral response to a stimulus depending on context is of critical importance for animals. To investigate the neural basis supporting context-dependent sensory processing we developed a behavioral task in which mice changed their response to a single whisker deflection according to a continuously present contextual cue. Through unbiased optogenetic inactivation mapping, we found that neuronal activity in sensory and motor cortices contributed to task execution and, interestingly, we uncovered an unexpected role of retrosplenial cortex for contextual integration. Widefield calcium imaging revealed that retrosplenial cortex was the first cortical area to show context discrimination in response to the whisker stimulus, followed by whisker motor cortex. Finally, we combined optogenetic inactivation with calcium imaging to define causal context-dependent changes in sensorimotor processing. Our cortex-wide mapping experiments thus begin to define key cortical nodes for context-dependent sensorimotor transformation and highlight an important contribution of retrosplenial cortex.

">Structural changes in autism reflect atypical brain network organization and phenotypical heterogeneity: a hybrid deep network approach</a></h4>

              
                Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a developmental disorder characterized by heterogeneity in social and emotional responses, language, and behavior. Assessments such as the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) can quantify this variability but understanding underlying mechanisms and identifying distinct and shared atypical organization and function of brain networks remains a challenge. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been used to analyze imaging data. However, the relationship between structural brain changes observed in structural MRI (sMRI), the affected brain functional networks inferred from these structural changes, and their connection to ASD phenotypes and scores still requires systematic investigation. In this study, we ensembled 3D CNNs with other artificial intelligence (AI) methods to conduct a comprehensive analysis of macrostructural changes in ASD. We found consistently dominant involvement of (a) the left hemisphere, (b) the frontal and temporal lobe, and (c) the default mode, salience, and language networks in ASD. Our findings highlighted brain network similarities and differences between high and low severity ASD and showed that typically developed brains fall at the low-severity end of the high-to-low severity spectrum of ASD. Our systematic AI approach utilized the phenotypic heterogeneity and spectral nature of ASD to uncover significant structural changes across brain regions and functional networks, correlating the structural, functional, and phenotypical heterogeneity of individuals with ASD. This enabled us to identify known and novel global and local brain region and network changes in ASD in relation to phenotypes and clinical scores that can guide diagnostic subtyping.

">Modelling Predictive Coding in the Primary Visual Cortex (V1): Layer 2/3 Circuits for Prediction Error Computation through Compartmentalized Spiking Neurons</a></h4>

              
                Cortical Layer 2/3 has been consistently implicated as the locus of prediction-error signalling in hierarchical models of cortical sensory processing. However, the circuit mechanisms that generate biologically plausible prediction-error (PE) signals remain elusive. A spiking network model is presented here in which two-compartment excitatory pyramidal neurons interact with three inhibitory subtypes: parvalbumin-expressing (PV), somatostatin-expressing (SOM), and vasoactive-intestinal-peptide-expressing (VIP) interneurons,to compute sign-specific prediction errors (positive and negative PEs). Feedforward input targets the soma, whereas top-down feedback reaches the distal apical dendrite, enabling a local somato-dendritic comparison. A PE emerges whenever the balance between excitation and inhibition is selectively disrupted within one compartment, recruiting either positive-error (PE+) or negative-error (PE-) subpopulations of pyramidal neurons. Unlike prior learning-dependent, rate-based accounts, this fixed-weight spiking circuit shows that bidirectional PE signals (PE+ and PE) can arise online from compartment-specific balance without any synaptic weight updates. The model reproduces key experimental observations, including sparse mismatch responses, compartment-specific inhibition, and VIP-mediated disinhibition. Across four canonical sensory-prediction configurations, the circuit maintains a tight balance during matched input and generates bidirectional PE signals only under mismatch. By routing sensory drive from Layer 4 into Layer 2/3 and allowing the resulting PE activity to project toward deeper feedback generators, the model situates Layer 2/3 as a dedicated, feature-specific mismatch detector within a hierarchical inference network. These results provide a mechanistic bridge from dendritic computation to laminar predictive coding, demonstrating how realistic spiking dynamics can implement fast, sign-specific PE signaling without learning.

">Striatal Pathways for Action Counting and Steering</a></h4>

              
                The basal ganglia (BG) are critical for coordinating voluntary movements, yet their precise contribution remains a subject of debate. Using a novel operant counting task, we trained mice to perform a specific number of lever presses to obtain a reward, enabling quantification of continuous kinematics, discrete actions, and action sequences. Optogenetic manipulations of direct pathway (dSPN) and indirect pathway (iSPN) striatal projection neurons exert bidirectional and dissociable influences on both movement steering and action count progression: activation of dSPNs extends press sequences as if resetting an internal accumulator, whereas activation of iSPNs prematurely terminates them, mimicking completion of the count. In vivo calcium imaging reveals distinct yet intermixed populations of dSPNs and iSPNs representing either lever approach or count progression, with ramping activity patterns consistent with accumulation and discharge dynamics. Importantly, the difference between dSPN and iSPN population activity scales with proximity to both spatial and count-based goals, unifying discrete and continuous control within a push/pull model. These findings establish the BG as a central circuit for integrating kinematic and sequential representations to monitor and steer progress toward behavioral goals.

">KIF5A binds RNA to orchestrate synaptic mRNA localization and stress granules in ALS</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal health depends on the precise transport and local translation of mRNAs to maintain synaptic function across highly polarized cellular architecture. While kinesin motor proteins are known to mediate mRNA transport, the specificity and direct involvement of individual kinesins as RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that KIF5A, a neuron-specific kinesin implicated in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), functions as an RBP. We show that KIF5A directly binds mRNAs encoding synaptic ribosomal proteins and is required for their synaptic localization and for maintaining normal synaptic composition and function. Additionally, we show ALS-linked KIF5A mutations confer gain-of-function properties, enhancing mRNA binding, increasing synaptic ribosomal protein accumulation, inducing neuronal hyperexcitability, and impairing stress responses. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized mechanism by which mutant KIF5A disrupts synaptic homeostasis. Our work positions a kinesin motor protein as an RBP with critical roles in mRNA transport, local translation, and stress response.

">Tuned to explore: Increased phasic responses to auditory targets and novelty in children regardless of induced tonic arousal</a></h4>

              
                The ability to focus on relevant information while ignoring distractions is critical during childhood, as it supports learning, social interaction, and adaptation to changing environments. This attentional balance is thought to depend in part on arousal regulation, mediated by the activity of the locus coeruleus norepinephrine (LC-NE) system. Moderate levels of arousal are typically associated with optimal cognitive performance. However, the interaction between arousal and attention remains poorly understood in humans, especially during development. In this study, we investigated whether experimentally modulating tonic arousal, the baseline level of physiological alertness, affects attentional processing in children (N = 44, aged 6-8) and adults (N = 46, aged 18-35). Participants performed an active auditory three-stimulus (standard, novel, target) oddball task, designed to assess selective attention to target tones and distraction by novel sounds. Prior to each task block, tonic arousal was manipulated using music or videos varying in arousing content. Physiological responses were recorded continuously (skin conductance, pupil dilation, heart rate) to index both tonic arousal and transient, phasic changes in arousal triggered by task events. While tonic arousal modulation was successful, as confirmed by skin conductance levels, Bayesian analyses provided evidence for no effect of this modulation on subsequent attentional processing. Importantly, children generally exhibited stronger phasic arousal responses, particularly to task-irrelevant novel sounds, reflecting less mature regulation of attention and arousal. These findings show developmental differences in physiological responses to unexpected environmental stimuli and provide physiological evidence of increased distractibility during childhood.

">Deletion of Cacna1c (CaV1.2) in D1-expressing cells elicits divergent sex-specific effects on aversive and spatial memories</a></h4>

              
                Dopamine signaling is critical for cognitive and emotional regulation and is implicated in multiple neuropsychiatric disorders. One downstream effector of dopamine is the L-type calcium channel CaV1.2, encoded by the risk gene CACNA1C. Genome-wide association studies have consistently linked CACNA1C single nucleotide polymorphisms to schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and related conditions. We previously showed that homozygous deletion of Cacna1c in dopamine receptor 1 (D1)-expressing cells enhances remote (30 days post-training) contextual fear memory in male mice. Here, we extend these findings by examining sex- and gene dosage-specific behavioral consequences of Cacna1c loss in D1 cells. We find that D1-Cacna1c deletion produces a sex- and gene dosage-dependent effect on fear memory. In males, homozygous loss of D1-Cacna1c heightens remote contextual fear at 30-days post-training, replicating prior findings, whereas partial loss had no effect. Cue-associated fear memory remained unaffected across genotypes. In contrast, females exhibited heightened contextual fear with both heterozygous and homozygous D1-Cacna1c loss at 24-hrs, 7-days, and 30-days post-training, indicating increased sensitivity to contextual aversive learning. Cue-associated fear memory was higher at 24-hrs but normalized at later time points in females. In the Water Y-maze, males with heterozygous or homozygous D1-Cacna1c loss showed impaired spatial memory at 7-days post-training, whereas females were unaffected. D1-Cacna1c deletion reduced locomotor activity selectively in females during the initial 5-mins of a 60-min session, with no genotype effects in males. Social interaction and anxiety-like behavior were unchanged across groups. Together, these findings highlight the interplay between dopamine receptor signaling and calcium channel function in shaping sex-dependent aspects of memory.

">Senescent astrocytic deposits drive cognitive decline by disrupting tripartite synapse in the aging brain</a></h4>

              
                Brain aging involves synapse decline, with astrocytes playing a key role in synapse homeostasis. However, the impact of astrocyte senescence on synaptic dysfunction and cognitive decline remains unclear. Here, we identified a hallmark of aging astrocytes Senescent Astrocytic Deposits (SAD) observed at aged rodents, macaques, and human hippocampal astrocytic processes that is associated with tripartite synapse dysfunction and memory decline. Laser capture microdissection-coupled mass spectrometry (LCM-MS), spatial transcriptome analysis and 3D electron microscopy revealed that SAD are abnormal protein deposits at the processes of ApoE-high expression astrocyte subtype and associated with dysfunctional tripartite synapses. Using a transgenic mouse (Nrbf2 knockout) with accelerated SAD formation as a tool for genetic manipulation, we clearly demonstrated that age-dependent defect of phagocytosis at maturation stage in astrocytic drives SAD accumulation, synaptic injury and cognitive deficits. Collectively, our findings establish SAD as a mechanistic link between astrocyte senescence and synaptic damage, underscoring the critical role of astrocytic phagocytic function in preserving synaptic homeostasis and cognitive function during aging.

">Rapid generation of ventral A9-like dopaminergic neurons from patterned iPSCs</a></h4>

              
                In vitro modelling of highly vulnerable nigral dopaminergic (DA) neuronal subtypes in Parkinson's disease (PD), is necessary for studying disease mechanisms. Here, we optimized a new approach by expressing the pioneer neurogenic transcription factor, Achaete-scute-like 1 (Ascl1), implicated in determining dopaminergic fate. Sequential small-molecule patterning of iPSCs into early floor plate mesencephalic progenitors, followed by inducible Ascl1 expression, rapidly differentiates midbrain DA neurons. Immunocytochemistry and transcriptomic analysis of these patterned Ascl1-driven DA neurons (PA-DANs) confirmed midbrain-lineage specificity. Importantly, we found an enrichment of DA subpopulations that corresponded to the adult human ventral SOX6-positive A9 DA subtypes vulnerable in PD. Furthermore, we combined these ventral A9-like PA-DANs with human iPSC-derived midbrain astrocytes and microglia in defined ratios to generate mature 3D A9-like assembled organoids that display characteristic spontaneous neuronal activity and electrical propagation along the axon. Our method efficiently generates a mature and functional A9-like DA neuronal platform to study PD.

">Oligodendrocytes support functional development of subcortical premotor neurons and navigation</a></h4>

              
                Oligodendrocytes and the myelin they produce are required for proper balance behaviors in adult vertebrates. If, when, and how they shape the functional development of vestibular (balance) circuits and associated behaviors is unclear. We first adopted a pharmacological approach to investigate the contribution of oligodendrocytes across early development of larval zebrafish (Danio rerio). Disruption of oligodendrogenesis reduces the number of oligodendrocytes near vestibular neurons across development, but only impacts vertical navigation -- a behavior requiring vestibular function -- in older larvae. Correspondingly, we found that midbrain premotor neurons in the vertical navigation circuit only decreased their responses to tilts at later ages. In contrast, we found that the vestibulo-ocular reflex was unaffected by drug treatment, and that body-tilt responses in the underlying hindbrain vestibular neurons and their target extraocular motor neurons were unchanged. Targeted photoablation of oligodendrocytes in the anterior hindbrain replicated our pharmacological findings, selectively disrupting vertical navigation in older animals. By dissociating where and when developmentally-disrupted oligodendrogenesis impacts neuronal function and behavior, our work takes a major step towards understanding how oligodendrocytes enable the maturation of sensorimotor behaviors.

">A semantotopic map in human hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                The hippocampus plays a central role in encoding abstract conceptual and semantic information. However, little is known about the topography of that encoding. We leveraged the rare opportunity to examine neural responses densely along a small portion of the human hippocampus, specifically, the mediolateral axis of the anterior body. We collected responses to passive language listening using Neuropixels probes in three anesthetized patients during clinically indicated neurosurgical procedures. We computed semantic tuning functions for each recording site by regressing threshold crossing events and single unit responses against semantic embeddings from GPT-2, Word2Vec, and SBERT. We find that tuning functions of more distant recording sites are more dissimilar, supporting the hypothesis semantotopic organization. Multiple semantic features showed systematic changes along that axis, including animacy, concreteness, and familiarity; notably, effects were individual-specific. Surprisingly, we also found a small but significant increase in semantic similarity as a function of distance between recording sites, on a shorter spatial scale, suggesting a modest periodic organization. Together, these results demonstrate the presence of a multiscale functional organization of semantics in the hippocampus.

">Task-optimized models of sensory uncertainty reproduce human confidence judgments</a></h4>

              
                Sensory input is often ambiguous, leading to uncertain interpretations of the external world. Estimates of perceptual uncertainty might be useful in guiding behavior, but it remains unclear whether humans explicitly represent uncertainty in naturalistic settings, and whether any such representations are normatively correct. Progress has been hindered by the absence of stimulus-computable models that estimate uncertainty. We developed a class of task-optimized models that generate probability distributions over perceptual estimates. To assess whether human uncertainty representations align with the model's, we compared human confidence judgments, which might indirectly reflect uncertainty representations, to confidence judgments extracted from the model's uncertainty. In both sound localization and pitch perception, human confidence varied systematically, being lower for stimuli that produced more variable estimates across trials. Human confidence tracked model confidence across conditions, suggesting that human uncertainty representations accurately reflect the actual uncertainty of perceptual estimation. The modeling framework is extensible to other perceptual domains.

">From perception to valence: a pair of interneurons that assign positive valence to sweet sensation in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Assigning valence, appeal or aversion, to gustatory stimuli and relaying it to higher-order brain regions to guide flexible behaviors is crucial to survival. Yet the neural circuit that transforms gustatory input into motivationally relevant signals remains poorly defined in any model system. In Drosophila melanogaster, substantial progress has been made in mapping the sensorimotor pathway for feeding and the architecture of the dopaminergic reinforcement system. However, where and how valence is first assigned to a taste has long been a mystery. Here, we identified a pair of subesophageal zone interneurons in Drosophila, termed Fox, that impart positive valence to sweet taste and convey this signal to the mushroom body, the fly's associative learning center. We show that Fox neuron activity is necessary and sufficient to drive appetitive behaviors and can override a tastant's intrinsic valence without impairing taste quality discrimination. Furthermore, Fox neurons transmit the positive valence to specific dopaminergic neurons that mediate appetitive memory formation. Our findings reveal a circuit mechanism that transforms sweet sensation into a reinforcing signal to support learned sugar responses. The Fox neurons exhibit a convergent-divergent "hourglass" circuit motif, acting as a bottleneck for valence assignment and distributing motivational signals to higher-order centers. This architecture confers both robustness and flexibility in reward processing: an organizational principle that may generalize across species.

">Neonatal brain volumes and birth characteristics predict behavioural outcomes in toddlerhood</a></h4>

              
                Background: Early brain structure and birth factors (e.g., sex, birth weight, gestational age at birth) are understood as critical to shaping lifelong developmental and psychopathological outcomes. Methods: Using data from the Developing Human Connectome Project, we examined whether neonatal brain volumes and birth factors predict developmental and socioemotional outcomes in toddlerhood. Structural MRI scans were acquired from 391 infants at birth (193 females, 198 males; mean age = 8 days), with follow-up behavioural assessments conducted in toddlerhood (mean age = 18 months). Results: Results demonstrated that larger neonatal brain volumes were associated with lower autistic traits and higher cognitive, language and motor outcomes. A higher gestational age and weight at birth were associated with higher scores on various of these outcomes - an effect that was partially mediated by larger brain volumes at birth. Females showed higher language scores compared to males, though this effect was suppressed rather than mediated by neonatal brain volumes. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate how birth factors interactively shape early developmental and neuropsychiatric outcomes.

<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>In biparental species, repeated exposure to infants can induce parental behavior in virgin males and females. Little is known, however, about the mechanisms underlying neuroplasticity resulting from experience with infants. Perineuronal nets (PNNs), extracellular matrix structures, regulate neuroplasticity during development and adulthood. We examined the impact of pup exposure on PNN expression in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), medial amygdala (MeA), and medial preoptic area (MPOA) in male and female California mice (<i>Peromyscus californicus</i>), a biparental rodent. We stained brain sections with the lectin <i>Wisteria floribunda agglutinin</i> (WFA) to examine WFA-positive PNN expression in adult virgins exposed to pups one, two, or three times and new parents. Controls were tested with a pup-sized object. Pup exposure altered WFA+ PNN density in the mPFC and MeA, but not MPOA, of males. Virgin males exposed to pups twice exhibited reduced WFA+ PNN density in the mPFC compared to virgin males exposed to pups only once. Pup-exposed fathers had lower WFA+ PNN density in the MeA than virgin males exposed to pups once. In contrast, pup exposure did not alter WFA+ PNN density in females. Additionally, WFA PNN density in the mPFC was higher in males than females. PNNs preferentially associated with GABAergic cells in the mPFC of males, whereas in the MeA, PNNs associated with a similar percentage of GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons.

">Is poor dose selection undermining the translational validity of antidepressant research involving animal models?</a></h4>

              
                Background: Behavioural studies in animal models represent a critical component of psychiatric drug development. Positive results in animal studies have identified novel therapeutic targets for major depressive disorder (MDD) but efficacy in humans has largely not been borne out in clinical trials. A possible reason for this failed translation is inappropriate dose selection and the engagement of mechanisms not directly relevant to antidepressant effects in patients. Methods: We first used PubMed to identify preclinical rodent studies in two assays used to assess antidepressants; the conventional forced swim test, (FST) and more recently developed affective bias test, (ABT). Dose ranges were extracted, as well as information about subjects, timing and route of administration, and justification and efficacy of dose(s). Dose ranges were compared against calculated animal equivalent doses. Results: The median FST dose across all antidepressants was 10mg/kg, with median doses for each drug exceeding the relevant animal equivalent dose by 1.5-25x. In contrast, effective doses in the ABT showed closer alignment to those used clinically. In the second study, 232 ketamine and 202 fluoxetine papers involving MDD-related research in rodents were reviewed. The median dose was 10mg/kg for both drugs, exceeding animal equivalent doses by 1.6-3.2x and 3.2-6.5x for ketamine and fluoxetine, respectively. Conclusions: The results indicate pervasive use of antidepressant doses in conventional models of MDD that may not correspond with doses used in clinical practice. We discuss the implications of using doses which exceed therapeutic levels and the potential to engage receptors and underlying mechanisms which are not relevant to clinical effects.

">Individual-level contextual alignment and aperiodic slope reveal improved comprehension of unexpected language</a></h4>

              
                In everyday language use, individuals are required to comprehend complex, continuous and often unexpected linguistic inputs to effectively communicate with others. Evidence from other domains of processing such as memory and learning suggest that individuals these unexpected inputs can often be remembered or learnt just as well as predictable inputs in follow up testing. However, language comprehension research often focuses on how individuals process these stimuli rather than how the information which is gathered can be used at a later time. It is proposed that, in line with memory and learning, individuals can utilise unexpected language inputs to support a deeper understanding of the information which is being communicated. Further, this will be related to the interaction between an individual's alignment to local context and inter-individual differences in information processing, such as aperiodic slope. The present study uses an alignment metric which measures the relationship between individual level N400 amplitudes (a neurophysiological metric of predictability) and surprisal (a text-collection-based metric of predictability), where higher alignment suggests the individual has a stronger preexisting schema. A steeper aperiodic slope has been suggested to reflect greater adaptation of predictive models in response to prediction errors; therefore, it is hypothesised that depth of language comprehension will be modulated by both alignment and aperiodic slope. To explore this, 30 participants (23F, 1 not reported; mean age: 22.2 years [SD:4.4]) listened to 12 short stories (3 genres, audio-visual presentation) while their electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded. Comprehension was tested via 6 multiple choice questions per story. An additional combined analysis, including a reanalysis of 40 audio-modality participants, provided evidence across both modalities that comprehension was improved for more surprising stories. Further, when considering inter-individual differences, the relationship between predictability and comprehension was shown to be modulated by both alignment and aperiodic activity. Comprehension of unexpected stories (as measured by N400 amplitudes) was improved only for lower aligned, steeper aperiodic slope individuals. This finding is considered a reflection of complementary processing strategies which are weighted towards incoming stimuli, increasing the likelihood of model updating and therefore resulting in improved comprehension of unexpected stories.

                Introduction and aim Periodontal disease, initiated by dental biofilm and influenced by various local and systemic factors, includes stress as a potential contributor to its progression. Despite associations with severe forms like acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis, a comprehensive large-sample study linking stress to periodontal disease is lacking. This study aims to investigate the relationship between mental health and periodontal disease. Materials and Methods Leveraging data (secondary dataset) from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 2011–2012 and NHANES 2013–2014 cycles, relevant information was extracted. Mental health was the exposure variable, and periodontal disease, assessed through indices following Eke et al.’s definition, served as the outcome. Covariates (demographical characteristics) impacting periodontal disease were considered, and disease status analyses employed the Rao-Scott chi-squared test. A logistic regression model assessed mental health’s impact on periodontal disease. Results Among the 2764 Participants, more than a quarter (29.1%) were aged over 60 years, 52% were females. Logistic regression indicated higher odds of periodontal disease among individuals feeling bad about themselves for more than half of the day (OR 1.170, 95% CI 0.533-2.474), though statistical significance was not reached. Periodontitis prevalence significantly varied based on marital status, with 6.6% of married and 10.8% of unmarried Participants affected. Notably, a statistically significant difference in periodontitis prevalence existed between Participants with health insurance (8.3%) and those without (16.5%). Conclusion Our findings suggest trends in periodontal disease prevalence linked to mental health, marital status, and access to health insurance. However, the absence of statistically significant findings calls for caution in interpreting these relationships. We recommend that future studies further investigate these potential associations to provide a clearer understanding.

                Student entrepreneurship is increasingly recognized as a driver of economic growth, innovation, and job creation, particularly in developing countries. However, limited financial literacy remains a major barrier to entrepreneurial success among students. This study aims to systematically review the role of financial literacy in supporting student entrepreneurship. A systematic search using the PRISMA 2020 method was conducted in Scopus for the period 2014–2024 with the following search string: (“financial literacy” AND entrepreneurship AND student*) OR (“financial literacy” AND “youth entrepreneurship”). From an initial 155 records, 36 studies met the inclusion criteria: peer-reviewed, empirical, English language, and focusing on students in the context of entrepreneurship. The review identifies three main themes. First, the financial skills addressed include budgeting, saving and borrowing, cash-flow management, investment and risk assessment, and basic accounting. Second, approaches to improving financial literacy are primarily through integrated curricula, business simulations, student venture projects, and industry mentoring. Third, financial literacy strongly impacts entrepreneurial outcomes, including higher self-efficacy, better financial decision-making, stronger resilience in cash-flow management, and greater sustainability of student ventures. The findings underscore the importance of integrating financial literacy as core human capital within entrepreneurship education, especially in developing countries. Limitations of this review include reliance on Scopus and exclusion of non-English studies. The study provides theoretical, practical, and policy implications for universities, educators, and policymakers.

                Spontaneous gastric intramural hematoma (GIH) is an exceptionally rare cause of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. We report the case of a 57-year-old man with no significant medical history who presented with hematemesis, melena, and hemodynamic instability. Upper endoscopy revealed a large submucosal hematoma with active bleeding. Despite endoscopic hemostasis and supportive management, hemorrhage persisted, requiring emergency partial gastrectomy. Histopathological examination confirmed submucosal hemorrhage without evidence of malignancy or vascular malformation. The patient had an uneventful postoperative recovery. This case underscores the importance of considering spontaneous GIH in the differential diagnosis of unexplained upper gastrointestinal bleeding and highlights the role of timely surgical intervention when endoscopic therapy fails.

                Background Enterprise Architecture (EA) is a crucial facilitator for the digital transformation of organizations; however, its implementation in the higher education sector of fragile states is still insufficiently studied. This gap makes it harder for policymakers and higher education leaders in countries like Yemen to carry out structured, sector-wide modernization. Methods This study utilizes a systematic integrative review methodology, adhering to PRISMA principles. We synthesized and analyzed 30 peer-reviewed articles and high-credibility reports published between 2010 and June 2025 to identify transferable EA frameworks, governance models, and implementation strategies pertinent to resource-constrained contexts in higher education. Results Our analysis confirms that the TOGAF framework is the most widely used, but it also indicates that successful public sector implementations depend on hybrid adaptations and federated governance models to attain a balance between central policy and institutional autonomy. The most important things that lead to success are strong executive sponsorship and a phased, pilot-led implementation. The primary problems are lack of resources and resistance from within the organization. The results also show a clear link between EA outcomes, such as improved efficiency and resilience, and the main goals of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Conclusions This review expands EA theory into the inadequately explored area of public administration in fragile contexts. In practice, it provides Yemen with a new, evidence-based, phased implementation pathway. This pathway affords higher education sector leaders a real policy and management tool to help them build strong and useful digital ecosystems in tough places.

</p>
<br/>
<p>The past decade has witnessed groundbreaking clinical implementation of neuroprosthetic limbs driven by signals from peripheral targets (eg, nerves and muscle) and the brain to restore limb function for individuals with limb loss or impairment. In this review, we highlight recent key clinical trials in peripheral neuroprosthetic interfaces directly with nerve, residual muscle, and reinnervated muscle. We then highlight the key advances in brain interfaces, including clinical trials using electroencephalography, electrocorticography, and intracortical electrodes to control neuroprosthetics. Finally, we explore the future of neuroprosthetic control where both peripheral and brain interfaces can be combined to improve neuroprosthetic performance.

                <p>Neurosyphilis remains an important and highly morbid neurologic infection. Recent years have seen a dramatic increase in the incidence of syphilis across a variety of populations, making recognition of the many neurologic complications of this infection still relevant for modern clinicians. As manifestations of neurosyphilis are famously varied, a high index of suspicion is essential, especially in the face of atypical presentations. In this review, we discuss updates to the epidemiology, range of clinical presentations, diagnosis, and management of neurosyphilis. ANN NEUROL 2025;98:1070–1076</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.70020?af=R">Depression Polygenicity and Disease Activity and Disability Worsening in Multiple Sclerosis</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>A better understanding of factors associated with multiple sclerosis (MS) disease activity and disability is needed. Given the strong link between comorbid depression and MS disease activity and disability, we aimed to determine whether the depression genetic burden, as modelled using its polygenic score, is associated with MS disease activity and disability worsening.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In this cohort study, we used samples from neurologist-defined adult people with MS (PwMS) followed in clinical care or during a clinical trial from existing cohorts: Canada, the United States (US), and Sweden with extensive longitudinal phenotypes. We computed the depression polygenic score (PGS) and tested its association with annualized relapse rate and worsening disability. In the US cohort, we additionally explored the time to relapse, number of enhancing lesions, and confirmed Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) worsening during the study period.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We included 3,420 relapsing-onset PwMS of European genetic ancestry with a median follow-up of 3 to 5 years. Meta-analyses revealed for each 1-standard deviation increase in the depression PGS, the relapse rate increased (incidence rate ratio: 1.23, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.01–1.50). In the US cohort, higher depression PGS was associated with protocol-defined relapses (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.58, 95% CI = 1.03–2.43), and time to confirmed EDSS worsening (HR = 1.51, 95% CI = 1.03–2.22) with this effect largely direct.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Meta-analyses showed a higher depression genetic burden was associated with increased MS disease activity. In the US clinical trial cohort only, we found a significant association between higher depression PGS and time to relapse and confirmed EDSS worsening. These findings may provide insights into MS disease activity and disability worsening. ANN NEUROL 2025;98:1057–1069</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Landau–Kleffner syndrome (LKS), is a rare, poorly-understood epileptic encephalopathy with spike–wave activation in sleep associated with mutations in <i>GRIN2A</i>, encoding the N-Methyl-D-Aspartate receptor (NMDAR) GluN2A subunit. Physicians rely on empirical treatments, with scarce information on treatment efficacy and outcomes. This study aims to improve the understanding and clinical management of LKS.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Fifty-two patients with LKS were recruited via one quaternary referral center. Case-notes review delineated clinical features, long-term outcomes, and prognostic factors. Generalized estimating equations were used to determine the longitudinal association among electroencephalogram abnormalities, steroid therapy, and neuropsychological findings. After genetic screening, the impact of identified <i>GRIN2A</i> missense variants on NMDAR function was assessed using homology modeling, cell-surface trafficking assays, and electrophysiology in artificial synapses. Whole exome/genome sequencing was performed on <i>GRIN2A</i>-negative patients to identify novel gene associations.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>LKS is complex with significant clinical and genetic heterogeneity. Besides speech and language impairment, many patients had other co-morbidities and almost half have long-term disability. Early age at disease onset was associated with worse outcomes. There was no reliable correlation between electroencephalogram findings and developmental scores. Steroid therapy improved language outcomes independently of electroencephalogram findings. <i>GRIN2A</i> mutations were identified in 15.5% of the cohort. Likely pathogenic variants in <i>GABBR2</i>, <i>SCN1A</i>, <i>TRPC1</i>, <i>ERRFI1</i>, <i>CTXN3</i>, <i>IRX6</i>, and <i>IQCA1</i> were identified in 7 <i>GRIN2A-</i>negative individuals.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>For LKS, early intervention is important for long-term outcomes. Furthermore, management should not be based solely on electroencephalogram findings. Genetic and functional investigations offer insights into disease pathophysiology and facilitate development of future targeted therapies. ANN NEUROL 2025;98:951–966</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Overactivity of muscles is thought to be involved in postural abnormalities (PA) in Parkinson's disease (PD). Here, we investigated the relationship between muscle activity and postural parameters to explore the peripheral mechanisms of PA.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A total of 90 PD patients and 19 healthy controls were enrolled. Posture features (F1–F8) and the index for PA were collected. Surface electromyography was acquired from cervical and thoracolumbar muscles during lying, sitting, standing, and walking, respectively. Follow-up was completed for a subset of PD patients.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Root mean square (RMS) amplitudes of the sternocleidomastoid muscle (SCM) and external oblique muscle, were higher in PD patients with PA (PD_PA) than PD patients without PA (PD_NPA) and healthy controls during lying and standing. Extensor activity in PD_PA patients increased only in the antigravity position compared with PD_NPA patients. Spearman's correlation showed that RMS amplitude of SCM in the lying position was associated with index for PA and forward flexion angles including F3–F8, whereas RMS amplitude of the external oblique muscle in the lying position was correlated with F5 alone. Longitudinal analysis showed that changes in F3, F4, and index for PA were significantly correlated with changes in RMS amplitude of the SCM in the lying position. Additionally, PD_NPA patients with SCM overactivity had a significantly higher risk of progressing to PA than those with normal SCM activity.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The SCM and external oblique muscle are involved in forward trunk flexion in PD patients, while extensors may play a compensatory role. SCM may be the key muscle in PA for PD patients, participating in the pathogenesis of PA. ANN NEUROL 2025;98:967–976</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Intracranial language localization with electrical stimulation mapping (ESM) and high-gamma modulation (HGM) mapping relies on artificial, repetitive tasks, requiring sustained cooperation from patients. Herein, we tested the validity of unstructured, interpersonal, naturalistic conversation for language localization, using a novel methodology: Behavior-iEEG-Spectral-Power correlation (BESPoC). We first validated BESPoC against ESM, HGM, and neuropsychological outcomes using well-established language tasks, then demonstrated the validity of naturalistic conversation.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We included 134 patients (59 females), aged 2–29 years, undergoing standard-of-care stereo-electroencephalography monitoring who engaged in picture naming, auditory naming, story listening, and conversed with a family member. ESM and HGM analysis were performed using established methods. BESPoC methodology quantified correlation between stereo-electroencephalography spectral power from task recordings, obviating the need for any trial-based epochs, and behavioral markers. The large sample size allowed mixed-effects modeling to compare BESPoC with HGM and ESM.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>BESPoC showed high specificity (0.79–0.83) and sensitivity (0.64–0.86) for localizing HGM language sites across the tasks. BESPoC also compared well with HGM across all language tasks for localizing ESM speech/language sites. With conventional tasks, BESPoC was superior to HGM for modeling neuropsychological deficits seen, despite preserving ESM speech/language sites. Naturalistic conversation compared well with standard tasks for localization of HGM and ESM language sites, and determined neuropsychological outcomes better than conventional tasks.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Using BESPoC methodology naturalistic conversation is shown to produce valid cortical language maps of both expressive and receptive language, and determine neuropsychological outcomes after epilepsy surgery. ANN NEUROL 2025;98:1096–1110</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective of this study was to investigate the relationships among subthalamic nucleus (STN) activity, gait initiation (GI), and freezing of gait (FOG) in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We recorded GI and STN local field potentials (LFPs) via externalized cables in 38 patients with PD (35 reporting FOG in daily life), both OFF- and ON-dopamine (DOPA). GI was also recorded in 24 age-matched controls. GI scores related to pace, rhythm, and balance were derived from kinetics, and FOG was identified using kinematics. We compared GI performance related to FOG and DOPA, and GI-LFP relationships between posterior-sensorimotor versus central-associative STN regions.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>DOPA<sup>OFF</sup>, 12 patients with PD had FOG observed (FOG-OBS, 263 episodes), occurring at a mean of 8 steps after GI, and 26 had no FOG observed (NOBS; FOG-NOBS). GI pace scores were worse in FOG-OBS than in FOG-NOBS patients with PD, even when not followed by FOG, with weaker association with alpha/low-beta activity in the posterior STN. Although rhythm/balance scores were similar between groups, their association with low-beta activity was stronger in FOG-OBS patients, with rhythm correlating more in the central STN and balance in the posterior STN. GI was worse preceding imminent FOG, with disrupted low-beta GI-LFP associations and emergent high-beta correlations with reversed spatial distribution (pace/rhythm-posterior STN, balance-central). Dopamine improved pace, rhythm, and FOG, and partially restored STN activity.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our results reveal 3 distinct GI patterns in patients with PD associated with absence, predisposition to, or imminent occurrence of FOG, with STN neuronal modulations differing dynamically between the posterior and central subregions. These markers could support developing adaptive DBS strategies tailored for episodic gait impairments. ANN NEUROL 2025;98:977–990</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Exenatide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist, has neuroprotective effects in preclinical models of multiple system atrophy (MSA). We investigated these effects in a proof-of-concept clinical trial.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In this single-center, randomized, open label trial, participants with MSA were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive subcutaneous injections of exenatide 2 mg weekly for 48 weeks, or as controls, followed by a 48-week washout period. The primary outcome was the Unified Multiple System Atrophy Rating Scale (UMSARS) parts I + II combined score at 48 weeks. Objective secondary outcome measures included the numbers of participants losing ambulation; scoring ≥ 3 on UMSARS part I items for falls, speech, swallowing, as well as timed walking and measures of quality of life and cognition.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Between September 23, 2020, and May 6, 2022, 50 participants were recruited (25 in each group). At 48 weeks, UMSARS parts I + II scores had worsened by 6.1 points (95% confidence interval [CI] = 3.0 to 9.3, SD = 6.9) in the exenatide group and by 13 3 points (95% CI = 9.2 to 17.3, SD = 9.4) in the control group, an adjusted mean difference of −7.4 points (−11.3 to −3.6, <i>p</i> = 0.0003). There were no statistically significant differences at either 48 or 96 weeks in the secondary outcome measures. Biomarker analysis of neurofilament light chain and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) alpha-synuclein oligomer load, sensor-derived gait measures, and imaging findings were also similar between groups.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Exenatide was associated with positive effects on participant-reported symptoms and clinician-rated MSA severity. In contrast, none of the objective comparisons differed according to randomization. Given the open label trial design, the discrepancy between the primary outcome and the objective measures may be explicable as placebo effects/observer bias.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.70006?af=R">Frequency of Microvascular Pathology and Hippocampal Atrophy on Magnetic Resonance Imaging in a Community Study of Alzheimer's Disease with Blood‐Based Biomarkers</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Blood-based biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD), representing antemortem indicators of AD pathophysiology, have greatly improved the accuracy of diagnosis. However, these biomarkers may not capture a frequent coincident pathology, such as cerebrovascular disease.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We measured plasma amyloid-<i>β</i>40, amyloid-<i>β</i>42, total tau, tau phosphorylated at threonine 181, tau phosphorylated at threonine 217, glial fibrillary acidic protein, and neurofilament light chain in 685 multiancestral individuals who had clinical assessments and brain magnetic resonance imaging. The cohort was represented by individuals of European, African American, and Caribbean Hispanic ancestry. Participants were then classified as biomarker-positive or -negative for AD based on previously established cutoffs: 2.65 pg/mL for, tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 and 0.39 pg/mL for tau phosphorylated at threonine 217. We used magnetic resonance images to compare white matter hyperintensity volume (WMH), silent brain infarcts, microhemorrhages, and hippocampus volume across groups by their clinical diagnosis and biomarker status.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In the P-tau181 group (<i>n</i> = 685), 70 individuals (10.2%) had dementia or amnestic mild cognitive impairment. A total of 40 (57%) were biomarker-positive for AD, and 30 were classified as other dementia. Among 615 without dementia, 265 (40.3%) were preclinical AD, and 348 (50.8%) were biomarker-negative controls. In the tau phosphorylated at threonine 217 group (<i>n</i> = 535), 54 (10.1%) had dementia or amnestic mild cognitive impairment, including 33 biomarker-positive for AD and 21 with other dementia, whereas 183 (38.0%) were preclinical AD and 298 (61.9%) were biomarker-negative controls. Across both classifications, biomarker-positive for AD and other dementia individuals showed greater WMH volumes, more infarcts, and smaller hippocampus. However, P-tau217 positivity was more sensitive to WMH volume differences, whereas tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 better captured hippocampal atrophy and silent brain infarcts. Interestingly, ethnic differences may also influence detection of changes in WMH volumes, hippocampal volume, and infarcts in relation to specific biomarkers.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The results indicate that cerebrovascular disease is consistently involved in dementia either directly or as a coincident pathology in AD. These results underscore the need to incorporate both blood-based biomarkers and structural imaging in the evaluation of patients with dementia. ANN NEUROL 2025;98:1027–1043</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Personalized approaches to ischemic stroke diagnosis are needed. We determine differences in proteomic signatures of incident embolic (EIS) and thrombotic stroke (TIS) by age and resultant pathways using large-scale proteomics.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Participants in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study (ARIC) from visit 2 (V2, 1990–1992) until 2020 without prevalent stroke with available SomaScan data (4,955 protein targets) at V2 (mid-life, n = 10,929), and then again at visit 5 (V5, 2011–2013, n = 4,463) were included. Covariate adjusted Cox hazard models determined the association between proteins, and adjudicated incident EIS or TIS from V2 to V5 and from V5 to 2020.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Among 10,929 participants (56% female, 23% Black, follow-up ~20 years), 20 proteins measured in mid-life were associated with either EIS (n = 168) or TIS (n = 459) in mid-life, and 4 measured in late-life were associated with late-life stroke (73 EIS and 124 TIS events) at the Bonferroni threshold <i>p</i> &lt; 1E−5. In mid-life, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NPPB) was significantly associated with EIS, but not TIS (<i>p</i>-difference = 9.14E−7). Nineteen mid-life proteins were strongly associated with TIS; 7 strongly associated with TIS and only nominally (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) with EIS and the remaining 12 with TIS only. In late-life, NPPB, serine protease inhibitor Kazal-type 4, oligodendrocyte-myelin-glycoprotein, and neurocan-core protein were significantly associated with EIS, but not TIS. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis tools implicated cancer for EIS-associated proteins, whereas TIS pathways reflected cell-structure and atherogenesis.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We identified plasma proteins associated with risk of EIS versus TIS reflecting distinct stroke mechanisms: cardiac dysfunction protein in EIS (eg, NPPB) and inflammation dysregulation in TIS (eg, interleukins). ANN NEUROL 2025;98:1125–1135</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.70014?af=R">Elevated Risk of Cerebral Arteriovenous Malformation Rupture during Pregnancy and Puerperium</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVM) pose a significant risk during pregnancy because of hormonal changes and increased hemodynamic stress. This study aims to assess the risk of AVM rupture during pregnancy and puerperium and to identify risk factors associated with rupture.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This prospective cohort study included 588 women with AVMs and a history of pregnancy, enrolled from a nationwide registry in China between August 2011 and August 2021. A case-crossover design was used to compare rupture risk during pregnancy, puerperium, and non-pregnancy periods, adjusting for clinical and morphological factors. Multivariable logistic regression analysis identified independent risk factors.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The risk of AVM rupture was significantly higher during pregnancy compared to non-pregnancy periods (4.5% vs 1.6%; risk ratio [RR], 3.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.3–4.2; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). The risk was particularly elevated during the second and third trimesters. Key factors independently associated with increased rupture risk included adolescent or advanced-age pregnancy (adolescent ≤19 years or advanced ≥35 years, odds ratio [OR], 8.32; 95% CI, 2.09–28.12, <i>p</i> = 0.001), a history of AVM rupture before pregnancy (OR, 4.20; 95% CI, 1.37–11.40; <i>p</i> = 0.007), diffuse nidus (OR, 2.32; 95% CI, 1.07–5.12; <i>p</i> = 0.033), and multifetal pregnancy (OR 18.31; 95% CI, 1.14–293.27; <i>p</i> = 0.040).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Pregnancy substantially increases the risk of AVM rupture, particularly during the second and third trimesters and compared to pre-first pregnancy periods. Risk factors such as adolescent or advanced-age pregnancy and multifetal pregnancy further increase the risk. These findings underscore the importance of tailored management during pregnancy for optimizing maternal and fetal outcomes. ANN NEUROL 2025;98:1136–1145</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.70015?af=R">Anterior Versus Posterior Insular Epilepsy: Correlations with Semiology Based on Stereoelectroencephalography</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To characterize insular seizure semiology and correlate with stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) seizure onset in a well-defined cohort, in particular examining differences between anterior and posterior insular seizures.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We documented all semiological signs and the timing of emergence for 45 patients with SEEG-confirmed insular epilepsy, along with the precise location of the seizure onset zone (SOZ) within the insula. Semiological signs and other non-invasive data were compared between those with anterior and posterior insula SOZ, with more detailed insular subregion description when appropriate. Co-occurrence patterns of insular semiological signs were also investigated.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 87% reported auras and the corresponding insular SOZ demonstrated an anterior-to-posterior gradient by aura type. The absence of aura was significantly associated with an anterior insula SOZ (<i>p</i> = 0.01). Late grunting/moaning (<i>p</i> = 0.07), symmetric mouth elementary motor (<i>p</i> = 0.1), blinking (<i>p</i> = 0.05), and chewing/repetitive swallowing (<i>p</i> = 0.09) also suggested an anterior insula SOZ. Unilateral non-painful somatosensory aura (<i>p</i> = 0.07) and early arm/hand elementary motor (<i>p</i> = 0.1) suggested a posterior insular SOZ.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We report the characteristics and semiological features in a large cohort of primary insular epilepsy patients. The type of aura is crucial for identifying the SOZ and the timing of semiological emergence contributes to the anatomo-electro-clinical localization of an insular SOZ. These findings can enhance identification of insular epilepsy, making targeted curative treatment feasible. ANN NEUROL 2025;98:1111–1124</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27307?af=R">Mapping Postictal Aphasia through Signal Complexity: A Stereo‐Electroencephalography Study</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The postictal period provides an opportunity to investigate the pathophysiology underlying aphasia and recovery following epileptic seizures. This study examines postictal aphasia in stereo-electroencephalography (SEEG)-explored patients to identify brain regions associated with task-specific language deficits using signal complexity analysis.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We evaluated video-SEEG-recorded focal seizures with and without postictal aphasia in patients with SEEG-confirmed hemispheric language dominance. SEEG traces were analyzed using permutation entropy (PE), with the postictal period quantified by a PE-based metric, the Postictal Alteration Time (PAT). Brain region PAT was correlated with language function recovery (eg, repetition). Electro-clinical recuperation was also assessed within the dorsal-ventral language stream framework. Additionally, a bedside testing battery was developed to evaluate postictal aphasia severity and task-specific deficits.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 322 seizures from 98 patients were analyzed. Seizures with postictal aphasia had longer PAT than those without. Task-specific language recovery correlated with regional PAT (eg, naming – middle temporal gyrus). Moreover, the dorsal stream recovered faster than the ventral stream. Additionally, the Postictal Aphasia Scale (PAS) was developed, evaluating naming, reading, repetition, and comprehension (verbal and written) and automatic speech. Higher PAS scores (indicating milder deficits) correlated with faster regional complexity recovery. At 5 and 10 minutes postictally, PAS revealed a global aphasia pattern, with comprehension deficits gradually resolving. By 15 minutes, aphasia was primarily production-related, particularly affecting naming.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This study provides new insights into the pathophysiology of postictal aphasia and introduces PAS as a tool for assessing postictal aphasia severity and domain-specific deficits, aiding surgical planning and rehabilitation. ANN NEUROL 2025;98:1080–1095</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To investigate how sex and age at menopause influence the interplay between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Lewy body disease (LBD) neuropathologies, and their associations with cognitive decline.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We analyzed data from: (1) three Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center cohorts (i.e., the Religious Orders Study, Rush Memory and Aging Project, and Minority Aging Research Study), and (2) the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center Neuropathology Data Set. Neuropathological evaluation assessed LBD (neocortical/limbic-type vs none) and AD, including neuritic plaques (β-amyloid plaques surrounded by dystrophic neurites) and neurofibrillary tangles. In each dataset, we tested interactive associations between LBD and sex on neuritic plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and cognitive decline. Additionally, in the Rush dataset, we tested whether age at spontaneous menopause modified the associations of LBD with neuritic plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and cognitive decline in women.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In the Rush dataset, we included 1,277 women and 579 men. In the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center dataset, we included 3,283 women and 3,563 men. Across both datasets, men were more likely to have LBD, whereas women showed greater neuritic plaque and neurofibrillary tangle burdens. Sex modified the associations of LBD with neurofibrillary tangles (but not neuritic plaques), whereby LBD was more strongly associated with greater neurofibrillary tangle burden in women than men. Men showed faster LBD-related cognitive decline, whereas women showed faster neurofibrillary tangle-related decline, after adjusting for copathologies (neuritic plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and LBD, as appropriate). In women, earlier age at menopause exacerbated the associations of LBD with neurofibrillary tangle burden and episodic memory decline.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Sex may influence AD and LBD neuropathologies, highlighting the need for precision approaches to dementia prevention and intervention. ANN NEUROL 2025;98:1014–1026</p>

                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>To examine volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (vMRI) in myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-associated disease (MOGAD), compared to multiple sclerosis (MS), neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD), and healthy controls (HC).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Standardized vMRI in MOGAD were compared to age, sex, and disease duration matched MS (5:1), and non-matched NMOSD and HC, in mixed linear models with time and group interactions. Disability assessments included; patient determined disease steps (PDDS), manual dexterity (MDT), walking speed (WST), processing speed (PST), and contrast sensitivity tests (CST). Correlations between vMRI and disability in MOGAD were examined.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 293 patients were included; 32 MOGAD, 160 MS, 49 NMOSD, and 52 HC. MOGAD had a faster rate of volume loss in all brain regions compared to HC (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). At baseline, MOGAD had preserved thalamic (0.000507, <i>p</i> = 0.005), caudate (0.000287, <i>p</i> = 0.004), and putamen (0.000341, <i>p</i> = 0.007) fractions than MS. Longitudinally, MOGAD had increased lateral ventricle fraction (LVF) (−0.000645, <i>p</i> = 0.032), but less hippocampal (0.000031, <i>p</i> = 0.044) and upper cervical cord area (UCCA) loss (1.482887, <i>p</i> = 0.005), compared to NMOSD. MOGAD had increased LVF (0.00529, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), but less UCCA loss (0.538656, <i>p</i> = 0.042) longitudinally compared to MS. Among MOGAD, UCCA was associated with PDDS (−0.72, <i>p</i> = 0.004) and CST (0.60, <i>p</i> = 0.014). Whole brain fraction (WBF) was associated with PDDS (−0.66, <i>p</i> = 0.01) and PST (0.52, <i>p</i> = 0.019). LVF was associated with PDDS (0.78, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>MOGAD showed longitudinal brain volume loss compared to HC. Deep gray matter was relatively preserved compared to MS, while MS and NMOSD had greater UCCA loss, indicating regional differences in atrophy. Despite less overall atrophy, volume loss in MOGAD was associated with disability. ANN NEUROL 2025;98:1044–1056</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To determine whether established heart rate parameters of exercise, related to cardiac autonomic function, are associated with incident Parkinson's disease, independent of both clinical and autonomic prodromal features.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A study of UK Biobank participants who performed a standardized bicycle exercise test (2009–2013), followed until November 2022, and analyzed in January 2024, was carried out. Heart rate increase from rest to exercise, and heart rate decrease from peak exercise to recovery were associated with incident Parkinson's disease. Multivariable adjustment was performed both for clinical characteristics and for prodromal non-cardiac autonomic features.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 69,288 eligible participants (men 48%, mean age 56.8 years [SD 8.2 years]) were followed for 12.5 years: among the 319 (0.5%) who developed Parkinson's disease, recognized prodromal markers (constipation, bladder dysfunction) were more common at baseline. The median lag time to diagnosis was 9.3 years (interquartile range 4.4). Both heart rate increase (37.5 [SD 11.5] vs 40.8 [SD 12.4] b.p.m., <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and recovery (23.4 [SD 8.8] vs. 27.8 [SD 10.3] b.p.m., <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) were significantly lower in incident cases compared with controls. Heart rate recovery was independently associated with incident Parkinson's disease, whereas heart rate increase was not. Specifically, a blunted heart rate lowering during recovery was associated with a 30% higher risk of incident Parkinson's disease (HR 1.3; 95% CI 1.1–1.4; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001 per 10 beats less recovery).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Collectively, this suggests that cardiac autonomic involvement precedes clinically manifest Parkinson's disease, and that heart rate recovery might serve as a quantitative prodromal marker. ANN NEUROL 2025;98:1004–1013</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Autophagy is a fundamental biological pathway with vital roles in intracellular homeostasis. During autophagy, defective cargoes including mitochondria are targeted to lysosomes for clearance and recycling. Recessive truncating variants in the autophagy gene <i>EPG5</i> have been associated with Vici syndrome, a severe early-onset neurodevelopmental disorder with extensive multisystem involvement. Here, we aimed to delineate the extended, age-dependent <i>EPG5</i>-related disease spectrum.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We investigated clinical, radiological, and molecular features from the largest cohort of <i>EPG5</i>-related patients identified to date, complemented by experimental investigation of cellular and animal models of EPG5 defects.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Through worldwide collaboration, we identified 211 patients, 97 of them previously unpublished, with recessive <i>EPG5</i> variants. The phenotypic spectrum ranged from antenatally lethal presentations to milder isolated neurodevelopmental disorders. A novel Epg5 knock-in mouse model of a recurrent <i>EPG5</i> missense variant featured motor impairments and defective autophagy in brain areas particularly relevant for the neurological disorders in milder presentations. Novel age-dependent neurodegenerative manifestations in our cohort included adolescent-onset parkinsonism and dystonia with cognitive decline, and myoclonus. Radiological features suggested an emerging continuum with brain iron accumulation disorders. Patient fibroblasts showed defects in PINK1-Parkin-dependent mitophagic clearance and α-synuclein overexpression, indicating a cellular basis for the observed neurodegenerative phenotypes. In <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>, <i>EPG5</i> knockdown caused motor impairments, defective mitophagic clearance, and changes in mitochondrial respiration comparable to observations in <i>C. elegans</i> knockdown of parkinsonism-related genes.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings illustrate a lifetime neurological disease continuum associated with pathogenic <i>EPG5</i> variants, linking neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders through the common denominator of defective autophagy. ANN NEUROL 2025;98:932–950</p>

                <p>by Logan A. Becker, Francois Baccelli, Thibaud Taillefumier</p>

Even when driven by the same stimulus, neuronal responses are well-known to exhibit a striking level of spiking variability. In-vivo electrophysiological recordings also reveal a surprisingly large degree of variability at the subthreshold level. In prior work, we considered biophysically relevant neuronal models to account for the observed magnitude of membrane voltage fluctuations. We found that accounting for these fluctuations requires weak but nonzero synchrony in the spiking activity, in amount that are consistent with experimentally measured spiking correlations. Here we investigate whether such synchrony can explain additional statistical features of the measured neural activity, including neuronal voltage covariability and voltage skewness. Addressing this question involves conducting a generalized moment analysis of conductance-based neurons in response to input drives modeled as correlated jump processes. Technically, we perform such an analysis using fixed-point techniques from queuing theory that are applicable in the stationary regime of activity. We found that weak but nonzero synchrony can consistently explain the experimentally reported voltage covariance and skewness. This confirms the role of synchrony as a primary driver of cortical variability and supports that physiological neural activity emerges as a population-level phenomenon, especially in the spontaneous regime.

                <p>by Araven Tiroumalechetty, Elisa B. Frankel, Peri T. Kurshan</p>

The detection and characterization of fluorescent puncta are critical tasks in image analysis pipelines for fluorescence imaging. Existing methods for quantitative characterization of such puncta often suffer from biases and limitations, compromising the reliability and reproducibility of results. Moreover, the widespread adoption of many available analysis scripts is often hampered by over-optimization for specific samples, requiring extensive coding knowledge to repurpose for other datasets. We present <i>WormSNAP (Worm SyNapse Analysis Program)</i>, a license-free, stand-alone, no-code approach to automated unbiased detection and characterization of 2D fluorescent puncta, originally developed to characterize images of the synapses residing in <i>C. elegans</i> nerve cords but suitable for broader 2D fluorescence image analysis. <i>WormSNAP</i> incorporates a local means thresholding algorithm and a user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI) for efficient and accurate analysis of large datasets, with user control of thresholding and restriction parameters and visualization options for further refinement. <i>WormSNAP</i> also calculates three types of correlation metrics for 2-channel images, enabling users to select the ideal metric for their dataset. <i>WormSNAP</i> provides robust and accurate fluorescent puncta detection in a variety of conditions, accelerating the image analysis workflow from data acquisition to figure generation.

Degenerative musculoskeletal diseases like osteoarthritis can be initiated by joint injury. Injurious overloading-induced mechanical straining of articular cartilage and subsequent biological responses may trigger cartilage degradation. One early sign of degradation is loss of aggrecan content which is potentially accelerated near chondral lesions under physiological loading. Yet, the mechanoinflammatory mechanisms explaining time-dependent degradation in regions with disparate mechanical loading are unclear and challenging to assess with experiments alone. Here, we developed computational models unraveling potential mechanisms behind aggrecan content adaptation in fibril-reinforced porohyperelastic cartilage after single injurious overloading (50% compressive strain magnitude, 100%/s strain rate) followed by physiological cyclic loading (15% strain, 1 Hz, haversine waveform). The simulated adaptation of aggrecan content was compared spatially and at several time points to tissue composition found in Safranin-O-stained sections of young bovine knee cartilage subjected to the same loading protocols. Incorporating mechanical strain-driven cell damage and downstream proteolytic enzyme release, fluid flow-driven aggrecan depletion, and fluid pressure-stimulated regulation of aggrecan biosynthesis, the models agreed with experiments and exhibited 14%-points greater near-lesion aggrecan loss after 12 days of physiological loading compared to without loading. The near-lesion aggrecan loss was driven by fluid flow and proteolytic aggrecanase activity, while chondroprotective pro-anabolic responses (increased aggrecan biosynthesis) were prominent in the deeper tissue despite damaged superficial layer. This significant advancement in mechanistic understanding incorporated into cartilage adaptation model can help in development and guidance of personalized therapies, such as rehabilitation protocols and tissue-engineered constructs.

                <p>by Stephanie A. Wankowicz</p>

The Protein Data Bank (PDB) is one of the richest open‑source repositories in biology, housing over 242,000 macromolecular structural models alongside much of the experimental data that underpins these models. By systematically collecting, validating, and indexing these models, the PDB has accelerated structural biology discoveries, enabling researchers to compare new entries against a vast archive of solved structures and, more recently, powering protein structure prediction. Leveraging this wealth of data, structural bioinformatics has uncovered patterns, such as conserved protein folds, binding‑site features, or subtle conformational shifts among related proteins, that would be impossible to detect from any single structure. Through the democratization of structural data and open-source analytical tools, now amplified by the power of large language models, a broader community of researchers is equipped to drive new scientific discoveries using structural data. However, good structural bioinformatics requires understanding some of the nuances of the underlying experimental data, data encoding conventions, and quality control metrics that can affect a model’s precision, fit‑to‑data, and comparability. This knowledge, combined with developing good controls, statistics, and connections to other databases, is essential for drawing accurate and reliable conclusions from PDB data. Here, we outline 10 recommendations for doing structural bioinformatic analyses crafted to pave the way for others to uncover exciting discoveries.

                Background Misconduct in the academic community remains poorly understood among post-graduate dental students (PGDSs) in North Africa. Data on the knowledge of misconduct (KoM) level in this population is lacking. This brief report assessed KoM of Tunisian PGDSs’. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted at the Faculty of Dental Medicine of Monastir, involving 147 PGDSs registered in 2022. Students were recruited via email invitations and convenience sampling at a medical congress. A French survey (i.e. ; Laval University quiz) with 11 questions on KoM, offering three-choice answers (yes/no/maybe) was administered. Each correct answer received one point, and a total score below six indicated a low-level of KoM. Results The mean±SD KoM score of the 106 students who accepted to participate in the study was 4.4±1.8, indicating a low-level of KoM. The majority of PGDSs (85.85%) demonstrated a low-level of KoM. A comparison between subjective and objective assessments of KoM levels revealed that a significant percentage of PGDSs underestimated their knowledge (62.26% vs. 85.85%, respectively). Conclusion North-African PGDSs have a low-level of KoM. This emphasizes the need for further efforts to enhance awareness and promote better KoM in this population.

                Background Understanding the epidemiology of soccer injuries during specific international competitions is essential for customizing preventive strategies. Several studies have reported outcomes related to international competitions but, to the best of our knowledge, there has been no investigation into the injury patterns during any African Cup of Nations (AFCON) tournaments. This study aimed to analyze the observed events frequencies and their characteristics during the 2021 African Cup of Nations (AFCON), which took place in Cameroon from January 9 to February 6, 2022. Methods A video-based analysis covering 52 matches was conducted by two independent consultant physicians. They reviewed “observed events” replays to determine frequencies and characteristics ( i.e. ; mechanisms, body location, match moment, player substitution, absence in the next match, and referee decisions). Results The tournament involved 519 male players, comprising 275 African (ALP) and 244 Non-African (NALP) league players. Eighty-seven “observed events” occurred, with frequencies of 1.7 and 48.8 injuries per match and per 1000 match hours, respectively. Observed event frequency rose with competition stages, particularly contact mechanism injuries. Non-contact injuries (23/87) predominantly occurred after 60 minutes of play (19/23), with the thigh being the most frequently affected body part (18/87). Older age and playing time significantly correlated with observed event occurrence (p=0.032 and p<0.001, respectively). NALP midfielders and forwards were notably injured by contact mechanisms (36/45) in the attacking zone. Although non-contact mechanisms were more common in ALP than NALP (13/42 vs. 9/45), the difference lacked statistical significance (p=0.240), with a higher rate of muscle injuries (13/42 vs. 10/45, p=0.001). Conclusion Muscle-related events were the most frequently observed during the 2021 AFCON, with older age and longer playing time identified as key associated factors. These events were more prevalent in ALP compared to NALP.

                Background Land tenure inequality and the risk of land grabbing are persistent challenges in Indonesia, particularly within Special Economic Zones (SEZs). While SEZs are designed to attract investment and foster economic growth, they frequently lead to large-scale land acquisitions that can compromise the rights and livelihoods of local communities. Methods This study investigates the juridical-empirical aspects of land tenure within three Indonesian SEZs: Lido, Tanjung Lesung, and Mandalika. A qualitative approach was adopted, utilizing a Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) framework. Data collection involved document analysis, community surveys, and in-depth interviews with two respondents to gather both legal perspectives and lived experiences. Results The findings reveal that land tenure practices within SEZs exacerbate the risks of land grabbing, undermine customary land rights, and offer limited economic advantages, particularly concerning the absorption of local labor. Conclusion Addressing these critical issues necessitates enhanced legal protection, transparent land registration processes, robust community participation, and empowerment strategies. These measures should ensure that investment incentives are aligned with principles of fairness and sustainability. By framing agrarian justice as a core analytical lens, this research proposes a model for more equitable land governance within Indonesian SEZs and beyond.

                This study aims to explore influential and relevant factors affecting organizational performance. A Systematic Literature Review (SLR) approach was employed to address this objective. The systematic literature review in this study adheres to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. PRISMA was chosen because it provides a comprehensive and relevant framework for reviewing literature related to the research topic. Additionally, it offers a systematic protocol that enhances the quality and clarity of research reporting. Data were obtained from the Scopus database, covering publications from 2019 to 2024. The articles analyzed were selected based on predefined criteria. The findings reveal that the key determinants of organizational performance include knowledge management, sustainable development, performance assessment, supply chain management, and human resource management. These findings offer practical implications for organizations seeking to enhance their performance. The novelty of this study lies in its exclusive focus on uncovering the complex factors that influence organizational performance using the SLR method grounded in the PRISMA approach. By adopting this method, the study aims to provide deeper insights and nuanced understanding that goes beyond general knowledge, thereby enriching academic literature with a fresh perspective on the multifaceted factors shaping organizational success.

[version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Clinical studies can experience major loss to follow-up and reduced response rates to participant reported outcomes such as quality of life questionnaires, which can lead to a lack of statistical power for the analysis of these outcomes. A number of studies have been embedded within trials to investigate interventions to improve retention. Methods A Study Within a Trial (SWAT) was integrated into the Outcome Monitoring After Cardiac Surgery (OMACS) study, a large observational cardiac surgery study, to investigate whether the use of a theory-informed cover letter with 12-month follow-up questionnaires could improve study retention. OMACS study participants receiving 12-month follow-up questionnaires by post were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either a standard cover letter or a theory informed cover letter with their questionnaires. Study retention was assessed by the proportion of participants who returned 12-month follow-up questionnaires. Results Questionnaire return rates were similar between the two groups (67.4% with the standard cover letter compared to 68.5% with the theory-informed cover letter, odds ratio 1.05, 95% confidence interval (CI) [0.85 to 1.31]). The results of the OMACS SWAT were consistent with the previously reported meta-analysis (MA) by Gillies et al., with a revised risk difference of 3% (95% CI -1% to 6%) when including OMACS in the MA. Conclusions There is insufficient evidence to support the use of a theory-informed cover letter to increase study retention. We would recommend study teams explore alternative strategies for improving retention where needed.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To investigate whether deep brain stimulation (DBS) lead implant in the subthalamic nucleus and its associated “microlesion” effect impacts oscillatory activity in the hand area of motor cortex.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We examined cortical local field potentials in 31 patients before and after subthalamic nucleus lead implant at rest and during repetitive voluntary and passive contralateral upper limb movements. We computed continuous wavelet transforms of the signals and correlated (1) baseline spectral power and motor symptom severity and (2) changes in spectral power and contralateral motor symptoms related to microlesion.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Baseline motor symptom severity correlated with high-frequency broadband power in primary motor cortex during voluntary movements (200–300Hz: Pearson's r = 0.51, <i>p</i> = 0.014, 95% confidence interval [CI]: [0.15, 0.75]; and 300–500Hz: r = 0.44, <i>p</i> = 0.038, 95% CI: [0.06, 0.70]). Motor improvements from lead implant correlated with decreases in high gamma power in primary sensory cortex during voluntary movements (70–200Hz: r = 0.44, <i>p</i> = 0.035, 95% CI: [−0.07, 0.62]).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>How motor parkinsonism alters electrophysiology in cerebral cortex is unclear. Our findings suggest that both the severity of parkinsonism and its improvement from the microlesion effect are associated most closely with changes in high-frequency oscillatory activity in primary sensorimotor cortex. Better understanding the cortical dynamics of movement disorders could guide novel paradigms for adaptive DBS. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1187/v1?src=rss">Artificial Intelligence Adoption as a Driver of Innovation and Competitiveness in SMEs: A Bibliometric and Systematic Review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                This study employs a bibliometric and systematic literature review (B-SLR) approach, guided by the PRISMA 2021 framework, to investigate the transformative impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Drawing on peer-reviewed studies published between 2020 and 2024 across the Scopus databases, the review integrates quantitative mapping and qualitative synthesis to identify emerging research patterns, thematic concentrations, and methodological trends. The findings reveal a marked surge in scholarly engagement since 2020, reflecting growing recognition of AI as both a strategic and operational driver of competitiveness in SMEs. Three dominant thematic clusters emerge: (1) AI-driven innovation, encompassing applications such as machine learning, predictive analytics, automation, and process optimization; (2) entrepreneurial decision-making, highlighting how AI supports opportunity recognition, strategic planning, and market sensing; and (3) adoption barriers and enablers, focusing on organizational readiness, digital infrastructure, human capital, and financial capability. While the field demonstrates expanding theoretical and practical interest, significant gaps remain regarding methodological diversity, contextual variation across developing economies, and the integration of socio-ethical considerations in AI adoption. The study contributes by consolidating fragmented knowledge, mapping the intellectual structure of the domain, and offering actionable implications for policymakers, practitioners, and scholars seeking to leverage AI to foster innovation, digital resilience, and sustainable growth in SMEs.
