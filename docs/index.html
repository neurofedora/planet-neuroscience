              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neurexins Regulate GABA Co-release by Dopamine Neurons</a></h4>

              
                Midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons are key regulators of basal ganglia functions. The axonal domain of these neurons is highly complex, with a large subset of non-synaptic release sites and a smaller subset of synaptic terminals from which glutamate or GABA are released. The molecular mechanisms regulating the connectivity of DA neurons and their neurochemical identity are unknown. Here we tested the hypothesis that the trans-synaptic cell adhesion molecules neurexins (Nrxns) regulate DA neuron neurotransmission. Conditional deletion of all Nrxns in DA neurons (DAT::Nrxns KO) revealed that loss of Nrxns does not impair the basic development and ultrastructural characteristics of DA neuron terminals. However, loss of Nrxns caused an impairment of DA transmission revealed as a reduced rate of DA reuptake following activity-dependent DA release, decreased DA transporter levels, increased vesicular monoamine transporter expression and impaired amphetamine-induced locomotor activity. Strikingly, electrophysiological recording revealed an increase of GABA co-release from DA neuron axons in the striatum of the KO mice. These findings reveal that Nrxns act as key regulators of DA neuron connectivity and DA-mediated functions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">TRPV1-lineage somatosensory fibers communicate with taste neurons in the mouse parabrachial nucleus</a></h4>

              
                Trigeminal neurons supply somatosensation to craniofacial tissues. In mouse brain, ascending projections from medullary trigeminal neurons arrive at taste neurons in the autonomic parabrachial nucleus, suggesting taste neurons participate in somatosensory processing. However, the genetic cell types that support this convergence were undefined. Using Cre-directed optogenetics and in vivo neurophysiology in anesthetized mice of both sexes, here we studied whether TRPV1-lineage nociceptive and thermosensory fibers are primary neurons that drive trigeminal circuits reaching parabrachial taste cells. We monitored spiking activity in individual parabrachial neurons during photoexcitation of the terminals of TRPV1-lineage fibers that arrived at the dorsal spinal trigeminal nucleus pars caudalis, which relays orofacial somatosensory messages to the parabrachial area. Parabrachial neural responses to oral delivery of taste, chemesthetic, and thermal stimuli were also recorded. We found that optical excitation of TRPV1-lineage fibers frequently stimulated traditionally defined taste neurons in lateral parabrachial nuclei. The tuning of neurons across diverse tastes associated with their sensitivity to excitation of TRPV1-lineage fibers, which only sparingly engaged neurons oriented to preferred tastes like sucrose. Moreover, neurons that responded to photostimulation of TRPV1-lineage afferents showed strong responses to temperature including noxious heat, which predominantly excited parabrachial bitter taste cells. Multivariate analyses revealed the parabrachial confluence of TRPV1-lineage signals with taste captured sensory valence information shared across aversive gustatory, nociceptive, and thermal stimuli. Our results reveal that trigeminal fibers with defined roles in thermosensation and pain communicate with parabrachial taste neurons. This multisensory convergence supports dependencies between gustatory and somatosensory hedonic representations in the brain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Synaptotagmin-7 enhances phasic dopamine release</a></h4>

              
                Dopamine released from substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) neurons modulates movement, motivation, and reward. In addition to their tonic firing pattern, dopamine neurons also fire high-frequency bursts that cause superlinear increases in dopamine release. To examine this poorly understood form of short-term plasticity, we used the fluorescent dopamine sensor dLight1.3b to examine the role of the calcium-binding protein synaptotagmin-7 (SYT7). We report that SYT7 mediates a hidden component of facilitation, which was unmasked by lowering initial release probability, or by low-frequency stimulation of nerve terminals. In Syt7 KO neurons, there was profound synaptic depression that significantly reduced release during stimulations that mimic in vivo firing patterns of SNc neurons. D2-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic currents in the SNc revealed a similar role for SYT7 in somatodendritic release. Our results indicate that SYT7 drives short-term facilitation of release from dopamine neurons, which likely underlies frequency-dependence of dopamine signaling in vivo.

	<p>Vocalization is an important part of social communication, not only for humans but also for mice. Here, we show in a mouse model that functional deficiency of Sprouty-related EVH1 domain-containing 2 (SPRED2), a protein ubiquitously expressed in the brain, causes differences in social ultrasound vocalizations (USVs), using an uncomplicated and reliable experimental setting of a short meeting of two individuals. SPRED2 mutant mice show an OCD-like behaviour, accompanied by an increased release of stress hormones from the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis, both factors probably influencing USV usage. To determine genotype-related differences in USV usage, we analyzed call rate, subtype profile, and acoustic parameters (i.e., duration, bandwidth, and mean peak frequency) in young and old SPRED2-KO mice. We recorded USVs of interacting male and female mice, and analyzed the calls with the deep-learning DeepSqueak software, which was trained to recognize and categorize the emitted USVs. Our findings provide the first classification of SPRED2-KO vs. wild-type mouse USVs using neural networks and reveal significant differences in their development and use of calls. Our results show, first, that simple experimental settings in combination with deep learning are successful at identifying genotype-dependent USV usage and, second, that SPRED2 deficiency negatively affects the vocalization usage and social communication of mice.</p>

	<p>The purpose of the study was to systematically review the evidence on the effects of an acute bout of exercise on concurrent performance of core executive function (EF) during exercise in adults. Four electronic databases (i.e., PubMed, Web of Science, PsycINFO, and SportDiscus) were searched from inception dates to 30 December 2020. The literature searches were conducted using the combinations of two groups of relevant items related to exercise and executive function. Articles were limited to human studies in adults. The search process, study selection, data extraction, and study quality assessments were carried out independently by two researchers. A total of 4899 studies were identified. Twenty-two studies met our inclusion criteria. Of the 42 reported outcomes in the 22 studies, 13 (31%) of the 42 outcomes showed that core EF performance was enhanced during exercise and 14 (33%) found that core EF performance did not differ from control conditions. Fifteen (36%) found that core EF performance was impaired. Notably, improved EF performances tend to be observed during moderate-intensity exercise, whereas impaired EF performances were more likely to be observed at vigorous-high intensity. The review suggests mixed findings regarding the effects of an acute bout of exercise on concurrent performance of core EF. Exercise intensity seems to influence the effects. The underlying neural mechanisms remain to be elucidated.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Adaptive coding of pain prediction error in the anterior insula</a></h4>

              
                Background: To reduce the computational demands of the task of determining values, the brain is thought to engage in adaptive coding, where the sensitivity of some neurons to value is modulated by contextual information. There is good behavioural evidence that pain is coded adaptively, but controversy regarding the underlying neural mechanism. Additionally, there is evidence that reward prediction errors are coded adaptively, but no parallel evidence regarding pain prediction errors. Methods: We tested the hypothesis that pain prediction errors are coded adaptively by scanning 19 healthy adults with fMRI while they performed a cued pain task. Our analysis followed an axiomatic approach. Results: We found that the left anterior insula was the only region which was sensitive both to predicted pain magnitudes and the unexpectedness of pain delivery, but not to the magnitude of delivered pain. Conclusions: This pattern suggests that the left anterior insula is part of a neural mechanism that serves the adaptive prediction error of pain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Formation of multinucleated globoid cells in Krabbe iPSC-derived microglia cultures: a preliminary investigation</a></h4>

              
                Globoid cell leukodystrophy (Krabbe disease) is a severe demyelinating, neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disorder caused by deficiency in glycosphingolipid catabolic enzyme galactosylceramidase (GALC). Histologically, Krabbe disease is characterized by the appearance of large multinucleated globoid cells that express classical macrophage markers (both of brain-resident microglia and peripheral monocyte-derived). Globoid cells reside near areas of degeneration; however, their functional significance in disease progression remains unclear. In the current study, we differentiated microglia-like cells from iPSCs from a donor with infantile Krabbe disease and compared them to microglia generated from two healthy controls and two donors with the lysosomal storage disorder metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD), which is genetically distinct from Krabbe disease but presents similarly in terms of severity of demyelination and neurodegeneration. We report the novel finding of prominent formation of giant multinucleated globoid cells from the microglia derived from the Krabbe donor, but not from healthy control or MLD donors. The Krabbe microglia displayed reduced IL-6 protein expression upon stimulation with lipopolysaccharide, and the multinucleated globoid cells themselves appeared deficient in phagocytosis of both disease-relevant myelin debris and E. coli, together hinting at an impairment of normal function. The formation of the globoid cells could be attenuated by fully replacing the medium following passaging, suggesting that yet-to-be determined secreted factors are influencing cell fusion in our culture system. While preliminary, our results imply that globoid cells may be detrimental in Krabbe disease by hindering the normal function of brain-residing macrophages.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dynamic Functional Brain Reconfiguration During Sustained Pain</a></h4>

              
                Pain is constructed through complex interactions among multiple brain systems, but it remains unclear how functional brain network representations are dynamically reconfigured over time while experiencing pain. Here, we investigated the dynamic changes in the functional brain networks during 20-min capsaicin-induced sustained orofacial pain. In the early stage, the orofacial areas of the primary somatomotor cortex were separated from the other primary somatomotor cortices and integrated with subcortical and frontoparietal regions, constituting a brain-wide pain supersystem. As pain decreased over time, the subcortical and frontoparietal regions were separated from this pain supersystem and connected to multiple cerebellar regions. Machine-learning models based on these dynamic network features showed significant predictions of changes in pain experience across two independent datasets (n = 48 and 74). This study provides new insights into how multiple brain systems dynamically interact to construct and modulate pain experience, potentially advancing our mechanistic understanding of chronic pain.

                The dynamics and connectivity of neural circuits continuously change during an animal's lifetime on timescales ranging from milliseconds to days. Therefore, to investigate how biological networks accomplish remarkable cognitive and behavioral tasks, minimally invasive methods are needed to perform repeated measurements, or perturbations of neural circuits in behaving animals across time. Such tools have been developed to investigate the brain but similar approaches are lacking for comprehensively and repeatedly recording motor circuits in behaving animals. Here we describe a suite of microfabricated technologies that enable long-term, minimally invasive optical recordings of the adult Drosophila melanogaster ventral nerve cord (VNC)---neural tissues that are functionally equivalent to the vertebrate spinal cord. These tools consist of (i) a manipulator arm that permits the insertion of (ii) a compliant implant into the thorax to expose the imaging region of interest; (iii) a numbered, transparent polymer window that encloses and provides optical access to the inside of the thorax, and (iv) a hinged remounting stage that allows gentle and repeated tethering of an implanted animal for two-photon imaging. We validate and illustrate the utility of our toolkit in several ways. First, we show that the thoracic implant and window have minimal impact on animal behavior and survival while also enabling neural recordings from individual animals across at least one month. Second, we follow the degradation of chordotonal organ mechanosensory nerve terminals in the VNC over weeks after leg amputation. Third, because our tools allow recordings of the VNC with the gut intact, we discover waves of neural population activity following ingestion of a high-concentration caffeine solution. In summary, our microfabricated toolkit makes it possible to longitudinally monitor anatomical and functional changes in premotor and motor neural circuits, and more generally opens up the long-term investigation of thoracic tissues.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A novel automated approach for improving standardization of the marble burying test enables quantification of burying bouts and activity characteristics</a></h4>

              
                The marble burying test is a commonly used paradigm to screen phenotypes in mouse models of neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. The current methodological approach relies solely on reporting the number of buried marbles at the end of the test. By measuring the proxy of the behavior (buried marbles), rather than the behavior itself (burying bouts), many important characteristics regarding the temporal aspect of this assay are lost. Here we introduce a novel, automated method to quantify mouse behavior throughout the duration of the marble burying test with the focus on the burying bouts. Using open-source software packages, we trained a supervised machine learning algorithm (the classifier) to distinguish burying behavior in freely moving mice. In order to confirm the classifier's accuracy and uncover the behavioral meaning of the marble burying test, we performed marble burying test in three mouse models: Ube3am-/p+ (Angelman Syndrome model), Shank2-/- (autism model), and Sapap3-/- (obsessive-compulsive disorder model) mice. The classifier scored burying behavior accurately and consistent with the literature in the Ube3am-/p+ mice, which showed decreased levels of burying compared to controls. Shank2-/- mice showed a similar pattern of decreased burying behavior, which was not found in Sapap3-/- mice. Tracking mouse behavior throughout the test enabled us to quantify activity characteristics, revealing hypoactivity in Ube3am-/p+ and hyperactivity in the Shank2-/- mice, indicating that mouse activity is unrelated to burying behavior. Together, we demonstrate that our classifier is an accurate method for the analysis of the marble burying test, providing more information than the currently used methods.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Propofol modulates functional connectivity signatures of sustained attention</a></h4>

              
                Sustained attention is a critical cognitive function reflected in an individuals whole-brain pattern of fMRI functional connectivity. However sustained attention is not a purely static trait. Rather, attention waxes and wanes over time. Do functional brain networks that underlie individual differences in sustained attention also underlie changes in attentional state? To investigate, we replicate the finding that a validated connectome-based model of individual differences in sustained attention tracks pharmacologically induced changes in attentional state. Specifically, preregistered analyses revealed that participants exhibited functional connectivity signatures of stronger attention when awake than when under deep sedation with the anesthetic agent propofol. Furthermore, this effect was relatively specific to the predefined sustained attention networks: propofol administration modulated strength of the sustained attention networks more than it modulated strength of canonical resting-state networks and a network defined to predict fluid intelligence, and the functional connections most affected by propofol sedation overlapped with the sustained attention networks. Thus, propofol modulates functional connectivity signatures of sustained attention within individuals. More broadly these findings underscore the utility of pharmacological intervention in testing both the generalizability and specificity of network-based models of cognitive function.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Amyloid-beta and tau pathologies are both necessary to induce novel stage-specific microglia subtypes during Alzheimer's disease progression.</a></h4>

              
                It is unknown whether specific microglia are selectively induced by amyloid-{beta}(A{beta}), tau pathologies, or both in combination. To address this, we use single-cell RNA-sequencing to profile mice bearing both A{beta} and tau pathologies during Alzheimer's disease (AD). We identify novel microglia subtypes induced in a disease stage-specific manner. We show that during early-stage disease, interferon signaling induces a subtype of microglia termed EADAM. During late-stage disease, a second microglia subtype termed LADAM is detected. While EADAM and LADAM-like microglia are observed in other neurodegenerative models, the magnitude and composition of subtype markers are distinct from microglia observed with AD-like pathology. The pattern of EADAM- and LADAM-associated gene expression is observed in microglia from human AD, during the early and late stages of disease, respectively. Furthermore, we observe that several siglec genes are selectively expressed in either EADAM or LADAM. Siglecg is expressed in white-matter-associated LADAM, and expression of the human orthologue of Siglecg is progressively elevated in AD-stage-dependent manner but not shown in non-AD tauopathy. Our findings imply that both A{beta} and tau pathologies are required for disease stage-specific induction of EADAM and LADAM.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex supports speech perception in listeners with cochlear implants</a></h4>

              
                Cochlear implants are neuroprosthetic devices that can restore hearing in individuals with severe to profound hearing loss by electrically stimulating the auditory nerve. Because of physical limitations on the precision of this stimulation, the acoustic information delivered by a cochlear implant does not convey the same level of spectral detail as that conveyed by normal hearing. As a result, speech understanding in listeners with cochlear implants is typically poorer and more effortful than in listeners with normal hearing. The brain networks supporting speech understanding in listeners with cochlear implants are not well understood, partly due to difficulties obtaining functional neuroimaging data in this population. In the current study, we assessed the brain regions supporting spoken word understanding in adult listeners with right unilateral cochlear implants (n=20) and matched controls (n=18) using high-density diffuse optical tomography (HD-DOT), a quiet and non-invasive imaging modality with spatial resolution comparable to that of functional MRI. We found that while listening to spoken words in quiet, listeners with cochlear implants showed greater activity in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, overlapping with functionally-defined domain-general processing seen in a spatial working memory task. These results suggest that listeners with cochlear implants require greater cognitive processing during speech understanding than listeners with normal hearing, supported by compensatory recruitment in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The Respiratory Resistance Sensitivity Task: An Automated Method for Quantifying Respiratory Interoception and Metacognition</a></h4>

              
                The ability to sense, monitor, and control respiration - e.g., respiratory interoception (henceforth, respiroception) is a core homeostatic ability. Beyond the mere regulation of gas exchange, enhanced awareness of respiratory sensations is directly related to psychiatric symptoms such as panic and anxiety. Indeed, chronic breathlessness (dyspnea) is associated with a fourfold increase in the risk of developing depression and anxiety, and the regulation of the breath is a key aspect of many mindfulness-based approaches to the treatment of mental illness. Physiologically speaking, the ability to accurately monitor respiratory sensations is important for optimizing cardiorespiratory function during athletic exertion, and can be a key indicator of illness. Given the important role of respiroception in mental and physical health, it is unsurprising that there is increased interest in the quantification of respiratory psychophysiology across different perceptual and metacognitive levels of the psychological hierarchy. Compared to other more popular modalities of interoception, such as in the cardiac domain, there are relatively few methods available for measuring aspects of respiroception. Existing inspiratory loading tasks are difficult to administer and frequently require expensive medical equipment, or offer poor granularity in their quantification of respiratory-related perceptual ability. To facilitate the study of respiroception, we here present a new, fully automated and computer-controlled apparatus and psychophysiological method, which can flexibly and easily measure respiratory-related interoceptive sensitivity, bias and metacognition, in as little as 30 minutes of testing, using easy to make 3D printable parts.

                This paper introduces a novel EEG channel selection method to determine which channel interrelationships provide the best classification accuracy between a group of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and a cohort of age matched healthy controls (HC). Thereby, determine which inter-relationships are more important for the in-depth dynamical analysis to further understand how neurodegenerative diseases such as AD affects global and local brain dynamics. The channel selection methodology uses kernel-based nonlinear manifold learning via Isomap and Gaussian Process Latent Variable Model (Isomap-GPLVM). The Isomap-GPLVM method is employed to learn both the spatial and temporal local similarities and global dissimilarities present within the EEG data structures. The resulting kernel (dis)similarity matrix is used as a measure of synchrony between EEG channels. Based on this information, channel-specific linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification is then used to determine which spatio-temporal channel inter-relationships are more important for in-depth dynamical analysis. In this work, the analysis of EEG data from HC and AD patients is presented as a case study. Our analysis shows that inter-relationships between channels in the fronto-parietal region and the rest are better at differentiating between AD and HC groups.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Bilaterally Reduced Rolandic Beta Band Activity in Minor Stroke Patients</a></h4>

              
                Objective: Stroke patients with hemiparesis display decreased beta band (13-25 Hz) rolandic activity, correlating to impaired motor function. However, patients without significant weakness, with small lesions far from sensorimotor cortex, nevertheless exhibit bilateral decreased motor dexterity and slowed reaction times. We investigate whether these minor stroke patients also display abnormal beta band activity. Methods: Magnetoencephalographic (MEG) data were collected from nine minor stroke patients (NIHSS < 4) without significant hemiparesis, at ~1 and ~6 months postinfarct, and eight age-similar controls. Rolandic relative beta power during matching tasks and resting state, and Beta Event Related (De)Synchronization (ERD/ERS) during button press responses were analyzed. Results: Regardless of lesion location, patients had significantly reduced relative beta power and ERS compared to controls. Abnormalities persisted over visits, and were present in both ipsi- and contra-lesional hemispheres, consistent with bilateral impairments in motor dexterity and speed. Conclusions: Minor stroke patients without severe weakness display reduced rolandic beta band activity in both hemispheres, which may be linked to bilaterally impaired dexterity and processing speed, implicating global connectivity dysfunction affecting sensorimotor cortex. Significance: Rolandic beta band activity may be a potential biomarker and treatment target, even for minor stroke patients with small lesions far from sensorimotor areas.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Intratumoral and extratumoral synapses are required for glioblastoma progression in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Glioblastoma (GB) is the most aggressive, lethal and frequent primary brain tumor. It originates from glial cells and is characterized by rapid expansion through infiltration. GB cells interact with the microenvironment and healthy surrounding tissues, mostly neurons and vessels. GB cells project tumor microtubes (TMs) that contact with neurons and exchange signaling molecules related to Wingless/WNT, JNK, Insulin or Neuroligin-3 pathways. This cell to cell communication promotes GB expansion and neurodegeneration. Moreover, healthy neurons form glutamatergic functional synapses with GB cells which facilitate GB expansion and premature death in mouse GB xerograph models. Targeting signaling and synaptic components of GB progression may become a suitable strategy against glioblastoma. In a Drosophila GB model, we have determined the post-synaptic nature of GB cells with respect to neurons, and the contribution of post-synaptic genes expressed in GB cells to tumor progression. In addition, we document the presence of intratumoral synapses between GB cells, and the functional contribution of pre-synaptic genes to GB calcium dependent activity and expansion. Finally, we explore the relevance of synaptic genes in GB cells to the lifespan reduction caused by GB advance. Our results indicate that both presynaptic and postsynaptic proteins play a role in GB progression and lethality.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Behavioral and molecular underpinnings of performance variability in eyeblink conditioning in male and female mice</a></h4>

              
                The functional and molecular sources of behavioral variability in mice are not fully understood. As a consequence, the predominant use of male mice has become a standard in animal reseach, under the assumption that males are less variable than females. Similarly, to homogenize genetic background, neuroscience studies have almost exclusively used the C57BL/6 (B6) strain. Here, we examined individual differences in performance in the context of associative learning. We performed delayed eyeblink conditioning while recording locomotor activity in mice from both sexes in two strains (B6 and B6CBAF1). Further, we used a C-FOS immunostaining approach to explore brain areas involved in eyeblink conditioning across subjects, and correlate them with behavioral performance. We found that B6 male and female mice show comparable variability in this task and that females reach higher learning scores. We found a strong positive correlation across sexes between learning scores and voluntary locomotion. C-FOS immunostainings revealed positive correlations between C-FOS positive cell density and learning in the cerebellar cortex as well as multiple, previously unreported extra-cerebellar areas. We found consistent and comparable correlations in eyeblink performance and C-fos expression in B6 and B6CBAF1 females and males. Taken together, we show that differences in motor behavior and activity across brain areas correlate with learning scores during eyeblink conditioning across strains and sexes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Individual differences in visual search performance extend from artificial arrays to naturalistic environments.</a></h4>

              
                Visual search is a universal human activity in naturalistic environments. Traditionally, visual search is investigated under tightly controlled conditions, where head-restricted participants locate a minimalistic target in a cluttered array presented on a computer screen. Do classic findings of visual search extend to naturalistic settings, where participants actively explore complex, real-world scenes? Here, we leverage advances in virtual reality (VR) technology to relate individual differences in classic visual search paradigms to naturalistic search behavior. In a naturalistic visual search task, participants looked for an object within their environment via a combination of head-turns and eye-movements using a head-mounted display. Then, in a classic visual search task, participants searched for a target within a simple array of colored letters using only eye-movements. We tested how set size, a property known to limit visual search within computer displays, predicts the efficiency of search behavior inside immersive, real-world scenes that vary in levels of visual clutter. We found that participants' search performance was impacted by the level of visual clutter within real-world scenes. Critically, we also observed that individual differences in visual search efficiency in classic search predicted efficiency in real-world search, but only when the comparison was limited to the forward-facing field of view for real-world search. These results demonstrate that set size is a reliable predictor of individual performance across computer-based and active, real-world visual search behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cholinergic modulation of distinct inhibitory domains in granule cells of the olfactory bulb</a></h4>

              
                Early olfactory processing relies on a large population of inhibitory neurons in the olfactory bulb (OB), the granule cells (GCs). GCs inhibit the OB output neurons, the mitral and tufted cells (M/TCs), shaping their responses to odors both in the spatial and temporal domains, therefore, the activity of GCs is finely tuned by local and centrifugal excitatory and inhibitory inputs. While the circuit substrates underlying regulatory inputs onto GCs are well-established, how they are locally modulated remains unclear. Here, we examine the regulation of GABAergic inhibition onto GCs by acetylcholine, a main neuromodulatory transmitter released in the OB, by basal forebrain (BF) neurons. In acute brain slices from male and female mice, we show that activation of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) produces opposing effects on local and centrifugal inhibition onto GCs. By using electrophysiology, laser uncaging and optogenetics we show that the kinetics of GABAergic currents in GCs could be correlated with distal and proximal spatial domains from where they originate, along the GC somatodendritic axis. Proximal inhibition from BF afferents, is suppressed by activation of M2/M4-mAChRs. In contrast, distal local inhibition from deep short axon cells (dSACs) is enhanced by activation of M3-mAChRs. Furthermore, we show that the cholinergic enhancement of distal inhibition in GCs reduces the extent of dendrodendritic inhibition in MCs. Interestingly, the excitatory cortical feedback, which also targets the proximal region of GCs, was not modulated by acetylcholine, suggesting that muscarinic activation shifts the synaptic balance towards excitation in GCs. Together, these results suggest that BF cholinergic inputs to the OB fine tune GC-mediated inhibition of M/TCs by differentially modulating the proximal and distal domains of inhibition in GCs.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cortical Spheroid Model for Studying the Effects of Ischemic Brain Injury</a></h4>

              
                Stroke is a devastating neurological disorder and a leading cause of death and long-term disability. Despite many decades of research, there are still very few therapeutic options for patients suffering from stroke or its consequences. This is partially due to the limitations of current research models, including traditional in vitro models which lack the three-dimensional (3D) architecture and cellular make-up of the in vivo brain. 3D spheroids derived from primary postnatal rat cortex provide an in vivo-relevant model containing a similar cellular composition to the native cortex and a cell-synthesized extracellular matrix. These spheroids are cost-effective, highly reproducible, and can be produced in a high-throughput manner, making this model an ideal candidate for screening potential therapeutics. To study the cellular and molecular mechanisms of stroke in this model, spheroids were deprived of glucose, oxygen, or both oxygen and glucose for 24 hours. Both oxygen and oxygen-glucose deprived spheroids demonstrated many of the hallmarks of stroke, including a decrease in metabolism, an increase in neural dysfunction, and an increase in reactive astrocytes. Pretreatment of spheroids with the antioxidant agent N-acetylcysteine (NAC) mitigated the decrease in ATP seen after 24 hours of oxygen-glucose deprivation. Together, these results show the utility of our 3D cortical spheroid model for studying ischemic injury and its potential for screening stroke therapeutics.

                The maturation of sleep behavior across a lifespan (sleep ontogeny) is an evolutionarily conserved phenomenon. Mammalian studies have shown that in addition to increased sleep duration, early life sleep exhibits stark differences compared to mature sleep with regard to the amount of time spent in certain sleep states. How intrinsic maturation of sleep output circuits contributes to sleep ontogeny is poorly understood. The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster exhibits multifaceted changes to sleep from juvenile to mature adulthood. Here, we use a non-invasive probabilistic approach to investigate changes in sleep architecture in juvenile and mature flies. Increased sleep in juvenile flies is driven primarily by a decreased probability of transitioning to wake, and characterized by more time in deeper sleep states. Functional manipulations of sleep-promoting neurons in the dFB suggest these neurons differentially regulate sleep in juvenile and mature flies. Transcriptomic analysis of dFB neurons at different ages and a subsequent RNAi screen implicate genes involved in distinct molecular processes in sleep control of juvenile and mature flies. These results reveal that dynamic transcriptional states of sleep output neurons contribute to changes in sleep across the lifespan.

                Alzheimers disease (AD) is one of the foremost neurodegenerative diseases, characterized by beta-amyloid (A{beta}) plaques and significant progressive memory loss. In AD, astrocytes are known to take up and clear A{beta} plaques. However, how A{beta} induces pathogenesis and memory impairment in AD remains elusive. We report that normal astrocytes show non-cyclic urea metabolism, whereas A{beta}-treated astrocytes show switched-on urea cycle with upregulated enzymes and accumulated entering-metabolite aspartate, starting-substrate ammonia, end-product urea, and side-product putrescine. Gene-silencing of astrocytic ornithine decarboxylase-1 (ODC1), facilitating ornithine-to-putrescine conversion, boosts urea cycle and eliminates aberrant putrescine and its toxic by-products ammonia, H2O2, and GABA to recover from reactive astrogliosis and memory impairment in AD model. Our findings implicate that astrocytic urea cycle exerts opposing roles of beneficial A{beta} detoxification and detrimental memory impairment in AD. We propose ODC1-inhibition as a promising therapeutic strategy for AD to facilitate removal of toxic molecules and prevent memory loss.

                Chronic pain and depression are frequently comorbid and ketamine has emerged as a potentially promising therapy. But the molecular mechanisms underlying comorbid depressive symptoms in chronic pain and ketamine antidepressant effects remain elusive. Here, we show that Tiam1 orchestrates synaptic structural and functional remodeling in anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) neurons via actin cytoskeleton reorganization and synaptic NMDAR stabilization. This Tiam1-coordinated synaptic plasticity underpins ACC hyperactivity and drives chronic pain-induced depressive-like behaviors. Ketamine induces sustained antidepressant effects in chronic pain by blocking Tiam1-mediated synaptic structural and functional plasticity in ACC neurons. Our results reveal Tiam1 as a key factor in the pathophysiology of chronic pain-induced depression and in the sustained antidepressant effects of ketamine in ACC neurons.

                Excitation-inhibition (EI) balance may be required for the organisation of brain dynamics to a phase transition, criticality, which confers computational benefits. Brain pathology associated with EI imbalance may therefore occur due to a deviation from criticality. However, evidence linking critical dynamics with EI imbalance-induced pathology is lacking. Here, we studied the effect of EI imbalance-induced epileptic seizures on brain dynamics, using in vivo whole-brain 2-photon imaging of GCaMP6s larval zebrafish at single-neuron resolution. We demonstrate the importance of EI balance for criticality, with EI imbalance causing a loss of whole-brain critical statistics. Using network models we show that a reorganisation of network topology drives this loss of criticality. Seizure dynamics match theoretical predictions for networks driven away from a phase transition into disorder, with the emergence of chaos and a loss of network-mediated separation, dynamic range and metastability. These results demonstrate that EI imbalance drives a pathological deviation from criticality.

                Coordinated movement is thought to be simplified by the nervous system through the activation of muscle synergies. Current approaches to muscle synergy extraction rely on dimensionality reduction algorithms that impose limiting constraints. To capture large-scale interactions between muscle activations, a more generalised approach that considers the complexity and nonlinearity of the motor system is required. Here we developed a novel framework for muscle synergy extraction that relaxes model assumptions by using a combination of information- and network theory and dimensionality reduction. This novel framework can capture spatial, temporal and spatiotemporal interactions, producing distinct spatial groupings and both tonic and phasic temporal patterns. Furthermore, our framework identifies submodular structures in the extracted synergies that exemplify the fractal modularity of the human motor system. To demonstrate the versatility of the methodology, we applied it to two benchmark datasets of arm and whole-body reaching movements. Readily interpretable muscle synergies spanning multiple spatial and temporal scales were identified that demonstrated significant task dependence, ability to capture trial-to-trial fluctuations, a scale-invariance with dataset complexity and a substantial concordance across participants. Finally, we position this framework as a bridge between existing models and recent network-theoretic endeavours by discussing the continuity and novelty of the presented findings.

                A long-range circuit linking anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) to primary visual cortex (V1) has been previously proposed to mediate visual selective attention in mice during visually guided behaviour. Here we used in vivo two-photon functional imaging to measure endogenous activity of ACC neurons projecting to layer 1 of V1 (ACC-V1axons) in mice either passively viewing stimuli or performing a go/no-go visually guided task. We observed that while ACC-V1axons were recruited under these conditions, this was not linked to enhancement of neural or behavioural measures of sensory coding. Instead, ACC-V1axon activity was observed to be associated with licking behaviour, modulated by reward, and biased towards task relevant sensory cortex.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Enhanced mismatch negativity responses in harmonic compared to inharmonic sound sequences</a></h4>

              
                Many natural sounds have frequency spectra composed of integer multiples of a fundamental frequency. This property, known as harmonicity, plays an important role in auditory information processing. However, the extent to which harmonicity influences the processing of sound features beyond pitch is still unclear. This is interesting because harmonic sounds have lower information entropy than inharmonic sounds. According to predictive processing accounts of perception, this property could produce more salient neural responses due to the brain weighting of sensory signals according to their uncertainty. In the present study, we used electroencephalography to investigate brain responses to harmonic and inharmonic sounds commonly occurring in music: piano tones and hi-hat cymbal sounds. In a multi-feature oddball paradigm, we measured mismatch negativity (MMN) and P3a responses to timbre, intensity, and location deviants in listeners with and without congenital amusia, an impairment of pitch processing. As hypothesized, we observed larger amplitudes and earlier latencies for harmonic compared to inharmonic sounds for both MMN and P3a responses. These harmonicity effects were modulated by sound feature. Moreover, the difference in P3a latency between harmonic and inharmonic sounds was larger for controls than amusics. We propose an explanation of these results based on predictive coding and discuss the relationship between harmonicity, information entropy, and precision weighting of prediction errors.

                The search for psychiatric biomarkers has remained elusive, in part, due to high comorbidity, low specificity, and poor concordance between neurobiological abnormalities and existing diagnostic categories. Developmental shifts in symptom expression and brain function across the lifespan further complicate biomarker identification. Recent studies suggest that focusing on cognition may be a pathway forward: Cognitive dysfunction is a common feature across psychiatric disorders. Individual differences in cognition may reflect variability in the connectivity of underlying neurocognitive brain networks, and predict psychopathology at different developmental periods. In the present study we identified brain-based dimensions of general cognitive capacity and psychopathology using sparse canonical correlation analysis (sCCA) in a sample of 7,383 preadolescents from the Adolescent Brian Cognitive Development (ABCD) study. This analysis revealed correlated patterns of functional connectivity with cognitive control capacity and psychopathology. Specifically, the results identified a single connectome-based latent brain variate that was positively correlated with performance on cognitive measures across domains and negatively correlated with parent-reported psychopathology across diagnoses and domains. Functional connectivity loadings for the brain variate were across distributed cortical and subcortical brain networks and a dose-dependent relationship with psychopathology based upon the cumulative number of psychiatric diagnoses was observed. These findings provide preliminary evidence for a connectome-based biomarker that indexes individual differences in cognitive control and predicts transdiagnostic psychopathology in a dose-dependent fashion.

                Electrophysiological power spectra typically consist of two components: An aperiodic part usually following an 1/f power law P{propto}1/f{beta} and periodic components appearing as spectral peaks. While the investigation of the periodic parts, commonly referred to as neural oscillations, has received considerable attention, the study of the aperiodic part has only recently gained more interest. The periodic part is usually quantified by center frequencies, powers, and bandwidths, while the aperiodic part is parameterized by the y-intercept and the 1/f exponent {beta}. For investigation of either part, however, it is essential to separate the two components. In this article, we scrutinize two frequently used methods, FOOOF (Fitting Oscillations & One-Over-F) and IRASA (Irregular Resampling Auto-Spectral Analysis), that are commonly used to separate the periodic from the aperiodic component. We evaluate these methods using diverse spectra obtained with electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG), and local field potential (LFP) recordings relating to three independent research datasets. Each method and each dataset poses distinct challenges for the extraction of both spectral parts. The specific spectral features hindering the periodic and aperiodic separation are highlighted by simulations of power spectra emphasizing these features. Through comparison with the simulation parameters defined a priori, the parameterization error of each method is quantified. Based on the real and simulated power spectra, we evaluate the advantages of both methods, discuss common challenges, note which spectral features impede the separation, assess the computational costs, and propose recommendations on how to use them.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Decoding of cortex-wide brain activity from local recordings of neural potentials</a></h4>

              
                Objective. Electrical recordings of neural activity from brain surface have been widely employed in basic neuroscience research and clinical practice for investigations of neural circuit functions, brain-computer interfaces, and treatments for neurological disorders. Traditionally, these surface potentials have been believed to mainly reflect local neural activity. It is not known how informative the locally recorded surface potentials are for the neural activities across multiple cortical regions. Approach. To investigate that, we perform simultaneous local electrical recording and wide-field calcium imaging in awake head-fixed mice. Using a recurrent neural network model, we try to decode the calcium fluorescence activity of multiple cortical regions from local electrical recordings. Main results. The mean activity of different cortical regions could be decoded from locally recorded surface potentials. Also, each frequency band of surface potentials differentially encodes activities from multiple cortical regions so that including all the frequency bands in the decoding model gives the highest decoding performance. Despite the close spacing between recording channels, surface potentials from different channels provide complementary information about the large-scale cortical activity and the decoding performance continues to improve as more channels are included. Finally, we demonstrate the successful decoding of whole dorsal cortex activity at pixel-level using locally recorded surface potentials. Significance. These results show that the locally recorded surface potentials indeed contain rich information of the large-scale neural activities, which could be further demixed to recover the neural activity across individual cortical regions. In the future, our cross-modality inference approach could be adapted to virtually reconstruct cortex-wide brain activity, greatly expanding the spatial reach of surface electrical recordings without increasing invasiveness. Furthermore, it could be used to facilitate imaging neural activity across the whole cortex in freely moving animals, without requirement of head-fixed microscopy configurations.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dysfunctional temporal stages of eye-gaze perception in adults with ADHD: a high-density EEG study</a></h4>

              
                ADHD have been associated with social cognitive impairments across the lifespan, but no studies have specifically addressed the presence of abnormalities in eye-gaze processing in the adult brain. This study investigated the neural basis of eye-gaze perception in adults with ADHD using event-related potentials (ERP). Twenty-three ADHD and 23 controls performed a delayed face-matching task with neutral faces that had either direct or averted gaze. ERPs were classified using microstate analyses. ADHD and controls displayed similar P100 and N170 microstates. ADHD was associated with cluster abnormalities in the attention-sensitive P200 to direct gaze, and in the N250 related to facial recognition. For direct gaze, source localization revealed reduced activity in ADHD for the P200 in the left/midline cerebellum, as well as in a cingulate-occipital network at the N250. These results suggest brain impairments involving eye-gaze decoding in adults with ADHD, suggesting that neural deficits persist across the lifespan.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Unifying turbulent dynamics framework distinguishes different brain states</a></h4>

              
                Recently, significant advances have been made by identifying the levels of synchronicity of the underlying dynamics of a given brain state. This research has demonstrated that unconscious dynamics tend to be more synchronous than those found in conscious states, which are more asynchronous. Here we go beyond this dichotomy to demonstrate that the different brain states are always underpinned by spatiotemporal chaos but with dissociable turbulent dynamics. We investigated human neuroimaging data from different brain states (resting state, meditation, deep sleep, and disorders of consciousness after coma) and were able to distinguish between them using complementary model-free and model-based measures of turbulent information transmission. Our model-free approach used recent advances describing a measure of information cascade across spatial scales using tools from turbulence theory. Complementarily, our model-based approach used exhaustive in silico perturbations of whole-brain models fitted to the empirical neuroimaging data, which allowed us to study the information encoding capabilities of the brain states. Overall, the current framework demonstrates that different levels of turbulent dynamics are fundamental for describing and differentiating between brain states.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Spatial signatures of anesthesia-induced burst-suppression differ between primates and rodents</a></h4>

              
                During deep anesthesia, the electroencephalographic (EEG) signal of the brain alternates between bursts of activity and periods of relative silence (suppressions). The origin of burst-suppression and its distribution across the brain remain matters of debate. In this work, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to map the brain areas involved in anesthesia-induced burst-suppression across four mammalian species: humans, long-tailed macaques, common marmosets, and rats. At first, we determined the fMRI signatures of burst-suppression in human EEG-fMRI data. Applying this method to animal fMRI datasets, we found distinct burst-suppression signatures in all species. The burst-suppression maps revealed a marked inter-species difference: in rats the entire neocortex engaged in burst-suppression, while in primates most sensory areas were excluded--predominantly the primary visual cortex. We anticipate that the identified species-specific fMRI signatures and whole-brain maps will guide future targeted studies investigating the cellular and molecular mechanisms of burst-suppression in unconscious states.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">An Optimal Policy Model for Concurrent Uncertainty Estimation During Decision Making</a></h4>

              
                We often postpone or even avoid making decisions when we feel uncertain. Uncertainty estimation is not an afterthought of decision making but a dynamic process that accompanies decision making in parallel and affects decision making. To study concurrent uncertainty estimation during decision making, we adapted the classic random-dots motion direction discrimination task to allow a reaction-time measure of uncertainty responses. Subjects were asked to judge whether a patch of random dots was moving left or right. In addition, they could seek assistance by choosing to look at a second stimulus that had the same direction but high coherence any time during the task. The task allows us to measure the reaction time of both the perceptual decisions and the uncertainty responses. The subjects were more likely to choose the uncertainty response when the motion coherence was low, while their reaction times of the uncertainty responses showed individual variations. To account for the subjects' behavior, we created an optimal policy decision model in which decisions are based on the value functions computed from the accumulated evidence using a drift-diffusion process. Model simulations captured key features of the subjects' choices, reaction times, and proportions of uncertainty responses. Varying model parameters explained individual variations in the subjects and the correlations between decision accuracy, proportions of uncertainty responses, and reaction times at the individual level. Our model links perceptual decisions and value-based decisions and indicates that concurrent uncertainty estimation may be based on comparisons between values of uncertainty responses and perceptual decisions, both of which may be derived from the same evidence accumulation process during decision making. It provides a theoretical framework for future investigations, including the ones that aim at the underlying neural mechanism.

	<p>We aimed to evaluate diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in infants born extremely preterm, to determine the effect of erythropoietin (Epo) on DTI, and to correlate DTI with neurodevelopmental outcomes at 2 years of age for infants in the Preterm Erythropoietin Neuroprotection (PENUT) Trial. Infants who underwent MRI with DTI at 36 weeks postmenstrual age were included. Neurodevelopmental outcomes were evaluated by Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development (BSID-III). Generalized linear models were used to assess the association between DTI parameters and treatment group, and then with neurodevelopmental outcomes. A total of 101 placebo- and 93 Epo-treated infants underwent MRI. DTI white matter mean diffusivity (MD) was lower in placebo- compared to Epo-treated infants in the cingulate and occipital regions, and occipital white matter fractional isotropy (FA) was lower in infants born at 24–25 weeks vs. 26–27 weeks. These values were not associated with lower BSID-III scores. Certain decreases in clustering coefficients tended to have lower BSID-III scores. Consistent with the PENUT Trial findings, there was no effect on long-term neurodevelopment in Epo-treated infants even in the presence of microstructural changes identified by DTI.</p>

	<p>The apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 allele is a risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) that has been linked to changes in brain structure and function as well as to different biological subtypes of the disease. The present study aimed to investigate the association of APOE ε4 genotypes with brain functional impairment, as assessed by quantitative EEG (qEEG) in patients on the AD continuum. The study population included 101 amyloid positive patients diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (n = 50) and AD (n = 51) that underwent resting-state EEG recording and CSF Aβ42 analysis. In total, 31 patients were APOE ε4 non-carriers, 42 were carriers of one, and 28 were carriers of two APOE ε4 alleles. Quantitative EEG analysis included computation of the global field power (GFP) and global field synchronization (GFS) in conventional frequency bands. Amyloid positive patients who were carriers of APOE ε4 allele(s) had significantly higher GFP beta and significantly lower GFS in theta and beta bands compared to APOE ε4 non-carriers. Increased global EEG power in beta band in APOE ε4 carriers may represent a brain functional compensatory mechanism that offsets global EEG slowing in AD patients. Our findings suggest that decreased EEG measures of global synchronization in theta and beta bands reflect brain functional deficits related to the APOE ε4 genotype in patients that are on a biomarker-verified AD continuum.</p>

	<p>Asymmetrical lower limb weakness is an early symptom and significant contributor to the progressive worsening of walking ability in people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS). Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) may effectively increase neural drive to the more-affected lower limb and, therefore, increase symmetrical activation. Four PwMS (1 female, age range: 27–57) underwent one session each of 3 mA or SHAM tDCS over the motor cortex corresponding to their more-affected limb followed by 20 min of treadmill walking at a self-selected speed. Two min into the treadmill task, the subjects were injected with the glucose analog [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). Immediately after treadmill walking, the subjects underwent whole-body positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. Glucose uptake (GU) values were compared between the legs, the spatial distribution of FDG was assessed to estimate glucose uptake heterogeneity (GUh), and GU asymmetry indices (AIs) were calculated. After tDCS, GU was altered, and GUh was decreased in various muscle groups in each subject. Additionally, AIs went from asymmetric to symmetric after tDCS in the subjects that demonstrated asymmetrical glucose uptake during SHAM. These results indicate that tDCS improved GU asymmetries, potentially from an increased neural drive and a more efficient muscle activation strategy of the lower limb in PwMS.</p>

	<p>In the field of time psychology, the functional significance of the contingent negative variation (CNV) component in time perception and whether the processing mechanisms of sub- and supra-second are similar or different still remain unclear. In the present study, event-related potential (ERP) technology and classical temporal discrimination tasks were used to explore the neurodynamic patterns of sub- and supra-second time perception. In Experiment 1, the standard interval (SI) was fixed at 500 ms, and the comparison interval (CI) ranged from 200 ms to 800 ms. In Experiment 2, the SI was fixed at 2000 ms, and the CI ranged from 1400 ms to 2600 ms. Participants were required to judge whether the CI was longer or shorter than the SI. The ERP results showed similar CNV activity patterns in the two experiments. Specifically, CNV amplitude would be more negative when the CI was longer or closer to the memorized SI. CNV peak latency increased significantly until the CI reached the memorized SI. We propose that CNV amplitude might reflect the process of temporal comparison, and CNV peak latency might represent the process of temporal decision-making. To our knowledge, it is the first ERP task explicitly testing the two temporal scales, sub- and supra-second timing, in one study. Taken together, the present study reveals a similar functional significance of CNV between sub- and supra-second time perception.</p>

	<p>Background: Sleep disorders and sleep problems commonly occur in adults with ADHD and add to functional impairment. Evidence-based treatments for sleep could improve function in the adult ADHD population. Methods: A literature review was conducted to present the clinical science informing treatment of sleep in adults with ADHD. Results: Six systematic prospective studies of sleep intervention in adults with ADHD were identified. Three of these, all including well-characterized ADHD patients, offered evidence for a significant effect of morning light therapy. Across the studies, preliminary evidence for melatonin, behavioral therapy, and weighted blankets were also found.

                Background: Banks and financial institutions are vulnerable to money laundering (ML) as a result of crime proceeds infiltrating banks in the form of significant cash deposits. Improved financial crime compliance processes and systems enable anti-ML (AML) analysts to devote considerable time and effort to case investigation and process quality work, thereby lowering financial risks by reporting suspicious activity in a timely and effective manner. This study uses Job Characteristics Theory (JCT) to evaluate the AML system through the job satisfaction and motivation of its users. The purpose of this study is to determine how satisfied AML personnel are with their jobs and how motivated they are to work with the system. Methods: This cross-sectional study used JCT to investigate the important elements impacting employee satisfaction with the AML system. The five core dimensions of the job characteristics were measured using a job diagnostic survey. The respondents were employees working in the AML department of a Malaysian bank, and the sample group was chosen using a purposive sampling approach. A total of 100 acceptable replies were gathered and analysed using various statistical approaches. A motivating potential score was generated for each employee based on five main job characteristics. Results: Findings revealed that five core job characteristics, namely, skill diversity, task identity, task importance, autonomy and feedback, positively influence the AML system employees’ job satisfaction. However, skill variety and autonomy are found to be low, which are reflected in the poor motivating potential score. Conclusion: This study examined the characteristics of the AML system and its users’ job satisfaction. Findings revealed that task significance is the most widely recognised characteristic, followed by feedback and task identity. However, there is a lack of skill variety and autonomy, which must be addressed to improve employee satisfaction with the AML system.

                Background: Herpes simplex virus (HSV) is a widely distributed human pathogen that is known for its ulcerative lesions at the infection site. HSV can cause persistent infection in the host that is often followed by a period of latency within the neurons. Considering the high rate of HIV infection in South Africa, it is important to assess the seroprevalence of HSV with a focus to determine the epidemiological association between HSV-DNA and HIV-1 in the population. Methods: A total of 44 sera samples were screened for HSV and HIV-1 using the highly sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The ELISA positive samples were characterized using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to confirm the positivity of both viruses and to further differentiate HSV into HSV-1 and -2. Thereafter, the samples were analysed for relatedness using phylogenetic analysis. Results: Of the 44 samples, 36 (81.8%) were positive for HIV-1, while 35 (79.5%) were positive for HSV when screened with ELISA kits. The PCR results, with the use of type specific primers, showed that 4/35 (11.4%) samples were specific for HSV-1 while 30/35 (85.7%) were specific for HSV-2. Statistical analysis performed using the chi-squared goodness-of-fit test showed that there is a significant relationship between HSV-2 and HIV-1 transmission. Conclusions:There is a significant relationship between HSV-2 and HIV-1 in the study population. Our study shows that some of the HSV-2 isolates are not related to the clinical isolate SD90e from South Africa, suggesting diversity in HSV-2 viral transmission.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">State transitions through inhibitory interneurons in a cortical network model</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Alexander Bryson, Samuel F. Berkovic, Steven Petrou, David B. Grayden</p>

Inhibitory interneurons shape the spiking characteristics and computational properties of cortical networks. Interneuron subtypes can precisely regulate cortical function but the roles of interneuron subtypes for promoting different regimes of cortical activity remains unclear. Therefore, we investigated the impact of fast spiking and non-fast spiking interneuron subtypes on cortical activity using a network model with connectivity and synaptic properties constrained by experimental data. We found that network properties were more sensitive to modulation of the fast spiking population, with reductions of fast spiking excitability generating strong spike correlations and network oscillations. Paradoxically, reduced fast spiking excitability produced a reduction of global excitation-inhibition balance and features of an inhibition stabilised network, in which firing rates were driven by the activity of excitatory neurons within the network. Further analysis revealed that the synaptic interactions and biophysical features associated with fast spiking interneurons, in particular their rapid intrinsic response properties and short synaptic latency, enabled this state transition by enhancing gain within the excitatory population. Therefore, fast spiking interneurons may be uniquely positioned to control the strength of recurrent excitatory connectivity and the transition to an inhibition stabilised regime. Overall, our results suggest that interneuron subtypes can exert selective control over excitatory gain allowing for differential modulation of global network state.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Visual perception of texture regularity: Conjoint measurements and a wavelet response-distribution model</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Hua-Chun Sun, David St-Amand, Curtis L. Baker Jr., Frederick A. A. Kingdom</p>

Texture regularity, such as the repeating pattern in a carpet, brickwork or tree bark, is a ubiquitous feature of the visual world. The perception of regularity has generally been studied using multi-element textures in which the degree of regularity has been manipulated by adding random jitter to the elements’ positions. Here we used three-factor Maximum Likelihood Conjoint Measurement (MLCM) for the first time to investigate the encoding of regularity information under more complex conditions in which element spacing and size, in addition to positional jitter, were manipulated. Human observers were presented with large numbers of pairs of multi-element stimuli with varying levels of the three factors, and indicated on each trial which stimulus appeared more regular. All three factors contributed to regularity perception. Jitter, as expected, strongly affected regularity perception. This effect of jitter on regularity perception is strongest at small element spacing and large texture element size, suggesting that the visual system utilizes the edge-to-edge distance between elements as the basis for regularity judgments. We then examined how the responses of a bank of Gabor wavelet spatial filters might account for our results. Our analysis indicates that the peakedness of the spatial frequency (SF) distribution, a previously favored proposal, is insufficient for regularity encoding since it varied more with element spacing and size than with jitter. Instead, our results support the idea that the visual system may extract texture regularity information from the moments of the SF-distribution across orientation. In our best-performing model, the variance of SF-distribution skew across orientations can explain 70% of the variance of estimated texture regularity from our data, suggesting that it could provide a candidate read-out for perceived regularity.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Knowledge, attitude, and behaviours on diet, physical activity, and tobacco use among school students: A cross-sectional study in two Indian states [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are escalating in India and can be attributed to behavioural risk factors such as unhealthy diet, physical inactivity and tobacco use that began in early years. Understanding adolescents’ knowledge, attitudes and behaviours (KAB) related to NCD risk factors would inform the development of school-based health programmes to prevent NCDs. Methods: Sixth-grade students (n=1026) in 20 schools (10 private, 10 public) from two Indian cities (n=667 from Pune; n=359 from Bengaluru) participated in a KAB survey in 2019. Differences in KAB by gender, school type within cities were investigated. Results: Knowledge about the harms of tobacco use was higher than knowledge about a healthy diet and importance of physical activity. Only a small proportion of students did not eat breakfast (8.7%) or fruits (11.3%) daily. Only 33.4% of students read nutrition labels before choosing their food. Moderate-to-vigorous physical activity of less than an hour per day was reported by 42.5% of students. Approximately one-third of students had ever tried smoking tobacco (30.1%), smokeless tobacco (30.5%), and e-cigarettes (32.4%). Differences in these behaviours by gender and school type showed that both boys, girls and students of private and public schools are vulnerable. Conclusions: The study findings highlight that knowledge is low for thematic areas like diet and physical activity. While knowledge of tobacco related harms is better but the prevalence of ever tobacco use was found to be high. Socio-demographic factors such as school type and gender had a varying effect on various KAB indicators. There is a need to strengthen health education activities by developing context-specific health intervention materials by engaging school children, their parents, teachers, and communities to promote healthy behaviours among adolescents. Need to augment school health programmes in India with a differential approach based on the issues, specific to school type and city.

                Background: Rural clinics still have X-ray facilities that produce physical films, which are sent to the nearest hospital for evaluation.  Purchasing digitalization facilities is costly, thus, sending digitized films to the radiologist may be a solution.  This can be achieved via digital photo capture.  However, there can be different output resolutions that may not be optimized for online diagnosis.  This paper investigates if digitized X-ray films can be enhanced using image processing techniques of Contrast-Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE), Normalized-CLAHE (N-CLAHE) and Min-Max Normalized-CLAHE (MMCLAHE).        Methods: We collected and digitized 21 X-ray films with low, medium, and high resolutions and implemented the CLAHE, N-CLAHE and MMCLAHE image enhancement. These methods introduced a limit to clip the histogram of image intensities so as to reduce any noise amplification before file compression with the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT).  Quantitative metrics of the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Mean-Squared Error (MSE) were used to compare the accuracies between digitized and processed X-ray films.  A qualitative evaluation was performed by a medical practitioner to validate the accuracy of enhanced digitized X-ray.  Results: It had been found that both CLAHE and MMCLAHE provided good average PSNR values of 31dB - 32dB and produced low MSE values compared to N-CLAHE.  The results of qualitative evaluation attained 89.9% correct diagnosis on nine randomly selected images.  Generally, the evaluation indicated that the results fulfill the acceptable criteria for further evaluation and there seemed to be no pathological differences observed. Conclusion: This paper presented a proof of concept on an implementation of the CLAHE technique and its variations on digitized X-ray films.  This paper had shown potential improvements with the proposed enhancement methods that may contribute to an increase efficiency in healthcare processes at rural clinics.

                This article describes the case of a 19-year-old woman who presented with prolonged fever, positive antinuclear antibodies (ANA) and splenomegaly. Pulmonary infiltrates were discovered and the patient was treated for community-acquired pneumonia, with no clinical amelioration. A more thorough evaluation was subsequently made, revealing elevated serum IgE and IgG4 levels and negative ANA tested by the hospital’s laboratory with two methods. During hospitalization thrombocytopenia, liver function test impairment, and evanescent rash during some febrile episodes developed. Vomiting also presented without any concomitant symptoms or signs; a funduscopic examination was consequently ordered, showing bilateral papilledema. Brain imaging was totally normal but a lumbar puncture revealed elevated opening pressure and lymphocytic pleocytosis along with low cerebrospinal fluid lactate dehydrogenase (CSF LDH). The patient was empirically treated with antimicrobials, dexamethasone, and acetazolamide and had immediate clinical and laboratory improvement. Diagnostic workup, however, was negative for an infectious agent; antimicrobials were ceased but the patient continued to improve. Adult-onset Still’s disease (AOSD) was considered as the working diagnosis because the patient fulfilled Yamaguchi criteria, responded to corticosteroids, and an alternative diagnosis was lacking. Nevertheless, because of the patient’s atypical features a trial to discontinue dexamethasone was undertaken, leading to immediate recurrence; the possibility of a self-limiting viral illness was excluded. Thrombocytopenia was attributed to hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) that complicated AOSD. Corticosteroid reinitiation combined with methotrexate fully controlled all clinical and laboratory parameters. One month later papilledema had disappeared and the patient remained symptom-free even without acetazolamide. To our knowledge, this is the first report in the literature of an AOSD case presenting intracranial hypertension without cerebral imaging abnormalities and neurological or meningeal symptoms and signs, as well as with the initial observation of serum IgG4 elevation. A classic regimen combined with acetazolamide led to a positive outcome.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Efficacy safety and immunogenicity of rurioctocog alfa pegol for prophylactic treatment in previously treated patients with severe hemophilia A: a systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Patients with severe hemophilia often present with painful joint and soft tissue bleeding which may restrict them from their daily activities. The current standard of care still relies on a regular prophylactic factor VIII (FVIII), which has a high daily treatment burden. Recently, rurioctocog alfa pegol, a third-generation recombinant FVIII with a modification in its polyethylene glycol (PEG) component, has been developed. Several trials have studied this synthetic drug as bleeding prophylaxis in severe hemophilia A. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of rurioctocog alfa pegol for previously treated patients with severe hemophilia A. Methods: This study was conducted in conformity with the PRISMA guidelines. Data were retrieved from PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Library, Wiley Online Library, and CINAHL (via EBSCOhost). Study qualities were assessed using the Methodological Index for Non-Randomized Studies (MINORS) and Modified Jadad scales. Results: Four studies involving 517 previously treated severe hemophilia A patients were included in this study. The pooled mean of total annualized bleeding rate (ABR) and hemostatic efficacy was 2.59 (95% CI = 2.04–3.14) and 92% (95% CI = 85%–97%), respectively. Only 30 (2.3%) non-serious and one (1.4%) serious adverse events were considered related to rurioctocog alfa pegol treatment. At the end of the studies, no development of FVIII inhibitory antibodies was observed. None of the developed binding antibodies to FVIII, PEG-FVIII, or PEG was correlated to the treatment efficacy and safety. Conclusions: Despite the limited availability of direct comparison studies, our analyses indicate that rurioctocog alfa pegol could serve as a safe and effective alternative for bleeding prophylaxis in previously treated hemophilia A patients. Moreover, it appears to have low immunogenicity, which further increases the safety profile of the drug in such clinical conditions.

                Background: Social media is changing the modern academic landscape; this study sought to explore how organizational structures support or inhibit the harnessing of social media use in academic contexts and knowledge translation. Methods: A qualitative study was conducted using framework analysis based on the Bolman and Deal’s Four-Frame Model—structural, human resources, political and symbolic. The research team used the snowball sampling technique to recruit participants following the completion of each participant’s semi-structured interview. A member check was completed to ensure rigour. Results: 16 social media educators and experts from several countries participated in the study. Study findings showed that within the Structural Frame, institution types were reported to have with diverse hierarchical structures, ranging from strict to malleable: hospital-based (strict), education institutional-based and online only groups (malleable). The Human Resources Frame revealed that most participants’ social media organizations operated on unpaid volunteer staff. The training of these staff was primarily via role-modeling and mentorship. Regarding the Political Frame, social media helped participants accumulate scholarly currency and influence within their field of practice. Symbolic Frame showed a wide range of traditional to non-traditional organizational supports, which interacted with both intrinsic to extrinsic motivation. Conclusions: Bolman and Deal’s Four-Frame Model framework may serve as an effective guideline for academic leaders who wish to strategically implement or enhance social media use into their organizations. The key insights that we have gained from our participants are how new emerging forms of scholarly pursuits can be more effectively enabled or hindered by the attributes of the organization within which these are occurring.

                Background: Bioclimatic design is an approach based on local climate which improves thermal qualities and indoor comfort. Buildings follow this process to minimize negative effects on the environment. However, this approach is still not suitable in developed countries. This study aims to investigate Mediterranean local bioclimatic strategies’ impact on thermal comfort efficiency in housing, by examining architectural elements and treatments. Methods: We adopted a descriptive, analytical, and comparative methodology, complemented with a software simulation, within a qualitative and quantitative approach. Investigation and methodological tools were based on technical information including plans, elevations, photos, and documentation. The approach consisted of multiple stages: a literature review interpreting the concept of bioclimatic design, as well as thermal comfort variables and common Mediterranean building features. Moreover, the paper showcases three examples of successful Mediterranean passive houses. Furthermore, the paper presents a case- studyhouse in Alex West, Alexandria, designed in the Mediterranean Revival style. Results: The results showed that the most influencing building features on thermal comfort were the low-pitched roofs and the top chimney, which achieved 12.6% and 5% improvement in the summer and 13% and 6.8% in winter, respectively. The pergola and porch elements barely had an effect when placed on the northern façade. However, on the southern façade, a positive contribution in the summer by 1.4% and 3.4% respectively were reported, but a slight negative impact in winter by 0.5% and 2% respectively. Conclusions:  We examined the impact of common Mediterranean building features , and compared thermal comfort results between case-study houses. Features focusing on passive design for cooling rather than heating, allowing wind flow for maximized natural ventilation, using ventilated pitched roof spaces, using sun shading elements in the proper facades and angles, help passive thermal regulation. The study proposes recommendations for optimizing thermal comfort in residential buildings in Alexandria, Egypt.

                Background Owing to low cost and ubiquity, human activity recognition using smartphones is emerging as a trendy mobile application in diverse appliances such as assisted living, healthcare monitoring, etc. Analysing this one-dimensional time-series signal is rather challenging due to its spatial and temporal variances. Numerous deep neural networks (DNNs) are conducted to unveil deep features of complex real-world data. However, the drawback of DNNs is the un-interpretation of the network's internal logic to achieve the output. Furthermore, a huge training sample size (i.e. millions of samples) is required to ensure great performance. Methods In this work, a simpler yet effective stacked deep network, known as Stacked Discriminant Feature Learning (SDFL), is proposed to analyse inertial motion data for activity recognition. Contrary to DNNs, this deep model extracts rich features without the prerequisite of a gigantic training sample set and tenuous hyper-parameter tuning. SDFL is a stacking deep network with multiple learning modules, appearing in a serialized layout for multi-level feature learning from shallow to deeper features. In each learning module, Rayleigh coefficient optimized learning is accomplished to extort discriminant features. A subject-independent protocol is implemented where the system model (trained by data from a group of users) is used to recognize data from another group of users. Results Empirical results demonstrate that SDFL surpasses state-of-the-art methods, including DNNs like Convolutional Neural Network, Deep Belief Network, etc., with ~97% accuracy from the UCI HAR database with thousands of training samples. Additionally, the model training time of SDFL is merely a few minutes, compared with DNNs, which require hours for model training. Conclusions The supremacy of SDFL is corroborated in analysing motion data for human activity recognition requiring no GPU but only a CPU with a fast- learning rate.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Study of Antibodies to Cytolethal Distending Toxin B (CdtB) and Antibodies to Vinculin in Patients with Irritable Bowel Syndrome [version 4; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common gastrointestinal disorder, categorized into various subtypes. Post-infection IBS may be attributed to the release of cytolethal distending toxin B (CdtB), which cross-reacts with the adhesion protein vinculin responsible for normal intestinal contractility. Objective: This study aims to identify anti-CdtB and anti-vinculin levels in IBS patients compared to healthy control. Subjects and methods: This retrospective case-control study was conducted on 100 subjects with IBS, as determined by a questionnaire based on Rome III criteria, recruited from the outpatient clinics of the Tropical Medicine at Mansoura University Hospital from January 2019 to January 2020. Results: The optical density (OD) results of the anti-vinculin and anti-CdtB levels were significantly elevated in patients with IBS (1.58±0.496 OD, 2.47±0.60 OD)  when compared to control subjects (1.13±0.249 OD, 2.1±0.24 OD), respectively with P=0.001 for both.  Anti-vinculin level was significantly higher in the IBS-D subtype than the other subtypes (P=0.001) while, Anti-CdtB was significantly elevated in IBS-C, IBS-D subgroups compared to control subjects (P=0.001). Conclusion: Findings of the present study support the hypothesis that IBS results from post-infectious disorders initiated by bacterial enteritis. A hypothesis could be applied to all IBS subgroups. On the other hand. These biomarkers might reflect the post-infectious state's severity.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">2-DOF robot modelling by SimMechanics and PD-FL integrated controller for position control and trajectory tracking [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Due to the high demand of robots to perform several industrial tasks, such as welding, machining, pick and place, position control in robotics has attracted high attention recently. Controllers’ improvement is also continuous specifically in terms of design simplicity and performance accuracy. This research plans to obtain the SimMechanics model of a two-degree of freedom (DOF) robot and to propose an integrated controller of a proportional–derivative (PD) controller and a fuzzy logic (FL) controller. Methodology The SimMechanics model of the 2-DOF robot is obtained using MATLAB SimMechanics toolbox from a CAD assembly design of the 2-DOF robot. Then, the proposed PD-FL integrated controller is designed and simulated in MATLAB Simulink. The PD controller is widely used for its simplicity, but it doesn’t have a satisfactory performance in difficult tasks. Furthermore, the FL controller is also easy for design and implementation even by non-experts in control theory, but it has the disadvantage of long computational time for multi-input systems due to the increased fuzzy rules. Results The FL controller is integrated with the PD controller for enhanced performance of the 2-DOF robot. The PD-FL integrated controller is developed and tested to control the 2-DOF robot for point-to-point position control and also tip trajectory tracking (TTT) such as triangular TTT and rhombic TTT. Conclusion The PD-FL integrated controller demonstrates enhanced performance compared to the conventional PD controller in both point-to-point position control and TTT. Furthermore, the PD-FL integrated controller has the advantage of less fuzzy rules which helps to overcome the computational time issue of the FL controller.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Changes in mammography screening in Ontario and Alberta following national guideline dissemination: an interrupted time series analysis [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: In November 2011, the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care released guidelines for screening women at average breast cancer risk. Weak recommendations (framed using GRADE methodology) were made for screening women aged 50 to 74 years every two to three years, and for not screening women aged 40 to 49 years. Methods: We conducted an interrupted time series analysis using administrative data to examine bilateral mammography use before and after a national guideline dissemination strategy targeting primary care physicians. Women aged 40 to 74 years living in Ontario or Alberta from 30th November 2008 to 30th November 2014 were included. Strata included age, region of residence, neighbourhood income quintile, immigration status, and education level. Results: In both provinces, mammography use rates were lower in the post-intervention period (527 vs. 556 and 428 vs. 465/1000 participant-months - the monthly screening rate/1000 - in Ontario and Alberta, respectively). In Ontario, mammography trends decreased following guideline release to align with recommendations for women aged 40 to 74 (decrease of 2.21/1000 women, SE 0.26/1000, p<0.0001). In Alberta, mammography trends decreased for women aged 40 to 49 years (3/1000 women, SE 0.32, p<0.001) and 50 to 69 (2.9/1000 women, SE 0.79, p<0.001), but did not change for women aged 70 to 74 (0.7/1000 women, SE 1.23, p=0.553). In both provinces, trends in mammography use rates were sustained for up to three years after guideline release. Conclusions: The guideline dissemination strategy appeared to increase uptake of guideline-concordant screening practice in women aged 40 to 49 years in Ontario and Alberta and for women aged 50 to 74 years in Ontario. Further work is required to understand these findings and whether shared decision making about mammography between women and providers increased among women considering mammography.

     alt="Hemispheric cortical atrophy and chronic microglial activation following mild focal ischemic stroke in adult male rats"/>
<p>Localised injection of ET-1 to the motor cortex resulted in focal ischemic damage causing neuronal loss. Despite the asymptomatic nature of this model of stroke, lacking motor or cognitive impairment, chronic inflammation and hemispheric atrophy developed over time. These findings highlight that even mild stroke can result in long-term pathological outcomes.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Animal modeling has played an important role in our understanding of the pathobiology of stroke. The vast majority of this research has focused on the acute phase following severe forms of stroke that result in clear behavioral deficits. Human stroke, however, can vary widely in severity and clinical outcome. There is a rapidly building body of work suggesting that milder ischemic insults can precipitate functional impairment, including cognitive decline, that continues through the chronic phase after injury. Here we show that a small infarction localized to the frontal motor cortex of rats following injection of endothelin-1 results in an essentially asymptomatic state based on motor and cognitive testing, and yet produces significant histopathological change including remote atrophy and inflammation that persists up to 1 year. While there is understandably a major focus in stroke research on mitigating the acute consequences of primary infarction, these results point to progressive atrophy and chronic inflammation as additional targets for intervention in the chronic phase after injury. The present rodent model provides an important platform for further work in this area.</p>

<p>The exercise during the adult life of the offspring, associated with iron supplementation during the pregnancies, proved to be of benefit. However, no relation was found between iron restriction in fetal programming and the occurrence of restless legs syndrome phenotype.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Iron restriction during pregnancy can lead to iron deficiency and changes in the dopaminergic system in the adulthood of offspring, and restless legs syndrome (RLS) is closely related to these changes. Objectives: Analyze whether iron restriction during pregnancy would cause changes in the behavior, sleep, and dopaminergic system of the male offspring. In addition, we aimed to assess whether exercise would be able to modulate these variables. The pregnant rats (Wistar) were divided into four groups with different concentrations of iron in the diet: standard (St), supplementation (Su), restriction since weaning (R1), and restriction only during pregnancy (R2). After birth, the offspring were assigned to their respective groups according to the dams diet (St, Su, R1, and R2) and distributed into sedentary (SD) and exercised (EX) (for 8 weeks of training), reaching eight groups of offspring (O): OSt SD, OSt EX, OSu SD, OSu EX, OR1 SD, OR1 EX, OR2 SD, and OR2 EX. Sleep, behavior, and analysis of key genes of dopaminergic system (D2, DAT) were performed after 8 weeks. The results for trained offspring that the mother received supplementation diet were the most expressive, with increased freezing and the OR1 SD group showed an increase in DAT protein content. These changes may have been due to the association between the dams diet during pregnancy and the practice of exercise by the offspring. The different concentrations of iron during pregnancy caused changes in the offspring, however, they were not associated with fetal programming in the context of RLS.</p>

                Neurological symptoms and varying levels of central nervous system (CNS) immunopathology have been described in COVID-19. Recent reports suggest an increased level of innate immune activation associated with CNS border areas, as well as a compartmentalized cytokine response and dysregulated, auto-reactive CSF immune profile. However, it remains contested whether these changes reflect bystander effects of systemic inflammation or relate to CNS-specific viral infection. In this article, we summarize some of the key findings pertaining this ongoing debate and highlight directions for future investigation.

                Energy balance is orchestrated by an extended network of highly interconnected nuclei across the central nervous system. While much is known about the hypothalamic circuits regulating energy homeostasis, the ‘extra-hypothalamic’ circuits involved are relatively poorly understood. In this review, we focus on the brainstem’s dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), integrating decades of research linking this structure to the physiologic and behavioral responses that maintain proper energy stores. DRN neurons sense and respond to interoceptive and exteroceptive cues related to energy imbalance and in turn induce appropriate alterations in energy intake and expenditure.

                The electrical activity of diverse brain cells is modulated across states of vigilance, namely wakefulness, non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Enhanced activity of neuronal circuits during NREM sleep impacts on subsequent awake behaviors, yet the significance of their activation, or lack thereof, during REM sleep remains unclear. This review focuses on feeding-promoting cells in the lateral hypothalamus (LH) that express the vesicular GABA and glycine transporter (vgat) as a model to further understand the impact of REM sleep on neural encoding of goal-directed behavior.

                Hsieh et al. generate MERS-CoV spike stabilized-stem (SS) antigens using a structure-guided approach. Mice immunized with MERS SS are protected against MERS-CoV challenge and used for isolation of cross-reactive monoclonal antibodies, including IgG22, which protects mice against MERS- and SARS-CoV-2 challenges. Structures of Fab22–spike complexes reveal a conserved epitope.

                Cerutti et al. report the cryo-EM structure of potent neutralizing antibody 5-7 bound to SARS-CoV-2 spike. While most NTD-directed neutralizing antibodies target the NTD supersite with high evolutionary diversity, 5-7 binds to an exposed hydrophobic pocket conserved on NTD to neutralize select variants of concern.

                Simulating nationwide realistic individual movements with a detailed geographical structure can help optimize public health policies. However, existing tools have limited resolution or can only account for a limited number of agents. We introduce Epidemap, a new framework that can capture the daily movement of more than 60 million people in a country at a building-level resolution in a realistic and computationally efficient way. By applying it to the case of an infectious disease spreading in France, we uncover hitherto neglected effects, such as the emergence of two distinct peaks in the daily number of cases or the importance of local density in the timing of arrival of the epidemic. Finally, we show that the importance of super-spreading events strongly varies over time.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Markov state models of proton- and pore-dependent activation in a pentameric ligand-gated ion channel</a></h4>

              
                Ligand-gated ion channels conduct currents in response to chemical stimuli, mediating electrochemical signaling in neurons and other excitable cells. For many channels the details of gating remain unclear, partly due to limited structural data and simulation timescales. Here, we used enhanced sampling to simulate the pH-gated channel GLIC, and construct Markov state models (MSMs) of gating. Consistent with new functional recordings we report in oocytes, our analysis revealed differential effects of protonation and mutation on free-energy wells. Clustering of closed- versus open-like states enabled estimation of open probabilities and transition rates, while higher-order clustering affirmed conformational trends in gating. Furthermore, our models uncovered state- and protonation-dependent symmetrization. This demonstrates the applicability of MSMs to map energetic and conformational transitions between ion-channel functional states, and how they reproduce shifts upon activation or mutation, with implications for modeling neuronal function and developing state-selective drugs.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Ssl2/TFIIH function in transcription start site scanning by RNA Polymerase II in Saccharomyces cerevisiae</a></h4>

              
                In <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) selects transcription start sites (TSS) by a unidirectional scanning process. During scanning, a preinitiation complex (PIC) assembled at an upstream core promoter initiates at select positions within a window ~40-120 basepairs downstream. Several lines of evidence indicate that Ssl2, the yeast homolog of XPB and an essential and conserved subunit of the general transcription factor (GTF) TFIIH, drives scanning through its DNA-dependent ATPase activity, therefore potentially controlling both scanning rate and scanning extent (processivity). To address questions of how Ssl2 functions in promoter scanning and interacts with other initiation activities, we leveraged distinct initiation-sensitive reporters to identify novel <i>ssl2</i> alleles. These <i>ssl2 </i>alleles, many of which alter residues conserved from yeast to human, confer either upstream or downstream TSS shifts at the model promoter <i>ADH1 </i>and genome-wide. Specifically, tested <i>ssl2</i> alleles alter TSS selection by increasing or narrowing the distribution of TSSs used at individual promoters. Genetic interactions of <i>ssl2 </i>alleles with other initiation factors are consistent with <i>ssl2</i> allele classes functioning through increasing or decreasing scanning processivity but not necessarily scanning rate. These alleles underpin a residue interaction network that likely modulates Ssl2 activity and TFIIH function in promoter scanning. We propose that the outcome of promoter scanning is determined by two functional networks, the first being Pol II activity and factors that modulate it to determine initiation efficiency within a scanning window, and the second being Ssl2/TFIIH and factors that modulate scanning processivity to determine the width of the scanning widow.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Sepsis leads to lasting changes in phenotype and function of memory CD8 T cells</a></h4>

              
                The global health burden due to sepsis and the associated cytokine storm is substantial. While early intervention has improved survival during the cytokine storm, those that survive can enter a state of chronic immunoparalysis defined by transient lymphopenia and functional deficits of surviving cells. Memory CD8 T cells provide rapid cytolysis and cytokine production following re-encounter with their cognate antigen to promote long-term immunity, and CD8 T cell impairment due to sepsis can pre-dispose individuals to re-infection. While the acute influence of sepsis on memory CD8 T cells has been characterized, if and to what extent pre-existing memory CD8 T cells recover remains unknown. Here, we observed that central memory CD8 T cells (T<sub>CM</sub>) from septic patients proliferate more than those from healthy individuals. Utilizing LCMV immune mice and a CLP model to induce sepsis, we demonstrated that T<sub>CM</sub> proliferation is associated with numerical recovery of pathogen-specific memory CD8 T cells following sepsis-induced lymphopenia. This increased proliferation leads to changes in composition of memory CD8 T cell compartment and altered tissue localization. Further, memory CD8 T cells from sepsis survivors have an altered transcriptional profile and chromatin accessibility indicating long-lasting T cell intrinsic changes. The sepsis-induced changes in the composition of the memory CD8 T cell pool and transcriptional landscape culminated in altered T cell function and reduced capacity to control <i>L. monocytogenes</i> infection. Thus, sepsis leads to long-term alterations in memory CD8 T cell phenotype, protective function and localization potentially changing host capacity to respond to re-infection.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Regulatory T-cells inhibit microglia-induced pain hypersensitivity in female mice</a></h4>

              
                Peripheral nerve injury-induced neuropathic pain is a chronic and debilitating condition characterized by mechanical hypersensitivity. We previously identified microglial activation via release of colony stimulating factor 1 (CSF1) from injured sensory neurons as a mechanism contributing to nerve injury-induced pain. Here we show that intrathecal administration of CSF1, even in the absence of injury, is sufficient to induce pain behavior, but only in male mice. Transcriptional profiling and morphologic analyses after intrathecal CSF1 showed robust immune activation in male but not female microglia. CSF1 also induced marked expansion of lymphocytes within the spinal cord meninges, with preferential expansion of regulatory T-cells (Tregs) in female mice. Consistent with the hypothesis that Tregs actively suppress microglial activation in females, Treg deficient (<i>Foxp3<sup>DTR</sup></i>) female mice showed increased CSF1-induced microglial activation and pain hypersensitivity equivalent to males. We conclude that sexual dimorphism in the contribution of microglia to pain results from Treg-mediated suppression of microglial activation and pain hypersensitivity in female mice.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Modular Derivation and Unbiased Single-cell Analysis of Regional Human Hindbrain And Spinal Neurons Enables Discovery of Nuanced Transcriptomic Patterns along Developmental Axes</a></h4>

              
                Our inability to derive the vast neuronal diversity of the posterior central nervous system (pCNS) using human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) poses a major impediment to understanding human neurodevelopment and disease in the hindbrain and spinal cord. Here we establish a modular differentiation paradigm that recapitulates patterning along both the rostrocaudal (R/C) and dorsoventral (D/V) axes of the pCNS, enabling derivation of any neuronal phenotype with discrete regional specificity. First, neuromesodermal progenitors (NMPs) with discrete Hox profiles are efficiently converted to pCNS progenitors (pCNSPs). Then by tuning D/V signaling, pCNSPs are directed to ventral Shh-dependent MNs (MNs) and locomotor interneurons (INs) or dorsal TGF-{beta}-dependent proprioceptive INs and TGF-{beta}-independent sensory INs. We applied D/V protocols to NMPs spanning the R/C axis for expansive single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNAseq) analysis. By implementing a novel computational pipeline comprising sparse non-negative matrix factorization, consensus clustering, and combinatorial gene expression pattern identification, we detect hundreds of transcriptional markers within region-specific neuronal phenotypes, enabling discovery of gene expression patterns along the developmental axes. These findings highlight the potential of these resources to advance a mechanistic understanding of pCNS development, expand the potential and accuracy of in vitro models, and inform novel regenerative therapeutic strategies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Targeted Tshz3 deletion in corticostriatal circuit components segregates core autistic behaviors</a></h4>

              
                We previously linked TSHZ3 haploinsufficiency to autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and showed that embryonic or postnatal Tshz3 deletion in mice results in behavioral traits relevant to the two core domains of ASD, namely social interaction deficits and repetitive behaviors. Here, we provide evidence that cortical projection neurons (CPNs) and striatal cholinergic interneurons (SCINs) are two main and complementary players in the TSHZ3-linked ASD syndrome. We show that in the cerebral cortex, TSHZ3 is expressed in CPNs and in a proportion of GABA interneurons, while not in cholinergic interneurons or glial cells. TSHZ3-expressing cells, which are predominantly SCINs in the striatum, represent a low proportion of neurons in the ascending cholinergic projection system. We then characterized two new conditional knockout (cKO) models generated by crossing Tshz3flox/flox with Emx1-Cre (Emx1-cKO) or Chat-Cre (Chat-cKO) mice to decipher the respective role of CPNs and SCINs. Emx1-cKO mice show altered excitatory synaptic transmission onto CPNs and plasticity at corticostriatal synapses, with neither cortical neuron loss nor impaired layer distribution. These animals present social interaction deficits but no repetitive patterns of behavior. Chat-cKO mice exhibit no loss of SCINs but changes in the electrophysiological properties of these interneurons, associated with repetitive patterns of behavior without social interaction deficits. Therefore, dysfunction in either CPNs or SCINs segregates with a distinct ASD behavioral trait. These findings provide novel insights onto the implication of the corticostriatal circuitry in ASD by revealing an unexpected neuronal dichotomy in the biological background of the two core behavioral domains of this disorder.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Reward timing matters in motor learning</a></h4>

              
                Reward can improve motor learning and the consolidation of motor memories. Identifying the features of reward feedback that are critical for motor learning is a necessary step for successful integration into rehabilitation programs. One central feature of reward feedback that may affect motor learning is its timing, that is, the delay after which reward is delivered following movement execution. In fact, research on associative learning has shown that short and long reward delays (e.g., 1 and 6 s following action execution) activate preferentially the striatum and the hippocampus, respectively, which both contribute with varying degrees to motor learning. Given the distinct functional role of these two areas, we hypothesized that reward timing could modulate how people learn and consolidate a new motor skill. In sixty healthy participants, we found that delaying reward delivery by a few seconds influenced motor learning dynamics. Indeed, training with a short reward delay (i.e., 1 s) induced slow, yet continuous gains in performance, while a long reward delay (i.e., 6 s) led to initially high learning rates that were followed by an early plateau in the learning curve and a lower endpoint performance. Moreover, participants who successfully learned the skill with a short reward delay displayed overnight consolidation, while those who trained with a long reward delay exhibited an impairment in the consolidation of the motor memory. Overall, our data show that reward timing affects motor learning, potentially by modulating the engagement of different learning processes, a finding that could be exploited in future rehabilitation programs.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">On the brain networks organization of individuals with high versus average fluid intelligence: a combined DTI and MEG study</a></h4>

              
                The neural underpinning of human fluid intelligence (Gf) has gathered a large interest in the scientific community. Nonetheless, previous research did not provide a full understanding of such intriguing topic. Here, we studied the structural (from diffusion tensor imaging, DTI) and functional (from magnetoencephalography (MEG) resting state) connectivity in individuals with high versus average Gf scores. Our findings showed greater values in the brain areas degree distribution and higher proportion of long-range anatomical connections for high versus average Gfs. Further, the two groups presented different community structures, highlighting the structural and functional integration of the cingulate within frontal subnetworks of the brain in high Gfs. These results were consistently observed for structural connectivity and functional connectivity of delta, theta and alpha. Notably, gamma presented an opposite pattern, showing more segregation and lower degree distribution and connectivity in high versus average Gfs. Our study confirmed and expanded previous perspectives and knowledge on the small-worldness of the brain. Further, it complemented the widely investigated structural brain network of highly intelligent individuals with analyses on fast-scale functional networks in five frequency bands, highlighting key differences in the integration and segregation of information flow between slow and fast oscillations in groups with different Gf.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Predicting the Influence of Axon Myelination on Sound Localization Precision Using a Spiking Neural Network Model of Auditory Brainstem</a></h4>

              
                Spatial hearing allows animals to rapidly detect and localize auditory events in the surrounding environment. The auditory brainstem plays a central role in processing and extracting binaural spatial cues through microsecond-precise binaural integration, especially for detecting interaural time differences (ITDs) of low-frequency sounds at the medial superior olive (MSO). A series of mechanisms exist in the underlying neural circuits for preserving accurate action potential timing across multiple fibers, synapses and nuclei along this pathway. One of these is the myelination of afferent fibers that ensures reliable and temporally precise action potential propagation in the axon. There are several reports of fine-tuned myelination patterns in the MSO circuit, but how specifically myelination influences the precision of sound localization remains incompletely understood. Here we present a spiking neural network model of the auditory brainstem with myelinated axons to investigate whether different axon myelination thicknesses alter the sound localization process. Our model demonstrates that axon myelin thickness along the contralateral pathways can substantially modulate ITD detection. Furthermore, optimal ITD sensitivity is reached when the MSO receives contralateral inhibition via thicker myelinated axons compared to contralateral excitation, a result that is consistent with previously reported experimental observations. Our results suggest specific roles of axon myelination for extracting temporal dynamics in ITD perception, especially in the pathway of the contralateral inhibition.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Short-term plasticity in the visual thalamus</a></h4>

              
                While there is evidence that the visual cortex retains a potential for plasticity in adulthood, less is known about the subcortical stages of visual processing. Here we asked whether short-term ocular dominance plasticity affects the visual thalamus. We addressed this question in normally sighted adult humans, using ultra-high field (7T) magnetic resonance imaging combined with the paradigm of short-term monocular deprivation. With this approach, we previously demonstrated transient shifts of perceptual eye dominance and ocular dominance in visual cortex (Binda et al., 2018). Here we report evidence for short-term plasticity in the ventral division of the pulvinar (vPulv), where the deprived eye representation was enhanced over the non-deprived eye. This pulvinar plasticity effect was similar as previously seen in visual cortex and it was correlated with the ocular dominance shift measured behaviorally. In contrast, there was no short-term plasticity effect in Lateral Geniculate Nucleus (LGN), where results were reliably different from vPulv, despite their spatial proximity. We conclude that the visual thalamus retains potential for short-term plasticity in adulthood; the plasticity effect differs across thalamic subregions, possibly reflecting differences in their cortical connectivity.

                Pyramidal cells of neocortical layer 2/3 (L2/3 PyrCs) integrate signals from numerous brain areas and project throughout the neocortex. Within L2/3, PyrCs show functional and structural specializations depending on their pial depth, indicating participation in different functional microcircuits. However, it is unknown whether these depth-dependent differences result from separable L2/3 PyrC subtypes or whether functional and structural features represent a continuum while correlating with pial depth. Here, we assessed the stimulus selectivity, electrophysiological properties, dendritic morphology, and excitatory and inhibitory synaptic connectivity across the depth of L2/3 in the binocular visual cortex (bV1) of female mice. We find that the structure of the apical but not the basal dendritic tree varies with pial depth, which is accompanied by differences in passive but not active electrophysiological properties. PyrCs in lower L2/3 receive increased excitatory and inhibitory input from L4, while upper L2/3 PyrCs receive a larger proportion of intralaminar input. Complementary in vivo calcium imaging revealed a systematic change in visual responsiveness, with deeper L2/3 PyrCs showing more robust responses than superficial PyrCs. Furthermore, deeper L2/3 PyrCs are more strongly driven by contralateral than ipsilateral eye stimulation. In contrast, orientation- and direction-selectivity of L2/3 PyrCs are not dependent on pial depth. Importantly, the transitions of the various properties are gradual, and cluster analysis does not support the classification of L2/3 PyrCs into discrete subtypes. These results show that L2/3 PyrCs' multiple functional and structural properties systematically correlate with their depth within L2/3, forming a continuum rather than representing discrete subtypes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Stable modulation of neuronal oscillations produced through brain-machine equilibrium</a></h4>

              
                Brain stimulation is predominantly delivered independent of ongoing activity, whereas closed-loop systems can modify activity through interaction. They have the unrealised potential to continuously bind external stimulation to specific dynamics of a neural circuit. Such manipulations are particularly suited to rhythmic activities, where neuronal activity is organised in oscillatory cycles. Here, we developed a fast algorithm that responds on a cycle-by-cycle basis to stimulate basal ganglia nuclei at predetermined phases of successive cortical beta cycles in parkinsonian rats. Using this approach, we demonstrate a stable brain-machine interaction. An equilibrium emerged between the modified brain signal and feedback-dependent stimulation pattern, which led to sustained amplification or suppression of the oscillation. Sustained beta amplification slowed movement speed by altering the mode of locomotion. Integrating an external stimulus with network activity in this way could be used to correct maladaptive activities and to define the role of oscillations in fundamental brain functions.

                Despite the incessant retinal disruptions that necessarily accompany eye movements, our percept of the visual world remains continuous and stable--a phenomenon referred to as spatial constancy. How the visual system achieves spatial constancy remains unclear despite almost four centuries worth of experimentation. Here I measured visual sensitivity at geometrically symmetric locations, observing transient sensitivity differences between them where none should be observed if cells that support spatial constancy indeed faithfully translate or converge. These differences, recapitulated by a novel neurobiological mechanical model, reflect an overriding influence of putative visually transient error signals that curve visual space. Intermediate eccentric locations likely to contain retinal disruptions are uniquely affected by curved visual space, suggesting that visual processing at these locations is transiently turned off before an eye movement, and with the gating off of these error signals, turned back on after an eye-movement-- a possible mechanism underlying spatial constancy.

                Sex differences in neurodegenerative disorder prevalence have been attributed to life expectancy, modifiable risk factors related to lifestyle and the impact of changes in sex hormones and the reproductive system. Although these factors are known to interact with one another, they are often studied in isolation. Here, we used a multivariate approach to investigate how lifestyle, along with menopause and the number of children, interacts with cortical thickness (CT) in healthy adults. Using CT measures from T1-weighted scans (MPRAGE, 1 mm3 voxels; 124 participants; 67 females; 40-70 years old) from the Cam-CAN dataset. Using a partial least squares decomposition, we identified patterns of covariance between CT and lifestyle factors, menopause and the number of children. In women, we identified significant patterns that linked education, socioeconomic status, social contact and length of reproductive period to CT in the left prefrontal cortex, as well as alcohol consumption, physical activity and menopausal status to CT in the frontal poles. Contrastingly, the results in men were driven by education and anxiety, and involved increased CT in the temporal poles. Our findings suggests that sex differences in cortical anatomy during brain ageing might be driven by interactions between contrasting lifestyles and the female-specific endocrine environment.

                The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) has been implicated in a number of functions including performance monitoring and decision making involving effort. The prediction of responses and outcomes (PRO) model has provided a unified account of much human and monkey ACC data involving anatomy, neurophysiology, EEG, fMRI, and behavior. Here we explore the computational nature of ACC with the PRO model, extending it to account specifically for both human and macaque monkey decision-making under risk, including both behavioral and neural data. We show that the PRO model can account for a number of additional effects related to outcome prediction, decision-making under risk, gambling behavior, and we show that the ACC represents the variance of uncertain outcomes, suggesting a link between ACC function and mean-variance theories of decision making. The PRO model provides a unified account of a large set of data regarding the ACC.

                Introduction: To better understand the relationships between brain activity, cognitive function and mental health risk in adolescence there is value in identifying data-driven subgroups based on measurements of brain activity and function, and then comparing cognition and mental health symptoms between such subgroups. Methods: Here we implement a multi-stage analysis pipeline to identify data-driven clusters of 12-year-olds (M = 12.64, SD = 0.32) based on frequency characteristics calculated from resting state, eyes-closed electroencephalography (EEG) recordings. EEG data was collected from 59 individuals as part of their baseline assessment in the Longitudinal Adolescent Brain Study (LABS) being undertaken in Queensland, Australia. Applying multiple unsupervised clustering algorithms to these EEG features, we identified well-separated subgroups of individuals. To study patterns of difference in cognitive function and mental health symptoms between core clusters, we applied Bayesian regression models to probabilistically identify differences in these measures between clusters. Results: We identified 5 core clusters which were associated with distinct subtypes of resting state EEG frequency content. EEG features that were influential in differentiating clusters included Individual Alpha Frequency, relative power in 4 Hz bands up to 16 Hz, and 95% Spectral Edge Frequency. Bayesian models demonstrated substantial differences in psychological distress, sleep quality and cognitive function between these clusters. By examining associations between neurophysiology and health measures across clusters, we have identified preliminary risk and protective profiles linked to EEG characteristics. Conclusion: In this work we have developed a flexible and scaleable pipeline to identify subgroups of individuals in early adolescence on the basis of resting state EEG activity. These findings provide new clues about neurophysiological subgroups of adolescents in the general population, and associated patterns of health and cognition that are not observed at the whole group level. This approach offers potential utility in clinical risk prediction for mental and cognitive health outcomes throughout adolescent development.

                Neuroscience has seen a dramatic increase in the types of recording modalities and complexity of neural time-series data collected from them. The brain is a highly recurrent system producing rich, complex dynamics that result in different behaviors. Correctly distinguishing such nonlinear neural time series in real-time, especially those with non-obvious links to behavior, could be useful for a wide variety of applications. These include detecting anomalous clinical events such as seizures in epilepsy, and identifying optimal control spaces for brain machine interfaces. It remains challenging to correctly distinguish nonlinear time-series patterns because of the high intrinsic dimensionality of such data, making accurate inference of state changes (for intervention or control) difficult. Simple distance metrics, which can be computed quickly do not yield accurate classifications. On the other end of the spectrum of classification methods, ensembles of classifiers or deep supervised tools offer higher accuracy but are slow, data-intensive, and computationally expensive. We introduce a reservoir-based tool, state tracker (TRAKR), which offers the high accuracy of ensembles or deep supervised methods while preserving the computational benefits of simple distance metrics. After one-shot training, TRAKR can accurately, and in real time, detect deviations in test patterns. By forcing the weighted dynamics of the reservoir to fit a desired pattern directly, we avoid many rounds of expensive optimization. Then, keeping the output weights frozen, we use the error signal generated by the reservoir in response to a particular test pattern as a classification boundary. We show that, using this approach, TRAKR accurately detects changes in synthetic time series. We then compare our tool to several others, showing that it achieves highest classification performance on a benchmark dataset, sequential MNIST, even when corrupted by noise. Additionally, we apply TRAKR to electrocorticography (ECoG) data from the macaque orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), a higher-order brain region involved in encoding the value of expected outcomes. We show that TRAKR can classify different behaviorally relevant epochs in the neural time series more accurately and efficiently than conventional approaches. Therefore, TRAKR can be used as a fast and accurate tool to distinguish patterns in complex nonlinear time-series data, such as neural recordings.

                Exposure to cyanotoxins has been linked to neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's disease. While the cyanotoxin beta-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA) has received much attention, cyanobacteria produce many cyanotoxic compounds, several of which have been detected in nature alongside BMAA including 2,4-diaminobutyric acid (2,4-DAB), and N-(2-aminoethyl)glycine (AEG). Thus, the question of whether DAB and AEG also cause neurotoxic effects in vivo is of great interest, as is the question of whether they interact to enhance toxicity. Here, we evaluate the toxic and neurotoxic effects of these cyanotoxins alone or in combination by measuring zebrafish larval viability and behavior after exposure. 2,4-DAB was the most potent cyanotoxin as it decreased larval viability by approximately 50% at 6 days post fertilization, while BMAA and AEG decreased viability by just 16% and 8%, respectively. Although we only observed minor neurotoxic effects on spontaneous locomotion, BMAA and AEG enhanced acoustic startle sensitivity, and they interacted in an additive manner to exert their effects. 2,4-DAB, however, only modulated the startle kinematics, an indication of motor dysfunction. To investigate the mechanisms of 2,4-DAB's effects, we analyzed the protein profile of larval zebrafish exposed to 500 uM 2,4-DAB at two time points and identified molecular signatures consistent with neurodegeneration, including disruption of metabolic pathways and downregulation of the ALS-associated genes SOD1 and UBQLN4. Together, our data demonstrate that BMAA and its isomers AEG and 2,4-DAB cause neurotoxic effects in vivo, with 2,4-DAB as the most potent of the three in the zebrafish model.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Composite receptive fields in the mouse auditory cortex</a></h4>

              
                A central question in sensory neuroscience is how neurons represent complex natural stimuli. This process involves multiple steps of feature extraction to obtain a condensed, categorical representation useful for classification and behavior. It has previously been shown that central auditory neurons in the starling have composite receptive fields composed of multiple features when probed with conspecific songs. Whether this property is an idiosyncratic characteristic of songbirds, a group of highly specialized vocal learners, or a generic characteristic of central auditory systems in different animals is, however, unknown. To address this question, we have recorded responses from auditory cortical neurons in mice, and characterized their receptive fields using mouse ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) as a natural and ethologically relevant stimulus and pitch-shifted starling songs as a natural but ethologically irrelevant control stimulus. We have found that auditory cortical neurons in the mouse display composite receptive fields with multiple excitatory and inhibitory subunits. Moreover, this was the case with either the conspecific or the heterospecific vocalizations. We then trained the sparse filtering algorithm on both classes of natural stimuli to obtain statistically optimal features, and compared the natural and artificial features using UMAP, a dimensionality-reduction algorithm previously used to analyze mouse USVs and birdsongs. We have found that the receptive-field features obtained with the mouse USVs and those obtained with the pitch-shifted starling songs clustered together, as did the sparse-filtering features. However, the natural and artificial receptive-field features clustered mostly separately. These results indicate that composite receptive fields are likely a generic property of central auditory systems in different classes of animals. They further suggest that the quadratic receptive-field features of the mouse auditory cortical neurons are natural-stimulus invariant.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Repetition-attenuation of auditory N1 is modulated by the phonological representations of spoken word-forms</a></h4>

              
                Repeated auditory stimuli are usually found to elicit attenuated peak amplitude of the N1 component of the event related brain potential (ERP). While the repetition-attenuation of the auditory N1 has been found sensitive to some cognitive factors, less is known whether and how the representational properties of stimuli influence this physiological phenomenon. To further address this issue, we focus on the phonological representations of spoken word-forms, and hypothesise modulatory roles of two phonological features: the lexicality and its usage frequency of a word-form. To test this, we used a short-term habituation design with a factorial combination of the two features at two levels each (i.e., lexicality (real versus pseudo word-form) X frequency (high versus low frequency)). EEG was recorded from 30 native Mandarin-speaking participants while they were passively delivered with stimulations trains. Each train consisted of five presentation positions (S1 ~ S5), on which one word-form is presented repeatedly, separated by a brief, constant interstimulus interval. At the fourth presentation position (S4), we found greater N1 attenuation in low-frequency pseudo word-forms than in low-frequency real and high-frequency pseudo word-forms, respectively. The results support our representational modulation hypothesis, and provides the first evidence that representations of different phonological features interactively modulate the N1 repetition-attenuation. The brain function that underlies the phonological effects of the representational modulation on N1 repetition-attenuation might be sensory filtering.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The secreted neuronal signal Spock1 regulates the blood-brain barrier</a></h4>

              
                The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is comprised of a single layer of endothelial cells with uniquely restrictive properties required for maintaining a tightly controlled homeostatic environment in the brain. Classic quail-chick grafting experiments showed that BBB properties are not intrinsic to brain endothelial cells, but instead are induced by signals from the embryonic brain microenvironment. Here we have identified a neuronally produced signal, Spock1, that specifically regulates BBB functional development in both zebrafish and mice without affecting angiogenesis. Using a combination of mosaic genetic analysis, tracer leakage assays and live imaging we show that Spock1 from neurons can regulate brain vasculature permeability non-cell autonomously. Electron microscopy analyses of spock1 mutants revealed that the leakage arises predominantly through increased endothelial transcytosis of both clathrin-independent small and large vesicles due to altered pericyte-endothelial interactions. Single-cell RNA sequencing analyses revealed a reduction in vascular expression of the cell adhesion molecule mcamb in the spock1 mutants, and this down-regulation of mcamb occurred specifically in regions with increased BBB leakage. These analyses indicate that the neuronal signal Spock1 regulates BBB properties by altering vascular gene expression and cellular interactions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Motor Learning Drives Dynamic Patterns of Intermittent Myelination onBehaviorally-Activated Axons</a></h4>

              
                Myelin plasticity occurs when newly-formed and pre-existing oligodendrocytes remodel existing myelination. Recent studies show these processes occur in response to changes in neuronal activity and are required for learning and memory. However, the link between behaviorally-relevant neuronal activity and circuit-specific changes in myelination remains unknown. Using longitudinal, in vivo two-photon imaging and targeted labeling of behaviorally-activated neurons, we explore how the pattern of intermittent myelination is altered on individual cortical axons during learning of a dexterous reach task. We show that learning-induced plasticity is targeted to behaviorally-activated axons and occurs in a staged response across cortical layers. During learning, myelin sheaths retract, lengthening nodes of Ranvier. Following learning, addition of new sheaths increases the number of continuous stretches of myelination. Computational modeling suggests these changes initially slow and subsequently increase conduction speed. Thus, behaviorally-activated, circuit-specific changes to myelination may fundamentally alter how information is transferred in neural circuits during learning.

                In human neurodegenerative diseases, neurons undergo axonal degeneration months to years before they die. Here, we developed a system modelling early degenerative events in Drosophila adult photoreceptor cells. Thanks to the stereotypy of their axonal projections, this system delivers quantitative data on sporadic and progressive axonal degeneration of photoreceptor cells. Using this method, we show that exposure of adult flies to a constant light stimulation for several days overcomes the intrinsic resilience of R7 photoreceptors and leads to progressive axonal degeneration. This was not associated with apoptosis. We furthermore provide evidence that loss of synaptic integrity between R7 and a postsynaptic partner preceded axonal degeneration, thus recapitulating features of human neurodegenerative diseases. Finally, our experiments uncovered that neurotransmission to postsynaptic partners of R7 and their response are required to initiate degeneration, suggesting that postsynaptic cells signal back to the photoreceptor to maintain axonal structure. This model can be used to dissect cellular circuit mechanisms involved in the early events of axonal degeneration, allowing for a better understanding of how neurons cope with stress and lose their resilience capacities.

                Aim: Spirulina is a microalga that is widely used as a food supplement and is regarded as having performance enhancing and health promoting properties. We conducted a preliminary evaluation of the possible antidepressant, anti-anxiety, pro-socialization and cognition-enhancing effects of Spirulina in mouse models. Methods: Sixty male BalbC mice aged 3 weeks were administered phycocyanin-rich Spirulina extract (PRSE, 545 mg/kg), fluoxetine (20 mg/kg) or water orally for 5 weeks. During the last 2 weeks of the experiment a series of behavioral-cognitive tests was performed to evaluate motor activity, antidepressant and anti-anxiety effects, socialization and cognitive effects. Effects of PRSE and fluoxetine were compared to those of water. Results: There was a significant effect of PRSE in the activity domain, manifesting as an increase in velocity in the open field (p=0.0007 vs. water). Fluoxetine significantly enhanced immobility in the tail suspension test and the forced swim test reflecting the known antidepressant effect of this compound, but not PRSE. There were no significant effects of PRSE in tests of anxiety, socialization or cognition. Conclusions: The most striking observation in this study was that PRSE significantly enhanced activity in the open field test. Further studies are indicated to confirm and extend this finding and investigate possible mechanisms of action. The results of the current study do not support sporadic reports of possible antidepressant or cognition-enhancing effects of PRSE. Nevertheless, additional studies are indicated using depression models rather than naive mice, alternative mouse strains, using additional cognitive tests, and administering higher PRSE doses.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Parkinsonian gait effects with DBS are associated with pallido-peduncular axis activation</a></h4>

              
                Background: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) targeting the subthalamic nucleus (STN) often shows variable outcomes on treating gait dysfunction in Parkinson's disease (PD). Such variability may stem from which specific neuronal pathways are modulated by DBS and the extent to which those pathways are modulated relative to one another. Objective: Leveraging ultra-high-field (7T) imaging data and subject-specific computational models, this study investigated how activation of seven distinct pathways in and around STN, including the pallidopeduncular and pedunculopallidal pathways, affect step length at clinically-optimized STN-DBS settings. Methods: Personalized computational models were developed for 10 subjects with a clinical diagnosis of PD and with bilateral STN-DBS implants. Results: The subject-specific pathway activation models showed a significant positive association between activation of the pedunculopallidal pathway and increased step length, and negative association on step length with pallidopeduncular pathway and hyperdirect pathway activation. Conclusions: The STN region includes multiple pathways, including fibers of passage to and from the mesencephalic locomotor area. Future clinical optimization of STN-DBS should consider these fibers of passage in the context of treating parkinsonian gait.

                Genetically encoded fluorescent voltage indicators are ideally suited to reveal the millisecond-scale interactions among and between distinct, targeted cell populations. However, current indicator families lack the requisite sensitivity for in vivo multipopulation imaging. We describe high-performance green and red sensors, Ace-mNeon2 and VARNAM2, and their reverse response-polarity variants, pAce and pAceR. Our indicators enable 0.4-1 kHz voltage recordings from >50 neurons per field-of-view in awake mice and ~30-min continuous imaging in flies. Using dual-polarity multiplexed imaging, we uncovered behavioral state-dependent interactions between distinct neocortical subclasses, as well as contributions to hippocampal field potentials from non-overlapping projection neuronal ensembles. By combining three mutually compatible indicators, we demonstrate concurrent triple-population voltage imaging. Our approach will empower investigations of the dynamic interplay between neuronal subclasses at single-spike resolution.

                Narcolepsy Type 1 (NT1), a sleep disorder with similar prevalence in both sexes, is thought to be due to loss of the hypocretin/orexin (Hcrt) neurons. Several transgenic strains have been created to model this disorder and are increasingly being used for preclinical drug development and basic science studies, yet most studies have solely used male mice. We compared the development of narcoleptic symptomatology in male vs. female orexin-tTA; TetO-DTA mice, a model in which Hcrt neuron degeneration can be initiated by removal of doxycycline (DOX) from the diet. EEG, EMG, body temperature, gross motor activity and video recordings were conducted for 24-h at baseline and 1, 2, 4 and 6 weeks after DOX removal. Female DTA mice exhibited cataplexy, the pathognomonic symptom of NT1, by Week 1 in the DOX(-) condition but cataplexy was not consistently present in males until Week 2. By Week 2, both sexes showed an impaired ability to sustain long wake bouts during the active period, the murine equivalent of excessive daytime sleepiness in NT1. Body temperature appeared to be regulated at lower levels in both sexes as the Hcrt neurons degenerated. During degeneration, both sexes also exhibited the Delta State, characterized by sudden cessation of activity, high delta activity in the EEG, maintenance of muscle tone and posture, and the absence of phasic EMG activity. Since the phenotypes of the two sexes were indistinguishable by Week 6, we conclude that both sexes can be safely combined in future studies to reduce cost and animal use.

                Our ability to remember the past is essential for guiding our future behavior. Psychological and neurobiological features of declarative memories are known to transform over time in a process known as systems consolidation. While many theories have sought to explain the time-varying role of hippocampal and neocortical brain areas, the computational principles that govern these transformations remain unclear. Here we propose a theory of systems consolidation in which hippocampal-cortical interactions serve to optimize generalizations that guide future adaptive behavior. We use mathematical analysis of neural network models to characterize fundamental performance tradeoffs in systems consolidation, revealing that memory components should be organized according to their predictability. The theory shows that multiple interacting memory systems can outperform just one, normatively unifying diverse experimental observations and making novel experimental predictions. Our results suggest that the psychological taxonomy and neurobiological organization of declarative memories reflect a system optimized for behaving well in an uncertain future.

	<p>Background: Interoceptive accuracy and sensibility are decreased in depressive samples. However, different studies showed that cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) and mindfulness interventions are promising approaches to improve interoceptive abilities. Based on these findings, the study aims to investigate the pre–post effect of CBT in a depressive sample. Additionally, we examined the effect of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) training in the context of CBT. Methods: Sixty depressive patients were investigated over four weeks, with two conditions—CBT vs. CBT + MBSR. Further, the changes in interoceptive abilities (interoceptive accuracy and sensibility) of the depressive patients were compared to baseline data of healthy controls. Results: The depressive patients showed significantly higher levels of depression and lower mindfulness and interoceptive abilities than healthy controls. The depressive sample showed a significant decrease in depressive symptoms and increased mindfulness and interoceptive abilities after CBT. Lastly, depressive patients of the CBT + MBSR condition did not differ from those who only received CBT in the levels of depression, mindfulness or interoceptive abilities over the time course. Discussion: This study demonstrates a positive effect of CBT on interoceptive abilities in a depressive sample. It is shown that the depressive sample did not profit from additional mindfulness training. It can be concluded that CBT is an efficient treatment, resulting in increased interoceptive abilities. Unexpectedly, the combination of CBT and MBSR has no additional effect on these changes. Future studies should investigate the effect of MBSR as a stand-alone therapy.</p>

	<p>Previous studies have found that transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) can significantly enhance individuals’ working memory performance. However, it is still unclear whether the memory performance enhancement was attributed to the quantity or the quality of working memory. The current study applies tACS over the right parietal cortex at slower (4 Hz) and faster (7 Hz) frequencies to participants with high and low working memory capacities in a color recall memory task. This enabled us to explore the tACS effects on the quantity and quality of the working memory for individuals with different memory capacities. The results revealed that slower frequency (4 Hz) tACS enhanced the quality of memory representations, and faster frequency (7 Hz) tACS principally impaired the quantity of working memory. The underlying mechanism of this effect might be that tACS at different frequencies modulate the memory resources, which then selectively affect the quantity and quality of memory representations. Importantly, individual traits, as well as memory strategies, may be crucial factors to consider when testing the effect of tACS on working memory performance.</p>

	<p>The medial posterior parietal cortex (PPC) is involved in the complex processes of visuomotor integration. Its connections to the dorsal premotor cortex, which in turn is connected to the primary motor cortex (M1), complete the fronto-parietal network that supports important cognitive functions in the planning and execution of goal-oriented movements. In this study, we wanted to investigate the time-course of the functional connectivity at rest between the medial PPC and the M1 using dual-site transcranial magnetic stimulation in healthy humans. We stimulated the left M1 using a suprathreshold test stimulus to elicit motor-evoked potentials in the hand, and a subthreshold conditioning stimulus was applied over the left medial PPC at different inter-stimulus intervals (ISIs). The conditioning stimulus affected the M1 excitability depending on the ISI, with inhibition at longer ISIs (12 and 15 ms). We suggest that these modulations may reflect the activation of different parieto-frontal pathways, with long latency inhibitions likely recruiting polisynaptic pathways, presumably through anterolateral PPC.</p>

	<p>Even though increasing literature describes changes in emotional processing in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), efforts to summarize relevant findings are lacking in the field. A systematic literature review was performed to provide a critical and up-to-date account of emotional abilities in ALS. References were identified by searches of PubMed, Web of Science and Scopus (1980–2021, English literature), with the following key terms: (“Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis” or “Primary Lateral Sclerosis” or “Motor Neuron”) and “Emotion*” and (“Processing” or “Attribution” or “Elaboration” or “Perception” or “Recognition”). Studies concerning only caregivers, pseudobulbar affect, and social cognition were excluded. Forty-one articles were included, all concerning ALS, and seven topics were identified: Emotion recognition, Emotional responsiveness, Emotional reactivity, Faces approachability rating, Valence rating, Memory for emotional materials and Alexithymia. The majority of these aspects have only been sparsely addressed. The evidence confirms altered emotional processing in ALS. The most consistent findings regard the recognition of facial expressions for negative emotions, but also alterations in the subjective responsiveness to emotional stimuli (arousal, valence and approachability), in psychophysiological and cerebral reactivity and in emotional memory, together with alexithymia traits, were reported. According to this evidence, emotional abilities should be included in the clinical assessment and therapeutic interventions.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) is a highly heterogeneous neurologic disorder characterized by lower-extremity spasticity. Here, we set out to determine the genetic basis of an autosomal dominant, pure, and infantile-onset form of HSP in a cohort of 8 patients with a uniform clinical presentation.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Trio whole-exome sequencing was used in 5 index patients with infantile-onset pure HSP to determine the genetic cause of disease. The functional impact of identified genetic variants was verified using bioinformatics and complementary cellular and biochemical assays.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Distinct heterozygous <i>KPNA3</i> missense variants were found to segregate with the clinical phenotype in 8 patients; in 4 of them <i>KPNA3</i> variants had occurred de novo. Mutant karyopherin-α3 proteins exhibited a variable pattern of altered expression level, subcellular distribution, and protein interaction.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our genetic findings implicate heterozygous variants in <i>KPNA3</i> as a novel cause for autosomal dominant, early-onset, and pure HSP. Mutant karyopherin-α3 proteins display varying deficits in molecular and cellular functions, thus, for the first time, implicating dysfunctional nucleocytoplasmic shuttling as a novel pathomechanism causing HSP.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The aim was to compare the outcomes of subdural electrode (SDE) implantations versus stereotactic electroencephalography (SEEG), the 2 predominant methods of intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) performed in difficult-to-localize drug-resistant focal epilepsy.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The Surgical Therapies Commission of the International League Against Epilepsy created an international registry of iEEG patients implanted between 2005 and 2019 with ≥1 year of follow-up. We used propensity score matching to control exposure selection bias and generate comparable cohorts. Study endpoints were: (1) likelihood of resection after iEEG; (2) seizure freedom at last follow-up; and (3) complications (composite of postoperative infection, symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, or permanent neurological deficit).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Ten study sites from 7 countries and 3 continents contributed 2,012 patients, including 1,468 (73%) eligible for analysis (526 SDE and 942 SEEG), of whom 988 (67%) underwent subsequent resection. Propensity score matching improved covariate balance between exposure groups for all analyses. Propensity-matched patients who underwent SDE had higher odds of subsequent resective surgery (odds ratio [OR] = 1.4, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.05, 1.84) and higher odds of complications (OR = 2.24, 95% CI 1.34, 3.74; unadjusted: 9.6% after SDE vs 3.3% after SEEG). Odds of seizure freedom in propensity-matched resected patients were 1.66 times higher (95% CI 1.21, 2.26) for SEEG compared with SDE (unadjusted: 55% seizure free after SEEG-guided resections vs 41% after SDE).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In comparison to SEEG, SDE evaluations are more likely to lead to brain surgery in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy but have more surgical complications and lower probability of seizure freedom. This comparative-effectiveness study provides the highest feasible evidence level to guide decisions on iEEG. ANN NEUROL 2021</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Huntington&rsquo;s disease (HD) is an inherited neurodegenerative disorder with onset of characteristic motor symptoms at midlife, preceded by subtle cognitive and behavioral disturbances. Transcriptional dysregulation emerges early in the disease course and is considered central to HD pathogenesis. Using wild-type (wt) and HD knock-in mouse striatal cell lines we observed a HD genotype-dependent reduction in the protein levels of transcription factor 4 (TCF4), a member of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) family with critical roles in brain development and function. We characterized mouse <I>Tcf4</I> gene structure and expression of alternative mRNAs and protein isoforms in cell-based models of HD, and in four different brain regions of male transgenic HD mice (R6/1) from young to mature adulthood. The largest decrease in the levels of TCF4 at mRNA and specific protein isoforms were detected in the R6/1 mouse hippocampus. Translating this finding to human disease, we found reduced expression of long TCF4 isoforms in the postmortem hippocampal CA1 area and in the cerebral cortex of HD patients. Additionally, TCF4 protein isoforms showed differential synergism with the proneural transcription factor ASCL1 in activating reporter gene transcription in hippocampal and cortical cultured neurons. Induction of neuronal activity increased these synergistic effects in hippocampal but not in cortical neurons, suggesting brain region-dependent differences in TCF4 functions. Collectively, this study demonstrates isoform-specific changes in TCF4 expression in HD that could contribute to the progressive impairment of transcriptional regulation and neuronal function in this disease.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Normal Aging Affects the Short-Term Temporal Stability of Implicit, But Not Explicit, Motor Learning following Visuomotor Adaptation</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Normal aging is associated with a decline in memory and motor learning ability. However, the exact form of these impairments (e.g., the short-term temporal stability and affected learning mechanisms) is largely unknown. Here, we used a sensorimotor adaptation task to examine changes in the temporal stability of two forms of learning (explicit and implicit) because of normal aging. Healthy young subjects (age range, 19&ndash;28 years; 20 individuals) and older human subjects (age range, 63&ndash;85 years; 19 individuals) made reaching movements in response to altered visual feedback. On each trial, subjects turned a rotation dial to select an explicit aiming direction. Once selected, the display was removed and subjects moved the cursor from the start position to the target. After initial training with the rotational feedback perturbation, subjects completed a series of probe trials at different delay periods to systematically assess the short-term retention of learning. For both groups, the explicit aiming showed no significant decrease over 1.5 min. However, this was not the case for implicit learning; the decay pattern was markedly different between groups. Older subjects showed a linear decrease of the implicit component of adaptation over time, while young subjects showed an exponential decay over the same period (time constant, 25.61 s). Although older subjects adapted at a similar rate, these results suggest natural aging selectively impacts the short-term (seconds to minutes) temporal stability of implicit motor learning mechanisms. This understanding may provide a means to dissociate natural aging memory impairments from deficits caused by brain disorders that progress with aging.</p>

                Background: Knowledge about the origin of SARS-CoV-2 is necessary for both a biological and epidemiological understanding of the COVID-19 pandemic. Evidence suggests that a proximal evolutionary ancestor of SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the bat coronavirus family. However, as further evidence for a direct zoonosis remains limited, alternative modes of SARS-CoV-2 biogenesis should be also considered.    Results: Here we show that the genomes from SARS-CoV-2 and from SARS-CoV-1 are differentially enriched with short chromosomal sequences from the yeast S. cerevisiae at focal positions that are known to be critical for virus replication, host cell invasion, and host immune response. Specifically, for SARS-CoV-2, we identify two sites: one at the start of the viral replicase domain, and the other at the end of the spike gene past its critical domain junction; for SARS-CoV-1, one at the start of the RNA dependent RNA polymerase gene, and the other at the start of the spike protein’s receptor binding domain. As yeast is not a natural host for this virus family, we propose a directed passage model for viral constructs, including virus replicase, in yeast cells based on co-transformation of virus DNA plasmids carrying yeast selectable genetic markers followed by intra-chromosomal homologous recombination through gene conversion. Highly differential sequence homology data across yeast chromosomes congruent with chromosomes harboring specific auxotrophic markers further support this passage model. Model and data together allow us to infer a hypothetical tripartite genome assembly scheme for the synthetic biogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1.   Conclusions: These results provide evidence that the genome sequences of SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, but not that of RaTG13, BANAL-20-52 and all other closest SARS coronavirus family members identified, are carriers of distinct homology signals that might point to large-scale genomic editing during a passage of directed replication and chromosomal integration inside genetically modified yeast cells.

While the slipknot topology in proteins has been known for over a decade, its evolutionary origin is still a mystery. We have identified a previously overlooked slipknot motif in a family of two-domain membrane transporters. Moreover, we found that these proteins are homologous to several families of unknotted membrane proteins. This allows us to directly investigate the evolution of the slipknot motif. Based on our comprehensive analysis of 17 distantly related protein families, we have found that slipknotted and unknotted proteins share a common structural motif. Furthermore, this motif is conserved on the sequential level as well. Our results suggest that, regardless of topology, the proteins we studied evolved from a common unknotted ancestor single domain protein. Our phylogenetic analysis suggests the presence of at least seven parallel evolutionary scenarios that led to the current diversity of proteins in question. The tools we have developed in the process can now be used to investigate the evolution of other repeated-domain proteins.

Understanding how immunological memory lasts a lifetime requires quantifying changes in the number of memory cells as well as how their division and death rates change over time. We address these questions by using a statistically powerful mixed-effects differential equations framework to analyze data from two human studies that follow CD8 T cell responses to the yellow fever vaccine (YFV-17D). Models were first fit to the frequency of YFV-specific memory CD8 T cells and deuterium enrichment in those cells 42 days to 1 year post-vaccination. A different dataset, on the loss of YFV-specific CD8 T cells over three decades, was used to assess out of sample predictions of our models. The commonly used exponential and bi-exponential decline models performed relatively poorly. Models with the cell loss following a power law (exactly or approximately) were most predictive. Notably, using only the first year of data, these models accurately predicted T cell frequencies up to 30 years post-vaccination. Our analyses suggest that division rates of these cells drop and plateau at a low level (0.1% per day, ∼ double the estimated values for naive T cells) within one year following vaccination, whereas death rates continue to decline for much longer. Our results show that power laws can be predictive for T cell memory, a finding that may be useful for vaccine evaluation and epidemiological modeling. Moreover, since power laws asymptotically decline more slowly than any exponential decline, our results help explain the longevity of immune memory phenomenologically.

                <p>by Mario Castro, Rob J. de Boer</p>

In their Commentary paper, Villaverde and Massonis (On testing structural identifiability by a simple scaling method: relying on scaling symmetries can be misleading) have commented on our paper in which we proposed a simple scaling method to test structural identifiability. Our scaling invariance method (SIM) tests for scaling symmetries only, and Villaverde and Massonis correctly show the SIM may fail to detect identifiability problems when a model has other types of symmetries. We agree with the limitations raised by these authors but, also, we emphasize that the method is still valuable for its applicability to a wide variety of models, its simplicity, and even as a tool to introduce the problem of identifiability to investigators with little training in mathematics.

                <p>by Maxwell W. Libbrecht, Rachel C. W. Chan, Michael M. Hoffman</p>

Segmentation and genome annotation (SAGA) algorithms are widely used to understand genome activity and gene regulation. These algorithms take as input epigenomic datasets, such as chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-seq) measurements of histone modifications or transcription factor binding. They partition the genome and assign a label to each segment such that positions with the same label exhibit similar patterns of input data. SAGA algorithms discover categories of activity such as promoters, enhancers, or parts of genes without prior knowledge of known genomic elements. In this sense, they generally act in an unsupervised fashion like clustering algorithms, but with the additional simultaneous function of segmenting the genome. Here, we review the common methodological framework that underlies these methods, review variants of and improvements upon this basic framework, and discuss the outlook for future work. This review is intended for those interested in applying SAGA methods and for computational researchers interested in improving upon them.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Universal risk phenotype of US counties for flu-like transmission to improve county-specific COVID-19 incidence forecasts</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yi Huang, Ishanu Chattopadhyay</p>

The spread of a communicable disease is a complex spatio-temporal process shaped by the specific transmission mechanism, and diverse factors including the behavior, socio-economic and demographic properties of the host population. While the key factors shaping transmission of influenza and COVID-19 are beginning to be broadly understood, making precise forecasts on case count and mortality is still difficult. In this study we introduce the concept of a universal geospatial risk phenotype of individual US counties facilitating flu-like transmission mechanisms. We call this the Universal Influenza-like Transmission (UnIT) score, which is computed as an information-theoretic divergence of the local incidence time series from an high-risk process of epidemic initiation, inferred from almost a decade of flu season incidence data gleaned from the diagnostic history of nearly a third of the US population. Despite being computed from the past seasonal flu incidence records, the UnIT score emerges as the dominant factor explaining incidence trends for the COVID-19 pandemic over putative demographic and socio-economic factors. The predictive ability of the UnIT score is further demonstrated via county-specific weekly case count forecasts which consistently outperform the state of the art models throughout the time-line of the COVID-19 pandemic. This study demonstrates that knowledge of past epidemics may be used to chart the course of future ones, if transmission mechanisms are broadly similar, despite distinct disease processes and causative pathogens.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Interplay between mobility, multi-seeding and lockdowns shapes COVID-19 local impact</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Mattia Mazzoli, Emanuele Pepe, David Mateo, Ciro Cattuto, Laetitia Gauvin, Paolo Bajardi, Michele Tizzoni, Alberto Hernando, Sandro Meloni, José J. Ramasco</p>

Assessing the impact of mobility on epidemic spreading is of crucial importance for understanding the effect of policies like mass quarantines and selective re-openings. While many factors affect disease incidence at a local level, making it more or less homogeneous with respect to other areas, the importance of multi-seeding has often been overlooked. Multi-seeding occurs when several independent (non-clustered) infected individuals arrive at a susceptible population. This can lead to independent outbreaks that spark from distinct areas of the local contact (social) network. Such mechanism has the potential to boost incidence, making control efforts and contact tracing less effective. Here, through a modeling approach we show that the effect produced by the number of initial infections is non-linear on the incidence peak and peak time. When case importations are carried by mobility from an already infected area, this effect is further enhanced by the local demography and underlying mixing patterns: the impact of every seed is larger in smaller populations. Finally, both in the model simulations and the analysis, we show that a multi-seeding effect combined with mobility restrictions can explain the observed spatial heterogeneities in the first wave of COVID-19 incidence and mortality in five European countries. Our results allow us for identifying what we have called epidemic epicenter: an area that shapes incidence and mortality peaks in the entire country. The present work further clarifies the nonlinear effects that mobility can have on the evolution of an epidemic and highlight their relevance for epidemic control.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">On testing structural identifiability by a simple scaling method: Relying on scaling symmetries can be misleading</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Alejandro F. Villaverde, Gemma Massonis</p>

A recent paper published in <i>PLOS Computational Biology</i> [1] introduces the Scaling Invariance Method (SIM) for analysing structural local identifiability and observability. These two properties define mathematically the possibility of determining the values of the parameters (identifiability) and states (observability) of a dynamic model by observing its output. In this note we warn that SIM considers scaling symmetries as the only possible cause of non-identifiability and non-observability. We show that other types of symmetries can cause the same problems without being detected by SIM, and that in those cases the method may lead one to conclude that the model is identifiable and observable when it is actually not.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Rapid increase in snake dietary diversity and complexity following the end-Cretaceous mass extinction</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Michael C. Grundler, Daniel L. Rabosky</p>

The Cenozoic marked a period of dramatic ecological opportunity in Earth history due to the extinction of non-avian dinosaurs as well as to long-term physiographic changes that created new biogeographic theaters and new habitats. Snakes underwent massive ecological diversification during this period, repeatedly evolving novel dietary adaptations and prey preferences. The evolutionary tempo and mode of these trophic ecological changes remain virtually unknown, especially compared with co-radiating lineages of birds and mammals that are simultaneously predators and prey of snakes. Here, we assemble a dataset on snake diets (34,060 observations on the diets of 882 species) to investigate the history and dynamics of the multidimensional trophic niche during the global radiation of snakes. Our results show that per-lineage dietary niche breadths remained remarkably constant even as snakes diversified to occupy disparate outposts of dietary ecospace. Rapid increases in dietary diversity and complexity occurred in the early Cenozoic, and the overall rate of ecospace expansion has slowed through time, suggesting a potential response to ecological opportunity in the wake of the end-Cretaceous mass extinction. Explosive bursts of trophic innovation followed colonization of the Nearctic and Neotropical realms by a group of snakes that today comprises a majority of living snake diversity. Our results indicate that repeated transformational shifts in dietary ecology are important drivers of adaptive radiation in snakes and provide a framework for analyzing and visualizing the evolution of complex ecological phenotypes on phylogenetic trees.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Cost-effectiveness of patient navigation for lung cancer – a systematic review [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Patient navigation (PN) programs have been shown to increase patient satisfaction and quality of life among patients with lung cancer and to decrease time to treatment. However, the general cost-effectiveness of such programs in the context of lung cancer remains unknown. Hence, the aim of the present systematic review was to analyze the scientific literature and quantitatively assess the level of evidence on the cost-effectiveness of PN programs for patients diagnosed with lung cancer.  Methods: A systematic literature search was carried out in PubMed, EMBASE, CENTRAL, CINAHL and PsycINFO databases without time limitations. Randomized controlled trials written in English or German were eligible for inclusion if any results regarding the cost-effectiveness of personally delivered PN programs for patients after lung cancer diagnosis were reported. A manual search was carried out to supplement the systematic search. Additionally, the authors of ongoing or unpublished relevant research were contacted. The titles, abstracts and full texts of relevant citations were screened independently by two reviewers.   Results: The initial search yielded 814 articles, including four papers identified manually. Twenty-one articles were included in the full text screening. However, no study met the inclusion criteria. Contacting the authors of ongoing or unpublished research and cross-cancer studies did not yield any studies that met the inclusion criteria.   Conclusion: Since no study met the inclusion criteria, this study reveals a research gap in this area. Furthermore, no conclusive statement regarding the cost-effectiveness of patient navigation programs for patients diagnosed with lung cancer can be made. Since the implementation of new healthcare models such as PN at least partially depends on their cost-effectiveness, future attempts to evaluate PN programs for lung cancer patients should consider examining outcomes related to cost-effectiveness to overcome the identified research gap.

                Introduction: COVID-19 can be worsened by hyper-production of cytokines accompanied by increased level of oxidative stress. The aim of this study was to investigate the correlation between a set of cytokines and the markers of the oxidative stress. Methods: The levels of cytokines IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL8, IL-10, VEGF, IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-1α, MCP-1 and EGF were determined by using High Sensitivity Evidence Investigator™ Biochip Array technology. The oxidative stress parameters (d-ROM, PAT, OS index) were measured in serum on FRAS5 analytical photometric system. Results: IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, VEGF, MCP-1 and EGF were significantly higher (p<0.05) in the patients with severe COVID-19 with increased levels of IL-2, IFN-y, TNF-α and IL-1α. The d-ROM, OS index, and PAT were significantly higher (p<0.05) in severe COVID-19 patients. IL-6 demonstrated the strongest correlation with all of the markers of the oxidative stress, d-ROM (r=0.9725, p=0.0001), PAT (r=0.5000, p=0.0001) and OS index (r=0.9593, p=0.012). Similar behavior was evidenced between IFN-y and d-ROM (r=0.4006, p=0.0001), PAT (r=0.6030, p=0.0001) and OS index (r=0.4298, p=0.012). Conclusion: The oxidative stress markers show good correlation with the tested cytokines which can be measured at the beginning of the disease in a primary care setting to predict the course of COVID-19.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Toxin-like peptides in plasma, urine and faecal samples from COVID-19 patients [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: SARS-CoV-2 that causes COVID-19 disease and led to the pandemic currently affecting the world has been broadly investigated. Different studies have been performed to understand the infection mechanism, and the involved human genes, transcripts and proteins. In parallel, numerous clinical extra-pulmonary manifestations co-occurring with COVID-19 disease have been reported and evidence of their severity and persistence is increasing. Whether these manifestations are linked to other disorders co-occurring with SARS-CoV-2 infection, is under discussion. In this work, we report the identification of toxin-like peptides in COVID-19 patients by application of the Liquid Chromatography Surface-Activated Chemical Ionization – Cloud Ion Mobility Mass Spectrometry.   Methods: Plasma, urine and faecal samples from COVID-19 patients and control individuals were analysed to study peptidomic toxins’ profiles. Protein precipitation preparation procedure was used for plasma, to remove high molecular weight proteins and efficiently solubilize the peptide fraction; in the case of faeces and urine, direct peptide solubilization was employed.   Results: Toxin-like peptides, almost identical to toxic components of venoms from animals, like conotoxins, phospholipases, phosphodiesterases, zinc metal proteinases, and bradykinins, were identified in samples from COVID-19 patients, but not in control samples.  Conclusions: The presence of toxin-like peptides could potentially be connected to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Their presence suggests a possible association between COVID-19 disease and the release in the body of (oligo-)peptides almost identical to toxic components of venoms from animals. Their involvement in a large set of heterogeneous extra-pulmonary COVID-19 clinical manifestations, like neurological ones, cannot be excluded. Although the presence of each individual symptom is not selective of the disease, their combination might be related to COVID-19 by the coexistence of the panel of the here detected toxin-like peptides. The presence of these peptides opens new scenarios on the aetiology of the COVID-19 clinical symptoms observed up to now, including neurological manifestations.

Here the authors performed a genome-wide sgRNA screen to identify Morc3 as a mediator of ERV silencing. They show Morc3 associates with the H3.3 chaperone Daxx, and that loss of Morc3 leads to reduced H3.3 at ERVs.

Here, based on rolling circular reverse transcription (RCRT) and nanopore sequencing, we developed circFL-seq, a full-length circRNA sequencing method, to profile circRNA at the isoform level. With a customized computational pipeline to directly identify full-length sequences from rolling circular reads, we reconstructed 77,606 high-quality circRNAs from seven human cell lines and two human tissues. circFL-seq benefits from rolling circles and long-read sequencing, and the results showed more than tenfold enrichment of circRNA reads and advantages for both detection and quantification at the isoform level compared to those for short-read RNA sequencing. The concordance of the RT-qPCR and circFL-seq results for the identification of differential alternative splicing suggested wide application prospects for functional studies of internal variants in circRNAs. Moreover, the detection of fusion circRNAs at the omics scale may further expand the application of circFL-seq. Together, the accurate identification and quantification of full-length circRNAs make circFL-seq a potential tool for large-scale screening of functional circRNAs.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The generation of cortical novelty responses through inhibitory plasticity</a></h4>

              
                Animals depend on fast and reliable detection of novel stimuli in their environment. Neurons in multiple sensory areas respond more strongly to novel in comparison to familiar stimuli. Yet, it remains unclear which circuit, cellular, and synaptic mechanisms underlie those responses. Here, we show that spike-timing-dependent plasticity of inhibitory-to-excitatory synapses generates novelty responses in a recurrent spiking network model. Inhibitory plasticity increases the inhibition onto excitatory neurons tuned to familiar stimuli, while inhibition for novel stimuli remains low, leading to a network novelty response. The generation of novelty responses does not depend on the periodicity but rather on the distribution of presented stimuli. By including tuning of inhibitory neurons, the network further captures stimulus-specific adaptation. Finally, we suggest that disinhibition can control the amplification of novelty responses. Therefore, inhibitory plasticity provides a flexible, biologically plausible mechanism to detect the novelty of bottom-up stimuli, enabling us to make experimentally testable predictions.

                Envisioning the future is intuitively linked to our ability to remember the past. Within the memory system, substantial work has demonstrated the involvement of the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus in representing the past and present. Recent data shows that both the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus encode future trajectories, which are segregated in time by alternating cycles of the theta rhythm. Here, we discuss how information is temporally organized by these brain regions supported by the medial septum, nucleus reuniens, and parahippocampal regions. Finally, we highlight a brain circuit that we predict is essential for the temporal segregation of future scenarios.

                Osteoblast differentiation is sequentially characterized by high rates of proliferation followed by increased protein and matrix synthesis, processes that require substantial amino acid acquisition and production. How osteoblasts obtain or maintain intracellular amino acid production is poorly understood. Here we identify SLC1A5 as a critical amino acid transporter during bone development. Using a genetic and metabolomic approach, we show SLC1A5 acts cell autonomously to regulate protein synthesis and osteoblast differentiation. SLC1A5 provides both glutamine and asparagine which are essential for osteoblast differentiation. Mechanistically, glutamine and to a lesser extent asparagine support amino acid biosynthesis. Thus, osteoblasts depend on <i>Slc1a5 </i>to provide glutamine and asparagine, which are subsequently used to produce non-essential amino acids and support osteoblast differentiation and bone development.

                The clinical and societal measurement of human sleep has increased exponentially in recent years. However, unlike other fields of medical analysis that have become highly automated, basic and clinical sleep research still relies on human visual scoring. Such human-based evaluations are time-consuming, tedious, and can be prone to subjective bias. Here, we describe a novel algorithm trained and validated on +30,000 hr of polysomnographic sleep recordings across heterogeneous populations around the world. This tool offers high sleep-staging accuracy that matches human scoring accuracy and interscorer agreement no matter the population kind. The software is designed to be especially easy to use, computationally low-demanding, open source, and free. Our hope is that this software facilitates the broad adoption of an industry-standard automated sleep staging software package.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Feature distribution learning by passive exposure</a></h4>

              
                Humans can rapidly estimate the statistical properties of groups of stimuli, including their average and variability. But recent studies of so-called Feature Distribution Learning (FDL) have shown that observers can quickly learn even more complex aspects of feature distributions. In FDL, observers learn the full shape of a distribution of features in a set of distractor stimuli and use this information to improve visual search: response times (RT) are slowed if the target feature lies inside the previous distractor distribution, and the RT patterns closely reflect the distribution shape. FDL requires only a few trials and is markedly sensitive to different distribution types. It is unknown, however, whether our perceptual system encodes feature distributions automatically and by passive exposure, or whether this learning requires active engagement with the stimuli. In two experiments, we sought to answer this question. During an initial exposure stage, participants passively viewed a display of 36 lines that included one orientation singleton or no singletons. In the following search display, they had to find an oddly oriented target. The orientations of the lines were determined either by a Gaussian or a uniform distribution. We found evidence for FDL only when the passive trials contained an orientation singleton. Under these conditions, RT decreased as a function of the orientation distance between the target and the exposed distractor distribution. These results suggest that FDL can occur by passive exposure, but only if an orientation singleton appears during exposure to the distribution.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Tagging active neurons by soma-targeted Cal-Light</a></h4>

              
                Verifying causal effects of neural circuits is essential for proving direct a circuit-behavior relationship. However, techniques for tagging only active neurons with high spatiotemporal precision remain at the beginning stages. Here we developed the soma-targeted Cal-Light (ST-Cal-Light) which selectively converts somatic calcium rise triggered by action potentials into gene expression. Such modification simultaneously increases the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of reporter gene expression and reduces the light requirement for successful labeling. Because of the enhanced efficacy, the ST-Cal-Light enables the tagging of functionally engaged neurons in various forms of behaviors, including context-dependent fear conditioning, lever-pressing choice behavior, and social interaction behaviors. We also targeted kainic acid-sensitive neuronal populations in the hippocampus which subsequently suppressed seizure symptoms, suggesting its applicability in controlling disease-related neurons. Furthermore, the generation of a conditional ST-Cal-Light knock-in (KI) mouse provides an opportunity to tag active neurons in a region- or cell-type specific manner via crossing with other Cre-driver lines. Thus, the versatile ST-Cal-Light system links somatic action potentials to behaviors with high temporal precision, and ultimately allows functional circuit dissection at a single cell resolution.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">In vivo imaging of the GnRH pulse generator reveals a temporal order of neuronal activation and synchronization during each pulse</a></h4>

              
                A hypothalamic pulse generator located in the arcuate nucleus controls episodic release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) and is essential for reproduction. Recent evidence suggests this generator is comprised of arcuate 'KNDy' cells, the abbreviation based on co-expression of kisspeptin, neurokinin B, and dynorphin. However, direct visual evidence of KNDy neuron activity at a single-cell level during a pulse is lacking. Here, we use in vivo calcium imaging in freely moving female mice to show that individual KNDy neurons are synchronously activated in an episodic manner, and these synchronized episodes always precede LH pulses. Furthermore, synchronization among KNDy cells occurs in a temporal order, with some subsets of KNDy cells serving as 'leaders' and others as 'followers' during each synchronized episode. These results reveal an unsuspected temporal organization of activation and synchronization within the GnRH pulse generator, suggesting that different subsets of KNDy neurons are activated at pulse onset than afterward during maintenance and eventual termination of each pulse. Further studies to distinguish KNDy leader from follower cells is likely to have important clinical significance, since regulation of pulsatile GnRH secretion is essential for normal reproduction and disrupted in pathological conditions such as polycystic ovary syndrome and hypothalamic amenorrhea.

                Stress exposure is a cardinal risk factor for most psychiatric diseases. Preclinical and clinical studies point to changes in gene expression involving epigenetic modifications within mesocorticolimbic brain circuits. Brahma (BRM) and Brahma-Related-Gene-1 (BRG1) are ATPase subunits of the SWI/SNF complexes involved in chromatin remodeling, a process essential to enduring plastic changes in gene expression. Here, we show that repeated social defeat induces changes in BRG1 nuclear distribution. The inactivation of the Brg1/Smarca4 gene within dopamine-innervated regions or the constitutive inactivation of the Brm/Smarca2 gene leads to resilience to repeated social defeat and decreases the behavioral responses to cocaine without impacting midbrain dopamine neurons activity. Within striatal medium spiny neurons Brg1 gene inactivation reduces the expression of stress- and cocaine-induced immediate early genes, increases levels of heterochromatin and at a global scale decreases chromatin accessibility. Altogether these data demonstrate the pivotal function of SWI/SNF complexes in behavioral and transcriptional adaptations to salient environmental challenges.

                A central principle of synaptic transmission is that action potential induced presynaptic neurotransmitter release occurs exclusively via Ca2+ dependent secretion (CDS). T he discovery and mechanistic investigations of Ca2+ independent but voltage dependent secretion (CiVDS) have demonstrated that the action potential per se is sufficient to trigger neurotransmission in the somata of primary sensory and sympathetic neurons in mammals. One key question remains, however, whether CiVDS contributes to central synaptic transmission. Here we report, in the central transmission from presynaptic (dorsal root ganglion) to postsynaptic (spinal dorsal horn) neurons, (1) excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) are mediated by glutamate transmission through both CiVDS up to 87%) and CDS; (2) CiVDS EPSC s are in dependent of extracellular and intracellular Ca2+; (3) CiVDS is >100 times faster than CDS in vesicle recycling with much less short term depression; 4) the fusion machinery of CiVDS includes Cav2.2 (voltage sensor) and SNARE (fusion pore). Together, an essential component of activity induced EPSCs is mediated by CiVDS in a central synapse.

                Senescence affects various aspects of sleep, and it remains unclear how sleep-related neuronal network activity is altered by senescence. Here, we recorded local field potential signals from multiple brain regions covering the forebrain in young (10-week-old) and aged (2-year-old) mice. Interregional LFP correlations across these brain regions showed smaller differences between awake and sleep states in aged mice. Multivariate analyses with machine learning algorithms with uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) and robust continuous clustering (RCC) demonstrated that these LFP correlational patterns in aged mice less represented awake/sleep states than those in young mice. By housing aged mice in an enriched environment, the LFP patterns were restored to those observed in young mice. Our results demonstrate senescence-induced changes in neuronal activity at the network level and provide insight into the prevention of pathological symptoms associated with sleep disturbance in senescence.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Functional connectivity networks of common synaptic inputs to motor neurons reveal neural spinal synergies during a multi-joint task</a></h4>

              
                Movements are reportedly controlled through the combination of synergies that generate specific motor outputs by imposing an activation pattern on a group of muscles. To date, the smallest unit of analysis has been the muscle through the measurement of its activation. However, the muscle is not the lowest neural level of movement control. In this human study, we identified the common synaptic inputs received by motor neurons during an isometric multi-joint task. We decoded the spiking activities of dozens of spinal motor neurons innervating six lower limb muscles in 10 participants. Furthermore, we analyzed these activities by identifying their common low-frequency components, from which networks of common synaptic inputs to the motor neurons were derived. The vast majority of the identified motor neurons shared common inputs with other motor neuron(s). In addition, groups of motor neurons were partly decoupled from their innervated muscle, such that motor neurons innervating the same muscle did not necessarily receive common inputs. Conversely, some motor neurons from different muscles, including distant muscles, received common inputs. Our results provide evidence of a synergistic control of a multi-joint motor task at the spinal motor neuron level. Moreover, we showed that common input to motor neurons is an essential feature of the neural control of movement. We conclude that the central nervous system controls flexible groups of motor neurons by distributing common inputs to substantially reduce the dimensionality of movement control.
