	<p>The landscape of pharmacological treatment for Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD) has undergone significant transformations with the advent of disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) targeting &amp;amp;beta;-Amyloid (A&amp;amp;beta;) accumulation, one of the hallmark pathologies of AD. The approval and market introduction of monoclonal antibodies mark the dawn of a new era in AD therapeutics as well. Furthermore, considerable progress has also been made in the development of new drugs targeting non-A&amp;amp;beta; and non-Tau protein pathways. These advancements are key in tackling the root causes of AD, offering hope for treatments that both relieve symptoms and slow disease progression, improving patient outcomes and quality of life. This review aims to provide a comprehensive update on the advances in drug development and application for AD, including those currently in clinical trials and those already approved for the market to treat patients.</p>

">Fast hierarchical processing of orthographic and semantic parafoveal information during natural reading</a></h4>

              
                Readers extract orthographic and semantic information from parafoveal words before fixating on them. While this has to be achieved within an intersaccadic interval, the neuronal mechanisms supporting this fast parafoveal word processing within the language network remain unknown. We co-registered MEG and eye-tracking data in a natural reading paradigm to uncover the neuronal mechanisms supporting parafoveal processing. Representational similarity analysis (RSA) revealed that parafoveal orthographic neighbours (e.g., "writer" vs. "waiter") showed higher representational similarity than non-neighbours (e.g., "writer" vs. "police"), emerging ~68 ms after fixation onset on the preceding word (e.g., "clever") in the visual word form area. Similarly, parafoveal semantic neighbours (e.g., "writer" vs. "author") exhibited increased representational similarity at ~137 ms in the left inferior frontal gyrus. Importantly, the degree of orthographic and semantic parafoveal processing predicted individual reading speed. Our findings suggest fast hierarchical processing of parafoveal words across distinct brain regions, which enhances reading efficiency.

">Comparative Analysis of AAV Serotypes for Transduction of Olfactory Sensory Neurons</a></h4>

              
                Olfactory sensory neurons within the nasal epithelium detect volatile odorants and relay odor information to the central nervous system. Unlike other sensory inputs, olfactory sensory neurons interface with the external environment and project their axons directly into the central nervous system. The use of adeno-associated viruses to target these neurons has garnered interest for applications in gene therapy, probing olfactory sensory neuron biology, and modeling disease. To date, there is no consensus on the optimal AAV serotype for efficient and selective transduction of olfactory sensory neurons in vivo. Here we utilized serial confocal imaging and single-nucleus RNA sequencing to evaluate the efficacy of 11 different AAV serotypes in transducing murine olfactory sensory neurons via non-invasive nasal inoculation. Our results reveal that AAV1, while highly effective, exhibited broad tropism, whereas AAV-DJ/8 showed the greatest specificity for olfactory sensory neurons.

">Connectivity in the Dorsal Visual Stream is Enhanced in Action Video Game Players</a></h4>

              
                Action video games foster competitive environments that demand rapid spatial navigation and decision-making. Action video gamers often exhibit faster response times and slightly improved accuracy in vision-based sensorimotor tasks. However, the underlying functional and structural changes in the two visual streams of the brain that may be contributing to these cognitive improvements have been unclear. Using functional and diffusion MRI data, this study investigated the differences in connectivity between gamers who play action video games and nongamers in the dorsal and ventral visual streams. We found that action video gamers have enhanced functional and structural connectivity, especially in the dorsal visual stream. Specifically, there is heightened functional connectivity both undirected and directed between the left Superior Occipital Gyrus and the left Superior Parietal Lobule during a moving-dots discrimination decision-making task. This increased connectivity correlates with response time in gamers. The structural connectivity, as quantified by diffusion fractional anisotropy and quantitative anisotropy measures of the axonal fiber pathways between the same regions was also enhanced for gamers compared to nongamers. These findings provide valuable insights into how action video gaming can induce targeted neuroplastic changes, enhancing structural and functional connectivity between specific brain regions in the visual processing pathways. These connectivity changes in the dorsal visual stream underpin the superior performance of action video gamers compared to non-gamers in tasks requiring rapid and accurate vision-based decision-making.

">A hierarchical Bayesian model reveals increased precision weighting for afferent cardiac signals, and reduced anxiety, as a function of interoceptive training</a></h4>

              
                Perceptual accuracy for interoceptive signals, such as heartbeats, varies in a trait-like manner across individuals and may influence the capacity for emotion regulation and vulnerability to affective symptoms, notably anxiety. Here, we demonstrate that an interoceptive training protocol improved perceptual accuracy in two tasks of heartbeat perception and reduced both state and trait anxiety in a subclinical sample, extending previous findings in autistic adults. Computational modelling indicated that accuracy improvement in the heartbeat discrimination task was associated with increases in the internal reliability estimate for interoceptive signals - their precision weighting - while a lower-level parameter representing noise in the interoceptive signal itself (which influences speed of learning) moderated this precision weighting improvement. Reductions in both state and trait anxiety in the training group were uniquely explained by computational parameter estimates, and not by conventional accuracy measures. These findings indicate that trait-like differences in interoceptive processing are modifiable and can be targeted to alleviate anxiety symptoms, and that interoceptive interventions may be best guided by a computational phenotyping approach.

">Potentiation of active locomotor state by spinal-projecting serotonergic neurons</a></h4>

              
                Animals produce diverse motor actions that enable expression of context-appropriate behaviors. Neuromodulators facilitate behavioral flexibility by altering the temporal dynamics and output of neural circuits. Discrete populations of serotonergic (5-HT) neurons target circuits in the brainstem and spinal cord, but their role in the control of motor behavior is unclear. Here we define the pre- and post-synaptic organization of the spinal-projecting serotonergic system and define a role in locomotor control. We show that while forebrain-targeting 5-HT neurons decrease their activity during locomotion, subpopulations of spinal projecting neurons increase their activity in a context-dependent manner. Optogenetic activation of ventrally projecting 5-HT neurons does not trigger initiation of movement, but rather enhances the speed and duration of ongoing locomotion over extended time scales. These findings indicate that the descending serotonergic system potentiates locomotor output and demonstrate a role for serotonergic neurons in modulating the temporal dynamics of motor circuits.

">Charting Cortical-Layer Specific Area Boundaries Using Gibbs Ringing Attenuated T1w/T2w-FLAIR Myelin MRI</a></h4>

              
                Cortical areas have traditionally been defined by their distinctive layer cyto- and/or myelo- architecture using postmortem histology. Recent studies have delineated many areas by measuring overall cortical myelin content and its spatial gradients using the T1w/T2w ratio MRI in living primates, including humans. While T1w/T2w studies of areal transitions might benefit from using the layer profile of this myelin-related contrast, a significant confound is Gibbs ringing artefact, which produces signal fluctuations resembling cortical layers. Here, we address these issues with a novel approach using cortical layer thickness-adjusted T1w/T2w-FLAIR imaging, which effectively cancels out Gibbs ringing artefacts while enhancing intra-cortical myelin contrast. Whole-brain MRI measures were mapped onto twelve equivolumetric layers, and layer-specific sharp myeloarchitectonic transitions were identified using spatial gradients resulting in a putative 182 area/subarea partition of the macaque cerebral cortex. The myelin maps exhibit unexpectedly high homology with humans suggesting cortical myelin shares the same developmental program across the species. Comparison with histological Gallyas myelin stains explains over 80% of the variance in the laminar T1w/T2w-FLAIR profiles, substantiating the validity of the method. Altogether, our approach provides a novel, noninvasive means for precision mapping layer myeloarchitecture in the primate cerebral cortex, advancing the pioneering work of classical neuroanatomists.

">HEXIM1 is correlated with Alzheimer's disease pathology and regulates immediate early gene dynamics in neurons</a></h4>

              
                Impaired memory formation and recall is a distinguishing feature of Alzheimer's disease, and memory requires de novo gene transcription in neurons. Rapid and robust transcription of many genes is facilitated by their existence in a basal poised state, in which RNA polymerase II (RNAP2) has initiated transcription, but is paused just downstream of the gene promoter. Neuronal depolarization releases the paused RNAP2 to complete the synthesis of messenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts. Paused RNAP2 release is controlled by positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb), which is sequestered into a larger inactive complex containing Hexamethylene bisacetamide inducible protein 1 (HEXIM1) under basal conditions. In this work, we find that neuronal expression of HEXIM1 mRNA is highly correlated with human Alzheimer's disease pathologies. Furthermore, P-TEFb regulation by HEXIM1 has a significant impact on the rapid induction of neuronal gene transcription, particularly in response to repeated neuronal depolarization. These data indicate that HEXIM1/P-TEFb has an important role in inducible gene transcription in neurons, and for setting and resetting the poised state that allows for the robust activation of genes necessary for synaptic plasticity.

">Somatostatin interneurons select dorsomedial striatal representations of the initial learning phase</a></h4>

              
                The dorsomedial striatum (DMS) is an associative node involved in the adaptation of ongoing actions to the environmental context and in the initial formation of motor sequences. In early associative or motor learning phases, DMS activity shows a global decrease in neuron firing, eventually giving rise to a select group of active cells, whose number is correlated with animal performance. Unveiling how those representation emerge from DMS circuits is crucial for understanding plasticity mechanisms of early adjustments to learning a task. Here, we hypothesized that inhibitory microcircuits formed by local interneurons are responsible for the genesis of early DMS representation and associated task performance. Despite the low density of somatostatin (SOM)-positive cells, we observed that selective manipulation of SOM cells disrupted reorganization of DMS activity and modulated initial phases of learning in two behavioral contexts. This effect was cell-specific as manipulation of parvalbumin-positive interneurons had no significant effect. Finally, we identified the high plasticity of SOM innervation in the DMS as a key modulator of the SPN excitability and firing activity. Hence, SOM interneurons set the pace of early learning by actively controlling the remapping of DMS network activity.

">A Novel Mouse Model Demonstrates In Vivo Replenishment of Central Nervous System Pericytes After Successful Acute Ablation</a></h4>

              
                Central nervous system (CNS) pericytes play crucial roles in vascular development and blood-brain barrier maturation during prenatal development, as well as in regulating cerebral blood flow in adults. They have also been implicated in the pathogenesis of numerous neurological disorders. However, the behavior of pericytes in the adult brain after injury remains poorly understood, partly due to limitations in existing pericyte ablation models. To investigate pericyte responses following acute ablation, we developed a tamoxifen-inducible pericyte ablation model by crossing PDGFR{beta}-P2A-CreERT2 and Rosa26-DTA176 transgenic mouse lines. Using this model, we studied the effects of different tamoxifen doses and conducted histological examinations 15 and 60 days post-injection to assess both short- and long-term impacts of pericyte ablation. Our results demonstrate that a low dose of tamoxifen effectively ablates CNS pericytes in mice without reducing survival or causing significant systemic side effects, such as weight loss. Additionally, we found that the extent of pericyte depletion varies between the cortex and the spinal cord's gray and white matter regions. Importantly, both pericyte coverage and numbers increased in the weeks following acute ablation, indicating the regenerative capacity of CNS pericytes in vivo. This model offers a valuable tool for future studies on the role of pericytes in neurological disorders, overcoming the limitations of constitutive pericyte ablation models.

	<p>Background/Objectives: Neural decoding methods are often limited by the performance of brain encoders, which map complex brain signals into a latent representation space of perception information. These brain encoders are constrained by the limited amount of paired brain and stimuli data available for training, making it challenging to learn rich neural representations. Methods: To address this limitation, we present a novel multimodal training approach using paired image and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data to establish a brain masked autoencoder that learns the interactions between images and brain activities. Subsequently, we employ a diffusion model conditioned on brain data to decode realistic images. Results: Our method achieves high-quality decoding results in semantic contents and low-level visual attributes, outperforming previous methods both qualitatively and quantitatively, while maintaining computational efficiency. Additionally, our method is applied to decode artificial patterns across region of interests (ROIs) to explore their functional properties. We not only validate existing knowledge concerning ROIs but also unveil new insights, such as the synergy between early visual cortex and higher-level scene ROIs, as well as the competition within the higher-level scene ROIs. Conclusions: These findings provide valuable insights for future directions in the field of neural decoding.</p>

	<p>Background: Mental health issues are increasingly prominent worldwide, posing significant threats to patients and deeply affecting their families and social relationships. Traditional diagnostic methods are subjective and delayed, indicating the need for an objective and effective early diagnosis method. Methods: To this end, this paper proposes a lightweight detection method for multi-mental disorders with fewer data sources, aiming to improve diagnostic procedures and enable early patient detection. First, the proposed method takes Electroencephalography (EEG) signals as sources, acquires brain rhythms through Discrete Wavelet Decomposition (DWT), and extracts their approximate entropy, fuzzy entropy, permutation entropy, and sample entropy to establish the entropy-based matrix. Then, six kinds of conventional machine learning classifiers, including Support Vector Machine (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Naive Bayes (NB), Generalized Additive Model (GAM), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and Decision Tree (DT), are adopted for the entropy-based matrix to achieve the detection task. Their performances are assessed by accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1-score. Concerning these experiments, three public datasets of schizophrenia, epilepsy, and depression are utilized for method validation. Results: The analysis of the results from these datasets identifies the representative single-channel signals (schizophrenia: O1, epilepsy: F3, depression: O2), satisfying classification accuracies (88.10%, 75.47%, and 89.92%, respectively) with minimal input. Conclusions: Such performances are impressive when considering fewer data sources as a concern, which also improves the interpretability of the entropy features in EEG, providing a reliable detection approach for multi-mental disorders and advancing insights into their underlying mechanisms and pathological states.</p>

	<p>Background: Intravenous thrombolysis is one of the most effective therapies for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke (AIS), with urokinase offering a cost-effective alternative to newer agents like alteplase and tenecteplase, especially in resource-limited settings. Methods: This review provides a comprehensive overview of the application of intravenous thrombolysis with urokinase for AIS in the clinical practice of stroke management, including the efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness of urokinase compared to other thrombolytic agents. Results: Urokinase, a first-generation thrombolytic drug, is a non-specific plasminogen activator that offers a cost-effective alternative. It has been used in clinical practice for over two decades to improve neurological outcomes in patients with AIS if administered within 6 h of ictus. Numerous studies have indicated that urokinase remains a viable option for patients who cannot access alteplase or tenecteplase because of economic constraints, time window limitations, availability, or other reasons. Conclusions: In low- and middle-income countries, urokinase is a cost-effective alternative thrombolytic drug. High-level evidence-based medical research is therefore urgently needed to confirm that urokinase is not inferior to new-generation thrombolytic drugs, and to assess whether it may even be superior in some patient populations.</p>

	<p>Background: Cognitive deficits following ischemic stroke significantly impair quality of life, highlighting the need for effective interventions. This study evaluates the efficacy and safety of extended N-Pep-12 dietary supplementation in enhancing cognitive recovery post-stroke. Methods: In this randomized, open-label, controlled study, 106 patients with supratentorial ischemic stroke were enrolled to receive either 90mg N-Pep-12 or no supplementation daily for 360 days and were followed-up for 360 days. Cognitive function and emotional well-being were assessed using established neuropsychological scales at baseline, 90 days, and 360 days post-stroke. Safety was monitored through adverse events and mortality rates. Results: Significant improvements were observed in the N-Pep-12 group compared to controls, particularly in the Montreal Cognitive Assessment scores at both 90 and 360 days, and in the Digit Symbol Coding scores at 360 days, suggesting enhanced cognitive recovery with extended N-Pep-12 supplementation. A linear regression for a composite outcome analysis at day 360 further confirmed the efficacy of N-Pep-12 in contributing to cognitive improvement. Safety profiles were favorable, with no significant adverse effects attributed to N-Pep-12. Conclusions: Extended dietary supplementation with N-Pep-12 appears to offer a safe and effective approach to support cognitive recovery in ischemic stroke survivors. These findings underscore the potential of the supplement as an add-on intervention for managing post-stroke cognitive impairments.</p>

	<p>Objectives. There is a significant correlation between EEG microstate and the neurophysiological basis of mental illness, brain state, and cognitive function. Given that the unclear relationship between network dynamics and different microstates, this paper utilized microstate, brain network, and control theories to understand the microstate characteristics of short-term memory task, aiming to mechanistically explain the most influential microstates and brain regions driving the abnormal changes in brain state transitions in patients with schizophrenia. Methods. We identified each microstate and analyzed the microstate abnormalities in schizophrenia patients during short-term memory tasks. Subsequently, the network dynamics underlying the primary microstates were studied to reveal the relationships between network dynamics and microstates. Finally, using control theory, we confirmed that the abnormal changes in brain state transitions in schizophrenia patients are driven by specific microstates and brain regions. Results. The frontal-occipital lobes activity of microstate D decreased significantly, but the left frontal lobe of microstate B increased significantly in schizophrenia, when the brain was moving toward the easy-to-reach states. However, the frontal-occipital lobes activity of microstate D decreased significantly in schizophrenia, when the brain was moving toward the hard-to-reach states. Microstate D showed that the right-frontal activity had a higher priority than the left-frontal, but microstate B showed that the left-frontal priority decreased significantly in schizophrenia, when changes occur in the synchronization state of the brain. Conclusions. In conclusion, microstate D may be a biomarker candidate of brain abnormal activity during the states transitions in schizophrenia, and microstate B may represent a compensatory mechanism that maintains brain function and exchanges information with other brain regions. Microstate and brain network provide complementary perspectives on the neurodynamics, offering potential insights into brain function in health and disease.</p>

	<p>Background: In recent years, there has been growing interest in the evaluation of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and autistic traits in prison populations and offenders. Due to misleading headlines and highly publicized criminal cases, the belief that autistic individuals are more prone to commit crimes has spread among the general population, also leading to increasing research on this matter. Aims: In this context, this narrative review aimed to analyze the available scientific literature on the bi-directional link between ASD and criminal behaviors and to assess the key characteristics of eventual ASD offenders, including sociodemographic data, comorbidities, crime-related features, and interactions with the criminal justice system. Results: Our review highlighted that the available studies lack methodological rigor and present controversial results. Overall, the current state of research does not support any definitive correlation between ASD or autistic traits and the predisposition to engage in criminal conduct. Further studies are needed to confirm or reject this hypothesis.</p>

	<p>The delivery of nutrients to the brain is provided by a 600 km network of capillaries and microvessels. Indeed, the brain is highly energy demanding and, among a total amount of 100 billion neurons, each neuron is located just 10&amp;amp;ndash;20 &amp;amp;mu;m from a capillary. This vascular network also forms part of the blood&amp;amp;ndash;brain barrier (BBB), which maintains the brain&amp;amp;rsquo;s stable environment by regulating chemical balance, immune cell transport, and blocking toxins. Typically, brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) have low turnover, indicating a stable cerebrovascular structure. However, this structure can adapt significantly due to development, aging, injury, or disease. Temporary neural activity changes are managed by the expansion or contraction of arterioles and capillaries. Hypoxia leads to significant remodeling of the cerebrovascular architecture and pathological changes have been documented in aging and in vascular and neurodegenerative conditions. These changes often involve BMEC proliferation and the remodeling of capillary segments, often linked with local neuronal changes and cognitive function. Cerebrovascular plasticity, especially in arterioles, capillaries, and venules, varies over different time scales in development, health, aging, and diseases. Rapid changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF) occur within seconds due to increased neural activity. Prolonged changes in vascular structure, influenced by consistent environmental factors, take weeks. Development and aging bring changes over months to years, with aging-associated plasticity often improved by exercise. Injuries cause rapid damage but can be repaired over weeks to months, while neurodegenerative diseases cause slow, varied changes over months to years. In addition, if animal models may provide useful and dynamic in vivo information about vascular plasticity, humans are more complex to investigate and the hypothesis of glymphatic system together with Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) techniques could provide useful clues in the future.</p>

	<p>The dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) has gained attention owing to its involvement in various physiological functions, such as sleep&amp;amp;ndash;awake, feeding, and emotion, with its analgesic role being particularly significant. It is described as the &amp;amp;ldquo;pain inhibitory nucleus&amp;amp;rdquo; in the brain. The DRN has diverse projections from hypothalamus, midbrain, and pons. In turn, the DRN is a major source of projections to diverse cortex, limbic forebrain thalamus, and the midbrain and contains highly heterogeneous neuronal subtypes. The activation of DRN neurons in mice prevents the establishment of neuropathic, chronic pain symptoms. Chemogenetic or optogenetic inhibition neurons in the DRN are sufficient to establish pain phenotypes, including long-lasting tactile allodynia, that scale with the extent of stimulation, thereby promoting nociplastic pain. Recent progress has been made in identifying the neural circuits and cellular mechanisms in the DRN that are responsible for sensory modulation. However, there is still a lack of comprehensive review addressing the specific neuron types in the DRN involved in pain modulation. This review summarizes the function of specific cell types within DRN in the pain regulation, and aims to improve understanding of the mechanisms underlying pain regulation in the DRN, ultimately offering insights for further exploration.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/11/9/ENEURO.0047-24.2024?rss=1">Variations in Clustering of Multielectrode Local Field Potentials in the Motor Cortex of Macaque Monkeys during a Reach-and-Grasp Task</a></h4>

              
                <p>There is experimental evidence of varying correlation among the elements of the neuromuscular system over the course of the reach-and-grasp task. The aim of this study was to investigate if modifications in correlations and clustering can be detected in the local field potential (LFP) recordings of the motor cortex during the task. To this end, we analyzed the LFP recordings from a previously published study on monkeys that performed a reach-and-grasp task for targets with a vertical or horizontal orientation. LFP signals were recorded from the motor and premotor cortex of macaque monkeys as they performed the task. We found very robust changes in the correlations of the multielectrode LFP recordings that corresponded to task epochs. Mean LFP correlation increased significantly during reach and then decreased during grasp. This pattern was very robust for both left and right arm reaches irrespective of target orientation. A hierarchical cluster analysis also demonstrated similar changes. In focusing on correlations, our study has contributed new insights to the understanding of LFP signals and their relationship to movement. A sliding window computation of the number of clusters was performed to probe the capacities of the LFP clusters for detecting upcoming task events. For a very high percentage of trials (97.89%), there was a downturn in cluster number following the Pellet Drop (GO signal) that reached a minimum preceding the Start of grasp, hence indicating that cluster analyses of LFPs could contribute to signaling an increased probability of the Start of grasp.</p>

                <p>A new era of disease-modifying therapy for Alzheimer's disease (AD) arrived in 2021 following the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) decision to grant accelerated approval for aducanumab, an anti-&beta;-amyloid (A&beta;) monoclonal antibody designed to target A&beta; aggregates, a biological component of AD. More recently, trial outcomes for lecanemab and donanemab, two additional antibodies of this drug class, have shown favorable and significant slowing of metrics for cognitive and functional decline. Lecanemab and donanemab have since received similar FDA approval to aducanumab in January 2023 and July 2024, respectively. Given that these therapies are a clearly emerging tool in the repertoire of clinicians treating AD and related dementias, a critical dialogue has been ongoing regarding the potential impacts and place for these therapies. Here, we seek to contextualize this debate by first considering factors involved in theoretically extrapolating current randomized control trial outcomes to estimate meaningful clinical impacts. In the process of this exercise, we outline a generally useful concept termed Summative Treatment-Associated Benefit measuring Long-term Efficacy/Effectiveness Area as a metric of summative benefits of treatment over the life course of an individual. Second, we consider current real-world factors, such as conditions of FDA approval and other points involved in clinical decision-making that will influence and/or temper the actual impacts of this drug class.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/11/9/ENEURO.0091-24.2024?rss=1">Reconstructing Spatiotemporal Trajectories of Visual Object Memories in the Human Brain</a></h4>

              
                <p>How the human brain reconstructs, step-by-step, the core elements of past experiences is still unclear. Here, we map the spatiotemporal trajectories along which visual object memories are reconstructed during associative recall. Specifically, we inquire whether retrieval reinstates feature representations in a copy-like but reversed direction with respect to the initial perceptual experience, or alternatively, this reconstruction involves format transformations and regions beyond initial perception. Participants from two cohorts studied new associations between verbs and randomly paired object images, and subsequently recalled the objects when presented with the corresponding verb cue. We first analyze multivariate fMRI patterns to map where in the brain high- and low-level object features can be decoded during perception and retrieval, showing that retrieval is dominated by conceptual features, represented in comparatively late visual and parietal areas. A separately acquired EEG dataset is then used to track the temporal evolution of the reactivated patterns using similarity-based EEG&ndash;fMRI fusion. This fusion suggests that memory reconstruction proceeds from anterior frontotemporal to posterior occipital and parietal regions, in line with a conceptual-to-perceptual gradient but only partly following the same trajectories as during perception. Specifically, a linear regression statistically confirms that the sequential activation of ventral visual stream regions is reversed between image perception and retrieval. The fusion analysis also suggests an information relay to frontoparietal areas late during retrieval. Together, the results shed light onto the temporal dynamics of memory recall and the transformations that the information undergoes between the initial experience and its later reconstruction from memory.</p>

                <p>Systemic inflammation has been implicated in the development and progression of neurodegenerative conditions such as cognitive impairment and dementia. Recent clinical studies indicate an association between sepsis, endothelial dysfunction, and cognitive decline. However, the investigations of the role and therapeutic potential of the cerebral microvasculature in sepsis-induced cognitive dysfunction have been limited by the lack of standardized experimental models for evaluating the alterations in the cerebral microvasculature and cognition induced by the systemic inflammatory response. Herein, we validated a mouse model of endotoxemia that recapitulates key pathophysiology related to sepsis-induced cognitive dysfunction, including the induction of an acute systemic hyperinflammatory response, blood&ndash;brain barrier (BBB) leakage, neurovascular inflammation, and memory impairment after recovery from the systemic inflammation. In the acute phase, we identified novel molecular (e.g., upregulation of plasmalemma vesicle-associated protein, PLVAP, a driver of endothelial permeability, and the procoagulant plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, PAI-1) and functional perturbations (i.e., albumin and small-molecule BBB leakage) in the cerebral microvasculature along with neuroinflammation. Remarkably, small-molecule BBB permeability, elevated levels of PAI-1, intra-/perivascular fibrin/fibrinogen deposition, and microglial activation persisted 1 month after recovery from sepsis. We also highlight molecular neuronal alterations of potential clinical relevance following systemic inflammation including changes in neurofilament phosphorylation and decreases in postsynaptic density protein 95 and brain-derived neurotrophic factor, suggesting diffuse axonal injury, synapse degeneration, and impaired neurotrophism. Our study serves as a standardized mouse model to support future mechanistic studies of sepsis-associated cognitive dysfunction and to identify novel endothelial therapeutic targets for this devastating condition.</p>

                Background Cogan’s syndrome is a rare autoimmune disorder characterized by ocular inflammation, vestibulocochlear dysfunction, and systemic vasculitis. Case Presentation We report a 28-year-old female who experienced decreased visual acuity and ocular redness one month after a COVID-19 infection, with ophthalmological signs linked to keratitis, uveitis and retinal vascularitis. Two weeks later, she developed vertigo, tinnitus, and sudden hearing loss, leading to a diagnosis of Cogan’s disease. The patient received corticosteroid therapy, resulting in regression of ophthalmological signs, but progressed to complete deafness. One month later, she presented with lymphocytic meningitis and high intracranial pressure, which improved under treatment. The patient later received cochlear implants. Objective This case report aims to highlight an atypical presentation of Cogan’s syndrome with neurological involvement following a COVID-19 infection. This case contributes to the limited literature on such presentations. Conclusion Our case is one of only two reported instances of Cogan’s syndrome presenting with neurological signs post-COVID-19 infection, underscoring the rarity and complexity of this condition.

[version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Backround/Objectives We investigated a technique that facilitates the coiling of a regular straight catheter (with integral stylet) behind the sciatic nerve in an ultrasound (US) regional anaesthesia simulator, and then applied our findings to a series of orthopedic-trauma patients. Methods We conducted a randomized study of two methods of perineural catheter advancement in a sciatic nerve block Blue Phantom simulator. Two groups of twenty catheters each (method A and method B) were evaluated under real-time ultrasound imaging. The needle in-plane/nerve in-short-axis technique was applied. In method A the catheter was advanced beyond the needle tip with the integral stylet extending along its entire length; in method B the catheter was advanced after its integral stylet was retracted by 6 cm, thus providing flexibility to the catheter’s distal end. Additionally, to assess the procedural effectiveness of method B coiling technique, a pilot study was conducted examining 25 perineural catheters coiled underneath the sciatic nerve in trauma-orthopaedic patients to document any displacement of catheters’ tip from their initial position (for 36 hours postoperatively). Results In the simulation study, method B led to a significantly higher percentage (18/20:90%) of coiled catheters than method A (3/20:15%). Two coiled catheters of method B were found kinked/obstructed. In our patients, after catheter insertion, the distal end of 2/25 (8%) coiled catheters was obstructed. One perineural catheter was dislodged. For the remaining 22 (88%) catheters, ultrasound imaging demonstrated that local anaesthetic infusion made contact with the sciatic nerve, indicating no displacement of the catheter’s distal end postoperatively. Conclusion Regular straight perineural catheters can be easily coiled if their integral stylet is partially retracted. This coiling method offers extra catheter length adjacent to the nerve structure which potentially mitigates catheter tip displacement.

                Background The Wheat Crop ontology was created to annotate phenotypic experimental data (i.e. field and greenhouse measurements standardized and integrated in databases). The Wheat Trait and Phenotype ontology was created to annotate information on wheat traits from the literature (i.e. text found in the abstract, results and discussion of scholarly articles). To enable seamless data retrieval on wheat traits from these complementary sources, the classes in the two ontologies have been aligned. Methods All pairs of ontology classes were examined and categorized in nine groups based on the nature of their relationships (e.g. equivalence, subsumption). General principles emerged from this process which were formalized into rules. The Simple Standard for Sharing Ontological Mappings (SSSOM) representation was chosen to represent the mappings in RDF (Resource Description Framework), including their metadata such as creators, reviewers, and justification (including rules). Results The mapping dataset is publicly available. It covers 77% of the ontology classes. Most labels of the aligned classes differed significantly and required domain expertise for decisions, especially for traits related to biotic stress. Consequently, most mappings are close mappings rather than exact equivalents. Conclusions We present the end-to-end manual process used to select and represent mappings in SSSOM within the specific domain of wheat traits. We derive general lessons from the complex alignment process that extend beyond the specific case of these two ontologies and more generally apply to alignments of specialized ontologies for information retrieval purposes. This work demonstrates the relevance of SSSOM for representing these mappings.

                Background Over the past three decades, Portugal has invested significantly in doctoral training. However, there is a lack of up-to-date information on the success of scholarship holders in obtaining the degree or on their subsequent career paths. Methods This study analysed four cohorts of scholarship holders funded by the Foundation for Science and Technology between 1995 and 2012. The professional situation at different points in time after the Ph.D. (5, 10, 15 and 20 years) was studied. Results The success rate for obtaining the degree was 88%, which is comparable to other European countries for doctorates completed with funding over a period of 3-4 years. The average time to obtain the degree was 5.06 years. The time to degree was influenced by the scientific field, the nationality of the scholarship holder, and the location of the institution awarding the degree (in Portugal or abroad). The gender or age range of the scholarship recipients did not influence the time required for graduation. The analysis of the career and sector of activity of these graduates at different points in time after obtaining the Ph.D. revealed that approximately 60% percent of the graduates were engaged in R&D activities at some point in their career paths, but this percentage diminished from the oldest to the most recent cohorts, suggesting difficulties in retaining recent graduates in academia and in the private sector. In 2020, 63% of the graduates were engaged in R&D activities, and almost half were employed in higher education as teachers, researchers, or scholarship holders. Conclusions This study confirmed the challenges faced by doctoral graduates in integrating into non-academic job markets. On the other hand, it has demonstrated an efficient use of public funds, with high success rates and a time to degree that is within the average of other European countries.

                <p>by Mengze Zhang, Xia Wang, Sanyi Tang</p>

Aedes mosquitoes, known as vectors of mosquito-borne diseases, pose significant risks to public health and safety. Modeling the population dynamics of Aedes mosquitoes requires comprehensive approaches due to the complex interplay between biological mechanisms and environmental factors. This study developed a model that couples differential equations with a neural network to simulate the dynamics of mosquito population, and explore the relationships between oviposition rate, temperature, and precipitation. Data from nine cities in Guangdong Province spanning four years were used for model training and parameter estimation, while data from the remaining three cities were reserved for model validation. The trained model successfully simulated the mosquito population dynamics across all twelve cities using the same set of parameters. Correlation coefficients between simulated results and observed data exceeded 0.7 across all cities, with some cities surpassing 0.85, demonstrating high model performance. The coupled neural network in the model effectively revealed the relationships among oviposition rate, temperature, and precipitation, aligning with biological patterns. Furthermore, symbolic regression was used to identify the optimal functional expression for these relationships. By integrating the traditional dynamic model with machine learning, our model can adhere to specific biological mechanisms while extracting patterns from data, thus enhancing its interpretability in biology. Our approach provides both accurate modeling and an avenue for uncovering potential unknown biological mechanisms. Our conclusions can provide valuable insights into designing strategies for controlling mosquito-borne diseases and developing related prediction and early warning systems.

Recent advancements in next-generation sequencing have revolutionized our understanding of the human microbiome. Despite this progress, challenges persist in comprehending the microbiome’s influence on disease, hindered by technical complexities in species classification, abundance estimation, and data compositionality. At the same time, the existence of macroecological laws describing the variation and diversity in microbial communities irrespective of their environment has been recently proposed using 16s data and explained by a simple phenomenological model of population dynamics. We here investigate the relationship between dysbiosis, i.e. in unhealthy individuals there are deviations from the “regular” composition of the gut microbial community, and the existence of macro-ecological emergent law in microbial communities. We first quantitatively reconstruct these patterns at the species level using shotgun data, and addressing the consequences of sampling effects and statistical errors on ecological patterns. We then ask if such patterns can discriminate between healthy and unhealthy cohorts. Concomitantly, we evaluate the efficacy of different statistical generative models, which incorporate sampling and population dynamics, to describe such patterns and distinguish which are expected by chance, versus those that are potentially informative about disease states or other biological drivers. A critical aspect of our analysis is understanding the relationship between model parameters, which have clear ecological interpretations, and the state of the gut microbiome, thereby enabling the generation of synthetic compositional data that distinctively represent healthy and unhealthy individuals. Our approach, grounded in theoretical ecology and statistical physics, allows for a robust comparison of these models with empirical data, enhancing our understanding of the strengths and limitations of simple microbial models of population dynamics.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012471">The role of training variability for model-based and model-free learning of an arbitrary visuomotor mapping</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Carlos A. Velázquez-Vargas, Nathaniel D. Daw, Jordan A. Taylor</p>

A fundamental feature of the human brain is its capacity to learn novel motor skills. This capacity requires the formation of vastly different visuomotor mappings. Using a grid navigation task, we investigated whether training variability would enhance the flexible use of a visuomotor mapping (key-to-direction rule), leading to better generalization performance. Experiments 1 and 2 show that participants trained to move between multiple start-target pairs exhibited greater generalization to both distal and proximal targets compared to participants trained to move between a single pair. This finding suggests that limited variability can impair decisions even in simple tasks without planning. In addition, during the training phase, participants exposed to higher variability were more inclined to choose options that, counterintuitively, moved the cursor away from the target while minimizing its actual distance under the constrained mapping, suggesting a greater engagement in model-based computations. In Experiments 3 and 4, we showed that the limited generalization performance in participants trained with a single pair can be enhanced by a short period of variability introduced early in learning or by incorporating stochasticity into the visuomotor mapping. Our computational modeling analyses revealed that a hybrid model between model-free and model-based computations with different mixing weights for the training and generalization phases, best described participants’ data. Importantly, the differences in the model-based weights between our experimental groups, paralleled the behavioral findings during training and generalization. Taken together, our results suggest that training variability enables the flexible use of the visuomotor mapping, potentially by preventing the consolidation of habits due to the continuous demand to change responses.

                <p>by Jiaxin Jiang, Xiaona Meng, Yibo Wang, Ziqian Zhuang, Ting Du, Jing Yan</p>

Most COVID-19 patients have a positive prognosis, but patients with additional underlying diseases are more likely to have severe illness and increased fatality rates. Numerous studies indicate that cancer patients are more prone to contract SARS-CoV-2 and develop severe COVID-19 or even dying. In the recent transcriptome investigations, it is demonstrated that the fructose metabolism is altered in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, cancer cells can use fructose as an extra source of energy for growth and metastasis. Furthermore, enhanced living conditions have resulted in a notable rise in fructose consumption in individuals’ daily dietary habits. We therefore hypothesize that the poor prognosis of cancer patients caused by SARS-CoV-2 may therefore be mediated through fructose metabolism. Using CRC cases from four distinct cohorts, we built and validated a predictive model based on SARS-CoV-2 producing fructose metabolic anomalies by coupling Cox univariate regression and lasso regression feature selection algorithms to identify hallmark genes in colorectal cancer. We also developed a composite prognostic nomogram to improve clinical practice by integrating the characteristics of aberrant fructose metabolism produced by this novel coronavirus with age and tumor stage. To obtain the genes with the greatest potential prognostic values, LASSO regression analysis was performed, In the TCGA training cohort, patients were randomly separated into training and validation sets in the ratio of 4: 1, and the best risk score value for each sample was acquired by lasso regression analysis for further analysis, and the fifteen genes <i>CLEC4A</i>, <i>FDFT1</i>, <i>CTNNB1</i>, <i>GPI</i>, <i>PMM2</i>, <i>PTPRD</i>, <i>IL7</i>, <i>ALDH3B1</i>, <i>AASS</i>, <i>AOC3</i>, <i>SEPINE1</i>, <i>PFKFB1</i>, <i>FTCD</i>, <i>TIMP1</i> and <i>GATM</i> were finally selected. In order to validate the model’s accuracy, ROC curve analysis was performed on an external dataset, and the results indicated that the model had a high predictive power for the prognosis prediction of patients. Our study provides a theoretical foundation for the future targeted regulation of fructose metabolism in colorectal cancer patients, while simultaneously optimizing dietary guidance and therapeutic care for colorectal cancer patients in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.

                <p>by Ilaria Granata, Lucia Maddalena, Mario Manzo, Mario Rosario Guarracino, Maurizio Giordano</p>

Machine learning-based approaches are particularly suitable for identifying essential genes as they allow the generation of predictive models trained on features from multi-source data. Gene essentiality is neither binary nor static but determined by the context. The databases for essential gene annotation do not permit the personalisation of the context, and their update can be slower than the publication of new experimental data. We propose HELP (Human Gene Essentiality Labelling & Prediction), a computational framework for labelling and predicting essential genes. Its double scope allows for identifying genes based on dependency or not on experimental data. The effectiveness of the labelling method was demonstrated by comparing it with other approaches in overlapping the reference sets of essential gene annotations, where HELP demonstrated the best compromise between false and true positive rates. The gene attributes, including multi-omics and network embedding features, lead to high-performance prediction of essential genes while confirming the existence of essentiality nuances.

                <p>by Cecile Le Sueur, Magnus Rattray, Mikhail Savitski</p>

Thermal proteome profiling (TPP) is a proteome wide technology that enables unbiased detection of protein drug interactions as well as changes in post-translational state of proteins between different biological conditions. Statistical analysis of temperature range TPP (TPP-TR) datasets relies on comparing protein melting curves, describing the amount of non-denatured proteins as a function of temperature, between different conditions (e.g. presence or absence of a drug). However, state-of-the-art models are restricted to sigmoidal melting behaviours while unconventional melting curves, representing up to 50% of TPP-TR datasets, have recently been shown to carry important biological information. We present a novel statistical framework, based on hierarchical Gaussian process models and named GPMelt, to make TPP-TR datasets analysis unbiased with respect to the melting profiles of proteins. GPMelt scales to multiple conditions, and extension of the model to deeper hierarchies (i.e. with additional sub-levels) allows to deal with complex TPP-TR protocols. Collectively, our statistical framework extends the analysis of TPP-TR datasets for both protein and peptide level melting curves, offering access to thousands of previously excluded melting curves and thus substantially increasing the coverage and the ability of TPP to uncover new biology.

The nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway clears eukaryotic cells of mRNAs containing premature termination codons (PTCs) or normal stop codons located in specific contexts. It therefore plays an important role in gene expression regulation. The precise molecular mechanism of the NMD pathway has long been considered to differ substantially from yeast to metazoa, despite the involvement of universally conserved factors such as the central ATP-dependent RNA-helicase Upf1. Here, we describe the crystal structure of the yeast Upf1 bound to its recently identified but yet uncharacterized partner Nmd4, show that Nmd4 stimulates Upf1 ATPase activity and that this interaction contributes to the elimination of NMD substrates. We also demonstrate that a region of Nmd4 critical for the interaction with Upf1 in yeast is conserved in the metazoan SMG6 protein, another major NMD factor. We show that this conserved region is involved in the interaction of SMG6 with UPF1 and that mutations in this region affect the levels of endogenous human NMD substrates. Our results support the universal conservation of the NMD mechanism in eukaryotes.

                Background The objective of this systematic review was to analyze the effects of the physical activity (PA) intervention as an adjuvant strategy to pharmacological treatment in people with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) and non-remitted depression (NRD). Methods A search strategy was realized from five databases: PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Scopus, SPORTDiscus, and Web of Science. Eleven articles attained the inclusion criteria. The Physiotherapy Evidence Database and Oxford’s Evidence Levels were used to classify the quality appraisal. Results The more significant outcome for this analysis was the improvement of depression by PA or exercise in TRD and NRD. According to the FITT (Frequency, Intensity, Time, and Type) principle, there was some variability in the PA intervention, and except for one article, they all were classified as excellent in terms of quality description. Conclusions This review highlights the potential of PA intervention as an adjuvant program to improve different traits of TRD and NRD. The remission of depression seems to be higher after PA intervention, showing improvements in quality of life, sleep quality, executive function, and vitality.

                Background The continuing Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had a massive impact on healthcare systems all around the globe. There is no exception in the demographics of elective surgery also. Like any other medical professionals, surgeons and post-graduates are redirected to the management of patients with COVID-19. The purpose of this study is to determine how the COVID-19 pandemic affected elective surgeries, surgeon skills, and post-graduate training. Methods This prospective study was done among 320 participants through a 15-question online cross-sectional survey sent primarily to surgeons practicing in six states of India that were most affected by the pandemic according to recent statistics and also to surgeons in other states via email or other online messaging services carried out from June 2021 to July 2021. Results 320 surgeons participated from various states in India. Overall, 59.7% of those participants who agreed that there was a reduction in bed availability, 70.4% of those participants who agreed that there was a shortage of oxygen, 78.8% of those participants who agreed that there was a shortage of PPE kits, 60.7% of those participants who agreed that there was a delay in procurement of surgical implants and 64% of participants also agreed that the COVID-19 pandemic had affected the post-graduate teaching program. Conclusions All these factors showed significant p-values with statistical significance, thereby indicating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the healthcare system and healthcare delivery. The pandemic also had a significant impact on post-graduate training.

                The 25th annual Bioinformatics Open Source Conference (BOSC 2024, open-bio.org/events/bosc-2024) was part of the 2024 conference on Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology (ISMB 2024). Launched in 2000 and held yearly since, BOSC is the premier meeting covering open-source bioinformatics and open science. ISMB 2024 was held in Montréal, Canada, with an online participation option. A total of nearly 2000 people attended; about 200 people participated in BOSC sessions. Over the course of two days, BOSC covered a wide range of topics in open science and open source bioinformatics, including Data Analysis, Open Data, Visualization, Developer Tools and Libraries, Standards and Frameworks for Open Science, and Open AI/ML. Mélanie Courtot delivered an impactful first keynote with a perspective on how “The Data Shows We Need Better Data”. The second keynote speaker, Andrew Su, discussed “Open Data, Knowledge Graphs, and Large Language Models.” BOSC ended with a panel, “Open Source AI/ML: A Game Changer for Bioinformatics?,” in which Lawrence Hunter and Thomas Hervé Mboa Nkoudou joined BOSC’s keynote speakers as panelists. Immediately following BOSC, the CollaborationFest was held at Montréal’s University of Québec campus. First launched in 2010, CoFest is a collaborative work event held yearly around BOSC. This year’s CoFest included 42 participants who worked together on 10 projects.

                The duration of immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is uncertain. Delineating immune memory typically requires longitudinal serological studies that track antibody prevalence in the same cohort for an extended time. However, this information is needed in faster timescales. Notably, the dynamics of an epidemic where recovered patients become immune for any period should differ significantly from those of one where the recovered promptly become susceptible. Here, we exploit this difference to provide a reliable protocol that can estimate immunity early in an epidemic. We verify this protocol with synthetic data, discuss its limitations, and then apply it to evaluate human immunity to SARS-CoV-2 in mortality data series from New York City. Our results indicate that New York’s mortality figures are incompatible with immunity lasting anything below 105 or above 211 days (90% CI.), and set an example on how to assess immune memory in emerging pandemics before serological studies can be deployed.

                The search for neural markers of depression remains challenging. Despite progress, neuroimaging results have generally not yielded actionable findings that could transform how we understand and treat this disorder. However, in a recent study, Lynch and colleagues identified enlargement of the frontrostriatal salience network as a reproducible, trait-like marker of depression.

                The capabilities of transformer networks such as ChatGPT and other large language models (LLMs) have captured the world’s attention. The crucial computational mechanism underlying their performance relies on transforming a complete input sequence – for example, all the words in a sentence – into a long ‘encoding vector’ that allows transformers to learn long-range temporal dependencies in naturalistic sequences. Specifically, ‘self-attention’ applied to this encoding vector enhances temporal context in transformers by computing associations between pairs of words in the input sequence. We suggest that waves of neural activity traveling across single cortical areas, or multiple regions on the whole-brain scale, could implement a similar encoding principle. By encapsulating recent input history into a single spatial pattern at each moment in time, cortical waves may enable a temporal context to be extracted from sequences of sensory inputs, the same computational principle as that used in transformers.

                Neuropathic pain (NP) is caused by a lesion or disease of the somatosensory system and is characterized by abnormal hypersensitivity to stimuli and nociceptive responses to non-noxious stimuli, affecting approximately 7–10% of the general population. However, current first-line drugs like non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents and opioids have limitations, including dose-limiting side effects, dependence, and tolerability issues. Therefore, developing new interventions for the management of NP is urgent. In this study, we discovered that the high-frequency terahertz stimulation (HFTS) at approximately 36 THz effectively alleviates NP symptoms in mice with spared nerve injury. Computational simulation suggests that the frequency resonates with the carbonyl group in the filter region of Kv1.2 channels, facilitating the translocation of potassium ions. In vivo and in vitro results demonstrate that HFTS reduces the excitability of pyramidal neurons in the anterior cingulate cortex likely through enhancing the voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> and also the leak K<sup>+</sup> conductance. This research presents a novel optical intervention strategy with terahertz waves for the treatment of NP and holds promising applications in other nervous system diseases.

                The recent, controversial approval of antibody-based treatments for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is fueling a heated debate on the molecular determinants of this condition. The discussion should also incorporate a critical revision of the limitations of preclinical mouse models in advancing our understanding of AD. We critically discuss the limitations of animal models, stressing the need for careful consideration of how experiments are designed and results interpreted. We identify the shortcomings of AD models to recapitulate the complexity of the human disease. We dissect these issues at the quantitative, qualitative, temporal, and context-dependent levels. We argue that these models are based on the oversimplistic assumptions proposed by the amyloid cascade hypothesis (ACH) of AD and fail to account for the multifactorial nature of the condition. By shedding light on the constraints of current experimental tools, this review aims to foster the development and implementation of more clinically relevant tools. While we do not rule out a role for preclinical models, we call for alternative approaches to be explored and, most importantly, for a re-evaluation of the ACH.

                We propose the Self Returning Excluded Volume (SR-EV) model for the structure of chromatin based on stochastic rules and physical interactions. The SR-EV <i>rules of return</i> generate conformationally defined domains observed by single-cell imaging techniques. From nucleosome to chromosome scales, the model captures the overall chromatin organization as a corrugated system, with dense and dilute regions alternating in a manner that resembles the mixing of two disordered bi-continuous phases. This particular organizational topology is a consequence of the multiplicity of interactions and processes occurring in the nuclei, and mimicked by the proposed return rules. Single configuration properties and ensemble averages show a robust agreement between theoretical and experimental results including chromatin volume concentration, contact probability, packing domain identification and size characterization, and packing scaling behavior. Model and experimental results suggest that there is an inherent chromatin organization regardless of the cell character and resistant to an external forcing such as RAD21 degradation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95867">Human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes to study inflammation-induced aberrant calcium transient</a></h4>

              
                Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is commonly found in persons living with HIV (PLWH) even when antiretroviral therapy suppresses HIV viremia. However, studying this condition has been challenging because an appropriate animal model is not available. In this article, we studied calcium transient in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) in culture to simulate the cardiomyocyte relaxation defect noted in PLWH and HFpEF and assess whether various drugs have an effect. We show that treatment of hiPSC-CMs with inflammatory cytokines (such as interferon-γ or TNF-α) impairs their Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake into sarcoplasmic reticulum and that SGLT2 inhibitors, clinically proven as effective for HFpEF, reverse this effect. Additionally, treatment with mitochondrial antioxidants (like mito-Tempo) and certain antiretrovirals resulted in the reversal of the effects of these cytokines on calcium transient. Finally, incubation of hiPSC-CMs with serum from HIV patients with and without diastolic dysfunction did not alter their Ca<sup>2+</sup>-decay time, indicating that the exposure to the serum of these patients is not sufficient to induce the decrease in Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake in vitro. Together, our results indicate that hiPSC-CMs can be used as a model to study molecular mechanisms of inflammation-mediated abnormal cardiomyocyte relaxation and screen for potential new interventions.

                Understanding the function of sleep requires studying the dynamics of brain activity across whole-night sleep and their transitions. However, current gold standard polysomnography (PSG) has limited spatial resolution to track brain activity. Additionally, previous fMRI studies were too short to capture full sleep stages and their cycling. To study whole-brain dynamics and transitions across whole-night sleep, we used an unsupervised learning approach, the Hidden Markov model (HMM), on two-night, 16 hr fMRI recordings of 12 non-sleep-deprived participants who reached all PSG-based sleep stages. This method identified 21 recurring brain states and their transition probabilities, beyond PSG-defined sleep stages. The HMM trained on one night accurately predicted the other, demonstrating unprecedented reproducibility. We also found functionally relevant subdivisions within rapid eye movement (REM) and within non-REM 2 stages. This study provides new insights into brain dynamics and transitions during sleep, aiding our understanding of sleep disorders that impact sleep transitions.

                Antimicrobial resistance is responsible for an alarming number of deaths, estimated at 5 million per year. To combat priority pathogens, like <i>Helicobacter pylori</i>, the development of novel therapies is of utmost importance. Understanding the molecular alterations induced by medications is critical for the design of multi-targeting treatments capable of eradicating the infection and mitigating its pathogenicity. However, the application of bulk omics approaches for unraveling drug molecular mechanisms of action is limited by their inability to discriminate between target-specific modifications and off-target effects. This study introduces a multi-omics method to overcome the existing limitation. For the first time, the Proteome Integral Solubility Alteration (PISA) assay is utilized in bacteria in the PISA-Express format to link proteome solubility with different and potentially immediate responses to drug treatment, enabling us the resolution to understand target-specific modifications and off-target effects. This study introduces a comprehensive method for understanding drug mechanisms and optimizing the development of multi-targeting antimicrobial therapies.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96854">Task-dependent coarticulation of movement sequences</a></h4>

              
                Combining individual actions into sequences is a hallmark of everyday activities. Classical theories propose that the motor system forms a single specification of the sequence as a whole, leading to the coarticulation of the different elements. In contrast, recent neural recordings challenge this idea and suggest independent execution of each element specified separately. Here, we show that separate or coarticulated sequences can result from the same task-dependent controller, without implying different representations in the brain. Simulations show that planning for multiple reaches simultaneously allows separate or coarticulated sequences depending on instructions about intermediate goals. Human experiments in a two-reach sequence task validated this model. Furthermore, in co-articulated sequences, the second goal influenced long-latency stretch responses to external loads applied during the first reach, demonstrating the involvement of the sensorimotor network supporting fast feedback control. Overall, our study establishes a computational framework for sequence production that highlights the importance of feedback control in this essential motor skill.

">Entorhinal grid-like codes for visual space during memory formation</a></h4>

              
                Eye movements, such as saccades, allow us to gather information about the environment and, in this way, can shape memory. In non-human primates, saccades are associated with the activity of grid cells in the entorhinal cortex. Grid cells are essential for spatial navigation, but whether saccade-based grid-like signals play a role in human memory formation is currently unclear. Here, human participants underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and continuous eye gaze monitoring while studying scene images. Recognition memory was probed immediately thereafter. Results revealed saccade-based grid-like codes in the left entorhinal cortex while participants studied the scene images, a finding that was replicated with an independent data set reported here. The grid-related effects were time-locked to activation increases in the frontal eye fields. Most importantly, saccade-based grid-like codes were associated with recognition memory, such that grid-like codes were lower the better participants performed in subsequently recognizing the scene images. Collectively, our findings suggest an entorhinal map of visual space that is timed with neural activity in oculomotor regions, supporting memory formation.

">Predictive influences on memory encoding: investigating oscillations and the N400 event-related potential component</a></h4>

              
                To effectively function in an ever-changing environment, the brain is proposed to make predictions about upcoming information. However, the association between prediction and memory formation and the role of between-subject neural variability in this relationship is unclear. To shed light on the relationship between prediction and memory, the present study reanalysed data from Jano and colleagues (2023). In the original experiment, participants were exposed to naturalistic images in predictable and unpredictable four-item sequences, after which their memory was tested using an old/new paradigm. In the present analysis (N = 46), N400 amplitude and oscillatory power during learning was measured to gauge processes related to prediction error and memory encoding, respectively. This activity was compared with subsequent memory outcomes and individual alpha frequency (IAF) calculated at rest. Linear mixed-effects regressions revealed an alpha power subsequent memory effect that was not related to the amplitude of the N400, suggesting that memory encoding may occur independently of the level of prediction error. Notably, IAF influenced the relationship between theta power, N400 amplitude and subsequent memory, implying that the electrophysiological conditions for successful memory formation differ between individuals. Consequently, the extent to which prediction errors (presumably captured via the N400) drive memory encoding could depend on inter-individual variability in intrinsic neural activity. These findings emphasise the flexible nature of memory, whilst having potential implications for prediction error-driven accounts of learning.

">Dynamic cognitive differences between internal and external attention are associated with depressive and anxiety disorders</a></h4>

              
                The internal/external attention framework characterises attention focused on internal representations, such as emotions, versus external representations, such as perceptual stimuli. The inability to focus one's attention is considered a critical factor in psychiatric disorders. While these different attentional foci are likely generated by the dynamic interplay of multiple cognitive processes, previous studies have generally examined single cognitive dimensions. We developed a new method, cognitive dynamic similarity analysis (C-DSA), to clarify how cognitive processes differ between experimental conditions. In an MR scanner, participants performed a word-processing task in which they focused on either their own emotions or the number of letters associated with a stimulus. To extract cognitive dynamics at the single-trial level, we applied cognitive dynamics estimation, a recently developed method that generates whole-brain activation maps for four cognitive dimensions (emotion processing, selective attention, self-referential thought, and working memory) using a meta-analytic platform. We then performed C-DSA to calculate the difference between internal and external attention for each cognitive dimension. C-DSA revealed significant differences between internal/external attention in all cognitive dimensions, but especially in emotion processing. Moreover, the difference between attention conditions of selective attention was negatively associated with the severity of depression and state-anxiety, but positively associated with trait-anxiety. Our findings suggest that C-DSA applies to both naturalistic and controlled dynamic processes and may be valuable in clinical settings by linking dynamic cognitive mechanisms with issues like ageing and psychiatric disorders.

">The Neural Blueprint of Stress Susceptibility: Brain-wide neuronal activity associated with the consequences of stress</a></h4>

              
                Understanding the neurobiological mechanisms of stress susceptibility is key to advancing our insight into stress-related psychopathology like post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Preclinical animal models however typically lack translationally relevant brain readouts. Here, we used a mouse model for severe stress, segregating mice into stress-susceptible and resilient groups. We analyzed and contrasted their whole-brain neuronal activity pre-, peri- and post-stress exposure and compared functional connectivity of the salience (SN), default mode (DMN) and executive control network (lateral cortical network (LCN) in rodents). We found that stress-susceptible mice exhibited pre-existing hyperactivity in the lateral orbital area, a potential risk factor for stress vulnerability, and heightened retrosplenial cortex activity peri- and post-stress, potentially contributing to maladaptive fear memory. Upon stress exposure, susceptible mice showed strong recruitment of visual and memory-related areas, whereas resilient mice displayed marked reductions in retrosplenial activity and increased activation in the agranular insula and ventral striatum. Observations of enhanced intra-SN and SN-DMN connectivity in susceptible mice mirrored those observed in individuals with PTSD. Moreover, susceptible mice displayed aberrant DMN-LCN network pre- and peri-stress. These findings highlight the importance of dynamic network interactions in stress susceptibility and suggest novel brain region targets for (early) intervention.

">The trade-off between temporal precision and effect amplitude of inhibitory plasticity regulation determines separability of learned representations</a></h4>

              
                Synaptic plasticity, the process by which synapses change in an activity-dependent manner, is assumed to be the basis of learning. Experimental evidence demonstrates that activity originating from other synapses in close proximity to an observed one can influence the outcome of plasticity including activity from inhibitory synapses. Under the assumption that the regulatory effect of inhibition is mediated by hyperpolarisation, we identify a trade-off between temporal precision and effect amplitude due to the treatment of postsynaptic activity in three different voltage-dependent plasticity models. Generally, inhibitory regulation of plasticity enhances the competition between lateral neurons driving the development of functionally relevant connectivity structures in recurrent excitatory-inhibitory networks. Thus, all models show signs of the ability to perform Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and lead to receptive field development. Models which are highly sensitive to local synaptic information tend to result in a higher degree of separation between learned features. This work stresses the importance of considering inhibition in plasticity research as well as indicates that learned representations are influenced by the available information at a synaptic site.

">Positive and Negative Retinotopic Codes in the Human Hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                The hippocampus is thought to coordinate sensory-mnemonic information streams in the brain, representing both the apex of the visual processing hierarchy and also a central hub of mnemonic processing. Yet, the mechanisms underlying sensory-mnemonic interactions in the hippocampus are poorly understood. Recent work in cortex suggests that a retinotopic code - typically thought to be exclusive to visual areas - may help organize internal and external information at the cortical apex via opponent interactions. Here, we leverage high-resolution 7T functional MRI to test whether a bivalent retinotopic code structures activity within the human hippocampus, and mediates hippocampal-cortical interactions. Our findings reveal a robust retinotopic code in the hippocampus, characterized by stable population receptive fields (pRFs) with consistent preferred visual field locations across experimental runs. Notably, this retinotopic code comprises roughly equal proportions of positive and negative pRFs, aligning with the hypothesized role of negative pRFs in mnemonic processing. Finally, the signed amplitude of hippocampal pRFs predicts functional connectivity between retinotopic hippocampal and cortical voxels. Taken together, these results suggest that retinotopic coding may scaffold internal mnemonic and external sensory information processing within the hippocampus, and across hippocampal-cortical interactions.

">Impaired excitability of fast-spiking neurons in a novel mouse model of KCNC1 epileptic encephalopathy</a></h4>

              
                The recurrent pathogenic variant KCNC1-p.Ala421Val (A421V) is a cause of developmental and epileptic encephalopathy characterized by moderate-to-severe developmental delay/intellectual disability, and infantile-onset treatment-resistant epilepsy with multiple seizure types including myoclonic seizures. Yet, the mechanistic basis of disease is unclear. KCNC1 encodes Kv3.1, a voltage-gated potassium channel subunit that is highly and selectively expressed in neurons capable of generating action potentials at high frequency, including parvalbumin-positive fast-spiking GABAergic inhibitory interneurons in cerebral cortex (PV-INs) known to be important for cognitive function and plasticity as well as control of network excitation to prevent seizures. In this study, we generate a novel transgenic mouse model with conditional expression of the Ala421Val pathogenic missense variant (Kcnc1-A421V/+ mice) to explore the physiological mechanisms of KCNC1 developmental and epileptic encephalopathy. Our results indicate that global heterozygous expression of the A421V variant leads to epilepsy and premature lethality. We observe decreased PV-IN cell surface expression of Kv3.1 via immunohistochemistry, decreased voltage-gated potassium current density in PV-INs using outside-out nucleated macropatch recordings in brain slice, and profound impairments in the intrinsic excitability of cerebral cortex PV-INs but not excitatory neurons in current-clamp electrophysiology. In vivo two-photon calcium imaging revealed hypersynchronous discharges correlated with brief paroxysmal movements, subsequently shown to be myoclonic seizures on electroencephalography. We found alterations in PV-IN-mediated inhibitory neurotransmission in young adult but not juvenile Kcnc1-A421V/+ mice relative to wild-type controls. Together, these results establish the impact of the recurrent Kv3.1-A421V variant on neuronal excitability and synaptic physiology across development to drive network dysfunction underlying KCNC1 epileptic encephalopathy.

">Purkinje cell intrinsic activity shapes cerebellar development and function</a></h4>

              
                The emergence of functional cerebellar circuits is heavily influenced by activity-dependent processes. However, the role of intrinsic activity in Purkinje neurons, independent of external input, in driving cerebellar development remains less understood. Here, we demonstrate that before synaptic networks mature, Purkinje cell intrinsic activity is essential for regulating dendrite growth, establishing connections with cerebellar nuclei, and ensuring proper cerebellar function. Disrupting this activity during the postnatal period impairs motor function, with earlier disruptions causing more severe effects. Importantly, only disruptions during early development lead to pronounced defects in cellular morphology, highlighting key temporal windows for dendritic growth and maturation. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that early intrinsic activity drives the expression of activity-dependent genes, such as Prkc{gamma} and Car8, which are essential for dendritic growth. Our findings emphasize the importance of temporally-specific intrinsic activity in Purkinje cells for guiding cerebellar circuit development, providing a potential common mechanism underlying cerebellum-related disorders.

">Activation of group I mGluRs is required for heterosynaptic priming of long-term potentiation in mouse hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                Metaplasticity involves changes in the state of neurons or synapses that influence their ability to generate synaptic plasticity. One form of heterosynaptic metaplasticity, known as synaptic tagging and capture (STC), has been intensively studied but the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. In experiments using hippocampal slices prepared from C57BL/6J mice, we have examined the role of group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) in STC. We used a version of STC where a strong theta-burst stimulus (TBS), delivered to one set of Schaffer collateral-commissural pathway inputs to CA1, preceded a weak TBS delivered to a second independent set of inputs. We observed that, firstly, dual inhibition of mGluR1 and mGluR5, using YM 298198 and MTEP respectively, did not affect a form of protein synthesis-independent LTP (LTP1), but substantially inhibited a form of protein synthesis-dependent LTP (LTP2). Secondly, these inhibitors prevented the small heterosynaptic potentiation, which is often associated with LTP2. Thirdly, STC was abolished when these antagonists were applied either during the strong (priming) TBS or during the subsequent weak TBS at the independent pathway. It is proposed that the activation of group I mGluRs serves as a trigger for local protein synthesis both during the strong and weak TBS and, as such, are an integral part of the STC process, a process involved in associative learning and memory.

">Millisecond-scale motor control precedes sensorimotor learning in Bengalese finches</a></h4>

              
                A key goal of the nervous system in young animals is to learn motor skills. Songbirds learn to sing as juveniles, providing a unique opportunity to identify the neural correlates of skill acquisition. Prior studies have shown that spike rate variability decreases during song acquisition, suggesting a transition from rate-based neural control to the millisecond-precise motor codes known to underlie adult vocal performance. By quantifying how the ensemble of spike patterns fired by cortical neurons (the ``neural vocabulary'') and the relationship between spike patterns and song acoustics (the ``neural code'') change during song acquisition, we quantified how vocal control changes across learning in juvenile Bengalese finches. We found that despite the expected drop in rate variability (a learning-related change in spike vocabulary), the precision of the neural code in the youngest singers is the same as in adults, with 1--2 millisecond variations in spike timing transduced into quantifiably different behaviors. In contrast, fluctuations of firing rates on longer timescales fail to affect the motor output. The consistent presence of millisecond-scale motor coding during changing levels of spike rate and behavioral variability supports the view that variability early in learning stems from deliberate motor exploration rather than imprecise motor control.

">The claustrum enhances neural variability by modulating the responsiveness of the prefrontal cortex</a></h4>

              
                The claustrum is recognized for its significant impact on various cognitive functions and its extensive connections with other brain regions, yet its functional role remains to be fully understood. Here, we utilized an optogenetic approach to investigate the claustrum's influence on neuronal activity within the dorsal prefrontal cortex (dPFC) of mice. We conducted two-photon calcium imaging to assess dPFC cell responses during exposure to visual stimuli and widefield photostimulation of claustrum axons embedded in the dPFC. We identified three distinct subpopulations of neurons - sensory responsive, opto responsive, and opto-boosted cells - each exhibiting unique response dynamics to combined visual and optogenetic stimuli. Our findings reveal that stimulation of claustrum axons can normalize neuronal responsiveness, while enhancing neural variability, and significantly increasing network homogeneity. Training in a Pavlovian task showed that while enhanced variability with claustrum axon stimulation in neural responses persists, training does not further increase this variability but instead leads to greater network homogeneity. Additionally, we also performed claustrum axon silencing experiments that revealed that the claustrum may operate bidirectionally to maintain enhanced variability and homogeneity in the prefrontal cortex. These results highlight the crucial role of the claustrum in dynamically modulating dPFC activity, impacting both neuronal variability and network synchronization.

">New neural-inspired controller generalises modularity over lower limb tasks through internal models</a></h4>

              
                Predictive neuromuscular models based on neural controllers are a powerful tool for testing assumptions on the underlying architecture of sensorimotor control and its associated neural activity. However, most current controllers suffer from lack of physiological plausibility and are generally task specific. We propose a new neural controller, called Internal Model-based Modular Controller (IMMC), where a hierarchical architecture organises generalizable modules in activation networks dedicated to different motion tasks. The architecture comprises a simple model of the mesencephalic locomotor region (MLR), which sends controlling signals that manage the activity of internal models (IMs). The IMs organise synergies, coordinated and stereotyped activity of multiple muscles, in task-specific networks. The resultant organisations allow the generalisation of this architecture to different lower limb motions. The IMMC was tested in Stand-To-Walk simulations (STW), where the MLR switches between two IMs that recombine five synergies to replicate the standing and walking tasks. The simulation kinematics, muscle activation patterns and ground reaction forces were generally consistent with experimental data. In addition, the controller can transition to slower and faster speeds by tuning a single controlling signal. The proposed architecture is a first step to develop neuromuscular models which integrate multiple motor behaviours in a unified controller.

">Altered mRNA transport and local translation in iNeurons with RNA binding protein knockdown</a></h4>

              
                Neurons rely on mRNA transport and local translation to facilitate rapid protein synthesis in processes far from the cell body. These processes allow precise spatial and temporal control of translation and are mediated by RNA binding proteins (RBPs), including those known to be associated with neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we use proteomics, transcriptomics, and microscopy to investigate the impact of RBP knockdown on mRNA transport and local translation in iPSC-derived neurons. We find thousands of transcripts enriched in neurites and that many of these transcripts are locally translated, possibly due to the shorter length of transcripts in neurites. Loss of frontotemporal dementia/amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (FTD/ALS)-associated RBPs TDP-43 and hnRNPA1 lead to distinct alterations in the neuritic proteome and transcriptome. TDP-43 knockdown (KD) leads to increased neuritic mRNA and translation. In contrast, hnRNPA1 leads to increased neuritic mRNA, but not translation, and more moderate effects on local mRNA profiles, possibly due to compensation by hnRNPA3. These results highlight the crucial role of FTD/ALS-associated RBPs in mRNA transport and local translation in neurons and the importance of these processes in neuron health and disease.

">Novel color vision assessment tool: AIM Color Detection and Discrimination</a></h4>

              
                Color vision assessment is essential in clinical practice, yet different tests exhibit distinct strengths and limitations. Here we apply a psychophysical paradigm, Angular Indication Measurement (AIM) for color detection and discrimination. AIM is designed to address some of the shortcomings of existing tests, such as prolonged testing time, limited accuracy and sensitivity, and the necessity for clinician oversight. AIM presents adaptively generated charts, each a N*M (here 4*4) grid of stimuli, and participants are instructed to indicate either the orientation of the gap in a cone-isolating Landolt C optotype or the orientation of the edge between two colors in an equiluminant color space. The contrasts or color differences of the stimuli are adaptively selected for each chart based on performance of prior AIM charts. In a group of 23 color-normal and 15 people with color vision deficiency (CVD), we validate AIM color against Hardy-Rand-Rittler (HRR), Farnsworth-Munsell 100 hue test (FM100), and anomaloscope color matching diagnosis and use machine learning techniques to classify the type and severity of CVD. The results show that AIM has classification accuracies comparable to that of the anomaloscope, and while HRR and FM100 are less accurate than AIM and an anomaloscope, HRR is very rapid. We conclude that AIM is a computer-based, self-administered, response-adaptive and rapid tool with high test-retest repeatability that has the potential to be suitable for both clinical and research applications.

">The neural time course of size constancy in natural scenes</a></h4>

              
                Accurate real-world size perception relies on size constancy, a mechanism that integrates an object's retinal size with distance information. The neural time course of extracting pictorial distance cues from scenes and integrating them with retinal size information - a process referred to as scene-based size constancy - remains unknown. In two experiments, participants viewed objects with either large or small retinal sizes, presented at near or far distances in outdoor scene photographs, while performing an unrelated one-back task. We applied multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) to time-resolved EEG data to decode the retinal size of large versus small objects, depending on their distance (near versus far) in the scenes. The objects were either perceptually similar in size (large-near versus small-far) or perceptually dissimilar in size (large-far versus small-near), reflecting size constancy. We found that the retinal size of objects could be decoded from 80 ms after scene onset onwards. Distance information modulated size decoding at least 120 ms later: from 200 ms after scene onset when objects were fixated, and from 280 ms when objects were viewed in the periphery. These findings reveal the neural time course of size constancy based on pictorial distance cues in natural scenes.

">Minimizing the number of phosphenes required for object recognition under prosthetic vision</a></h4>

              
                Cortical prostheses offer the potential for partial vision restoration in individuals with blindness by stimulating V1 neurons to produce phosphenes. However, the low number of phosphenes that can be elicited in practice makes encoding of whole objects difficult, and the round shape of phosphenes lack the contour cues necessary for perceptual grouping. We propose a minimalistic encoding approach that focuses on essential visual information. We fragmented objects' contours into either phosphenes or curved segments, providing either low or high local visual information. 46 participants identified these fragmented objects in a free-naming task. The number of fragments gradually increased to quantify the minimum number of phosphenes and segments necessary to recognize objects. Most objects could be recognized with only 65 phosphenes, which is in the range of implantable electrodes in human patients. Participants required 27% fewer segments than phosphenes to recognize objects. Including individual objects as a random effect in a linear mixed model substantially increased the explained variance, suggesting that the minimal number of fragments required for object recognition in prosthetic vision strongly depends on the particular object. Our results demonstrate that a minimalistic approach can substantially reduce the number of phosphenes required for recognition, emphasizing the importance of identifying critical object features to minimize brain stimulation in visual prostheses.

">Undoing of firing rate adaptation enables invariant population codes</a></h4>

              
                Adaptation often implements an efficient coding strategy to align neuron sensitivity to relevant stimuli. However, when sensory information is encoded in populations of neurons, adaptation of individual units could deteriorate stimulus information relevant for behavior. One prominent example is the encoding of olfactory information, which occurs at the population level. We show that if individual ORNs were to adapt following an efficient coding principle, contrast information would be lost at the population level, impairing the detection of ON and OFF stimuli. Surprisingly, adaptation of ORN firing responses is compensated at the axon terminal, where calcium transients are kept background-invariant by inhibitory feedback. We demonstrate that achieving this invariance across different background conditions requires an adaptation strategy that shifts response amplitude, rather than sensitivity as predicted by the efficient coding principle. This background invariance is passed on to second-order olfactory neurons, through facilitation of vesicle release that involves modulation of Unc13 proteins. We conclude that synaptic and circuit computations compensate peripheral firing rate adaptation, enhancing the separation of ON and OFF contrasts, while preserving the identity of ON stimuli in population codes. Our findings identify a strategy that allows neural circuits to minimize the cost of information transmission while preserving information content.

">Sleep modulates neural timescales and spatiotemporal integration in the human cortex</a></h4>

              
                Spontaneous neural dynamics manifest across multiple timescales, which are intrinsic to brain areas and exhibit hierarchical organization across the cortex. In wake, a hierarchy of timescales is thought to naturally emerge from microstructural properties, gene expression, and recurrent connections. A fundamental question is timescales' organization and changes in sleep, where physiological needs are different. Here, we describe two coexisting but distinct measures of neural timescales, obtained from broadband activity and gamma power, which display complementary properties. We leveraged intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) data to characterize timescale changes from wake to sleep across the cortical hierarchy. We show that both broadband and gamma timescales are globally longer in sleep than in wake. While broadband timescales increase along the sensorimotor-association axis, gamma ones decrease. During sleep, slow waves can explain the increase of broadband and gamma timescales, but only broadband ones show a positive association with slow-wave density across the cortex. Finally, we characterize spatial correlations and their relationship with timescales as a proxy for spatiotemporal integration, finding high integration at long distances in wake for broadband and at short distances in sleep for gamma timescales. Our results suggest that mesoscopic neural populations possess different timescales that are shaped by anatomy and are modulated by the sleep/wake cycle.

">Coordinated multi-level adaptations across neocortical areas during task learning</a></h4>

              
                The coordinated changes of neural activity during learning, from single neurons to populations of neurons and their interactions across brain areas, remain poorly understood. To reveal specific learning-related changes, we applied multi-area two-photon calcium imaging in mouse neocortex during training of a sensory discrimination task. We uncovered coordinated adaptations in primary somatosensory area S1 and the anterior (A) and rostrolateral (RL) areas of posterior parietal cortex (PPC). At the single-neuron level, task-learning was marked by increased number and stabilized responses of task neurons. At the population level, responses exhibited increased dimensionality and reduced trial-to-trial variability, paralleled by enhanced encoding of task information. The PPC areas, especially area A, became gradually engaged, opening additional within-area subspaces and inter-area subspaces with S1. Task encoding subspaces gradually aligned with these interaction subspaces. Behavioral errors correlated with reduced neuronal responses, decreased encoding accuracy, and misaligned subspaces. Thus, multi-level adaptations within and across cortical areas contribute to learning-related refinement of sensory processing and decision-making.

">Evaluation of HD-sEMG descriptor sensitivity to changes of anatomical and neural properties with aging : A simulation study</a></h4>

              
                Background and objectives: A reliable evaluation of anatomical and neural muscle properties and its effects on the electrical signals measured at the skin surface aims to develop a medical non-invasive aid-diagnosis tool assisted by model and personalized to the patient. This tool will be dedicated to understand and evaluate muscle diseases and aging. Methods: We perform a new Robust Morris Screening Method: RMSM in Douania et al. (2023), to assess the impact of muscle anatomy (model inputs) uncertainties and variations on a simulated HD-sEMG signals (model outputs). The model describes a complex neuromuscular system simulating HD-sEMG (high density surface electromyography) signals generated from motor units electrical sources of a striated muscle: the Biceps Brachii (BB). Two subjects categories and two contractions levels are studied: young men (YM) and old men (OM) at low and high contraction (LC = 20% of MVC and HC = 60% of MVC). A 33 features in time and frequency domains are used as model outputs. Results: We have demonstrated that the neuromuscular model is able to deliver HD-sEMG signals sensitive to the same anatomical and neural muscle factors as in real cases. Time domain features are mainly sensitive to muscle thickness, conduction velocity of fibers, electrode locations (at HC), number of motor units, and to the number of slow and fast fibers for young and aged categories respectively. Frequency domain feature are sensitive mainly to the conduction velocity of fibers and muscle conductivities (no significant differences between YM and OM are observed). Conclusion: This result is important, it allows to obtain simulated HD-sEMG signals close to experimental ones with low cost and in reduced time. However, for a reliable evaluation of muscle aging, the neuromuscular model should be enhanced to better describe structural, morphological, and functional age-related phenomena.

">Effect of chronic upregulation of endocannabinoid signaling in vivo with JZL184 on striatal synaptic plasticity and motor learning in YAC128 Huntington disease mice</a></h4>

              
                Synaptic dysfunction underlies early sensorimotor and cognitive deficits, and precedes neurodegeneration in a variety of disorders, including Alzheimer, Parkinson and Huntington disease (HD). A monogenic inherited disorder, HD manifests with cognitive, motor and mood disorders associated with progressive degeneration of striatal spiny projection neurons and cortical pyramidal neurons. Cortico-basal ganglia-thalamic loops regulate movement selection and motor learning, which are impaired early in HD. Skilled motor learning is mediated in part by plasticity at cortico-striatal synapses, including endocannabinoid-mediated, high-frequency stimulation induced long-term depression (HFS-LTD). Previously, we found impaired HFS-LTD in brain slice recordings from pre-manifest HD mouse models, which was corrected by JZL184, an inhibitor of endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2-AG) degradation. Here, we tested the effects of JZL184 administered in vivo to YAC128 HD model and wild-type (WT) littermate mice. JZL184, given orally daily over a 3-week period, significantly increased levels of 2-AG in striatal tissue. While JZL184 treatment had no impact on open field behavior which was similar for the two genotypes, the treatment improved motor learning on the rotarod task in YAC128 mice to the level observed in WT mice. Moreover, HFS-induced striatal plasticity measured by field potential recording in acute brain slice from YAC128 mice was normalized to WT levels after JZL184 treatment. These results suggest a novel target for mitigating early symptoms of HD, and support the need for clinical trials to test the efficacy of modulating the endocannabinoid system in treatment of HD.

	<p>Background/Objectives: Meditation induces changes in the nervous system, which presumably underpin positive psychological and physiological effects. Such neural changes include alterations in the arousal fluctuation, as well as in infraslow brain activity (ISA, &amp;amp;lt;0.1 Hz). Furthermore, it is known that fluctuations of arousal over time correlate with the oscillatory phase of ISA. However, whether this arousal&amp;amp;ndash;ISA correlation changes after meditation practices remains unanswered.; Methods: The present study aims to address this question by analyzing a publicly available electroencephalogram (EEG) dataset recorded during meditation sessions in the groups of experienced meditators and novices. The arousal fluctuation is measured by galvanic skin responses (GSR), and arousal&amp;amp;ndash;ISA correlations are measured by phase synchronization between GSR and EEG ISAs.; Results: While both groups exhibit arousal&amp;amp;ndash;ISA correlations, experienced meditators display higher correlations than novices. These increased arousal&amp;amp;ndash;ISA correlations in experienced meditators manifest more clearly when oscillatory phase differences between GSR and EEG ISAs are either 0 or &amp;amp;pi; radians. As such, we further investigate the characteristics of these phase differences with respect to spatial distribution over the brain. We found that brain regions with the phase difference of either 0 or &amp;amp;pi; radians form distinct spatial clusters, and that these clusters are spatially correlated with functional organization estimated by the principal gradient, based on functional connectivity.; Conclusions: Since increased arousal&amp;amp;ndash;ISA correlations reflect enhanced global organization of the central and autonomic nervous systems, our findings imply that the positive effects of meditation might be mediated by enhanced global organization of the nervous system.</p>

	<p>Introduction: This study investigates how traumatic injuries alter joint movements in the ankle and foot. We used a brain injury model in rats, focusing on the hippocampus between the CA1 and dentate gyrus. Materials and Methods: We assessed the dissimilarity factor (DF) and vertical displacement (VD) of the ankle and metatarsus joints before and after the hippocampal lesion. We analyzed joint movements in rats after the injury or in rats treated with resveratrol, exercise, or a combination of both. Results: Resveratrol facilitated the recovery of DF in both legs, showing improvements in the ankle and metatarsus joints on the third and seventh days post-injury. The hippocampal lesion affected VD in both legs, observed on the third or seventh day after the injury. Both exercise and resveratrol partially recovered VD in the ankle and metatarsus joints on these days. These effects may be linked to increased hippocampal neurogenesis and reduced neuroinflammation. Conclusions: The study highlights the benefits of resveratrol and exercise in motor recovery following brain injury, suggesting their potential to enhance the quality of life for patients with neurological disorders affecting motor function and locomotion. These findings also suggest that resveratrol could offer a promising or complementary alternative in managing chronic pain and inflammation associated with orthopedic conditions, thus improving overall patient management.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Research suggests that metalinguistic and cognitive/attentional-control processes are key variables in literacy development in young learners. Interactions between these variables are complex, and this complexity is increased in multilingual learners. With data on the interplay between metalinguistic and cognitive awareness, literacy, and multilingualism being scarce, it is far from clear how these variables interact and how they impact the individual child. This article sets out to shine some light on the interconnectedness and interactions between metalinguistic awareness, cognitive/executive functions, and (multilingual) literacy. Conclusions: We argue that the three dimensions are strongly correlated and that this correlation comes with important implications for language learning, language processing, and language development. However, the exact nature of these correlations is yet to be established.</p>

	<p>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a motor neuron disease with progressive neurodegeneration, affecting both the cortical and the spinal component of the motor neuron circuitry in patients. The cellular and molecular basis of selective neuronal vulnerability is beginning to emerge. Yet, there are no effective cures for ALS, which affects more than 200,000 people worldwide each year. Recent studies highlight the importance of the glymphatic system and its proper function for the clearance of the cerebral spinal fluid, which is achieved mostly during the sleep period. Therefore, a potential link between problems with sleep and neurodegenerative diseases has been postulated. This paper discusses the present understanding of this potential correlation.</p>

	<p>Background: Perinatal infection is a major risk factor for diffuse white matter injury (dWMI), which remains the most common form of neurological disability among very preterm infants. The disease primarily targets oligodendrocytes (OL) lineage cells in the white matter but also involves injury and/or dysmaturation of neurons of the gray matter. This study aimed to investigate whether neuroinflammation preferentially affects the cellular compositions of the white matter or gray matter. Method: Neuroinflammation was initiated by intracerebral administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to rat pups at postnatal (P) day 5, and neurobiological and behavioral outcomes were assessed between P6 and P21. Results: LPS challenge rapidly activates microglia and astrocytes, which is associated with the inhibition of OL and neuron differentiation leading to myelination deficits. Specifically, neuroinflammation reduces the immature OLs but not progenitors and causes acute axonal injury (&amp;amp;beta;-amyloid precursor protein immunopositivity) and impaired dendritic maturation (reduced MAP2+ neural fiber density) in the cortical area at P7. Neuroinflammation also reduces the expression of doublecortin in the hippocampus, suggesting compromise in neurogenesis. Utilizing a battery of behavioral assessments, we found that LPS-exposed animals exhibited deficits in sensorimotor, neuromuscular, and cognitive domains. Conclusion: Our overall results indicate that neuroinflammation alone in the early postnatal period can produce cardinal neuropathological features of dWMI.</p>

	<p>Background: Hemodynamics during the growth process of cerebral aneurysms are incompletely understood. We developed a novel fluid&amp;amp;ndash;structure interaction analysis method for the identification of relevant scenarios of aneurysm onset. Method: This method integrates both fluid dynamics and structural mechanics, as well as their mutual interaction, for a comprehensive analysis. Patients with a single unruptured cerebral aneurysm were included. Results: Overall, three scenarios were identified. In scenario A, wall shear stress (WSS) was low, and the oscillatory shear index (OSI) was high in large areas within the region of aneurysm onset (RAO). In scenario B, the quantities indicated a reversed behavior, where WSS was high and OSI was low. In the last scenario C, a behavior in-between was found, with scenarios A and B coexisting simultaneously in the RAO. Structural mechanics demonstrated a similar but independent trend. Further, we analyzed the change in hemodynamics between the onset and a fully developed aneurysm. While scenarios A and C remained unchanged during aneurysm growth, 47% of aneurysms in scenario B changed into scenario A and 20% into scenario C. Conclusions: In conclusion, these findings suggest that WSS and the OSI are reciprocally regulated, and both low and high WSS/OSI conditions can lead to aneurysm onset.</p>

	<p>Background: Lower urinary tract (LUT) symptoms are reported in more than 80% of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), most commonly an overactive bladder (OAB). The relationship between brain white matter (WM) changes in MS and OAB symptoms is poorly understood. Objectives: We aim to evaluate (i) microstructural WM differences across MS patients (pwMS) with OAB symptoms, patients without LUT symptoms, and healthy subjects using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and (ii) associations between clinical OAB symptom scores and DTI indices. Methods: Twenty-nine female pwMS [mean age (SD) 43.3 years (9.4)], including seventeen with OAB [mean age (SD) 46.1 years (8.6)] and nine without LUT symptoms [mean age (SD) 37.5 years (8.9)], and fourteen healthy controls (HCs) [mean age (SD) 48.5 years (20)] were scanned in a 3T MRI with a DTI protocol. Additionally, clinical scans were performed for WM lesion segmentation. Group differences in fractional anisotropy (FA) were evaluated using tract-based spatial statistics. The Urinary Symptom Profile questionnaire assessed OAB severity. Results: A statistically significant reduction in FA (p = 0.004) was identified in microstructural WM in pwMS, compared with HCs. An inverse correlation was found between FA in frontal and parietal WM lobes and OAB scores (p = 0.021) in pwMS. Areas of lower FA, although this did not reach statistical significance, were found in both frontal lobes and the rest of the non-dominant hemisphere in pwMS with OAB compared with pwMS without LUT symptoms (p = 0.072). Conclusions: This study identified that lesions affecting different WM tracts in MS can result in OAB symptoms and demonstrated the role of the WM in the neural control of LUT functions. By using DTI, the association between OAB symptom severity and WM changes were identified, adding knowledge to the current LUT working model. As MS is predominantly a WM disease, these findings suggest that regional WM involvement, including of the anterior corona radiata, anterior thalamic radiation, superior longitudinal fasciculus, and superior frontal-occipital fasciculus and a non-dominant prevalence in WM, can result in OAB symptoms. OAB symptoms in MS correlate with anisotropy changes in different white matter tracts as demonstrated by DTI. Structural impairment in WM tracts plays an important role in LUT symptoms in MS.</p>

	<p>Background: Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by structural changes in the brain, including hippocampal atrophy, cortical thinning, amyloid plaques, and tau tangles. Due to the aging of the global population, the burden of Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease is expected to increase, making the exploration of non-pharmacological interventions, such as physical exercise, an urgent priority. Results: There is emerging evidence that regular physical exercise may mitigate the structural and functional declines associated with Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease. The underlying mechanisms, however, remain poorly understood. Gut&amp;amp;ndash;brain axis research is a promising area for further investigation. This system involves bidirectional communication between the gut microbiome and the brain. According to recent studies, the gut microbiome may influence brain health through modulating neuroinflammation, producing neuroactive compounds, and altering metabolic processes. Exercise has been shown to alter the composition of the gut microbiome, potentially impacting brain structure and function. In this review, we aim to synthesize current research on the relationship between physical exercise, structural brain changes in Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease, and the gut&amp;amp;ndash;brain axis. Conclusions: In this study, we will investigate whether changes in the gut microbiome induced by physical exercise can mediate its neuroprotective effects, offering new insights into the prevention and treatment of Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease. By integrating findings from neuroimaging studies, clinical trials, and microbiome research, this review will highlight potential mechanisms. It will also identify key gaps in the literature. This will pave the way for future research directions.</p>

	<p>Background: Long COVID-19 is an emerging chronic illness of significant public health concern due to a myriad of neuropsychiatric sequelae, including increased suicidal ideation (SI) and behavior (SB). Methods: This review provides a concise synthesis of clinical evidence that points toward the dysfunction of astrocytes, the most abundant glial cell type in the central nervous system, as a potential shared pathology between SI/SB and COVID-19. Results: Depression, a suicide risk factor, and SI/SB were both associated with reduced frequencies of various astrocyte subsets and complex proteomic/transcriptional changes of astrocyte-related markers in a brain-region-specific manner. Astrocyte-related circulating markers were increased in depressed subjects and, to a less consistent extent, in COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, reactive astrocytosis was observed in subjects with SI/SB and those with COVID-19. Conclusions: Astrocyte dysfunctions occurred in depression, SI/SB, and COVID-19. Reactive-astrocyte-mediated loss of the blood&amp;amp;ndash;brain barrier (BBB) integrity and subsequent neuroinflammation&amp;amp;mdash;a factor previously linked to SI/SB development&amp;amp;mdash;might contribute to increased suicide in individuals with long COVID-19. As such, the formulation of new therapeutic strategies to restore astrocyte homeostasis, enhance BBB integrity, and mitigate neuroinflammation may reduce SI/SB-associated neuropsychiatric manifestations among long COVID-19 patients.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-788/v2?src=rss">Cheating and plagiarism in higher education institutions (HEIs): A literature review [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Cheating and plagiarism have become serious problems in higher education institutions (HEIs). It affects educational quality as well as the reputation of higher education. The purpose of this study is to identify the most prevalent types of cheating and plagiarism, as well as the elements that contribute to cheating and plagiarism, and to present solutions to this recurring problem. This paper systematically reviews 45 articles published from 2018, to 2022, aligned with the PRISMA guidelines in the selection, filtering, and reporting of the papers. This review shows that factors such as increased pressure on students, poor academic integrity awareness, lack of up-to-date academic honor codes, and the unethical application of AI tools are prime contributing factors to cheating and plagiarism in HEIs. In a broader sense, all these factors are classified as individual, social, cultural, institutional, and technological factors that are responsible for this problem. This problem can be reduced by establishing ethical and moral development tutorials as well as formulating up-to-date honor codes considering AI tools. Furthermore, higher education institutions must develop anti-plagiarism detection software in order to detect plagiarism and aid students in improving academic writing and paraphrasing approaches. The findings of this systematic literature review provide useful insights for educators and policymakers to solve the complicated issue of cheating and plagiarism in higher education institutions.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1097/v1?src=rss">A high-throughput gene expression analysis software tool for developmental time series and gene signature analysis of human cardiomyocyte differentiation [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Publicly available high-throughput gene expression data enable the investigation of biological processes by the scientific community. Although several bioinformatics tools offer methodologies for basic differential gene expression analysis, difficulties arise in the analysis of multiple sample groups comprising a developmental time series, especially when the identification and classification of unique gene expression patterns is the primary goal of the study. Data analysis using these tools requires programming experience, which limits the accessibility of these tools to the broader community. To streamline developmental time-series investigations, we created the Developmental Gene Expression Analysis (devGEA) tool. This environment can be implemented locally or via web browsers to expedite differential gene expression analysis. This tool provides gene signature determination methods that can classify differentially expressed genes based on their correlation with gene expression patterns. devGEA was used to characterize cardiac development gene expression signatures from high-throughput RNA-seq datasets profiling small-molecule directed cardiomyocyte differentiation of human pluripotent stem cell lines (hiPSCs). After pre-processing, discrete gene expression criteria-based expected changes were used to classify the genes into developmental signatures. Several cardiomyocyte differentiation markers and candidate cardiac genes representing different developmental signatures were experimentally validated using the GIBCOTM hiPSC line. This method was then compared to a gene signature correlation approach that classified expressed genes based on their degree of similarity with key cardiac developmental signatures representing the stages of cardiomyocyte differentiation. Therefore, devGEA provides a robust workflow for investigator-driven analysis of developmental time series, allowing for the identification of differentially expressed genes and gene signatures for extensive experimental investigation. We also introduced a method for classifying genes by their correlation with genes or developmental patterns of interest. Our correlation-based method takes advantage of a priori knowledge of an experiment and is conceptually simpler than unsupervised clustering approaches.

                Yeasts are widely known for their application in food production, but also because of their clinical significance. As human pathogens, several species of yeasts, mainly of the genus Candida, are responsible for a great number of life-threatening infections. The occurrence of yeasts in cheeses, including pathogenic species, has been largely studied, yet the antifungal susceptibility of these microorganisms is rarely reported. Here, we identified the species and determined the antifungal susceptibility profile of 45 Candida isolates recovered from artisanal cheeses from 20 cities in Boyacá, Colombia. Among the species, Candida lambica (28.9%) prevailed, followed by Candida krusei (24.4%), Candida kefyr (22.2%), Candida lusitaniae (11.1%), Candida inconspicua (6.7%) Candida parapsilosis (4.4%) and Candida guillermondii (2.2%). Notably, all seven species have been globally reported, to a greater or lesser extent, to cause fungemia and other invasive infections with high mortality rates. Remarkably, most isolates of C. lambica C. krusei, C. inconspicua and C. parapsilosis were resistant to fluconazole, one of the most common drugs to treat candidiasis. Our findings highlight the importance of exploring the ecological niches of pathogenic yeasts, together with their antifungal susceptibility, considering that the emergence of resistance in non-commensal opportunistic pathogens poses a serious threat to public health.

                Purpose This study aims to evaluate the changes in the sustainability of fiscal policies in South Africa and selected Southern African Development Community (SADC) countries by employing the Kalman filter and Markov switching model and further overcome the limitations of previous studies by considering the impact of previously neglected variables. Design/methodology/approach The paper utilizes regression analysis, the Kalman filter, and the Markov switching model. By analysing GDP data for SADC countries, regime shifts are estimated, and fiscal sustainability is evaluated. To enhance numerical adaptation, a random walk state space model is incorporated into the conventional Kalman filter. Originality and value This study significantly contributes to academia and the field of economics in South Africa by addressing previous research limitations on fiscal policy sustainability. It incorporates previously omitted variables and employs advanced estimation techniques, such as the random walk-based Kalman filter and Markov switching model, to provide a comprehensive understanding of fiscal sustainability in South Africa and selected SADC countries. The findings offer valuable recommendations for policymakers and government authorities, including the necessity of fiscal consolidation to reduce debt, adherence to specified borrowing ratios, and reforms to increase savings and overall fiscal sustainability in the SADC region. Findings The random walk-based Kalman filter exhibits superior numerical adaptation compared to the conventional approach. An analysis of normalized financial impacts reveals significant variations in fiscal sustainability among SADC countries and different GDP categories. Countries with higher GDPs generally exhibit greater financial sustainability, while those with lower GDPs face more challenges in this regard. Conclusion Advanced estimation techniques like the random walk-based Kalman filter and Markov switching model offer critical insights into fiscal sustainability in South Africa and the broader SADC region. They further provide a more accurate and comprehensive analysis, revealing significant variations in fiscal stability across different GDP categories.

                <p>by Ylva Katarina Wedmark, Jon Olav Vik, Ove Øyås</p>

The metabolic network of an organism can be analyzed as a constraint-based model. This analysis can be biased, optimizing an objective such as growth rate, or unbiased, aiming to describe the full feasible space of metabolic fluxes through pathway analysis or random flux sampling. In particular, pathway analysis can decompose the flux space into fundamental and formally defined metabolic pathways. Unbiased methods scale poorly with network size due to combinatorial explosion, but a promising approach to improve scalability is to focus on metabolic subnetworks, e.g., cells’ metabolite exchanges with each other and the environment, rather than the full metabolic networks. Here, we applied pathway enumeration and flux sampling to metabolite exchanges in microbial species and a microbial community, using models ranging from central carbon metabolism to genome-scale and focusing on pathway definitions that allow direct targeting of subnetworks such as metabolite exchanges (elementary conversion modes, elementary flux patterns, and minimal pathways). Enumerating growth-supporting metabolite exchanges, we found that metabolite exchanges from different pathway definitions were related through a hierarchy, and we show that this hierarchical relationship between pathways holds for metabolic networks and subnetworks more generally. Metabolite exchange frequencies, defined as the fraction of pathways in which each metabolite was exchanged, were similar across pathway definitions, with a few specific exchanges explaining large differences in pathway counts. This indicates that biological interpretation of predicted metabolite exchanges is robust to the choice of pathway definition, and it suggests strategies for more scalable pathway analysis. Our results also signal wider biological implications, facilitating detailed and interpretable analysis of metabolite exchanges and other subnetworks in fields such as metabolic engineering and synthetic biology.

                <p>by Elena Miu, Luke Rendell, Sam Bowles, Rob Boyd, Daniel Cownden, Magnus Enquist, Kimmo Eriksson, Marcus W. Feldman, Timothy Lillicrap, Richard McElreath, Stuart Murray, James Ounsley, Kevin N. Lala</p>

Social learning is common in nature, yet cumulative culture (where knowledge and technology increase in complexity and diversity over time) appears restricted to humans. To understand why, we organized a computer tournament in which programmed entries specified when to learn new knowledge and when to refine (i.e. improve) existing knowledge. The tournament revealed a ‘refinement paradox’: refined behavior afforded higher payoffs as individuals converged on a small number of successful behavioral variants, but refining did not generally pay. Paradoxically, entries that refined only in certain conditions did best during behavioral improvement, while simple copying entries thrived when refinement levels were high. Cumulative cultural evolution may be rare in part because sophisticated strategies for improving knowledge and technology are initially advantageous, yet complex culture, once achieved, favors conformity, blind imitation and hyper-credulity.

                <p>by Carlos Albors, Jordi Mill, Andy L. Olivares, Xavier Iriart, Hubert Cochet, Oscar Camara</p>

Left atrial appendage occlusion devices (LAAO) are a feasible alternative for non-valvular atrial fibrillation (AF) patients at high risk of thromboembolic stroke and contraindication to antithrombotic therapies. However, optimal LAAO device configurations (i.e., size, type, location) remain unstandardized due to the large anatomical variability of the left atrial appendage (LAA) morphology, leading to a 4-6% incidence of device-related thrombus (DRT). In-silico simulations have the potential to assess DRT risk and identify the key factors, such as suboptimal device positioning. This work presents fluid simulation results computed on 20 patient-specific left atrial geometries, analysing different commercially available LAAO occluders, including plug-type and pacifier-type devices. In addition, we explored two distinct device positions: 1) the real post-LAAO intervention configuration derived from follow-up imaging; and 2) one covering the pulmonary ridge if it was not achieved during the implantation (13 out of 20). In total, 33 different configurations were analysed. In-silico indices indicating high risk of DRT (e.g., low blood flow velocities and flow complexity around the device) were combined with particle deposition analysis based on a discrete phase model. The obtained results revealed that covering the pulmonary ridge with the LAAO device may be one of the key factors to prevent DRT, resulting in higher velocities and reduced flow recirculations (e.g., mean velocities of 0.183 ± 0.12 m/s and 0.236 ± 0.16 m/s for uncovered versus covered positions in DRT patients). Moreover, disk-based devices exhibited enhanced adaptability to various LAA morphologies and, generally, demonstrated a lower risk of abnormal events after LAAO implantation.

Understanding perturbations in circulating lipid levels that often occur years or decades before clinical symptoms may enhance our understanding of disease mechanisms and provide novel intervention opportunities. Here, we assessed if polygenic scores (PGSs) for complex traits could detect lipid dysfunctions related to the traits and provide new biological insights. We constructed genome-wide PGSs (approximately 1 million genetic variants) for 50 complex traits in 7,169 Finnish individuals with routine clinical lipid profiles and lipidomics measurements (179 lipid species). We identified 678 associations (<i>P</i> < 9.0 × 10<sup>−5</sup>) involving 26 traits and 142 lipids. Most of these associations were also validated with the actual phenotype measurements where available (89.5% of 181 associations where the trait was available), suggesting that these associations represent early signs of physiological changes of the traits. We detected many known relationships (e.g., PGS for body mass index (BMI) and lysophospholipids, PGS for type 2 diabetes and triacyglycerols) and those that suggested potential target for prevention strategies (e.g., PGS for venous thromboembolism and arachidonic acid). We also found association of PGS for favorable adiposity with increased sphingomyelins levels, suggesting a probable role of sphingomyelins in increased risk for certain disease, e.g., venous thromboembolism as reported previously, in favorable adiposity despite its favorable metabolic effect. Altogether, our study provides a comprehensive characterization of lipidomic alterations in genetic predisposition for a wide range of complex traits. The study also demonstrates potential of PGSs for complex traits to capture early, presymptomatic lipid alterations, highlighting its utility in understanding disease mechanisms and early disease detection.

                <p>by Alexander Kroll, Nico Niebuhr, Gregory Butler, Martin J. Lercher</p>

Transport proteins play a crucial role in cellular metabolism and are central to many aspects of molecular biology and medicine. Determining the function of transport proteins experimentally is challenging, as they become unstable when isolated from cell membranes. Machine learning-based predictions could provide an efficient alternative. However, existing methods are limited to predicting a small number of specific substrates or broad transporter classes. These limitations stem partly from using small data sets for model training and a choice of input features that lack sufficient information about the prediction problem. Here, we present SPOT, the first general machine learning model that can successfully predict specific substrates for arbitrary transport proteins, achieving an accuracy above 92% on independent and diverse test data covering widely different transporters and a broad range of metabolites. SPOT uses Transformer Networks to represent transporters and substrates numerically. To overcome the problem of missing negative data for training, it augments a large data set of known transporter-substrate pairs with carefully sampled random molecules as non-substrates. SPOT not only predicts specific transporter-substrate pairs, but also outperforms previously published models designed to predict broad substrate classes for individual transport proteins. We provide a web server and Python function that allows users to explore the substrate scope of arbitrary transporters.

                <p>by Jobran Chebib, Anika Jonas, Eugenio López-Cortegano, Sven Künzel, Diethard Tautz, Peter D. Keightley</p>

Each generation, spontaneous mutations introduce heritable changes that tend to reduce fitness in populations of highly adapted living organisms. This erosion of fitness is countered by natural selection, which keeps deleterious mutations at low frequencies and ultimately removes most of them from the population. The classical way of studying the impact of spontaneous mutations is via mutation accumulation (MA) experiments, where lines of small effective population size are bred for many generations in conditions where natural selection is largely removed. Such experiments in microbes, invertebrates, and plants have generally demonstrated that fitness decays as a result of MA. However, the phenotypic consequences of MA in vertebrates are largely unknown, because no replicated MA experiment has previously been carried out. This gap in our knowledge is relevant for human populations, where societal changes have reduced the strength of natural selection, potentially allowing deleterious mutations to accumulate. Here, we study the impact of spontaneous MA on the mean and genetic variation for quantitative and fitness-related traits in the house mouse using the MA experimental design, with a cryopreserved control to account for environmental influences. We show that variation for morphological and life history traits accumulates at a sufficiently high rate to maintain genetic variation and selection response. Weight and tail length measures decrease significantly between 0.04% and 0.3% per generation with narrow confidence intervals. Fitness proxy measures (litter size and surviving offspring) decrease on average by about 0.2% per generation, but with confidence intervals overlapping zero. When extrapolated to humans, our results imply that the rate of fitness loss should not be of concern in the foreseeable future.

[version 2; peer review: 1 appr</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Restorative dental materials are defined as substances that are used to repair, replace, or enhance a patient’s teeth. Various materials used in paediatric dentistry are zinc oxide eugenol, glass ionomer cement, resin composite, calcium hydroxide, silver amalgam, giomers etc. GIC is a biocompatible material having a low thermal expansion coefficient and fluoride release property. There are still a few drawbacks of GICdue of their poor mechanical properties therefore addition of Silver Nanoparticles demonstrated improved mechanical and bactericidal capabilities. There hasn’t been much study on the quality of the bond contact between silver nanoparticles and dentin, as well as the color’s durability. Aim: To evaluate and compare the mechanical properties and bond strength of Glass ionomer cement reinforced with three different concentrations of silver nanoparticle as against conventional glass ionomer cement in primary Teeth. Materials and Method: Silver nanoparticles will be prepared using three chemicals namely, silver nitrate, sodium citrate and tannic acid. Traditional GIC (GC Fuji II, GC Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) will be purchased. Three different concentrations of silver nanoparticles will be prepared i.e., 0.2, 0.4, and 0.6%. The GIC specimens will then be divided into 4 groups: GIC without silver nanoparticles (AgNPs),0.2%,0.4% and 0.6% AgNPs. Mechanical properties will be checked such as compressive, tensile, and bond strength using Universal Testing Machine. Expected Results: GIC reinforced with silver nano particles is expected to have better mechanical strength, less microleakage and wear resistance, greater fracture resistance and adhesive bond strength. Conclusion: GIC reinforced with silver nano particles will be expected to have better mechanical and physical properties than conventional Type II GICs and is expected to be a promising material for restoration in primary teeth.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-664/v2?src=rss">(Semi)automated approaches to data extraction for systematic reviews and meta-analyses in social sciences: A living review [version 2; peer review: 2 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background An abundance of rapidly accumulating scientific evidence presents novel opportunities for researchers and practitioners alike, yet such advantages are often overshadowed by resource demands associated with finding and aggregating a continually expanding body of scientific information. Data extraction activities associated with evidence synthesis have been described as time-consuming to the point of critically limiting the usefulness of research. Across social science disciplines, the use of automation technologies for timely and accurate knowledge synthesis can enhance research translation value, better inform key policy development, and expand the current understanding of human interactions, organizations, and systems. Ongoing developments surrounding automation are highly concentrated in research for evidence-based medicine with limited evidence surrounding tools and techniques applied outside of the clinical research community. The goal of the present study is to extend the automation knowledge base by synthesizing current trends in the application of extraction technologies of key data elements of interest for social scientists. Methods We report the baseline results of a living systematic review of automated data extraction techniques supporting systematic reviews and meta-analyses in the social sciences. This review follows PRISMA standards for reporting systematic reviews. Results The baseline review of social science research yielded 23 relevant studies. Conclusions When considering the process of automating systematic review and meta-analysis information extraction, social science research falls short as compared to clinical research that focuses on automatic processing of information related to the PICO framework. With a few exceptions, most tools were either in the infancy stage and not accessible to applied researchers, were domain specific, or required substantial manual coding of articles before automation could occur. Additionally, few solutions considered extraction of data from tables which is where key data elements reside that social and behavioral scientists analyze.

                Background Selfies have been defined as “a photograph that one has taken of oneself, and are a continuing growing trend among Millennials. Narcissism refers to the personality trait of an extraordinary self-awareness and adoration. Studies have shown a close relationship between selfie-taking behaviour, narcissism and oral health. Hence, a study was conducted with aim of the influence of selfie-taking behavior and narcissism on oral health. Methods An analytical cross-sectional questionnaire study was designed using relevant literature for collating information on sociodemographic characteristics, frequency of dental visits, selfie-taking behavior and perceived oral health. Oral health examination was performed to assess decay and plaque. Narcissism was assessed using The Five-Factor Narcissism Inventory Short Form Results The study included a sample of 163 participants. The associations between selfies taken per day and perceived oral health was statistically significant (p value 0.047*). Binary logistic regression models were constructed, which were significant for perceived oral health and grandiose fantasy. Plaque Scores showed significant corelations between indifference, manipulativeness, thrill seeking and age. Step forward binary regression demonstrated a significant odds ratio for grandiose narcissism followed by selfie-taking behavior Conclusion This study revealed a correlation between perceived oral health and selfie-taking behaviour. Further studies are required to assess selfie-taking behaviour and oral health.

                Background The primary objective worldwide during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic had been controlling disease transmission. However, lockdown measures used to mitigate transmission affected human behavior and altered lifestyles, with a likely impact on chronic non-communicable diseases. More than a year into the pandemic, substantial peer-reviewed literature emerged on altered lifestyles following the varying lockdown measures imposed globally to control the virus spread. We explored the impact of lockdown measures on six lifestyle factors, namely diet, physical activity, sleep, stress, social connectedness, and the use of tobacco, alcohol, or other harmful substances. Methods We comprehensively searched PubMed and the World Health Organization’s global literature database on COVID-19 and retrieved 649 relevant articles for the narrative review. A critical interpretative synthesis of the articles was performed. Results Most of the articles included in the review identified the negative effect of lockdown measures on each of the lifestyle factors in many parts of the world. Encouraging lifestyle trends were also highlighted in a few articles. Such trends can positively influence the outcome of lifestyle-related chronic diseases, such as obesity and diabetes. Conclusions The lockdown associated with COVID-19 has largely had a negative impact on the lifestyles of individuals and communities across many countries and cultures. However, some individuals and communities also initiated positive lifestyle-related behavioral changes. If the knowledge generated by studying the impact of COVID-19-related lockdowns on the six lifestyle factors is further consolidated, it could improve chronic disease outcomes. This will help better understand lifestyle behaviors amidst crises and assist in redesigning extreme public health measures such as lockdowns.. It is up to governments, communities, and healthcare/academic entities to derive benefit from lessons learned from the pandemic, with the ultimate objective of better educating and promoting healthy lifestyles among communities.

                Behçet’s disease (BD) is rare in children. Herein, we report a case of 12-year-old male child with a history of left superficial femoral vein thrombosis and bilateral pulmonary embolism, admitted for multiple thrombosis located in the inferior vena cava, right atrium and ventricle associated with multiple pulmonary artery aneurisms and fissurations concomitant to oral aphthosis, which was suggestive of BD. Despite corticoids and immunosuppressive therapy, the child had a massive hemoptysis resulting in his death. The association between intracardiac thrombosis, pulmonary aneurism and venous thrombosis should raise suspicion of angio-Behçet, which could be lethal.

                Background The escalating impact of climate change underscores the critical need for advanced and sustainable climate forecasting techniques. This review examines the current state and future prospects of leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI) for climate forecasting, focusing on enhancing accuracy and identifying complex patterns in large datasets. Methods A systematic bibliometric methodology was employed, analyzing peer-reviewed literature from the past two decades. The study screened 455 articles from Scopus and Web of Science databases using specific keywords related to AI and weather forecasting. After removing duplicates and irrelevant studies, 218 articles were selected for detailed analysis. Bibliometric analysis was conducted using RStudio software to examine publication trends, co-word co-occurrence, and thematic evolution. Results The findings indicate significant growth in AI applications for climate forecasting, particularly from 2014 to 2023. AI techniques such as machine learning, artificial neural networks, and deep learning have shown promise in improving the accuracy of weather forecasts and early warning systems. The thematic analysis identified key themes like numerical weather prediction, feature selection, and neural networks as fundamental areas of research. Additionally, AI-based early warning systems for extreme weather events were highlighted as a crucial application. Below Figure 1. shows the graphical abstract of research Conclusions AI has the potential to significantly enhance climate forecasting by analyzing vast amounts of data and identifying complex patterns. Future research should focus on developing universal AI models, increasing model accuracy with explainable AI techniques, and integrating region-specific forecasts to aid decision-making in various sectors. Addressing ethical concerns and ensuring sustainable AI applications are essential for the responsible deployment of AI in climate forecasting.

                Background This study examines Muhammad Shahrur’s theory of limits and women’s issues. This theory adjusts the muhkamat verses to remain relevant to sociocultural conditions while remining within the jurisdiction of Allah SWT. Shahrur’s approach conveyed women as different from traditional ulemas and controversial. Therefore, it is necessary to describe Shahrur’s theory and interpretation of women’s issues. Methods This was an exploratory bibliographic study using descriptive-hermeneutic analysis. Two of Shahrur’s books were selected and five chapters from Al-Kitāb wa Al-Qur’ān, Qirā’ah Mu’āshirah and five chapters from Nahw Ushūl al-Jadīdah Li al-Fiqh al-Islāmy; Fiqh al-Mar’ah . Results Shahrur’s interpretations on women’s issues are: a) relationships between teenagers of the opposite sex without marriage or living together are “halal” if they follow their will without a contract and are accompanied by syecih, or permission; b) the maximum limit of the hijab is to cover the entire body except the face and palms. In contrast, the minimum limit covers the juyūb, including cleavage under the armpits, body parts, genitals, and buttocks. Apart from these, it does not include intimate parts and adapts to the community. c) Women’s intimate parts are shown only to the seven groups: brothers, fathers, children of a sibling, parents of one’s wives, and their children; d) Polygamy has both an upper limit and a lower limit. Shahrur allows polygamy under two conditions: widows with children whose husbands left them to protect them; polygamy has two limitations: a limit for quantity and a limit for quality; and e) the law of adultery has a lower and upper limit. Conclusion According to Shahrur, women’s issues are divided into four limits: sometimes they are at the upper limit and sometimes at the lower limit. Shahrur’s linguistic approach finally led him to draw the conclusion that the product of Islamic law is highly dependent on the sociocultural context.

                Background Haematological abnormalities following renal transplantation are frequently observed and have a significant effect on survival and graft outcomes. The pattern of haematological abnormalities varies globally. Few studies have been conducted in Asian countries. We aimed to evaluate the patterns of haematological abnormalities in post-transplant recipients in our center during the first year after post-renal transplant and the association of post-transplant anemia with graft function. Methods This single-center retrospective study was conducted on renal transplantation recipients between 2014 and 2019. The study included all patients who received kidney transplants from live/cadaveric donors and had follow-up data collected up to 12 months after the transplant. The outcome studied was the prevalence of haematological abnormalities and the association between post-transplant anemia (PTA) and graft function in post-transplant recipients. Results A total of 106 renal transplant recipients were included in the study. The prevalence of PTA was 98% in the first week, 75% at one month, 35% at three months, 32% at six months, and 27% at 12 months. The other cytopenia cases were leukopenia (43.4%), thrombocytopenia (33.2%), and pancytopenia (15.1%). Post-transplant erythrocytosis was observed in 17.9% of patients. 18 patients with severe PTA in the first week of transplant had significant allograft dysfunction (p=0.04). Patients with and without PTA had similar graft functions at six and 12 months (p=0.50). Conclusions Haematological abnormalities are common in renal transplant recipients. PTA is highly prevalent during the first week and improves over time. Other haematological abnormalities observed were leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, pancytopenia, and post-transplant erythrocytosis. Leucopenia was primarily drug-induced, and thrombocytopenia and pancytopenia were frequently caused by infections in our cohort. Additionally, severe PTA was significantly associated with graft dysfunction in the first week post-transplant, whereas similar graft function was observed at 6 and 12 months post-transplant, irrespective of the presence or absence of PTA.

                Introduction: The COVID-19 virus has impacted people worldwide, causing significant changes in their lifestyles. Since the emergence of the epidemic, attempts have begun to prepare a vaccine that can eliminate the virus and restore balance to life in the entire world. Over the past two years, countries and specialized companies have competed to obtain a license from the World Health Organization for the vaccines that were discovered. After the appearance of vaccines in the health community, comparisons and fears of their side effects began, but people don’t get an answer to the question of which is the best vaccine. Methods: IEEE Xplore, ScienceDirect, the New England Journal of Medicine, Google Scholar, and PubMed databases were searched for literature on the COVID-19 vaccine and its side effects. we surveyed the literature on the COVID-19 vaccine’s side effects and the sorts of side effects observed after vaccination. Depending on data from the literature, we compared these vaccines in terms of side effects, then we analyzed the gaps and obstacles of previous studies and made proposals to process these gaps in future studies. Results: Overall, 17 studies were included in this scoping systematic review as they fulfilled the criteria specified, the majority of which were cross-sectional and retrospective cross-sectional studies. Most of the side effects were mild, self-limiting, and common. Thus, they usually resolve within 1–3 days after vaccination. Factors associated with higher side effects included advanced age, allergic conditions, those taking other medications (particularly immunosuppressive ones), those with a history of type II diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, COVID-19 infection, and female sex. Our meta‐analyses also found that mRNA vaccines looked to be more effective, while inactivated vaccinations had fewer side effects. Conclusion: This review shows that the COVID-19 vaccine is safe to administer and induces protection.

                Wu et al. show that tandem duplications (TDs) are prevalent in root plants, especially trees, likely enabling resistance, defense, and detoxification against microbial pressure. This suggests a universally adaptive strategy shaped by interactions with subterranean microbes, defining the role of soil ecosystem in root plant genome evolution.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94916">Hippocampal-occipital connectivity reflects autobiographical memory deficits in aphantasia</a></h4>

              
                Aphantasia refers to reduced or absent visual imagery. While most of us can readily recall decade-old personal experiences (autobiographical memories, AM) with vivid mental images, there is a dearth of information about whether the loss of visual imagery in aphantasics affects their AM retrieval. The hippocampus is thought to be a crucial hub in a brain-wide network underlying AM. One important question is whether this network, especially the connectivity of the hippocampus, is altered in aphantasia. In the current study, we tested 14 congenital aphantasics and 16 demographically matched controls in an AM fMRI task to investigate how key brain regions (i.e. hippocampus and visual-perceptual cortices) interact with each other during AM re-experiencing. All participants were interviewed regarding their autobiographical memory to examine their episodic and semantic recall of specific events. Aphantasics reported more difficulties in recalling AM, were less confident about their memories, and described less internal and emotional details than controls. Neurally, aphantasics displayed decreased hippocampal and increased visual-perceptual cortex activation during AM retrieval compared to controls. In addition, controls showed strong negative functional connectivity between the hippocampus and the visual cortex during AM and resting-state functional connectivity between these two brain structures predicted better visualization skills. Our results indicate that visual mental imagery plays an important role in detail-rich vivid AM, and that this type of cognitive function is supported by the functional connection between the hippocampus and the visual-perceptual cortex.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90293">The deubiquitinase Ubp3/Usp10 constrains glucose-mediated mitochondrial repression via phosphate budgeting</a></h4>

              
                Many cells in high glucose repress mitochondrial respiration, as observed in the Crabtree and Warburg effects. Our understanding of biochemical constraints for mitochondrial activation is limited. Using a <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> screen, we identified the conserved deubiquitinase Ubp3 (Usp10), as necessary for mitochondrial repression. Ubp3 mutants have increased mitochondrial activity despite abundant glucose, along with decreased glycolytic enzymes, and a rewired glucose metabolic network with increased trehalose production. Utilizing <i>∆ubp3</i> cells, along with orthogonal approaches, we establish that the high glycolytic flux in glucose continuously consumes free Pi. This restricts mitochondrial access to inorganic phosphate (Pi), and prevents mitochondrial activation. Contrastingly, rewired glucose metabolism with enhanced trehalose production and reduced GAPDH (as in <i>∆ubp3</i> cells) restores Pi. This collectively results in increased mitochondrial Pi and derepression, while restricting mitochondrial Pi transport prevents activation. We therefore suggest that glycolytic flux-dependent intracellular Pi budgeting is a key constraint for mitochondrial repression.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97662">Muscle-resident mesenchymal progenitors sense and repair peripheral nerve injury via the GDNF-BDNF axis</a></h4>

              
                Fibro-adipogenic progenitors (FAPs) are muscle-resident mesenchymal progenitors that can contribute to muscle tissue homeostasis and regeneration, as well as postnatal maturation and lifelong maintenance of the neuromuscular system. Recently, traumatic injury to the peripheral nerve was shown to activate FAPs, suggesting that FAPs can respond to nerve injury. However, questions of how FAPs can sense the anatomically distant peripheral nerve injury and whether FAPs can directly contribute to nerve regeneration remained unanswered. Here, utilizing single-cell transcriptomics and mouse models, we discovered that a subset of FAPs expressing GDNF receptors <i>Ret</i> and <i>Gfra1</i> can respond to peripheral nerve injury by sensing GDNF secreted by Schwann cells. Upon GDNF sensing, this subset becomes activated and expresses <i>Bdnf</i>. FAP-specific inactivation of <i>Bdnf</i> (<i>Prrx1<sup>Cre</sup>; Bdnf<sup>fl/fl</sup></i>) resulted in delayed nerve regeneration owing to defective remyelination, indicating that GDNF-sensing FAPs play an important role in the remyelination process during peripheral nerve regeneration. In aged mice, significantly reduced <i>Bdnf</i> expression in FAPs was observed upon nerve injury, suggesting the clinical relevance of FAP-derived BDNF in the age-related delays in nerve regeneration. Collectively, our study revealed the previously unidentified role of FAPs in peripheral nerve regeneration, and the molecular mechanism behind FAPs’ response to peripheral nerve injury.

	<p>Background/Objectives: This study aimed to investigate the acute effects of a single session of a VR exergame (Beat Saber) and a VR nature video (Ireland 4K) on attentional performance, using the Flanker and Attentional Blink (AB) tasks. The objective was to assess whether these VR interventions could enhance attentional control, as measured by improvements in response times and accuracy. Methods: A total of 39 psychology students, aged 19&amp;amp;ndash;25, were randomly assigned to one of three groups: VR exergame, VR nature video, or control. Participants completed the Flanker and AB tasks before and after the intervention. A repeated measures design was employed to analyze changes in response times and accuracy across pre- and post-test sessions. Results: The study revealed significant improvements in response times and accuracy across all groups in the post-test measures, indicating a strong training effect. In the AB task, shorter stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) led to decreased accuracy and slower response times, emphasizing the difficulty in processing closely spaced targets. The interaction between Type and Group in response times for target stimuli suggested that the intervention types differentially influenced processing speed in specific conditions. Conclusions: The findings suggest that while brief VR interventions did not produce significant differences between groups, the training effect observed highlights the influence of task-specific factors such as SOA and target presence. Further research is needed to explore whether longer or repeated VR sessions, as well as the optimization of task-specific parameters, might lead to more pronounced cognitive benefits.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Increasing evidence shows an involvement of brain plasticity mechanisms in both motor and central manifestations of neuromuscular disorders (NMDs). These mechanisms could be specifically addressed with neuromodulation or rehabilitation protocols. The aim of this scoping review is to summarise the evidence on plasticity mechanisms&amp;amp;rsquo; involvement in NMDs to encourage future research. Methods: A scoping review was conducted searching the PubMed and Scopus electronic databases. We selected papers addressing brain plasticity and central nervous system (CNS) studies through non-invasive brain stimulation techniques in myopathies, muscular dystrophies, myositis and spinal muscular atrophy. Results: A total of 49 papers were selected for full-text examination. Regardless of the variety of pathogenetic and clinical characteristics of NMDs, studies show widespread changes in intracortical inhibition mechanisms, as well as disruptions in glutamatergic and GABAergic transmission, resulting in altered brain plasticity. Therapeutic interventions with neurostimulation techniques, despite being conducted only anecdotally or on small samples, show promising results; Conclusions: despite challenges posed by the rarity and heterogeneity of NMDs, recent evidence suggests that synaptic plasticity may play a role in the pathogenesis of various muscular diseases, affecting not only central symptoms but also strength and fatigue. Key questions remain unanswered about the role of plasticity and its potential as a therapeutic target. As disease-modifying therapies advance, understanding CNS involvement in NMDs could lead to more tailored treatments.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: This study investigates the relationship between movement-related beta synchrony and primary motor cortex (M1) excitability, focusing on the time-dependent inhibition of movement. Voluntary movement induces beta frequency (13&amp;amp;ndash;30 Hz) event-related desynchronisation (B-ERD) in M1, followed by post-movement beta rebound (PMBR). Although PMBR is linked to cortical inhibition, its temporal relationship with motor cortical excitability is unclear. This study aims to determine whether PMBR acts as a marker for post-movement inhibition by assessing motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) during distinct phases of the beta synchrony profile. Methods: Twenty-five right-handed participants (mean age: 24 years) were recruited. EMG data were recorded from the first dorsal interosseous muscle, and TMS was applied to the M1 motor hotspot to evoke MEPs. A reaction time task was used to elicit beta oscillations, with TMS delivered at participant-specific time points based on EEG-derived beta power envelopes. MEP amplitudes were compared across four phases: B-ERD, early PMBR, peak PMBR, and late PMBR. Results: Our findings demonstrate that MEP amplitude significantly increased during B-ERD compared to rest, indicating heightened cortical excitability. In contrast, MEPs recorded during peak PMBR were significantly reduced, suggesting cortical inhibition. While all three PMBR phases exhibited reduced cortical excitability, a trend toward amplitude-dependent inhibition was observed. Conclusions: This study confirms that PMBR is linked to reduced cortical excitability, validating its role as a marker of motor cortical inhibition. These results enhance the understanding of beta oscillations in motor control and suggest that further research on altered PMBR could be crucial for understanding neurological and psychiatric disorders.</p>

	<p>Objective: We investigated the effect of high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) on intracranial aneurysms (IAs) by analyzing single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) based on genome-wide association study (GWAS) data. HMGB1 mRNA and protein expression levels in plasma were also analyzed. Methods: This study was a comprehensive analysis of a GWAS dataset, including 250 patients with IAs and 294 controls. The HMGB1 gene region was targeted within SNP rs3742305 &amp;amp;plusmn; 10 kbp. Multivariate logistic regression analysis determined its association with IAs after adjusting for relevant clinical factors. HMGB1 mRNA expression was analyzed in the plasma of 24 patients selected from the GWAS dataset. The HMGB1 protein was analyzed by Western blotting. Results: A total of seven polymorphisms, including rs1360485, rs185382445, rs2039338, rs1045411, rs3742305, rs2249825, and rs189034241, were observed. Two SNPs, including rs1045411 (UTR-3) and rs3742305 (intron), showed strong linkage disequilibrium (r2 = 0.99). However, none of the seven SNPs associated with IAs had an adjusted p-value of &amp;amp;lt; 0.0016 on multiple comparison analysis. HMGB1 mRNA levels (2&amp;amp;minus;&amp;amp;Delta;Ct) did not differ significantly between patients with IAs and the control subjects [1.07 (1.00&amp;amp;ndash;1.15) in patients with IAs vs. 1.05 (0.94&amp;amp;ndash;1.12) in controls; p = 0.67)]. Also, no significant difference in the degree of plasma HMGB1 protein expression was seen between the two groups (p = 0.82). Conclusions: The number of SNPs associated with HMGB1 and the degree of HMGB1 mRNA and protein expression were not significantly different between patients diagnosed with IAs and the controls.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Detailed morphometric analysis of an aneurysm and the related vascular bifurcation are critical factors when determining rupture risk and planning treatment for unruptured intracranial aneurysms (UIAs). The standard visualization of digital subtraction angiography (DSA) and its 3D reconstruction on a 2D monitor provide precise measurements but are subject to variability based on the rater. Visualization using virtual (VR) and augmented reality platforms can overcome those limitations. It is, however, unclear whether accurate measurements of the aneurysm and adjacent arterial branches can be obtained on VR models. This study aimed to assess interrater reliability and compare measurements between 3D VR, standard 2D DSA, and 3D DSA reconstructions, evaluating the reliability and accuracy of 3D VR as a measurement tool. Methods: A pool of five neurosurgeons performed three individual analyses on each of the ten UIA cases, measuring them in completely immersed 3D VR and the standard on-screen format (2D DSA and 3D reconstruction). This resulted in three independent measurements per modality for each case. Interrater reliability of measurements and morphology characterization, comparative differences, measurement duration, and VR user experience were assessed. Results: Interrater reliability for 3D VR measurements was significantly higher than for 3D DSA measurements (3D VR mean intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC]: 0.69 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.22 vs. 3D DSA mean ICC: 0.36 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.37, p = 0.042). No significant difference was observed between 3D VR and 2D DSA (3D VR mean ICC: 0.69 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.22 vs. 2D DSA mean ICC: 0.43 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.31, p = 0.12). A linear mixed-effects model showed no effect of 3D VR and 3D DSA (95% CI = &amp;amp;minus;0.26&amp;amp;ndash;0.28, p = 0.96) or 3D VR and 2D DSA (95% CI = &amp;amp;minus;0.02&amp;amp;ndash;0.53, p = 0.066) on absolute measurements of the aneurysm in the anteroposterior, mediolateral, and craniocaudal dimensions. Conclusions: 3D VR technology allows for reproducible, accurate, and reliable measurements comparable to measurements performed on a 2D screen. It may also potentially improve precision for measurements of non-planar aneurysm dimensions.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Headaches in Moyamoya angiopathy are common but poorly understood. We aimed to investigate if headaches in Moyamoya angiopathy improve after revascularization surgery and whether this is associated with improvement in cerebrovascular reactivity on MRI (CVR-MRI). Methods: We included consecutive adult patients with Moyamoya angiopathy who had chart data on headaches, CVR-MRI, and underwent extracranial&amp;amp;ndash;intracranial bypass surgery between January 2010 and September 2022 at a tertiary neurovascular referral center. Clinical and CVR-MR imaging data of all patients were collected through systematic chart review, complemented by standard-of-care headache questionnaires from patients who were operated between 2018 and 2022. We evaluated headache features and explored the association between headaches and CVR before and after revascularization surgery. Results: Fifty-nine patients were included (mean age 47 &amp;amp;plusmn; 14 years, 43 females (73%)); among them, 41/59 (69%) reported headaches pre-surgery. Headache improved in 28/41 (68%) patients after revascularization surgery with a reduction in pain severity (median VAS-score from 5/10 to 2.5/10; p = 0.002), analgesic use (from 84% to 40%; p = 0.007), and sick leave (from 60% to 16%; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Improvement in headaches was associated with improvement in CVR (OR 5.3; 95% CI: 1.2&amp;amp;ndash;23.5) and sick leave reduction (OR 1.4; 95% CI: 1.6&amp;amp;ndash;121.4). Conclusions: Headaches in Moyamoya angiopathy are common and disabling. They may improve in most patients after revascularization surgery and seem to be associated with improvement in CVR, supporting the hypothesis of a potential vascular origin of the headaches.</p>

	<p>Background: Recent evidence in systems neuroscience suggests that lighting conditions affect the whole chain of brain processing, from retina to high-level cortical networks, for perceptual and cognitive function. Here, visual adaptation levels to three different environmental lighting conditions, (1) darkness, (2) daylight, and (3) prolonged exposure to very bright light akin to sunlight, were simulated in lab to investigate the effects of light adaptation levels on classic cases of subjective contrast, assimilation, and contrast-induced relative depth in achromatic, i.e., ON&amp;amp;ndash;OFF pathway mediated visual configurations. Methods: After adaptation/exposure to a given lighting condition, configurations were shown in grouped and ungrouped conditions in random order to healthy young humans in computer-controlled two-alternative forced-choice procedures that consisted of deciding, as quickly as possible, which of two background patterns in a given configuration of achromatic contrast appeared lighter, or which of two foreground patterns appeared to stand out in front, as if it were nearer to the observer. Results: We found a statistically significant effect of the adaptation levels on the consciously perceived subjective contrast (F(2,23) = 20.73; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) and the relative depth (F(2,23) = 12.67; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), a statistically significant interaction between the adaptation levels and the grouping factor (F(2,23) = 4.73; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05) on subjective contrast, and a statistically significant effect of the grouping factor on the relative depth (F(2,23) = 13.71; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01). Conclusions: Visual adaption to different lighting conditions significantly alters the conscious perception of contrast and assimilation, classically linked to non-linear functional synergies between ON and OFF processing channels in the visual brain, and modulates the repeatedly demonstrated effectiveness of luminance contrast as a depth cue; the physically brighter pattern regions in the configurations are no longer consistently perceived as nearer to a conscious observer under daylight and extreme bright light adapted (rod-saturated) conditions.</p>

                <p>Conscious reportability of visual input is associated with a bimodal neural response in the primary visual cortex (V1): an early-latency response coupled to stimulus features and a late-latency response coupled to stimulus report or detection. This late wave of activity, central to major theories of consciousness, is thought to be driven by the prefrontal cortex (PFC), responsible for "igniting" it. Here we analyzed two electrophysiological studies in mice performing different stimulus detection tasks and characterized neural activity profiles in three key cortical regions: V1, posterior parietal cortex (PPC), and PFC. We then developed a minimal network model, constrained by known connectivity between these regions, reproducing the spatiotemporal propagation of visual- and report-related activity. Remarkably, while PFC was indeed necessary to generate report-related activity in V1, this occurred only through the mediation of PPC. PPC, and not PFC, had the final veto in enabling the report-related late wave of V1 activity.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/39/e0116242024?rss=1">Dense and Persistent Odor Representations in the Olfactory Bulb of Awake Mice</a></h4>

              
                <p>Recording and analysis of neural activity are often biased toward detecting sparse subsets of highly active neurons, masking important signals carried in low-magnitude and variable responses. To investigate the contribution of seemingly noisy activity to odor encoding, we used mesoscale calcium imaging from mice of both sexes to record odor responses from the dorsal surface of bilateral olfactory bulbs (OBs). The outer layer of the mouse OB is comprised of dendrites organized into discrete "glomeruli," which are defined by odor receptor-specific sensory neuron input. We extracted activity from a large population of glomeruli and used logistic regression to classify odors from individual trials with high accuracy. We then used add-in and dropout analyses to determine subsets of glomeruli necessary and sufficient for odor classification. Classifiers successfully predicted odor identity even after excluding sparse, highly active glomeruli, indicating that odor information is redundantly represented across a large population of glomeruli. Additionally, we found that random forest (RF) feature selection informed by Gini inequality (RF Gini impurity, RFGI) reliably ranked glomeruli by their contribution to overall odor classification. RFGI provided a measure of "feature importance" for each glomerulus that correlated with intuitive features like response magnitude. Finally, in agreement with previous work, we found that odor information persists in glomerular activity after the odor offset. Together, our findings support a model of OB odor coding where sparse activity is sufficient for odor identification, but information is widely, redundantly available across a large population of glomeruli, with each glomerulus representing information about more than one odor.</p>

                <p>Oligodendrocyte myelination and remyelination after injury are intricately regulated by various intrinsic and extrinsic factors, including transcriptional regulators. Among these, the zinc-finger protein ZFP488 is an oligodendrocyte-enriched transcriptional regulator that promotes oligodendrocyte differentiation in the developing neural tube and in oligodendroglial cell lines. However, the specific in vivo genetic requirements for ZFP488 during oligodendrocyte development and remyelination have not been defined. To address this gap, we generated a lineage-traceable <I>ZFP488</I> knock-out mouse line, wherein an <I>H2b-GFP</I> reporter replaces the <I>ZFP488</I>-coding region. Using these mice of either sex, we examined the dynamics of <I>ZFP488</I> expression from the endogenous promoter in the developing central nervous system (CNS). We observed a unique expression pattern in the oligodendrocyte lineage, with <I>ZFP488</I> expression particularly enriched in differentiated oligodendrocytes. ZFP488 loss resulted in delayed myelination in the developing CNS and impaired remyelination after demyelinating injury in the brain. Integrated transcriptomic and genomic profiling further revealed that ZFP488 loss decreased the expression of myelination-associated genes but not oligodendrocyte progenitor&ndash;associated genes, suggesting that ZFP488 serves as a positive regulator of myelination by regulating maturation programs. Thus, our genetic loss-of-function study revealed that ZFP488 regulates a stage-dependent differentiation program that controls the timing of CNS myelination and remyelination.</p>

                <p>Nerve injury can induce aberrant changes in the spine; these changes are due to, or at least partly governed by, transcription factors that contribute to the genesis of neuropathic allodynia. Here, we showed that spinal nerve ligation (SNL, a clinical neuropathic allodynia model) increased the expression of the transcription factor Tbx5 in the injured dorsal horn in male Sprague Dawley rats. In contrast, blocking this upregulation alleviated SNL-induced mechanical allodynia, and there was no apparent effect on locomotor function. Moreover, SNL-induced Tbx5 upregulation promoted the recruitment and interaction of GATA4 and Brd4 by enhancing its binding activity to H3K9Ac, which was enriched at the <I>Trpv1</I> promotor, leading to an increase in TRPV1 transcription and the development of neuropathic allodynia. In addition, nerve injury-induced expression of Fbxo3, which abates Fbxl2-dependent Tbx5 ubiquitination, promoted the subsequent Tbx5-dependent epigenetic modification of TRPV1 expression during SNL-induced neuropathic allodynia. Collectively, our findings indicated that spinal Tbx5-dependent TRPV1 transcription signaling contributes to the development of neuropathic allodynia via Fbxo3-dependent Fbxl2 ubiquitination and degradation. Thus, we propose a potential medical treatment strategy for neuropathic allodynia by targeting Tbx5.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/39/e0542242024?rss=1">A Multidimensional Neural Representation of Face Impressions</a></h4>

              
                <p>From a glimpse of a face, people form trait impressions that operate as facial stereotypes, which are largely inaccurate yet nevertheless drive social behavior. Behavioral studies have long pointed to dimensions of trustworthiness and dominance that are thought to underlie face impressions due to their evolutionarily adaptive nature. Using human neuroimaging (<I>N </I>= 26, 19 female, 7 male), we identify a two-dimensional representation of faces&rsquo; inferred traits in the middle temporal gyrus (MTG), a region involved in domain-general conceptual processing including the activation of social concepts. The similarity of neural-response patterns for any given pair of faces in the bilateral MTG was predicted by their proximity in trustworthiness&ndash;dominance space, an effect that could not be explained by mere visual similarity. This MTG trait-space representation occurred automatically, was relatively invariant across participants, and did not depend on the explicit endorsement of face impressions (i.e., beliefs that face impressions are valid and accurate). In contrast, regions involved in high-level social reasoning (the bilateral temporoparietal junction and posterior superior temporal sulcus; TPJ&ndash;pSTS) and entity-specific social knowledge (the left anterior temporal lobe; ATL) also exhibited this trait-space representation but only among participants who explicitly endorsed forming these impressions. Together, the findings identify a two-dimensional neural representation of face impressions and suggest that multiple implicit and explicit mechanisms give rise to biases based on facial appearance. While the MTG implicitly represents a multidimensional trait space for faces, the TPJ&ndash;pSTS and ATL are involved in the explicit application of this trait space for social evaluation and behavior.</p>

                <p>Dopamine (DA) neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) respond to motivationally relevant cues, and circuit-specific signaling drives different aspects of motivated behavior. Orexin (ox; also known as hypocretin) and dynorphin (dyn) are coexpressed lateral hypothalamic (LH) neuropeptides that project to the VTA. These peptides have opposing effects on the firing activity of VTA<sup>DA</sup> neurons via orexin 1 (Ox1R) or kappa opioid (KOR) receptors. Given that Ox1R activation increases VTA<sup>DA</sup> firing, and KOR decreases firing, it is unclear how the coreleased peptides contribute to the net activity of DA neurons. We tested if optical stimulation of LH<SUB>ox/dyn</SUB> neuromodulates VTA<sup>DA</sup> neuronal activity via peptide release and if the effects of optically driven LH<SUB>ox/dyn</SUB> release segregate based on VTA<sup>DA</sup> projection targets including the basolateral amygdala (BLA) or the lateral or medial shell of the nucleus accumbens (lAcbSh, mAchSh). Using a combination of circuit tracing, optogenetics, and patch-clamp electrophysiology in male and female orexin<sup>cre</sup> mice, we showed a diverse response of LH<SUB>ox/dyn</SUB> optical stimulation on VTA<sup>DA</sup> neuronal firing, which is not mediated by fast transmitter release and is blocked by antagonists to KOR and Ox1R signaling. Additionally, where optical stimulation of LH<SUB>ox/dyn</SUB> inputs in the VTA inhibited firing of the majority of BLA-projecting VTA<sup>DA</sup> neurons, optical stimulation of LH<SUB>ox/dyn</SUB> inputs in the VTA bidirectionally affects firing of either lAcbSh- or mAchSh-projecting VTA<sup>DA</sup> neurons. These findings indicate that LH<SUB>ox/dyn</SUB> corelease may influence the output of the VTA by balancing ensembles of neurons within each population which contribute to different aspects of reward seeking.</p>

                <p>Growth-associated protein of 43&nbsp;kDa (GAP43) is a key cytoskeleton-associated component of the presynaptic terminal that facilitates neuroplasticity. Downregulation of GAP43 expression has been associated to various psychiatric conditions in humans and evokes hippocampus-dependent memory impairments in mice. Despite the extensive studies conducted on hippocampal GAP43 in past decades, however, very little is known about its roles in modulating the excitatory versus inhibitory balance in other brain regions. We recently generated conditional knock-out mice in which the <I>Gap43</I> gene was selectively inactivated in either telencephalic glutamatergic neurons (<I>Gap43<sup>fl/fl</sup></I>;<I>Nex1<sup>Cre</sup></I> mice, hereafter Glu-GAP43<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice) or forebrain GABAergic neurons (<I>Gap43<sup>fl/fl</sup></I>;<I>Dlx5/6<sup>Cre</sup></I> mice, hereafter GABA-GAP43<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice). Here, we show that Glu-GAP43<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> but not GABA-GAP43<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice of either sex show a striking hyperactive phenotype when exposed to a novel environment. This behavioral alteration of Glu-GAP43<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice was linked to a selective activation of dorsal-striatum neurons, as well as to an enhanced corticostriatal glutamatergic transmission and an abrogation of corticostriatal endocannabinoid-mediated long-term depression. In line with these observations, GAP43 was abundantly expressed in corticostriatal glutamatergic terminals of wild-type mice. The novelty-induced hyperactive phenotype of Glu-GAP43<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice was abrogated by chemogenetically inhibiting corticostriatal afferences with a G<SUB>i</SUB>-coupled "designer receptor exclusively activated by designer drugs" (DREADDs), thus further supporting that novelty-induced activity is controlled by GAP43 at corticostriatal excitatory projections. Taken together, these findings show an unprecedented regulatory role of GAP43 in the corticostriatal circuitry and provide a new mouse model with a delimited neuronal-circuit alteration for studying novelty-induced hyperactivity, a phenotypic shortfall that occurs in diverse psychiatric diseases.</p>

                <p>Understanding how spontaneous brain activity influences the response to neurostimulation is crucial for the development of neurotherapeutics and brain&ndash;computer interfaces. Localized brain activity is suggested to influence the response to neurostimulation, but whether fast-fluctuating (i.e., tens of milliseconds) large-scale brain dynamics also have any such influence is unknown. By stimulating the prefrontal cortex using combined transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and electroencephalography, we examined how dynamic global brain state patterns, as defined by microstates, influence the magnitude of the evoked brain response. TMS applied during what resembled the canonical Microstate C was found to induce a greater evoked response for up to 80&nbsp;ms compared with other microstates. This effect was found in a repeated experimental session, was absent during sham stimulation, and was replicated in an independent dataset. Ultimately, ongoing and fast-fluctuating global brain states, as probed by microstates, may be associated with intrinsic fluctuations in connectivity and excitation&ndash;inhibition balance and influence the neurostimulation outcome. We suggest that the fast-fluctuating global brain states be considered when developing any related paradigms.</p>

                <p>Circadian rhythms in conditioned threat extinction emerge from a tissue-level circadian timekeeper, or local clock, in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). Yet it remains unclear how this local clock contributes to extinction-dependent adaptations. Here we used single-unit and local field potential analyses to interrogate neural activity in the male rat vmPFC during repeated extinction sessions at different times of day. In association with superior recall of a remote extinction memory during the circadian active phase, vmPFC putative principal neurons exhibited phasic firing that was amplified for cue presentations and diminished at transitions in freezing behavior. Coupling of vmPFC gamma amplitude to the phase of low-frequency oscillations was greater during freezing than mobility, and this difference was augmented during the active phase, highlighting a time-of-day dependence in the organization of freezing- versus mobility-associated cell assemblies. Additionally, a greater proportion of vmPFC neurons were phase-locked to low-frequency oscillations during the active phase, consistent with heightened neural excitability at this time of day. Our results suggest that daily fluctuations in vmPFC excitability precipitate enhanced neural recruitment into extinction-based cell assemblies during the active phase, providing a potential mechanism by which the vmPFC local clock modulates circuit and behavioral plasticity during conditioned threat extinction.</p>

                <p>Communication in the form of nonverbal, social vocalization, or crying is evolutionary conserved in mammals and is impaired early in human infants that are later diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Defects in infant vocalization have been proposed as an early sign of ASD that may exacerbate ASD development. However, the neural mechanisms associated with early communicative deficits in ASD are not known. Here, we expressed a constitutively active mutant of Rheb (Rheb<sup>S16H</sup>), which is known to upregulate two ASD core pathways, mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and ERK1/2, in Layer (L) 2/3 pyramidal neurons of the neocortex of mice of either sex. We found that cellular mosaic expression of Rheb<sup>S16H</sup> in L2/3 pyramidal neurons altered the production of isolation calls from neonatal mice. This was accompanied by an expected misplacement of neurons and dendrite overgrowth, along with an unexpected increase in spine density and length, which was associated with increased excitatory synaptic activity. This contrasted with the known decrease in spine density in Rheb<sup>S16H</sup> neurons of 1-month-old mice. Reducing the levels of the actin cross-linking and adaptor protein filamin A (FLNA), known to be increased downstream of ERK1/2, attenuated dendrite overgrowth and fully restored spine properties, synaptic connectivity, and the production of pup isolation calls. These findings suggest that upper-layer cortical pyramidal neurons contribute to communicative deficits in a condition known to affect two core ASD pathways and that these mechanisms are regulated by FLNA.</p>

                <p>The lateral habenula (LHb) has emerged as a pivotal brain region implicated in depression, displaying hyperactivity in human and animal models of depression. While the role of LHb efferents in depressive disorders has been acknowledged, the specific synaptic alterations remain elusive. Here, employing optogenetics, retrograde tracing, and ex vivo whole-cell patch-clamp techniques, we investigated synaptic transmission in male mice subjected to chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) at three major LHb neuronal outputs: the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), the ventral tegmental area (VTA), and the rostromedial tegmental nucleus (RMTg). Our findings uncovered distinct synaptic adaptations in LHb efferent circuits in response to CSDS. Specifically, CSDS induced in susceptible mice postsynaptic potentiation and postsynaptic depression at the DRN and VTA neurons, respectively, receiving excitatory inputs from the LHb, while CSDS altered presynaptic transmission at the LHb terminals in RMTg in both susceptible and resilient mice. Moreover, whole-cell recordings at projection-defined LHb neurons indicate decreased spontaneous activity in VTA-projecting LHb neurons, accompanied by an imbalance in excitatory&ndash;inhibitory inputs at the RMTg-projecting LHb neurons. Collectively, these novel findings underscore the circuit-specific alterations in LHb efferents following chronic social stress, shedding light on potential synaptic adaptations underlying stress-induced depressive-like states.</p>

Methods Utilizing a systematic literature review methodology, the study adopts the PRISMA approach to identify 26 pertinent articles from a pool of 340 papers obtained through a SCOPUS database search. These papers were published between 2019 and 2024 and were retrieved using the keywords (‘digitalization OR digital AND servitization OR servitization’). The selection process involved scrutinizing titles, abstracts, and keywords based on predefined criteria. Results The findings reveal that current digital servitization research emphasizes five determinant variables: digitization, servitization, manufacturing servitization, process innovation, and product innovation. Additionally, response variables influenced by digital servitization were identified, including firm competitiveness, firm performance, financial performance, firm profitability, and sustainable performance. Discussion The results of this review point to inconsistencies, underscoring the necessity for additional research into the factors influencing digital servitization across companies beyond the manufacturing sector. This highlights the importance of gaining a deeper understanding of digital servitization strategies and their impacts across various industries. By expanding the scope of research to include a broader range of sectors, researchers can provide more comprehensive insights into the complexities and nuances of digital servitization adoption. This broader perspective enables a more thorough examination of the challenges and opportunities associated with implementing digital servitization strategies, ultimately contributing to a richer understanding of its implications for businesses across diverse industries.

                <p>by Adrielli Tina Lopes Rego, Joshua Snell, Martijn Meeter</p>

Although word predictability is commonly considered an important factor in reading, sophisticated accounts of predictability in theories of reading are lacking. Computational models of reading traditionally use cloze norming as a proxy of word predictability, but what cloze norms precisely capture remains unclear. This study investigates whether large language models (LLMs) can fill this gap. Contextual predictions are implemented via a novel parallel-graded mechanism, where all predicted words at a given position are pre-activated as a function of contextual certainty, which varies dynamically as text processing unfolds. Through reading simulations with OB1-reader, a cognitive model of word recognition and eye-movement control in reading, we compare the model’s fit to eye-movement data when using predictability values derived from a cloze task against those derived from LLMs (GPT-2 and LLaMA). Root Mean Square Error between simulated and human eye movements indicates that LLM predictability provides a better fit than cloze. This is the first study to use LLMs to augment a cognitive model of reading with higher-order language processing while proposing a mechanism on the interplay between word predictability and eye movements.
