	<p>Deep learning (DL) has been demonstrated to be a valuable tool for classifying state of disorders of consciousness (DOC) using EEG signals. However, the performance of the DL-based DOC state classification is often challenged by the limited size of EEG datasets. To overcome this issue, we introduce multiple open-source EEG datasets to increase data volume and train a novel multi-task pre-training Transformer model named MutaPT. Furthermore, we propose a cross-distribution self-supervised (CDS) pre-training strategy to enhance the model&amp;amp;rsquo;s generalization ability, addressing data distribution shifts across multiple datasets. An EEG dataset of DOC patients is used to validate the effectiveness of our methods for the task of classifying DOC states. Experimental results show the superiority of our MutaPT over several DL models for EEG classification.</p>

                Cholinergic urticaria (CholU) is a rare condition characterized by itchy hives in the form of 1-4 mm small, raised wheals on skin, which are short-lived for duration of 15 to 20 minutes; they are caused by stimuli associated with sweating such as from physical exercise. CholU is also known as cholinergic angioedema urticaria. Hereby, we present a case report of a 42-year-old male with ChoIU who presented with systemic manifestation in the form of recurrent attacks of syncope. Diagnosis was made after a detailed history taking and all cardiac and neurological evaluations done that were normal, and widespread literature research was done to rule out other causes of syncope as systemic symptoms are rarely seen in ChoIU. His IgE antibodies levels were highly increased. He was managed with nonsedating antihistamines and health education regarding the rare condition.

                <p>-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the principal inhibitory neurotransmitter in the adult brain which mediates its rapid effects on neuronal excitability via ionotropic GABA<SUB>A</SUB> receptors. GABA levels in the brain are critically dependent upon GABA-aminotransferase (GABA-AT) which promotes its degradation. Vigabatrin, a low-affinity GABA-AT inhibitor, exhibits anticonvulsant efficacy, but its use is limited due to cumulative ocular toxicity. OV329 is a rationally designed, next-generation GABA-AT inhibitor with enhanced potency. We demonstrate that sustained exposure to OV329 in mice reduces GABA-AT activity and subsequently elevates GABA levels in the brain. Parallel increases in the efficacy of GABAergic inhibition were evident, together with elevations in electroencephalographic delta power. Consistent with this, OV329 exposure reduced the severity of status epilepticus and the development of benzodiazepine refractory seizures. Thus, OV329 may be of utility in treating seizure disorders and associated pathologies that result from neuronal hyperexcitability.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/11/7/ENEURO.0190-24.2024?rss=1">Persistent Interruption in Parvalbumin-Positive Inhibitory Interneurons: Biophysical and Mathematical Mechanisms</a></h4>

              
                <p>Persistent activity in excitatory pyramidal cells (PYRs) is a putative mechanism for maintaining memory traces during working memory. We have recently demonstrated persistent interruption of firing in fast-spiking parvalbumin-expressing interneurons (PV-INs), a phenomenon that could serve as a substrate for persistent activity in PYRs through disinhibition lasting hundreds of milliseconds. Here, we find that hippocampal CA1 PV-INs exhibit type 2 excitability, like striatal and neocortical PV-INs. Modeling and mathematical analysis showed that the slowly inactivating potassium current K<SUB>V</SUB>1 contributes to type 2 excitability, enables the multiple firing regimes observed experimentally in PV-INs, and provides a mechanism for robust persistent interruption of firing. Using a fast/slow separation of times scales approach with the K<SUB>V</SUB>1 inactivation variable as a bifurcation parameter shows that the initial inhibitory stimulus stops repetitive firing by moving the membrane potential trajectory onto a coexisting stable fixed point corresponding to a nonspiking quiescent state. As K<SUB>V</SUB>1 inactivation decays, the trajectory follows the branch of stable fixed points until it crosses a subcritical Hopf bifurcation (HB) and then spirals out into repetitive firing. In a model describing entorhinal cortical PV-INs without K<SUB>V</SUB>1, interruption of firing could be achieved by taking advantage of the bistability inherent in type 2 excitability based on a subcritical HB, but the interruption was not robust to noise. Persistent interruption of firing is therefore broadly applicable to PV-INs in different brain regions but is only made robust to noise in the presence of a slow variable, K<SUB>V</SUB>1 inactivation.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/11/7/ENEURO.0255-24.2024?rss=1">Motor Control of Distinct Layer 6 Corticothalamic Feedback Circuits</a></h4>

              
                <p>Layer 6 corticothalamic (L6 CT) neurons provide massive input to the thalamus, and these feedback connections enable the cortex to influence its own sensory input by modulating thalamic excitability. However, the functional role(s) feedback serves during sensory processing is unclear. One hypothesis is that CT feedback is under the control of extrasensory signals originating from higher-order cortical areas, yet we know nothing about the mechanisms of such control. It is also unclear whether such regulation is specific to CT neurons with distinct thalamic connectivity. Using mice (either sex) combined with in vitro electrophysiology techniques, optogenetics, and retrograde labeling, we describe studies of vibrissal primary motor cortex (vM1) influences on different CT neurons in the vibrissal primary somatosensory cortex (vS1) with distinct intrathalamic axonal projections. We found that vM1 inputs are highly selective, evoking stronger postsynaptic responses in CT neurons projecting to the dual ventral posterior medial nucleus (VPm) and posterior medial nucleus (POm) located in lower L6a than VPm-only&ndash;projecting CT cells in upper L6a. A targeted analysis of the specific cells and synapses involved revealed that the greater responsiveness of Dual CT neurons was due to their distinctive intrinsic membrane properties and synaptic mechanisms. These data demonstrate that vS1 has at least two discrete L6 CT subcircuits distinguished by their thalamic projection patterns, intrinsic physiology, and functional connectivity with vM1. Our results also provide insights into how a distinct CT subcircuit may serve specialized roles specific to contextual modulation of tactile-related sensory signals in the somatosensory thalamus during active vibrissa movements.</p>

                <p>Microglia carry out important functions as the resident macrophages of the brain. To study their role in health and disease, the research community needs tools to genetically modify them with maximum completeness in a manner that distinguishes them from closely related cell types, such as monocytes. While currently available tamoxifen-inducible CreERT2 lines can achieve the differentiation from other cells, the field needs improved and publicly available constitutively active Cre lines, especially ones with favorable efficiency and specificity profiles for studies where high recombination efficiency is imperative and where tamoxifen administration is contraindicated. Here, we leverage the microglia-specific <I>Fcrls</I> gene to generate mice expressing Cre. Using genomic methods, we show correct positioning of the transgene and intact microglia homeostasis in <I>Fcrls-2A-Cre</I> mice. Crossing <I>Fcrls-2A-Cre</I> mice to four different reporters, we demonstrate highly efficient recombination in microglia across differentially sensitive loxP alleles in different genomic contexts, indicating robust applicability of the line. Further, we show that microglia recombine a loxP reporter during early embryonic development, supporting the use of the line for developmental studies. Finally, using immunofluorescence and flow cytometry, we reveal that most border-associated macrophages are also targeted whereas only few liver and spleen macrophages and virtually no white blood cell subsets exhibit Cre activity, distinguishing this line from another publicly available Cre line, <I>Cx3cr1-Cre<sup>M</sup></I>. <I>Fcrls-2A-Cre</I> mice are immediately available (JAX #036591) and serve as a valuable addition to the community's microglia toolbox by providing highly efficient constitutive Cre activity with excellent specificity, particularly for studies where tamoxifen administration is undesirable.</p>

                Background Patients with Metastatic Bone Disease (MBD) often present with complaints of pain and multiple osteolytic lesions findings. Remarkably, 30% of these cases exhibit an undetected primary lesion. Hence, categorizing them as MBD of unknown origin. The diagnostic processes of patients with MBD of unknown origin typically takes up to four months, rendering it as a catastrophic disease with the second-highest financial burden. Given its urgency, it is necessary to develop a evidence-based consensus for managing cases of MBD with an unknown origin. Purpose This study aimed to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of treating patients with MBD of unknown origin through the application of the INA-MBD algorithm. Research method A quasi-experimental study with a pretest and post-test design was conducted with a total of 128 patients who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The patients were consecutively enrolled and categorized into two groups: the intervention group with the INA-MBD algorithm and the non-intervention group without the INA-MBD algorithm. The primary outcomes were the cost and time to diagnose MBD of unknown origin. The proposed measuring tool was the INA-MBD algorithm. Furthermore, for the cost-to-diagnosis variable, an extra measurement tool was used, which were summaries of the patient’s medical bill including hospital stays and medical procedures. The analysis of data related to the time-to-diagnosis variable was conducted using the Log Rank regression test, and cost-to-diagnosis variable was carried out using co-variance test.

                Protein phosphatase 2A is a serine/threonine phosphatase with activity dependent on an associated regulatory subunit, serine/threonine-protein phosphatase 2A 56 kDa regulatory subunit delta (δ) isoform (PPP2R5D). PPP2R5D is the δ isoform in the B56 family of regulatory subunits. Abundantly expressed in the brain and involved in a broad range of cellular processes, PPP2R5D plays an essential role in modulating key neuronal pathways and signalling. Pathogenic mutations in the PPP2R5D gene are linked to clinical symptoms characterized by neurodevelopmental delay, intellectual disability, and autism spectrum disorders. The etiology of these genetic disorders remains unknown, which can partly be due to the lack of independently characterized antibodies. Here we have characterized six PPP2R5D commercial antibodies for Western Blot, immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence using a standardized experimental protocol based on comparing read-outs in knockout cell lines and isogenic parental controls. These studies are part of a larger, collaborative initiative seeking to address antibody reproducibility by characterizing commercially available antibodies for human proteins and publishing the results openly as a resource for the scientific community. While use of antibodies and protocols vary between laboratories, we encourage readers to use this report as a guide to select the most appropriate antibodies for their specific needs.

                Background PRAAN, a digital peak flow meter, was developed to measure peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) for asthma monitoring. This study aimed to compare PRAAN’s accuracy to that of spirometry and the mini-Wright peak flow meter for PEFR measurement. Methods Two cross-sectional studies were conducted in 106 healthy adult participants. Study A (n=56) compared PRAAN with spirometry, while study B (n=50) compared PRAAN with the mini-Wright peak flow meter. PEFR values were collected using crossover studies. Pearson’s correlation and Bland-Altman plots were used to report the relationship and agreement between two measurements, respectively. Results In study A, 51.8% were female, mean age was 24.3±5.6 years, and PEFR was 480.3±86.8 L/min. PEFR measured by PRAAN had very strongly positive correlation with spirometry (r=0.980, P<0.001). Bland-Altman analysis showed that there was good agreement between them, with a low mean difference of -7.07 liters/minute (95% CI: -40.58 to 26.44 liters/minute) and 92.9%, which were within the limit of agreement (LOA). In study B, 54.0% were female, mean age was 23.5±2.4 years, and PEFR was 495.1±82.7 L/min. PEFR measured by PRAAN and by the mini-Wright peak flow meter showed very strongly positive correlation (r=0.971, P<0.001). Bland-Altman comparison of PEFR between these two measurements showed that there was a very good agreement between them, with a low mean difference of 0.84 liters/minute (95% CI: -38.68 to 40.38 liters/minute) and 94.0%, which were within LOA. Conclusions The accuracy of PRAAN is in the agreement with spirometry and the mini-Wright peak flow meter. The clinical application of PRAAN may potentially lead to a monitoring strategy that healthcare providers can use to improve the management of asthma.

                Casein kinase II subunit alpha (CSNK2A1), a serine/threonine kinase, phosphorylates multiple protein substrates and is involved in diverse cellular and biological processes. Implicated in various human diseases, high-performing antibodies would help evaluate its potential as a therapeutic target and benefit the scientific community. In this study, we have characterized ten CSNK2A1 commercial antibodies for western blot, immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence using a standardized experimental protocol based on comparing read-outs in knockout cell lines and isogenic parental controls. These studies are part of a larger, collaborative initiative seeking to address antibody reproducibility issues by characterizing commercially available antibodies for human proteins and publishing the results openly as a resource for the scientific community. While use of antibodies and protocols vary between laboratories, we encourage readers to use this report as a guide to select the most appropriate antibodies for their specific needs.

                <p>by Kanishk Chauhan, Alexander B. Neiman, Peter A. Tass</p>

Abnormally strong neural synchronization may impair brain function, as observed in several brain disorders. We computationally study how neuronal dynamics, synaptic weights, and network structure co-emerge, in particular, during (de)synchronization processes and how they are affected by external perturbation. To investigate the impact of different types of plasticity mechanisms, we combine a network of excitatory integrate-and-fire neurons with different synaptic weight and/or structural plasticity mechanisms: (i) only spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), (ii) only homeostatic structural plasticity (hSP), i.e., without weight-dependent pruning and without STDP, (iii) a combination of STDP and hSP, i.e., without weight-dependent pruning, and (iv) a combination of STDP and structural plasticity (SP) that includes hSP and weight-dependent pruning. To accommodate the diverse time scales of neuronal firing, STDP, and SP, we introduce a simple stochastic SP model, enabling detailed numerical analyses. With tools from network theory, we reveal that structural reorganization may remarkably enhance the network’s level of synchrony. When weaker contacts are preferentially eliminated by weight-dependent pruning, synchrony is achieved with significantly sparser connections than in randomly structured networks in the STDP-only model. In particular, the strengthening of contacts from neurons with higher natural firing rates to those with lower rates and the weakening of contacts in the opposite direction, followed by selective removal of weak contacts, allows for strong synchrony with fewer connections. This activity-led network reorganization results in the emergence of degree-frequency, degree-degree correlations, and a mixture of degree assortativity. We compare the stimulation-induced desynchronization of synchronized states in the STDP-only model (i) with the desynchronization of models (iii) and (iv). The latter require stimuli of significantly higher intensity to achieve long-term desynchronization. These findings may inform future pre-clinical and clinical studies with invasive or non-invasive stimulus modalities aiming at inducing long-lasting relief of symptoms, e.g., in Parkinson’s disease.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-324/v2?src=rss">A scoping review on what constitutes a good research culture [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 3 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background The crisis in research culture is well documented, covering issues such as a tendency for quantity over quality, unhealthy competitive environments, and assessment based on publications, journal prestige and funding. In response, research institutions need to assess their own practices to promote and advocate for change in the current research ecosystem. The purpose of the scoping review was to explore ‘What does the evidence say about the ‘problem’ with ‘poor’ research culture, what are the benefits of ‘good’ research culture, and what does ‘good’ look like?’ Aims To examine the peer-reviewed and grey literature to explore the interplay between research culture, open research, career paths, recognition and rewards, and equality, diversity, and inclusion, as part of a larger programme of activity for a research institution. Methods A scoping review was undertaken. Six databases were searched along with grey literature. Eligible literature had relevance to academic research institutions, addressed research culture, and were published between January 2017 to May 2022. Evidence was mapped and themed to specific categories. The search strategy, screening and analysis took place between April-May 2022. Results 1666 titles and abstracts, and 924 full text articles were assessed for eligibility. Of these, 253 articles met the eligibility criteria for inclusion. A purposive sampling of relevant websites was drawn from to complement the review, resulting in 102 records included in the review. Key areas for consideration were identified across the four themes of job security, wellbeing and equality of opportunity, teamwork and interdisciplinary, and research quality and accountability. Conclusions There are opportunities for research institutions to improve their own practice, however institutional solutions cannot act in isolation. Research institutions and research funders need to work together to build a more sustainable and inclusive research culture that is diverse in nature and supports individuals’ well-being, career progression and performance.

<p>The three-dimensional ultrastructure of flower-spray nerve endings in the carotid sinus was analyzed. The terminal parts of the endings localized in the tunica adventitia and were incompletely covered by the thin cytoplasmic processes of Schwann cells.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The flower-spray nerve endings are afferent nerve terminals in the carotid sinus that arise from carotid sinus nerve of glossopharyngeal nerve. However, the three-dimensional ultrastructural characteristics of flower-spray nerve endings and spatial relationships between the terminal parts and other cellular elements have not been fully understood. To elucidate their detailed relationship, backscattered electron imaging of serial sections was performed with a scanning electron microscope to produce a three-dimensional reconstruction of the flower-spray endings. The terminal parts of flower-spray endings were distributed horizontally approximately 5 µm outside the external elastic membrane in the tunica adventitia of the internal carotid artery. The three-dimensional reconstruction showed that the terminal parts of flower-spray endings were flat with irregular contours and were partially covered by the thin cytoplasmic processes of Schwann cells. The complex consisting of the nerve terminals and associated Schwann cells was surrounded by a multilayered basement membrane. The terminal parts of the endings were also surrounded by fibroblasts with elastic fibers and collagen fibrils. Secretory vesicles without an electron-dense core were observed in the terminal parts of the endings. The accumulation of vesicles just below the axonal membrane was observed in terminal parts not covered by Schwann cell cytoplasmic processes on both the luminal and basal sides. Swollen mitochondria, concentric membranous structures, and glycogen granule-like electron-dense materials were often noted in some of the terminal parts of the endings and the parent axon. Collectively, the present results suggest that flower-spray endings are baroreceptors because their morphology was similar to other mechanoreceptors. Furthermore, flower-spray endings may be affected by glutamate secreted in an autocrine manner.</p>

<p>We compared transcriptomic profiles and functionality of ABC and SLC transporters in marsupial <i>Monodelphis domestica</i> brain and eutherian rat brain and placenta.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>This study used a marsupial <i>Monodelphis domestica</i>, which is born very immature and most of its development is postnatal without placental protection. RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) was used to identify the expression of influx and efflux transporters (ATP-binding cassettes [ABCs] and solute carriers [SLCs]) and metabolizing enzymes in brains of newborn to juvenile <i>Monodelphis</i>. Results were compared to published data in the developing eutherian rat. To test the functionality of these transporters at similar ages, the entry of paracetamol (acetaminophen) into the brain and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was measured using liquid scintillation counting following a single administration of the drug along with its radiolabelled tracer [<sup>3</sup>H]. Drug permeability studies found that in <i>Monodelphis</i>, brain entry of paracetamol was already restricted at P5; it decreased further in the first week of life and then remained stable until the oldest age group tested (P110). Transcriptomic analysis of <i>Monodelphis</i> brain showed that expression of transporters and their metabolizing enzymes in early postnatal (P) pups (P0, P5, and P8) was relatively similar, but by P109, many more transcripts were identified. When transcriptomes of newborn <i>Monodelphis</i> brain and E19 rat brain and placenta were compared, several transporters present in the rat placenta were also found in the newborn <i>Monodelphis</i> brain. These were absent from E19 rat brain but were present in the adult rat brain. These data indicate that despite its extreme immaturity, the newborn <i>Monodelphis</i> brain may compensate for the lack of placental protection during early brain development by upregulating protective mechanisms, which in eutherian animals are instead present in the placenta.</p>

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Some recent publications have used the term “vagal–adrenal axis” to account for mechanisms involved in the regulation of inflammation by electroacupuncture. This concept proposes that efferent parasympathetic nerve fibers in the vagus directly innervate the adrenal glands to influence catecholamine secretion. Here, we discuss evidence for anatomical and functional links between the vagi and adrenal glands that may be relevant in the context of inflammation and its neural control by factors, including acupuncture. First, we find that evidence for any direct vagal parasympathetic efferent innervation of the adrenal glands is weak and likely artifactual. Second, we find good evidence that vagal afferent fibers directly innervate the adrenal gland, although their function is uncertain. Third, we highlight a wealth of evidence for indirect pathways, whereby vagal afferent signals act via the central nervous system to modify adrenal-dependent anti-inflammatory responses. Vagal afferents, not efferents, are thus the likely key to these phenomena.</p>

                Background This research investigated the dynamics of fee-free higher education in South Africa, aiming to elucidate the complexities surrounding its implementation and impact. By employing a causal loop diagram approach, the study examined the interplay of socioeconomic, political, and institutional factors influencing the provision of fee-free higher education. Method A participatory approach to developing the CLD was used. Through an extensive literature review, the research contextualised fee-free higher education enabling a preliminary CLD to be developed. Discussions were held to improve the preliminary model based on stakeholder and expert opinion. The model was then validated by stakeholders and experts. Results The CLD has explicitly mapped out the causal relationships which play a fundamental role in fee-free higher education in South Africa. Key findings revealed that fee-free higher education initiatives, such as managing funding constraints and administrative complexities, hold promise for fostering inclusivity and socioeconomic development but are hindered by bureaucratic policy establishments and inefficiencies. These challenges underscore the gap between policy formulation and implementation, highlighting the need for comprehensive reforms to streamline administrative processes and enhance financial sustainability within the higher education sector. Conclusion This research thoroughly examined the dynamics of fee-free higher education in South Africa, highlighting both the challenges and opportunities in its implementation. The study emphasized the need for systemic reforms to improve accessibility and effectiveness, while also underscoring the potential of such initiatives to promote social mobility and economic empowerment, aligning with global goals like the SDGs and the African Agenda 2063.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Most paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia (PKD) cases are hereditary, yet approximately 60% of patients remain genetically undiagnosed. We undertook the present study to uncover the genetic basis for undiagnosed PKD patients.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Whole-exome sequencing was performed for 106 <i>PRRT2</i>-negative PKD probands. The functional impact of the genetic variants was investigated in HEK293T cells and <i>Drosophila</i>.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Heterozygous variants in <i>KCNJ10</i> were identified in 11 individuals from 8 unrelated families, which accounted for 7.5% (8/106) of the <i>PRRT2</i>-negative probands. Both co-segregation of the identified variants and the significantly higher frequency of rare <i>KCNJ10</i> variants in PKD cases supported impacts from the detected <i>KCNJ10</i> heterozygous variants on PKD pathogenesis. Moreover, a <i>KCNJ10</i> mutation-carrying father from a typical EAST/SeSAME family was identified as a PKD patient. All patients manifested dystonia attacks triggered by sudden movement with a short episodic duration. Patch-clamp recordings in HEK293T cells revealed apparent reductions in K<sup>+</sup> currents of the patient-derived variants, indicating a loss-of-function. In <i>Drosophila</i>, milder hyperexcitability phenotypes were observed in heterozygous <i>Irk2</i> knock-in flies compared to homozygotes, supporting haploinsufficiency as the mechanism for the detected heterozygous variants. Electrophysiological recordings showed that excitatory neurons in <i>Irk2</i> haploinsufficiency flies exhibited increased excitability, and glia-specific complementation with human Kir4.1 rescued the <i>Irk2</i> mutant phenotypes.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our study established haploinsufficiency resulting from heterozygous variants in <i>KCNJ10</i> can be understood as a previously unrecognized genetic cause for PKD and provided evidence of glial involvement in the pathophysiology of PKD. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-446/v2?src=rss">An Insight into developmental changes in reasoning skills among Indian Preschoolers: A cross-sectional study using a story-based approach [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Considering the importance of exploring the development of reasoning skills during preschool period and the suitability of using a culturally linguistically relevant story-based approach for the same, the present research intended to profile the reasoning skills in typically developing Indian preschool children between 36 and 72 months using a story-based approach. The specific objectives were to develop explanation, prediction, and inference based reasoning tasks around a story and assess the reasoning skills in typically developing Indian preschool children using the same. Method: Reasoning tasks across explanation, prediction, and inference domains were developed based on a story and evaluated for its psychometric properties. The developed tasks were then administered to 63 typically developing Indian preschool children attending English medium schools in Mangalore. The preschoolers were equally divided into three age groups, and the responses obtained across the age groups were analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively. Results: The developed tasks were confirmed to have good psychometric properties like content validity and reliability. The age comparisons of reasoning abilities using one-way ANOVA suggested an increase in reasoning abilities with age during the preschool period. The qualitative analysis further suggested that with increasing age, the nature of reasoning changed from content-based reasoning to reasoning based on prior knowledge which was integrated with the story content. Conclusion: The study describes reasoning skill development using a story-based task in Indian preschoolers. The study findings further provide clinical and educational implications to assess and foster reasoning abilities among preschoolers.

                Background: Mycobacterial pathogens are among the top causes of diseases in humans. In Kenya, incidences of Non-Tuberculous Mycobacteria (NTM) species have steadily been on the increase. Most NTMare resistant to first line treatment of tuberculosis and have a challenge in timely and accurate diagnosis. Misdiagnosis has led to prescribing anti-tuberculosis regimens to patients suffering from NTM. We aimed to determine the most prevalent Non-Tuberculous Mycobacterium in Kenya. Methods: We reviewed records from the National Tuberculosis Reference Laboratory(NTRL ) Laboratory information management system (LIMS) between January 2018 and December 2019 for the patients on surveillance. All isolates were cultured in Mycobacterial Growth Indicator Tubes (MGIT) and incubated for detection using BACTEC™ MGIT™ system. Those with negative acid-fast bacilli (AFB) growth and negative for Mycobacterium Tuberculosis Complex Species (MTBC) protein-MPT64 were suggestive of NTM infections, which were sub-cultured in MGIT and characterized using Line Probe Assay (LPA) GenoType® MTBDR CM/AS. Descriptive and bivariate analysis was done. Results: Of the total 24,549 records reviewed, 167(0.7%) were NTM isolates. Males comprised of 74.2% (124/167), and the mean age was 42 years (SD±16), age group 35-44 years had the highest NTM at 26.3% (44/167). Nairobi had 12.6% (21/167), Mombasa 10.8% (18/167), Kilifi and Meru each had 7.8% (13/167). Eleven isolated species comprised of Mycobacterium intracellulare 35.3% (65/167), M. fortuitum at 27% (48/167), and M. scrofulaceum at 10.2% (17/167). Previously treated patients had higher NTM [63.5% (106/167)] than Drug-resistant follow-up patients [26.9% (45/167)]. Coinfection with HIV was at 27.5% (46/167). Conclusion: Previously treated patients should have an additional screening of NTMS, and drug susceptibility testing should be done before initiation of treatment.

                Background The topic of Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) in civil and commercial contexts presents a contemporary legal challenge aimed at fostering equitable solutions. Among ADR methods, mediation stands out for its ability to reduce time, costs, and litigation duration. This study explores the conceptual framework, essential conditions, and procedural aspects of mediation. It evaluates the sufficiency, regulation, and effectiveness of mediation principles in conflict resolution and risk mitigation. Methods This study is conducted through a comprehensive review of current literature on Alternative Dispute Resolution methods, with a particular focus on mediation as an alternative to dispute settlement. The study utilizes qualitative analysis techniques to examine the effectiveness of mediation principles and their application in resolving civil and commercial disputes. Comparative analyses are also conducted to extract useful insights from various legal systems and authorities. Results The study provides an analysis that illustrates the effectiveness of mediation in resolving disputes, emphasizing its potential benefits in terms of time and cost savings, as well as its srole in facilitating amicable resolutions. The results of this study shall contribute to the current body of knowledge on mediation and provide practical recommendations for its application in diverse legal contexts. Conclusion In conclusion, the study proposes strategies to enhance mediation practices, promote a culture of its adoption, and integrate it more closely into the judicial system. Additionally, it anticipates the future effectiveness of mediation in jurisdictions lacking comprehensive legislation, drawing from successful Western experiences to guide potential developments in Arab legal frameworks.

                Background: Acute sub-massive pulmonary embolism is a common clinical condition, and it is associated with high mortality and morbidity. This condition is commonly associated with various co-morbidities and clinical circumstances. Methods: This is a case report series of 4 patients, wherein the thrombolysis and balloon angioplasty was performed simultaneously using a Cordis 6F diagnostic catheter and later exchanged with a 6F guide catheter in the respective pulmonary artery when a larger balloon was required. Results: All these four patients achieved successful revascularization of the respective pulmonary artery. One patient expired 30 hours after the procedure with a significant reduction in the symptoms suddenly, which was likely a second episode of pulmonary embolism. No bleeding manifestations were observed in any of the patients. The other three patients are on follow-up. Conclusion: Simultaneous coronary balloon dilatation and thrombolysis is a useful method in the treatment of high risk submassive acute pulmonary embolism. If needed, higher caliber balloons can be used for the same technique using guide catheters.

                Background Funding committees, comprising members with a range of knowledge, skills, and experience, are considered integral to the decision-making process of funding organisations for recommending or allocating research funding. However, there is limited research investigating the decision-making processes, the role of members and their social interactions during funding committee meetings conducted both virtually and face-to-face. Methods Using a mixed-methods design and following netnography principles, the study observed nine National Institute for Health and Care Research programmes funding committee meetings conducted virtually during October 2020 to December 2021; complemented by interviews with committee chairs and members (18 interviews) and NIHR staff (12 interviews); an online survey (50 responses); and documentary analysis. Personal reflections through immersive journals also formed part of the analysis. Results Three main themes were identified from the observations, interviews, and online survey: efficiency of virtual committee meetings (importance of preparation, and the role of formality, process, and structure); understanding the effect of virtual committee meetings on well-being (effects of fatigue and apprehension, and the importance of work life balance); understanding social interactions and engagement (levels of engagement, contribution and inclusivity, awareness of unconscious bias and the value of social networking). Conclusions Examining the decision-making practices of one funding organisation across several research programmes, across multiple committee meetings over one year has generated new insights around funding committee practices that previous studies have not been able to explore or investigate. Overall, it was observed that fair and transparent funding recommendations and outcomes can be achieved through virtual funding committees. However, whilst virtual funding committees have many benefits and opportunities, such as the potential to increase membership diversity and inclusivity, and be more environmentally sustainable, more evidence is needed to evaluate their effectiveness, with particular focus on issues of fatigue, engagement, and committee cohesion, especially when new committee members join.

                Introduction Carriers of variant alleles of genes that encode liver CYP450 and UGT enzymes may experience abnormal plasma levels of antipsychotics and, consequently, worse efficacy or tolerability. Although pharmacogenomics is a rapidly developing field, current guidelines often rely on limited, underpowered evidence. We have previously demonstrated that meta-analysis is a viable strategy for overcoming this problem. Here, we propose a project that will expand our previous work and create a living systematic review and meta-analysis of drug plasma level differences between carriers and non-carriers of variant genotype-predicted phenotypes for every pharmacokinetic drug-gene interaction relevant to commonly used antipsychotic drugs. Protocol First, a baseline systematic review and meta-analysis will be conducted by searching for observational pharmacogenomics-pharmacokinetic studies. Data on dose-adjusted drug plasma levels will be extracted, and participants will be grouped based on their genotype for each drug-gene pair separately. Differences in plasma drug levels between different phenotypes will be compared using a random-effect ratio-of-means meta-analysis. The risk of bias will be assessed using ROBINS-I, and the certainty of evidence will be assessed using GRADE. Following the establishment of baseline results, the literature search will be re-run at least once every six months, and the baseline data will be updated and re-evaluated as new evidence is published. A freely available website will be designated to present up-to-date results and conclusions. Discussion This systematic review will provide evidence-based results that are continuously updated with evidence as it emerges in the rapidly developing field of pharmacogenomics. These results may help psychiatrists in their decision-making, as clinicians are becoming increasingly aware of the patients’ genetic data as testing becomes more widespread and cheaper. In addition, the results may serve as a scientific basis for the development of evidence-based pharmacogenomics algorithms for personalized dosing of antipsychotics to mitigate potentially harmful drug-gene interactions.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-439/v2?src=rss">Paying reviewers and regulating the number of papers may help fix the peer-review process [version 2; peer review: 2 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                The exponential increase in the number of submissions, further accelerated by generative AI, and the decline in the availability of experts are burdening the peer review process. This has led to high unethical desk rejection rates, a growing appeal for the publication of unreviewed preprints, and a worrying proliferation of predatory journals. The idea of monetarily compensating peer reviewers has been around for many years; maybe, it is time to take it seriously as one way to save the peer review process. Here, I argue that paying reviewers, when done in a fair and transparent way, is a viable solution. Like the case of professional language editors, part-time or full-time professional reviewers, managed by universities or for-profit companies, can be an integral part of modern peer review. Being a professional reviewer could be financially attractive to retired senior researchers and to researchers who enjoy evaluating papers but are not motivated to do so for free. Moreover, not all produced research needs to go through peer review, and thus persuading researchers to limit submissions to their most novel and useful research could also help bring submission volumes to manageable levels. Overall, this paper reckons that the problem is not the peer review process per se but rather its function within an academic ecosystem dominated by an unhealthy culture of ‘publish or perish’. Instead of reforming the peer review process, academia has to look for better science dissemination schemes that promote collaboration over competition, engagement over judgement, and research quality and sustainability over quantity.

Miq as a potential antiviral agent for Newcastle disease [version 7; peer review: 1 approved, 3 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Recent evidence suggests that some flavonoid compounds obtained from crude methanol extract of mistletoe leaves (Dendrophthoe pentandra L. Miq), also known as Benalu Duku (BD), have antimicrobial effects. Thus, the plant has the potential to eliminate viruses that may cause outbreaks in chicken farms. This study aimed to prove the in vitro ability of flavonoid compounds, namely quercetin-like compounds (QLCs), to eliminate field viruses, specifically the Newcastle disease virus (NDV). Methods This research was performed in two stages. An in vitro test was used with a post-test of the control groups designed at a significance of 0.05. BD leaves (5 kg) were extracted using a maceration method with methanol and then separated into hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate, and methanol fractions. The final extracted products were separated using semi-preparative high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to obtain QLCs. The QLCs were identified and compared with quercetin using HPLC, proton and carbon nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry, Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometry and ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. The activity of QLCs was tested in vitro against the NDV at a virulence titter of 10−5 Tissue Culture Infectious Dose 50% (TCID50) in chicken kidney cell culture. Results Solutions of 0.05% (w/v) QLCs were discovered to have antiviral activity against NDVs, with an average cytopathogenic effect antigenicity at a 10−5 dilution (p<0.05). Conclusions QLCs from flavonoids from the leaves of BD have in vitro antiviral bioactivity against NDV at a virulence titter of 10-5 Tissue Culture Infectious Dose 50% (TCID50) in chicken kidney cell culture. QLCs may have the potential to be developed as medicinal compounds for the treatment of other human or animal viral infections.

                Background Primiparous mothers face diverse challenges during pregnancy and post-childbirth. There is a lack of comprehensive educational programs for primiparous mothers on maternal functioning and newborn care. This study aimed to explore the efficacy of a developed educational program on the attitude of primiparous mothers towards newborn communication, general health, feeding and swallowing. The objectives were (1) to develop an attitude questionnaire (AQ), a parent education program, and a feedback questionnaire (FQ); and (2) to estimate the efficacy of the education program pre- and post-delivery. Methods Ninety-eight primiparous mothers without any obstetric history, proficient in English or Kannada, and delivering healthy newborns were recruited for the study. Phase 1 involved the development and validation of AQ, the parent education program [Newborn Communication, Health, Feeding and Swallowing Education Program (N-CHFSEP)], and FQ; while Phase 2 comprised of administering them on the mothers. Both quantitative (descriptive statistics, paired t-test, and chi-square test) and qualitative analysis were done on the parameters of interest. Results The results of the study demonstrated a notable increase in the number of mothers (not all) reporting heightened confidence levels following receiving the N-CHFSEP (which was observed in all the domains). This observed change (pre and post) was statistically significant as per paired t-test analysis (p <0.05) indicating a significant increase in confidence levels post-N-CHFSEP intervention, as well as recognizing warning signs related to the same. Sociodemographic factors such as age, education, occupation, and family type were reported to have a significant effect (p <0.05) on maternal confidence levels before and after N-CHFSEP administration. Feedback from participants highlighted the effectiveness of the program in enhancing knowledge and awareness, while also suggesting areas for improvement. Conclusions This study demonstrates the effectiveness of N-CHFSEP in enhancing primiparous mothers' confidence in newborn care, thereby improving maternal and infant health.

                Jiang et al. demonstrate that combinations of different accessory proteins tune nematode TMC-1 to different sensory functions. In addition, distinct structural domains of nematode TMC-1 mediate mechanosensation and alkaline sensing. These domains are segregated between mammalian mTMC1 and mTMC3, and mTMC1 supports mechanosensation in nematodes, while mTMC3 supports alkaline sensing.

                Feng et al. conducted a genome-wide CRISPR synthetic lethality screen, which revealed that PD-L1-deficient cells are susceptible to ferroptosis. Mechanistically, nuclear PD-L1 activates SOD2 expression to maintain redox homeostasis, thereby conferring ferroptosis resistance. Targeting intrinsic PD-L1 function is a potential therapeutic approach to enhance the efficacy of cancer treatments.

Omari et al. found that SGs enlarge by fusion of individual SGs with amphisomes and decrease in size through dynamin-mediated fission regulated by phosphoinositide interconversions. While both small and large SGs are exocytosis competent, only large SGs can release exosomes.

M of lyssavirus can inhibit the NLRP3 inflammasome activation by competing with NEK7 for direct binding with NLRP3. Lyssavirus M strongly interacts with NLRP3, thereby keeping a “locked” state to prevent NLRP3 assembly, which restricts downstream ASC oligomerization.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92679">Differential regulation by CD47 and thrombospondin-1 of extramedullary erythropoiesis in mouse spleen</a></h4>

              
                Extramedullary erythropoiesis is not expected in healthy adult mice, but erythropoietic gene expression was elevated in lineage-depleted spleen cells from <i>Cd47<sup>−/−</sup></i> mice. Expression of several genes associated with early stages of erythropoiesis was elevated in mice lacking CD47 or its signaling ligand thrombospondin-1, consistent with previous evidence that this signaling pathway inhibits expression of multipotent stem cell transcription factors in spleen. In contrast, cells expressing markers of committed erythroid progenitors were more abundant in <i>Cd47<sup>−/−</sup></i> spleens but significantly depleted in <i>Thbs1<sup>−/−</sup></i> spleens. Single-cell transcriptome and flow cytometry analyses indicated that loss of CD47 is associated with accumulation and increased proliferation in spleen of Ter119<sup>−</sup>CD34<sup>+</sup> progenitors and Ter119<sup>+</sup>CD34<sup>−</sup> committed erythroid progenitors with elevated mRNA expression of Kit, Ermap, and Tfrc. Induction of committed erythroid precursors is consistent with the known function of CD47 to limit the phagocytic removal of aged erythrocytes. Conversely, loss of thrombospondin-1 delays the turnover of aged red blood cells, which may account for the suppression of committed erythroid precursors in <i>Thbs1<sup>−/−</sup></i> spleens relative to basal levels in wild-type mice. In addition to defining a role for CD47 to limit extramedullary erythropoiesis, these studies reveal a thrombospondin-1-dependent basal level of extramedullary erythropoiesis in adult mouse spleen.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/87316">Uremic toxin indoxyl sulfate induces trained immunity via the AhR-dependent arachidonic acid pathway in end-stage renal disease (ESRD)</a></h4>

              
                Trained immunity is the long-term functional reprogramming of innate immune cells, which results in altered responses toward a secondary challenge. Despite indoxyl sulfate (IS) being a potent stimulus associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD)-related inflammation, its impact on trained immunity has not been explored. Here, we demonstrate that IS induces trained immunity in monocytes via epigenetic and metabolic reprogramming, resulting in augmented cytokine production. Mechanistically, the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) contributes to IS-trained immunity by enhancing the expression of arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism-related genes such as arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase (ALOX5) and ALOX5 activating protein (ALOX5AP). Inhibition of AhR during IS training suppresses the induction of IS-trained immunity. Monocytes from end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients have increased ALOX5 expression and after 6 days training, they exhibit enhanced TNF-α and IL-6 production to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Furthermore, healthy control-derived monocytes trained with uremic sera from ESRD patients exhibit increased production of TNF-α and IL-6. Consistently, IS-trained mice and their splenic myeloid cells had increased production of TNF-α after in vivo and ex vivo LPS stimulation compared to that of control mice. These results provide insight into the role of IS in the induction of trained immunity, which is critical during inflammatory immune responses in CKD patients.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92621">Comparative transcriptomics reveal a novel tardigrade-specific DNA-binding protein induced in response to ionizing radiation</a></h4>

              
                Tardigrades are microscopic animals renowned for their ability to withstand extreme conditions, including high doses of ionizing radiation (IR). To better understand their radio-resistance, we first characterized induction and repair of DNA double- and single-strand breaks after exposure to IR in the model species <i>Hypsibius exemplaris</i>. Importantly, we found that the rate of single-strand breaks induced was roughly equivalent to that in human cells, suggesting that DNA repair plays a predominant role in tardigrades’ radio-resistance. To identify novel tardigrade-specific genes involved, we next conducted a comparative transcriptomics analysis across three different species. In all three species, many DNA repair genes were among the most strongly overexpressed genes alongside a novel tardigrade-specific gene, which we named <i>Tardigrade DNA damage Response 1</i> (<i>TDR1</i>). We found that TDR1 protein interacts with DNA and forms aggregates at high concentration suggesting it may condensate DNA and preserve chromosome organization until DNA repair is accomplished. Remarkably, when expressed in human cells, TDR1 improved resistance to Bleomycin, a radiomimetic drug. Based on these findings, we propose that TDR1 is a novel tardigrade-specific gene conferring resistance to IR. Our study sheds light on mechanisms of DNA repair helping cope with high levels of DNA damage inflicted by IR.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96386">Selective recruitment of the cerebellum evidenced by task-dependent gating of inputs</a></h4>

              
                Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have documented cerebellar activity across a wide array of tasks. However, the functional contribution of the cerebellum within these task domains remains unclear because cerebellar activity is often studied in isolation. This is problematic, as cerebellar fMRI activity may simply reflect the transmission of neocortical activity through fixed connections. Here, we present a new approach that addresses this problem. Rather than focus on task-dependent activity changes in the cerebellum alone, we ask if neocortical inputs to the cerebellum are gated in a task-dependent manner. We hypothesize that input is upregulated when the cerebellum functionally contributes to a task. We first validated this approach using a finger movement task, where the integrity of the cerebellum has been shown to be essential for the coordination of rapid alternating movements but not for force generation. While both neocortical and cerebellar activity increased with increasing speed and force, the speed-related changes in the cerebellum were larger than predicted by an optimized cortico-cerebellar connectivity model. We then applied the same approach in a cognitive domain, assessing how the cerebellum supports working memory. Enhanced gating was associated with the encoding of items in working memory, but not with the manipulation or retrieval of the items. Focusing on task-dependent gating of neocortical inputs to the cerebellum offers a promising approach for using fMRI to understand the specific contributions of the cerebellum to cognitive function.

">Age-dependent predictors of effective reinforcement motor learning across childhood</a></h4>

              
                Across development, children must learn motor skills such as eating with a spoon and drawing with a crayon. Reinforcement learning, driven by success and failure, is fundamental to such sensorimotor learning. It typically requires a child to explore movement options along a continuum (grip location on a crayon) and learn from probabilistic rewards (whether the crayon draws or breaks). Here, we studied the development of reinforcement motor learning using online motor tasks to engage children aged 3 to 17 and adults (cross-sectional sample, N=385). Participants moved a cartoon penguin across a scene and were rewarded (animated cartoon clip) based on their final movement position. Learning followed a clear developmental trajectory when participants could choose to move anywhere along a continuum and the reward probability depended on final movement position. Learning was incomplete or absent in 3 to 8-year-olds and gradually improved to adult-like levels by adolescence. A reinforcement learning model fit to each participant identified three age-dependent factors underlying improvement: amount of exploration after a failed movement, learning rate, and level of motor noise. We predicted, and confirmed, that switching to discrete targets and deterministic reward would improve 3 to 8-year-olds' learning to adult-like levels by increasing exploration after failed movements. Overall, we show a robust developmental trajectory of reinforcement motor learning abilities under ecologically relevant conditions i.e., continuous movement options mapped to probabilistic reward. This learning appears to be limited by immature spatial processing and probabilistic reasoning abilities in young children and can be rescued by reducing the demands in these domains.

">Sex-specific GABAergic microcircuits that switch vulnerability into resilience to stress and reverse the effects of chronic stress exposure</a></h4>

              
                Clinical and preclinical studies have identified somatostatin (SST)-positive interneurons as key elements that regulate the vulnerability to stress-related psychiatric disorders. Conversely, disinhibition of SST neurons in mice results in resilience to the behavioral effects of chronic stress. Here we established a low-dose chronic chemogenetic protocol to map these changes in positively and negatively motivated behaviors to specific brain regions. AAV-hM3Dq mediated chronic activation of SST neurons in the prelimbic cortex (PLC) had antidepressant drug-like effects on anxiety- and anhedonia-like motivated behaviors in male but not female mice. Analogous manipulation of the ventral hippocampus (vHPC) had such effects in female but not male mice. Moreover, activation of SST neurons in the PLC of male and the vHPC of female mice resulted in stress resilience. Activation of SST neurons in the PLC reversed prior chronic stress-induced defects in motivated behavior in males but was ineffective in females. Conversely, activation of SST neurons in the vHPC reversed chronic stress-induced behavioral alterations in females but not males. Quantitation of c-Fos+ and FosB+ neurons in chronic stress-exposed mice revealed that chronic activation of SST neurons leads to a paradoxical increase in pyramidal cell activity. Collectively, these data demonstrate that GABAergic microcircuits driven by dendrite targeting interneurons enable sex- and brain-region-specific neural plasticity that promotes stress resilience and reverses stress-induced anxiety- and anhedonia-like motivated behavior. Our studies provide a mechanistic rationale for antidepressant efficacy of dendrite-targeting, low-potency GABAA receptor agonists, independent of sex and despite striking sex differences in the relevant brain substrates.

">A dendritic substrate for temporal diversity of cortical inhibition</a></h4>

              
                In the mammalian neocortex, GABAergic interneurons (INs) inhibit cortical networks in profoundly different ways. The extent to which this depends on how different INs process excitatory signals along their dendrites is poorly understood. Here, we reveal that the functional specialization of two major populations of cortical INs is determined by the unique association of different dendritic integration modes with distinct synaptic organization motifs. We found that somatostatin (SST)-INs exhibit NMDAR-dependent dendritic integration and uniform synapse density along the dendritic tree. In contrast, dendrites of parvalbumin (PV)-INs exhibit passive synaptic integration coupled with proximally enriched synaptic distributions. Theoretical analysis shows that these two dendritic configurations result in different strategies to optimize synaptic efficacy in thin dendritic structures. Yet, the two configurations lead to distinct temporal engagement of each IN during network activity. We confirmed these predictions with in vivo recordings of IN activity in the visual cortex of awake mice, revealing a rapid and linear recruitment of PV-INs as opposed to a long-lasting integrative activation of SST-INs. Our work reveals the existence of distinct dendritic strategies that confer distinct temporal representations for the two major classes of neocortical INs and thus dynamics of inhibition.

">A Systematic Review of the Neuroprotective Role and Biomarker Potential of GDF15 in Neurodegeneration</a></h4>

              
                Neurodegeneration is characteristically multifaceted, with limited therapeutic options. One of the chief pathophysiological mechanisms driving these conditions is neuroinflammation, prompting increasing clinical interest in immunomodulatory agents. Growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15; previously also called macrophage inhibitory cytokine-1 or MIC-1), an anti-inflammatory cytokine with established neurotrophic properties, has emerged as a promising therapeutic agent in recent decades. However, methodological challenges and the delayed identification of its specific receptor GFRAL have hindered research progress. This review systematically examines literature about GDF15 in neurodegenerative diseases and neurotrauma. The evidence collated in this review indicates that GDF15 expression is upregulated in response to neurodegenerative pathophysiology and increasing its levels in preclinical models typically improves outcomes. Key knowledge gaps are addressed for future investigations to foster a more comprehensive understanding of the neuroprotective effects elicited by GDF15.

">Advancing Thalamic Nuclei Segmentation: The Impact of Compressed Sensing and FastSurfer on MRI Processing</a></h4>

              
                The thalamus is a collection of gray matter nuclei that play a crucial role in sensorimotor processing and modulation of cortical activity. Characterizing thalamic nuclei is particularly relevant for patient populations with Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, dementia, and schizophrenia. However, severe head motion in these populations poses a significant challenge for in vivo mapping of thalamic nuclei. Recent advancements have leveraged the compressed sensing (CS) framework to accelerate acquisition times in MPRAGE sequence variants, while fast segmentation tools like FastSurfer have reduced processing times in MRI research. In this study, we evaluated thalamic nuclei segmentations derived from six different MPRAGE variants with varying degrees of CS acceleration (from about 9 to about 1 minute acquisitions), using both FreeSurfer and FastSurfer for segmentation. Our findings show minimal sequence effects with no systematic bias, and low volume variability across sequences for the whole thalamus and major thalamic nuclei. Notably, CS-accelerated sequences produced less variable volumes compared to non-CS sequences. Additionally, segmentations of thalamic nuclei by FreeSurfer and FastSurfer were highly comparable. We provide first evidence supporting that a good segmentation quality of thalamic nuclei with compressed sensing T1-weighted image acceleration in a clinical 3T MRI system is possible. Our findings encourage future applications of fast T1-weighted MRI to study deep gray matter. CS-accelerated sequences and rapid segmentation methods are promising tools for future studies aiming to characterize thalamic nuclei in vivo at 3T in both healthy individuals and clinical populations.

">Probing tau citrullination in Alzheimer's disease brains and mouse models of tauopathy</a></h4>

              
                Tauopathies, which include Alzheimers disease (AD) share a common defining factor, namely misfolded tau protein. However, the upstream etiology and downstream clinical manifestations of tauopathies are quite diverse. Tau deposition elicits different pathological phenotypes and outcomes depending on the tau strain and regional susceptibility. Posttranslational modifications (PTM) can alter tau structure, function, networks, and its pathological sequalae. We uncovered a novel PTM of tau, named citrullination, caused by peptidyl arginine deiminase (PAD) enzymes. PAD induced citrullination irreversibly converts arginine residues to citrulline, producing net loss of positive charge, elimination of pi-pi interactions, and increased hydrophobicity. We observed increased PAD2 and PAD4 in Alzheimers disease (AD) brain and that they both can citrullinate tau. Tau can become citrullinated by PADs at all 14 arginine residues throughout the N-terminal domain (N-term), proline-rich domain (PR), microtubule binding repeat domain (MBR), and C-terminal domain (C-term) on full length tau (2N4R). Citrullination of tau impacts fibrillization and oligomerization rates in aggregation assays. Utilizing a panel of novel citrullinated tau (citR tau) antibodies, we identified citrullination of tau in vitro, several animal models of tauopathies, and Alzheimers disease (AD). CitR tau increased with Braak stage and was enriched in AD brains with higher phospho-tau burden. This work provides a new area of tau biology that signifies further consideration in the emerging spectrum of tauopathies and its clinical understanding.

                INTRODUCTION: We investigated the effects of multiple cerebrovascular disease (CeVD) neuroimaging markers on brain functional connectivity (FC), and how such CeVD-related FC changes interact with plasma p-tau181 (Alzheimer's disease (AD) marker) to influence downstream neurodegeneration and cognitive changes. METHODS: Multivariate associations between four CeVD markers and whole-brain FC in 529 participants across the dementia spectrum were examined using partial least squares correlation. Interactive effects of CeVD-related FC patterns and p-tau181 on longitudinal grey matter volume and cognitive changes were investigated using linear mixed-effects models. RESULTS: We identified a brain FC phenotype associated with high CeVD burden across all markers. Further, expression of this general CeVD-related FC phenotype and p-tau181 contributed additively, but not synergistically, to baseline and longitudinal grey matter volumes and cognitive changes. DISCUSSION: Our findings suggest that CeVD exerts global effects on the brain connectome and highlight the additive nature of AD and CeVD on neurodegeneration and cognition.

">Representation of visual uniformity in the lateral prefrontal cortex</a></h4>

              
                Visual illusions tend to have early visual cortical correlates. However, this general trend may not apply to our subjective impression of a detailed and uniform visual world, which may be considered illusory given the paucity of peripheral processing. Using a psychophysically calibrated visual illusion, we assessed the patterns of hemodynamic activity in the human brain that distinguished between the illusory percept of uniformity in the periphery (i.e., Gabor patches having identical orientations) from the accurate perception of incoherence. We identified voxel patterns in the lateral prefrontal cortex that predicted perceived uniformity, which could also generalize to scene uniformity in naturalistic movies. Because similar representations of visual uniformity can also be found in the intermediate and late layers of a feedforward convolutional neural network, the perception of uniformity may involve high-level coding of abstract properties of the entire scene as a whole, that is distinct from the filling-in of specific details in early visual areas.

">GPT-3 reveals selective insensitivity to global vs. local linguistic context in speech produced by treatment-naive patients with positive thought disorder</a></h4>

              
                Background: Early psychopathologists proposed that certain features of positive thought disorder, the disorganized language output produced by some people with schizophrenia, suggest an insensitivity to global, relative to local, discourse context. This idea has received support from carefully controlled psycholinguistic studies in language comprehension. In language production, researchers have so far remained reliant on subjective qualitative rating scales to assess and understand speech disorganization. Now, however, recent advances in large language models mean that it is possible to quantify sensitivity to global and local context objectively by probing lexical probability (the predictability of a word given its preceding context) during natural language production. Methods: For each word in speech produced by 60 first-episode psychosis patients and 35 healthy, demographically-matched controls, we extracted lexical probabilities from GPT-3 based on contexts that ranged from very local--a single preceding word: P(Wn | Wn-1)--to global--up to 50 preceding words: P(Wn|Wn-50, Wn-49, ..., Wn-1). Results: We show, for the first time, that disorganized speech is characterized by disproportionate insensitivity to global, versus local, linguistic context. Critically, this global-versus-local insensitivity selectively predicted clinical ratings of positive thought disorder, above and beyond overall symptom severity. There was no evidence of a relationship with negative thought disorder (impoverishment). Conclusions: We provide an automated, interpretable measure that can potentially be used to quantify speech disorganization in schizophrenia. Our findings directly link the clinical phenomenology of thought disorder to neurocognitive constructs that are grounded in psycholinguistic theory and neurobiology.

">Sleep and circadian rhythm activity alterations during adolescence in a mouse model of neonatal fentanyl withdrawal syndrome</a></h4>

              
                Purpose: Fentanyl, a highly potent synthetic opioid, is a major contributor to the ongoing opioid epidemic. During adulthood, fentanyl is known to induce pronounced sleep and circadian disturbances during use and withdrawal. Children exposed to opioids in utero are likely to develop neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, and display sleep disturbances after birth. However, it is currently unknown how neonatal opioid withdrawal from fentanyl impacts sleep and circadian rhythms in mice later in life. Methods: To model neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, mice were treated with fentanyl from postnatal days 1 through 14, analogous to the third trimester of human gestation. After weaning, fentanyl and saline treated mice underwent non-invasive sleep and circadian rhythm monitoring during adolescence postnatal days 23 through 30. Results: Neonatal fentanyl exposure led to reduced duration of wake and a decrease in the number of bouts of non-rapid eye movement sleep. Further, neonatally exposed mice displayed an increase in the average duration of rapid eye movement sleep bouts, reflecting an overall increase in the percent time spent in rapid eye movement sleep across days. Conclusions: Neonatal fentanyl exposure leads to altered sleep-wake states during adolescence in mice.

">Decision-making shapes dynamic inter-areal communication within macaque ventral frontal cortex</a></h4>

              
                Macaque ventral frontal cortex is comprised of a set of anatomically heterogeneous and highly interconnected areas. Collectively these areas have been implicated in many higher-level affective and cognitive processes, most notably the adaptive control of decision-making. Despite this appreciation, little is known about how subdivisions of ventral frontal cortex dynamically interact with each other during decision-making. Here we assessed functional interactions between areas by analyzing the activity of thousands of single neurons recorded from eight anatomically defined subdivisions of ventral frontal cortex in macaques performing a visually guided two-choice probabilistic task for different fruit juices. We found that the onset of stimuli and reward delivery globally increased communication between all parts of ventral frontal cortex. Inter-areal communication was, however, temporally specific, occurred through unique activity subspaces between areas, and depended on the encoding of decision variables. In particular, areas 12l and 12o showed the highest connectivity with other areas while being more likely to receive information from other parts of ventral frontal cortex than to send it. This pattern of functional connectivity suggests a role for these two areas in integrating diverse sources of information during decision processes. Taken together, our work reveals the specific patterns of inter-areal communication between anatomically connected subdivisions of ventral frontal cortex that are dynamically engaged during decision-making.

">The biomechanical state of the effector affects motor control and provides measures of single trial inhibition in a stop signal task</a></h4>

              
                The Stop Signal Task (SST) has been the benchmark for studying the behavioral and physiological basis of movement generation and inhibition. In our study, we extended the scope beyond physiological findings related to muscle activity, focusing our analysis on the initial biomechanical state of the effector. By incorporating a force sensitive resistor (FSR), we continuously monitored the force applied by the effector (here the index finger) during a button release version of the SST. This modified task design allowed us to examine both the baseline force before the relevant Go signal was presented and during the covert state of movement preparation. Notably, variations in force over time in response to the Go signal revealed differences across trials where movement was either generated or successfully inhibited, depending on the amount of force during the baseline period. Specifically, higher baseline force was associated with a delayed movement generation, which simultaneously slowed down the force release, facilitating successful inhibition when requested. Our results highlight the influence of biomechanical variables in movement control, which should be accounted for by the models developed for investigating the physiology of this ability.

Fast subsecond fluctuations in neuronal population responses dominate the temporal dynamics of neural circuits. Traditional approaches have treated this activity as "noise" that can be averaged away by taking the mean spiking rate over wide time bins or over multiple trial repetitions, but this ignores much of the temporal dynamics that naturally occur in neural systems. We find that subsecond flares of increased population activity are layer- and cell-type specific, and large-scale computational modelling suggests they may serve as an inter-areal gating mechanism. Moreover, we find that most of the neural variability is restricted to a population-gain axis. This observation explains why neural systems can function in the presence of excessive variability: population-level spiking dynamics generate invariance to the majority of neural noise.

">Tau phosphorylation suppresses oxidative stress-induced mitophagy via FKBP8 receptor modulation</a></h4>

              
                Neurodegenerative diseases are often characterized by mitochondrial dysfunction. In Alzheimer's disease, abnormal tau phosphorylation disrupts mitophagy, a quality control process through which damaged organelles are selectively removed from the mitochondrial network. The precise mechanism through which this occurs remains unclear. Previously, we showed that tau which has been mutated at Thr-231 to glutamic acid to mimic an Alzheimer's-relevant phospho-epitope expressed early in disease selectively inhibits oxidative stress-induced mitophagy in C. elegans. Here, we use immortalized mouse hippocampal neuronal cell lines to extend that result into mammalian cells. Specifically, we show that phosphomimetic tau at Ser-396/404 (EC) or Thr-231/Ser-235 (EM) partly inhibits mitophagy induction by paraquat, a potent inducer of mitochondrial oxidative stress. Moreover, a combination of immunologic and biochemical approaches demonstrates that the levels of the mitophagy receptor FKBP8, significantly decrease in response to paraquat in cells expressing EC or EM tau mutants, but not in cells expressing wildtype tau. In contrast, paraquat treatment results in a decrease in the levels of the mitophagy receptors FUNDC1 and BNIP3 in the presence of both wildtype tau and the tau mutants. Interestingly, FKBP8 is normally trafficked to the endoplasmic reticulum during oxidative stress induced mitophagy, and our results support a model where this trafficking is impacted by disease-relevant tau, perhaps through a direct interaction. We provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying tau pathology in Alzheimer's disease and highlight FKBP8 receptor as a potential target for mitigating mitochondrial dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases.

">Pharmacological rescue of motor circuit dysfunction in a Drosophila model of paroxysmal dyskinesia</a></h4>

              
                Background: Paroxysmal dyskinesias (PxDs) are characterised by bouts of involuntary dystonic and choreiform movements. The patho-mechanisms underlying these debilitating disorders remain poorly understood, and drug treatments are often limited. We recently generated a Drosophila model of a PxD-linked mutation causing BK potassium channel gain-of-function (BK GOF), and showed that BK GOF perturbs movement in Drosophila by disrupting neurodevelopment. However, whether locomotor capacity in BK GOF flies can be pharmacologically restored following neurodevelopmental insults has remained unclear. Objective: To identify pharmacological suppressors of motor defects caused by BK GOF. Methods: Using adult BK GOF flies, we performed an unbiased, in vivo, locomotion-based screen of 370 FDA-approved drugs. To test the impact of positive hits from this screen on motor circuit activity, we used optical imaging to record the intrinsic rhythmic activity of Drosophila larval motor circuits driving peristalsis and turning behaviors. Results: We found that inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase - a protein that degrades acetylcholine in cholinergic synapses - partially rescued movement defects caused by BK GOF. Inhibition of acetylcholinesterase also partially restored intrinsic activity of motor circuits controlling forward movement and turning in BK GOF larvae. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that elevating cholinergic tone can reverse motor circuit dysfunction in an animal model of PxD caused by BK GOF. Furthermore, our study provides proof-of-principle that Drosophila can be utilised for screens to uncover putative drug treatments for involuntary movement disorders.

">Frontal Theta Oscillations and Cognitive Flexibility: Age-Related Modulations in EEG Activity</a></h4>

              
                Cognitive flexibility, the ability to adapt one's behaviour in changing environments, declines during aging. Electroencephalography (EEG) studies demonstrate that the P300 and midfrontal theta oscillations are sensitive to attentional set-shifting - a measure of cognitive flexibility. Few is known about the electrocortical modulations underlying set-shifting in healthy older adults. Here, we investigated aging effects on set-shifting performance by analysing the P300 and theta power in 20 young (mean age: 22.5 {+/-} 2.9 years) and 19 older (mean age: 69.4 {+/-} 6.1 years) adults. While increasing shift difficulty (e.g. intra- vs. extradimensional shifts) led to increased reaction times (RTs) and higher error rates in both age groups, older adults showed an additional increase in RT variability. Older adults showed higher P300 latencies and P300 amplitude decreased during set-shifting in both groups. Young adults exhibited amplified midfrontal theta power with increasing shift difficulty whereas older adults showed an overall decrease. This study suggests that set-shifting in healthy older adults occurs without midfrontal theta modulation indicating that different neural substrates are recruited compared to young adults.

">Novel quantal analysis method reveals conservation of injected charge by excitatory synapses across cortical cells of different sizes</a></h4>

              
                In chemical synapses of the central nervous system (CNS), information is transmitted via the presynaptic release of a vesicle (or 'quantum') of neurotransmitter, which elicits a postsynaptic electrical response with an amplitude termed the 'quantal size'. This key determinant of neural computation is hard to measure reliably due to its small size and the multiple sources of noise within neurons and electrophysiological recordings. Measuring amplitudes of miniature postsynaptic currents (mPSCs) or potentials (mPSPs) at the cell soma potentially offers a technically straightforward way to estimate quantal sizes, as each of these miniature responses (or 'minis') is elicited by the spontaneous release of a single neurotransmitter vesicle. However, a somatically recorded mini is typically massively attenuated compared with at its input site, and a significant fraction are indistinguishable from (or cancelled out by) background noise fluctuations. Here we describe a novel quantal analysis method that estimates electrical size of the synapse by combining separate somatic recordings of background physiological noise and minis with simulations. With the help of a genetic algorithm, simulations are successfully used to infer the combined amplitude and rise time distribution of minis that would otherwise be inaccessible due to low signal to noise ratio. The estimated distributions reveal a striking inverse dependence of mean minis' amplitudes on cell's total capacitance (a proxy for the size of cells) that firmly supports the conservation of the electrical size of excitatory cortical synapses in rats. We incorporate the novel quantal analysis method into our patch clamp data analysis software called 'minis'.

">Age-related differences in working memory subprocesses decomposed by the reference-back paradigm</a></h4>

              
                We used a data-driven approach to study the electrophysiological correlates of the working memory subprocesses revealed by the reference-back paradigm. In the absence of prior research, we focused on how aging affects the four subprocesses: updating, substitution, gate opening, and gate closing. We conducted our experiment with 25 younger adults (M=20.17{+/-}1.47) and 23 older adults (M=67.35{+/-}4.01) using the reference-back paradigm. Significant reaction time costs were observed for all four subprocesses, but age-related differences were found only in substitution, which was larger in older than younger adults, indicating it as being the most vulnerable subprocess in aging. Using difference waves, we identified event-related potential components that characterize the subprocesses we studied. Regarding updating: three occipital negativities between 80-180 ms, 300-400 ms, and 400-1,000 ms were observed, with only the latter range showing age group differences. Source analysis showed larger activity differences in the right frontal and temporal areas for younger adults. Regarding substitution: a frontal positivity between 250-600 ms emerged in younger adults, while a posterior positivity between 550-750 ms was found in older adults indicating different underlying processes supported by sLORETA results. Regarding gate opening: three parieto-occipital components were identified: a negativity between 150-250 ms, a positivity between 300-500 ms, and a positivity between 500-700 ms, all showing age-related differences. Regarding gate closing: we found an occipital negativity between 150-300 ms and a frontal positivity between 300-600 ms, neither of which changed between the age groups. From our findings, we conclude that the process of protecting information (gate closing) remains stable with age, despite older adults' sensitivity to interference. Conversely, gate opening is sensitive to age-related changes, likely to be resulting in different brain activity patterns during substitution being the updating of working memory with new information.

">Structurally targeted mutagenesis identifies key residues supporting α-synuclein misfolding in multiple system atrophy</a></h4>

              
                Multiple system atrophy (MSA) and Parkinsons disease (PD) are caused by misfolded -synuclein spreading throughout the central nervous system. While familial PD is linked to several point mutations in -synuclein, there are no known mutations associated with MSA. Our previous work investigating differences in -synuclein misfolding between the two disorders showed that the familial PD mutation E46K inhibits replication of MSA prions both in vitro and in vivo, providing key evidence to support the hypothesis that -synuclein adopts unique strains in patients. Here, to further interrogate -synuclein misfolding, we engineered a panel of cell lines harboring both PD-linked and novel mutations designed to identify key residues that facilitate -synuclein misfolding in MSA. These data were paired with in silico analyses using Maestro software to predict the effect of each mutation on the ability of -synuclein to misfold into one of the reported MSA cryo-electron microscopy conformations. In many cases, our modeling accurately identified mutations that facilitated or inhibited MSA replication. However, Maestro was occasionally unable to predict the effect of a mutation on MSA propagation in vitro, demonstrating the challenge of using computational tools to investigate intrinsically disordered proteins. Finally, we used our cellular models to determine the mechanism underlying the E46K-driven inhibition of MSA replication, finding that the E46/K80 salt bridge is necessary to support -synuclein misfolding. Overall, our studies use a structure-based approach to investigate -synuclein misfolding, resulting in the creation of a powerful panel of cell lines that can be used to interrogate MSA strain biology.

	<p>Glioblastoma is the most common and malignant primary brain tumor, with high morbidity and mortality. Despite an aggressive, multimodal treatment regimen, including surgical resection followed by chemotherapy and radiotherapy, the prognosis of glioblastoma patients remains poor. One formidable challenge to advancing glioblastoma therapy is the complexity of the tumor microenvironment. The tumor microenvironment of glioblastoma is a highly dynamic and heterogeneous system that consists of not only cancerous cells but also various resident or infiltrating inflammatory cells. These inflammatory cells not only provide a unique tumor environment for glioblastoma cells to develop and grow but also play important roles in regulating tumor aggressiveness and treatment resistance. Targeting the tumor microenvironment, especially neuroinflammation, has increasingly been recognized as a novel therapeutic approach in glioblastoma. In this review, we discuss the components of the tumor microenvironment in glioblastoma, focusing on neuroinflammation. We discuss the interactions between different tumor microenvironment components as well as their functions in regulating glioblastoma pathogenesis and progression. We will also discuss the anti-tumor microenvironment interventions that can be employed as potential therapeutic targets.</p>

	<p>This study aimed to identify when and how eye movements change across the human lifespan to benchmark developmental biomarkers. The sample size comprised 45,696 participants, ranging in age from 6 to 80 years old (M = 30.39; SD = 17.46). Participants completed six eye movement tests: Circular Smooth Pursuit, Horizontal Smooth Pursuit, Vertical Smooth Pursuit, Horizontal Saccades, Vertical Saccades, and Fixation Stability. These tests examined all four major eye movements (fixations, saccades, pursuits, and vergence) using 89 eye-tracking algorithms. A semi-supervised, self-training, machine learning classifier was used to group the data into age ranges. This classifier resulted in 12 age groups: 6&amp;amp;ndash;7, 8&amp;amp;ndash;11, 12&amp;amp;ndash;14, 15&amp;amp;ndash;25, 26&amp;amp;ndash;31, 32&amp;amp;ndash;38, 39&amp;amp;ndash;45, 46&amp;amp;ndash;53, 54&amp;amp;ndash;60, 61&amp;amp;ndash;68, 69&amp;amp;ndash;76, and 77&amp;amp;ndash;80 years. To provide a descriptive indication of the strength of the self-training classifier, a series of multiple analyses of variance (MANOVA) were conducted on the multivariate effect of the age groups by test set. Each MANOVA revealed a significant multivariate effect on age groups (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Developmental changes in eye movements across age categories were identified. Specifically, similarities were observed between very young and elderly individuals. Middle-aged individuals (30s) generally showed the best eye movement metrics. Clinicians and researchers may use the findings from this study to inform decision-making on patients&amp;amp;rsquo; health and wellness and guide effective research methodologies.</p>

                Introduction Biofeedback is a non-pharmacological treatment option valued for its minimal risk of adverse events and offers a safe alternative for individuals seeking preventive care for migraine. Despite level A evidence for migraine prevention, biofeedback treatment is still unavailable to most patients. We developed a novel medical device (Cerebri) for multimodal biofeedback treatment that omits the need for healthcare personnel involvement. Cerebri consists of a smartphone application (app) and two wireless sensors. Unique in its approach, the Cerebri app seamlessly integrates three biofeedback modalities – heart rate variability, temperature, and electromyography – making it a comprehensive, therapist-independent solution for non-pharmacological migraine management. Methods Biofeedback therapy using Cerebri for the prevention of migraine attacks in adults with episodic migraine (The BioCer study) was an open-label, randomized, waitlist-controlled, multicenter trial. This study investigated the safety and efficacy of daily home-based biofeedback sessions using the Cerebri device. A total of 286 participants will be randomized to either a 12-week intervention arm or waitlist control arm. The primary outcome was the change in the mean number of migraine days from baseline to the last 28-day period during the treatment phase in the treatment group compared with the control group. The primary outcome variable was prospectively collected through daily eDiary entries. Ethics and Dissemination Approval from the ethics committee and competent authorities was obtained prior to study initiation. Participation was voluntary and informed and written consent was obtained prior to inclusion.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-774/v1?src=rss">Digital well-being in children and youth: Protocol for a comprehensive systematic review of reviews on interventions of problematic digital technology use [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Digital technologies proliferate in many people’s lives around the world with over 65% of these technology users being online. Children and youth are among the most prominent adopters of digital technologies in forms such as video gaming, social media, and online shopping. Problematic use of digital technologies can lead to poorer school/work performance, neglect of self-care skills, and comorbidities with other mental health issues. However, when used non-problematically, digital technology can also contribute to improving health and well-being. With the abundance of literature published, many reviews have sought to collate literature on treatment and interventions for children and youth with varying results. Thus, our proposed systematic review aims to synthesize current systematic reviews and meta-analyses on interventions and treatment of problematic digital technology use in children and youth (up to 25 years old). Methods As part of a three-paper series, a systematic search was completed in PsycINFO, Web of Science, and PubMed databases. Grey literature databases of the World Health Organization (IRIS database) and ClinicalTrials.gov were also searched. Furthermore, hand-searching of reference lists was also conducted. Title and abstract screening, followed by full-text screening, were completed by at least two independent reviewers. For this review, the extractions and the quality of selected reviews will be assessed using AMSTAR 2.0 by two authors independently and reviewed by two additional authors. Results Results will be presented in narrative and tabular form. The results of this study are expected to offer insights into the populations of children and youth studied, treatments/interventions provided, outcomes, results, limitations, and conclusions of literature from the past five years. Feasibility and generalizability of the reviews will also be discussed. Conclusions Methodological strengths and weaknesses of reviewed studies will point to gaps in knowledge and can be used to inform future areas of policy and research.

                <p>Measuring the dynamic relationship between neuromodulators, such as dopamine, and neuronal action potentials is imperative to understand how these fundamental modes of neural signaling interact to mediate behavior. We developed methods to measure concurrently dopamine and extracellular action potentials (i.e., spikes) in monkeys. Standard fast-scan cyclic voltammetric (FSCV) electrochemical (EChem) and electrophysiological (EPhys) recording systems are combined and used to collect spike and dopamine signals, respectively, from an array of carbon fiber (CF) sensors implanted in the monkey striatum. FSCV requires the application of small voltages at the implanted sensors to measure redox currents generated from target molecules, such as dopamine. These applied voltages create artifacts at neighboring EPhys measurement sensors which may lead to misclassification of these signals as physiological spikes. Therefore, simple automated temporal interpolation algorithms were designed to remove these artifacts and enable accurate spike extraction. We validated these methods using simulated artifacts and demonstrated an average spike recovery rate of 84.5%. We identified and discriminated cell type-specific units in the monkey striatum that were shown to correlate to specific behavioral task parameters related to reward size and eye movement direction. Synchronously recorded spike and dopamine signals displayed contrasting relations to the task variables, suggesting a complex relationship between these two modes of neural signaling. Future application of our methods will help advance our understanding of the interactions between neuromodulator signaling and neuronal activity, to elucidate more detailed mechanisms of neural circuitry and plasticity mediating behaviors in health and in disease.</p>

                <p>Preparing acute brain slices produces trauma that mimics severe penetrating brain injury. In neonatal acute brain slices, the spatiotemporal characteristics of trauma-induced calcium dynamics in neurons and its effect on network activity are relatively unknown. Using multiphoton laser scanning microscopy of the somatosensory neocortex in acute neonatal mouse brain slices (P8&ndash;12), we simultaneously imaged neuronal Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics (GCaMP6s) and cytotoxicity (propidium iodide or PI) to determine the relationship between cytotoxic Ca<sup>2+</sup> loaded neurons (GCaMP-filled) and cell viability at different depths and incubation times. PI<sup>+</sup> cells and GCaMP-filled neurons were abundant at the surface of the slices, with an exponential decrease with depth. Regions with high PI<sup>+</sup> cells correlated with elevated neuronal and neuropil Ca<sup>2+</sup>. The number of PI<sup>+</sup> cells and GCaMP-filled neurons increased with prolonged incubation. GCaMP-filled neurons did not participate in stimulus-evoked or seizure-evoked network activity. Significantly, the superficial tissue, with a higher degree of trauma-induced injury, showed attenuated seizure-related neuronal Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses. Calpain inhibition prevented the increase in PI<sup>+</sup> cells and GCaMP-filled neurons in the deep tissue and during prolonged incubation times. Isoform-specific pharmacological inhibition implicated calpain-2 as a significant contributor to trauma-induced injury in acute slices. Our results show a calpain-mediated spatiotemporal relationship between cell death and aberrant neuronal Ca<sup>2+</sup> load in acute neonatal brain slices. Also, we demonstrate that neurons in acute brain slices exhibit altered physiology depending on the degree of trauma-induced injury. Blocking calpains may be a therapeutic option to prevent acute neuronal death during traumatic brain injury in the young brain.</p>

                Background The discovery of an ideal and effective therapy is urgently required for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease. The main pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease that appear before the clinical symptoms are neurofibrillary tangles, amyloid plaques, brain inflammation, and neuronal atrophy throughout the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. GSK-3β (Glycogen Synthase Kinase-3β) is regarded as the most important and promising target for therapeutic use because GSK-3β expression levels increase with age and are the most abundant and hyperactive in the brains of patients with Alzheimer’s disease. Methods We used Maestro, which is Schrodinger, for our computational simulation studies. In the present work, we have used different modules that were used in previous studies with a little modification, the modules such as Protein Preparation with the help of Protein Preparation Wizard, Ligand Preparation with the help of LigPrep, for ADME (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism and Excretion) prediction we used Qikprop, Docking studies we used Glide module, Binding energy prediction we used Prime and Molecular dynamic simulation studies by Desmond Results Our focus is mainly on an in-silico approach, focusing on library generation; we first drew an imidazo [1,5-a]pyridine-3-carboxamide (IMID 2) scaffold structure at Enamine and subjected it to a substructure search to target the receptor grid region (ATP-competitive site) of 6Y9R. They were then subjected to various screening processes. Finally, we selected nine compounds and subjected them to molecular dynamic simulation studies. Conclusions Nine compounds showed good results with the most stable interactions. Further experiments and studies are required to confirm these results.

                Photobiomodulation (PBM) has demonstrated positive effects on bone healing after fracture. This case report describes a skateboard-related shoulder anterior dislocation with Bankart and Hill-Sachs lesions. After a non-invasive reduction, the patient received conservative treatment with PBM. PBM was started on the accident day and continued daily for 30 days, followed by bi-weekly irradiation for 33 months. In the initial 30 days, the patient’s pain decreased, and the shoulder function was recovered with no pain, swelling, or bruising. On day 28, there was a reduction in edema compared to the initial injury and a full shoulder recovery for daily and sports activities. Physical examinations confirmed shoulder joint stability and the images at 33 months demonstrated Hill-Sachs lesion healing and significant Bankart lesion repair. In conclusion, PBM can induce recovery, alleviate pain, and facilitate functional rehabilitation. Additional clinical trials are required to validate the efficacy of this complementary therapy.

                Background Determinant and characteristic polynomials are important concepts related to square matrices. Due to the absence of additive inverse in max-plus algebra, the determinant of a matrix over max-plus algebra can be represented by a permanent. In addition, there are several types of square matrices over max-plus algebra, including triangular and diagonal strictly double ℝ -astic matrices. A special formula has been devised to determine the permanent and characteristic max-polynomial of those matrices. Another algebraic structure that is isomorphic with max-plus algebra is min-plus algebra. Methods Min-plus algebra is the algebraic structure of triple ( ℝ ε ′ , ⊕ ′ , ⊗ ) . Furthermore, square matrices over min plus algebra are defined by the set of matrices sized n × n , the entries of which are the elements of ℝ ε ′ . Because these two algebraic structures are isomorphic, the permanent and characteristic min-polynomial can also be determined for each square matrix over min-plus algebra, as well as the types of matrices. Results In this paper, we find out the special formulas for determining the permanent and characteristic min-polynomial of the triangular matrix and the diagonal strictly double ℝ -astic matrix. Conclusions We show that the formula for determining the characteristic min-polynomial of the two matrices is the same, for each triangular matrix and strictly double ℝ -astic matrix A , χ A ( x ) = ⨁ r = 0 , 1 , … , n ′ δ n − r ⊗ n r .

                Background Because of its close relationship with vessels that supply the thyroid gland, it is necessary to understand and document the course of the laryngeal nerves to prevent accidental damage. Otherwise it can lead to weakness in vocal cord function if ligated along with the arteries during thyroidectomy or other surgical procedures. The aim of our study was to examine and document the origin, relationship, and branching patterns of the laryngeal nerves on the side of the neck. Method The present cross sectional anatomical study was conducted on 64 dissected necks of formalin-fixed cadavers that were utilized for undergraduate teaching purposes. Different parameters were measured in the neck along with the relationship between the laryngeal nerves and their accompanying arteries. Results We observed usual and unusual course of laryngeal nerves along with some variations. Some of the novel findings were an internal laryngeal nerve piercing the thyroid cartilage lamina and an external laryngeal nerve communicating with the superior cervical ganglion. Conclusion The present study observed anatomical variations in the course of the laryngeal nerves, which are relevant for clinical practice. The potential risks of damage to these laryngeal nerves during various surgical procedures make it necessary to review and compile its relationship with the surrounding structures.

                Background Cardiac amyloidosis, characterized by the deposition of amyloid proteins in the heart tissue, presents in two main types: transthyretin (ATTR) and light-chain (AL) amyloidosis. The hemodynamic response to exercise and the relationship with pulmonary hypertension (PH) in these patients is not well understood. Methods This retrospective study analyzed 100 patients diagnosed with either ATTR or AL amyloidosis. We assessed the prevalence of PH at rest and its induction during exercise stress tests. Hemodynamic parameters were measured to identify differences in the cardiac response to exercise between the two subtypes. Results A higher prevalence of PH was noted in the ATTR group compared to the AL group. Exercise stress tests induced significant PH, particularly in the ATTR subgroup. Subtle yet clinically relevant hemodynamic differences were observed between the amyloidosis subtypes. Conclusions Our findings suggest that the amyloidosis subtype is an important factor in the management of PH. There is a need for tailored clinical approaches to address the distinct pathophysiological mechanisms in ATTR and AL amyloidosis. This study contributes to a better understanding of the hemodynamic changes during exercise in cardiac amyloidosis and underscores the importance of subtype-specific management strategies.

                Background The Liver is a vital organ in the human body, which plays a crucial role in various physiological processes. Oxidative stress is a critical factor in the pathogenesis and progression of various liver diseases, contributing to cellular damage and dysfunction. The Liver is particularly vulnerable to the harmful effects of reactive oxygen species when the balance between their production and the body’s antioxidant defense mechanisms is disrupted. The nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) pathway has emerged as a promising therapeutic target for liver diseases due to its pivotal role in cellular defense against oxidative stress and inflammation. Plants have always been a source of drugs which has been used to treat various pharmacological disorders and most of its activity is due to its potential as an antioxidant. However, the specific mechanisms by which they interact with the NRF2 pathway and confer protection against liver diseases remain inadequately elucidated. Therefore, this scoping review aims to identify and analyze the existing literature pertaining to the relationship between Phytomolecules, which can modulate NRF2 and protect against liver diseases. Methods The proposed scoping review will follow the steps given by “Arksey and O’Malley and Levac et al”. Electronic databases (PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, etc.) will be searched for recent relevant studies. A predefined criterion for the inclusion and exclusion of studies will be independently adopted by two reviewers. The review will be presented as per the “Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses Extension for Scoping Review (PRISMA-ScR)” guidelines. Conclusion The scoping review finding is expected to help understanding the role of Phytomolecules in preventing liver diseases by modulating the NRF2 pathway. Ultimately, this review will serve as a foundational step toward developing targeted interventions to improve liver health outcomes and reduce the global burden of liver diseases.

[version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background The degree of intratumoral lipiodol staining after conventional transarterial chemoembolization (cTACE) has the potential to predict tumor responses and disease prognosis. This study is aimed at evaluating the correlation between the lipiodol retention of the tumor with a complete response after cTACE and tumor recurrence by quantitative assessment. Methods From January 2013 to September 2023, every patient receiving cTACE for HCC was recognized. Inclusion criteria were patients with ≤6 HCCs and sizes 1-6 cm, with at least one tumor obtaining a complete response after cTACE, and available baseline and follow-up CT studies. Tumoral, cTACE procedural, and lipiodol staining parameters were analyzed. Using univariate and multivariate analysis, significant factors associated with tumor recurrence were identified. ROC curve analysis was used to identify the optimal cutoff point for the statistically significant factors, predicting tumor recurrence. Results The final population included 39 patients with 63 HCCs. Tumor recurrence was detected in 18/63 (28.6%) at a mean of 27.8 months. On univariate analysis, the incidence of tumor recurrence significantly increased with increased tumor size (p = 0.007), an inhomogeneous lipiodol staining pattern (p<0.001), a low minimum lipiodol radiodensity (p = 0.012), and a high lipiodol washout rate (p = 0.046). On multivariate analysis, an inhomogeneous lipiodol staining pattern (p<0.001) and a high lipiodol washout rate (p = 0.012) were significant predictors for tumor recurrence. On ROC analysis, a lipiodol washout rate of greater than 6.44 HU/month was related to tumor recurrence (sensitivity 83%, specificity 51%). Conclusions Inhomogeneous lipiodol staining pattern and lipiodol washout rate of >6.44 HU/month were predictors for recurrence of HCC after a complete response after cTACE. These correlations may provide useful guidance for subsequent imaging surveillance and treatment approaches.

                Background Education of ‘108' ambulance personnel involved in transporting neonates may improve outcomes. We assessed i) perceptions/practices of ‘108’ ambulance personnel for transporting neonates, ii) clinical parameters of transported neonates at arrival, and iii) outcomes such as survival/mortality and NICU stay (before and after skill-based educational intervention). Methods We conducted a single-arm intervention study (pre-and post) over 18 months. We assessed the perceptions and practices of 77 ambulance personnel on neonatal transport pre- versus post-intervention. Checklists assessed ambulance equipment availability/usage in both phases. We compared clinical parameters and outcomes of transported neonates between the pre-intervention (n=62) and post-intervention (n=53) phases. We analyzed data using SPSS version 25. Results Post-intervention, there was a significant reduction in the levels of hypothermia (p < 0.001), hypoglycemia (p=0.010), and prolonged capillary refill time (p=0.042), along with improvement in the use of intravenous fluids (p <0.001), a reduction in the positivity of umbilical swab growth (p=0.002) and in the duration of NICU stay (p = 0.001), significant improvement (p < 0.001) in the perceptions/practices of ambulance personnel towards neonatal transport. There was an improvement in the ambulance equipment availability/usage post-intervention. Conclusions The perceptions and practices of the ‘108’ ambulance towards transporting neonates had significantly improved post-educational intervention. Further, a significant decrease in hypothermia, hypoglycemia, and duration of NICU stay was seen in neonates transported post-intervention.

                Background and aim Hypertension (HTN) is a significant public health concern worldwide, affecting approximately a third of people during their lifetimes. There are many factors that influence people with HTN to develop cardiovascular disease, such as lifestyle, genetics, economics, overall health, and medications; the authors did not find any previous study employing Multi-Attribute Utility Theory (MAUT) analysis using machine learning. There is a sense of urgency to understand the characteristics of HTN patients in Pakistan; by using MAUT to analyze and evaluate different factors related to developing HTN, we can gain valuable insights into the characteristics of HTN and cardiovascular HTN (HTN-CVD) patients in Pakistan. Methods and results This study utilized a cross-sectional survey with 98 participants diagnosed with HTN and HTN-CVD. The questionnaire included sociodemographic items, symptoms, heredity factors, and dietary habits. The study was approved by the Research Ethical Committees of Pir Mehr Ali Shah Arid Agriculture University Rawalpindi (PMAS-AAUR), Pakistan. The result shows that there is a wide difference between HTN and HTN-CVD patients’ scores for symptoms (37% vs. 63%) and economic status (39% vs. 61%) (respectively). Other than these, the attribute proportions of scores for HTN and HTN-CVD are almost the same. The highest MAUT scores were higher for patients with HTN-CVD (373) than for those with HTN alone (270), and the mean age of HTN patients is higher than HTN-CVD; almost all attributes’ groups of the 10 highest MAUT scores of HTN-CVD higher than HTN patients except for attribute of medication status. Conclusion Patients with HTN-CVD complications have higher MAUT scores for lifestyle, social status, health status, and economic status. This emphasizes the importance of educating patients (and indeed the general public) about risks, symptoms, and adopting healthy behaviors.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-136/v2?src=rss">Diagnosis and Molecular Characterization of Dermatophytosis: An Observational Study [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Dermatophytes are the keratinophilic fungi which infect humans and is the most recurring type of disease. The high level of transmissibility creates an epidemiological risk and emphasises the significance of these illnesses. However, a growing number of reports describing dermatophytes can cause deep infections in diabetic and immunocompromised patients, by invading deep layers like the dermis and hypodermis. Despite the prevalence and significance of dermatophytes in clinical mycology, it is not always possible to accurately diagnose this specific infection due to its overlapping structures among species of dermatophytes. Since it is difficult to identify species that exhibit weak characteristics in the morphological highlights, identification of the dermatophyte is often relied on its morphological analysis, which is a laborious process and demands skill. The massive shift in genetic variation, the source of infection, and epidemiological research can be discovered using molecular approaches. Therefore, the development of an accurate laboratory test for dermatophyte species identification is essential for the prevention and efficient management of dermatophytoses. One such methodology allows use of PCR technology which has many methods for molecular level characterization which is rapid, efficient, and capable of producing DNA polymorphisms specific to various dermatophyte species based on distinctive band patterns seen by agarose gel electrophoresis. The RAPD-PCR approach will be used in this study protocol to molecularly characterize the dermatophytes for precise speciation of the sample. In addition to improving knowledge of fungal biology and pathology with a focus on adaptive mechanisms to combat difficult conditions from host counteractions, there is a need to improve awareness of the importance of these diseases through accurate epidemiological data. The advantages of molecular approaches for characterizing objects over traditional methods are their sensitivity and specificity.

                Abstract* This report details a rare case of corneal infection caused by Medicopsis romeroi, highlighting clinical presentation, diagnostic methods, treatment, and outcome. An early adolescence male, after recent corneal tear repair, presented acute eye pain, redness, and decreased vision for 1 day. He underwent corneal tear repair elsewhere post vegetative matter-related swimming injury. Ophthalmic examination revealed a 2.5*3.3mm ulcer around sutures. Corneal scrapings enabled microscopy and culture. With lesion worsening, tissue adhesive (TA) and bandage contact lens (BCL) were applied. Fungal culture identified Medicopsis romeroi. Patient's history, clinical course, and treatment were documented. Microscopy unveiled fungal hyphae, later confirmed as Medicopsis romeroi. Treatment included topical/systemic antifungals. Post-TA + BCL, significant improvement followed, with re-epithelialization, scarring. This report underscores the importance of considering rare fungal pathogens like Medicopsis romeroi in cases of corneal ulcers, especially in individuals with unusual risk factors. Timely diagnosis through microscopy and fungal culture, coupled with tailored antifungal treatment led to successful management and favorable patient outcomes. This case also emphasizes the significance of vigilant clinical observation, precise laboratory analysis, and multidisciplinary collaboration between ophthalmologists and microbiologists in managing atypical ocular infections.

                Background COVID-19 has heavily impacted the financial and economic well-being of the world’s population. Various national relief programs and initiatives have been carried out to address society’s financial difficulties, especially the issue of poverty among the vulnerable, like refugees and immigrants. Consequently, being one of the main elements in Islamic social finance, waqf has been emphasised and proven throughout Islamic history as one of the practical tools for poverty reduction. However, recent waqf initiatives towards poverty reduction focused more on aiding the micro and small entrepreneurs, whilst limited waqf initiatives were available to help low-income households, refugees, and immigrants during this critical time in Malaysia. Methods This study introduces a novel waqf model, specifically designed to contribute to poverty reduction in society. It is tailored for low-income households, refugees, and immigrants, aiming to sustain their financial independence. By combining the elements of waqf and crowdfunding, this model proposes an innovative agriculture-based microfinance programme. It utilizes undeveloped waqf lands and equity-based crowdfunding to reach its objective of poverty reduction. This study has adopted a secondary research approach using the existing scholarly literature. Results This paper also discusses the potential of the proposed model to deliver more than its primary objective, as the framework illustrates that waqf institutions will have a continuous inflow of funds that will allow them to initiate other waqf-based projects, job creation through the microfinance programmes, and financial return for the investor of equity-based crowdfunding projects. Conclusion This study not only underscores the sustainability of the proposed model, but also its alignment with the increasing awareness of value-based and social impact objectives. It further explores the potential of waqf to be integrated with other financing instruments during the pandemic to help the vulnerable, specifically refugees and immigrants. This research thus contributes to the true purpose of Islamic social finance, highlighting the significance of its findings.

                Background The improper management of hazardous solid waste in dental care offices poses significant risks to public health and the environment. Dental offices generate hazardous waste, including biological and chemical contaminants, which can lead to infections, pollution, and harm if not managed properly. Effective waste management practices are crucial, yet compliance varies significantly across regions, especially in Latin America, due to limited resources, inadequate training, and insufficient infrastructure. This study compares hazardous waste management practices in dental offices in Talara, Peru, and Machala, Ecuador, to provide actionable recommendations for improvement. Policy and Implications In Peru, hazardous waste management involves critical steps such as conditioning, segregation, transport, storage, treatment, and disposal. Compliance minimizes exposure risks and environmental contamination. Ecuador emphasizes administrative and operational aspects, including policies, records, training, and procedures. Improving practices in both countries can model enhanced waste management across Latin America. Recommendations To address challenges in Talara and similar Latin American cities, it is essential to strengthen administrative systems, increase budget allocations for waste management, and develop comprehensive training programs. Waste management should be prioritized within public policy agendas with clear guidelines and accountability measures. Both cities need improved resource allocation, modern waste treatment facilities, and centralized storage solutions. Continuous education and certification programs are crucial. Implementing integrated policies, regular reviews, and robust compliance mechanisms based on Machala’s practices can benefit other regions. Public awareness campaigns and regional collaboration through workshops and research initiatives are also recommended. Conclusions Significant disparities in hazardous waste management exist between Talara and Machala. Talara requires strengthened systems and improved infrastructure, while Machala’s practices serve as a model. Tailored interventions can enhance public health and environmental outcomes across Latin America. Regular monitoring, evaluation, and collaboration are essential for sustained improvements.

                Lymphomas of the oral and oropharyngeal regions are rather uncommon, and diagnosis can be challenging and confusing due to the multiple histological subgroups. Lymphomas are the third most common type of tumor in the head and neck region and are brought on by the lymphoreticular system. The two forms of lymphoma are Hodgkin’s lymphoma and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL). Herein, we present a case report of oropharyngeal lymphoma. The female patient reported with a complaint of swelling over the palatal region for two to three months. An ulceroproliferative lesion was evident over the posterior palatal region. We diagnosed reactive lymphadenitis based on an incisional biopsy. To confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions, a punch biopsy followed by immunohistochemical studies were done. Features suggestive of activated B-cell-diffuse large B-cell lymphoma were confirmed. Among malignant lymphomas, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is the most prevalent variety. Much progress has been made in recent years in understanding the molecular pathophysiology of this disease. In this case report, we aim to correlate the clinical presentation, histology features and immunohistochemical significance in order to promote early discovery, diagnosis, and treatment for a better prognosis of the patient.

                <p>by Yingjun Ma, Yuanyuan Ma</p>

Identifying the association and corresponding types of miRNAs and diseases is crucial for studying the molecular mechanisms of disease-related miRNAs. Compared to traditional biological experiments, computational models can not only save time and reduce costs, but also discover potential associations on a large scale. Although some computational models based on tensor decomposition have been proposed, these models usually require manual specification of numerous hyperparameters, leading to a decrease in computational efficiency and generalization ability. Additionally, these linear models struggle to analyze complex, higher-order nonlinear relationships. Based on this, we propose a novel framework, KBLTDARD, to identify potential multiple types of miRNA–disease associations. Firstly, KBLTDARD extracts information from biological networks and high-order association network, and then fuses them to obtain more precise similarities of miRNAs (diseases). Secondly, we combine logistic tensor decomposition and Bayesian methods to achieve automatic hyperparameter search by introducing sparse-induced priors of multiple latent variables, and incorporate auxiliary information to improve prediction capabilities. Finally, an efficient deterministic Bayesian inference algorithm is developed to ensure computational efficiency. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets show that KBLTDARD has better Top-1 precision, Top-1 recall, and Top-1 F1 for new type predictions, and higher AUPR, AUC, and F1 values for new triplet predictions, compared to other state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, case studies demonstrate the efficiency of KBLTDARD in predicting multiple types of miRNA-disease associations.

                <p>by Ulrik Hvid, Namiko Mitarai</p>

T-even bacteriophages are known to employ lysis inhibition (LIN), where the lysis of an infected host is delayed in response to secondary adsorptions. Upon the eventual burst of the host, significantly more phage progenies are released. Here, we analysed the competitive advantage of LIN using a mathematical model. In batch culture, LIN provides a bigger phage yield at the end of the growth where all the hosts are infected due to an exceeding number of phage particles and, in addition, gives a competitive advantage against LIN mutants with rapid lysis by letting them adsorb to already infected hosts in the LIN state. By simulating plaque formation in a spatially structured environment, we show that, while LIN phages will produce a smaller zone of clearance, the area over which the phages spread is actually comparable to those without LIN. The analysis suggests that LIN induced by secondary adsorption is favourable in terms of competition, both in spatially homogeneous and inhomogeneous environments.

                <p>by Haocheng Zhu, Ulrik Beierholm, Ladan Shams</p>

Psychological and neuroscientific research over the past two decades has shown that the Bayesian causal inference (BCI) is a potential unifying theory that can account for a wide range of perceptual and sensorimotor processes in humans. Therefore, we introduce the BCI Toolbox, a statistical and analytical tool in Python, enabling researchers to conveniently perform quantitative modeling and analysis of behavioral data. Additionally, we describe the algorithm of the BCI model and test its stability and reliability via parameter recovery. The present BCI toolbox offers a robust platform for BCI model implementation as well as a hands-on tool for learning and understanding the model, facilitating its widespread use and enabling researchers to delve into the data to uncover underlying cognitive mechanisms.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011696">Phenotypic memory in quorum sensing</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Ghazaleh Ostovar, James Q. Boedicker</p>

Quorum sensing (QS) is a regulatory mechanism used by bacteria to coordinate group behavior in response to high cell densities. During QS, cells monitor the concentration of external signals, known as autoinducers, as a proxy for cell density. QS often involves positive feedback loops, leading to the upregulation of genes associated with QS signal production and detection. This results in distinct steady-state concentrations of QS-related molecules in QS-ON and QS-OFF states. Due to the slow decay rates of biomolecules such as proteins, even after removal of the initial stimuli, cells can retain elevated levels of QS-associated biomolecules for extended periods of time. This persistence of biomolecules after the removal of the initial stimuli has the potential to impact the response to future stimuli, indicating a memory of past exposure. This phenomenon, which is a consequence of the carry-over of biomolecules rather than genetic inheritance, is known as "phenotypic" memory. This theoretical study aims to investigate the presence of phenotypic memory in QS and the conditions that influence this memory. Numerical simulations based on ordinary differential equations and analytical modeling were used to study gene expression in response to sudden changes in cell density and extracellular signal concentrations. The model examined the effect of various cellular parameters on the strength of QS memory and the impact on gene regulatory dynamics. The findings revealed that QS memory has a transient effect on the expression of QS-responsive genes. These consequences of QS memory depend strongly on how cell density was perturbed, as well as various cellular parameters, including the Fold Change in the expression of QS-regulated genes, the autoinducer synthesis rate, the autoinducer threshold required for activation, and the cell growth rate.

                <p>by Gustavo Magaña-López, Laurence Calzone, Andrei Zinovyev, Loïc Paulevé</p>

Boolean networks are largely employed to model the qualitative dynamics of cell fate processes by describing the change of binary activation states of genes and transcription factors with time. Being able to bridge such qualitative states with quantitative measurements of gene expressions in cells, as scRNA-seq, is a cornerstone for data-driven model construction and validation. On one hand, scRNA-seq binarisation is a key step for inferring and validating Boolean models. On the other hand, the generation of synthetic scRNA-seq data from baseline Boolean models provides an important asset to benchmark inference methods. However, linking characteristics of scRNA-seq datasets, including dropout events, with Boolean states is a challenging task.
We present scBoolSeq, a method for the bidirectional linking of scRNA-seq data and Boolean activation state of genes. Given a reference scRNA-seq dataset, scBoolSeq computes statistical criteria to classify the empirical gene pseudocount distributions as either unimodal, bimodal, or zero-inflated, and fit a probabilistic model of dropouts, with gene-dependent parameters. From these learnt distributions, scBoolSeq can perform both binarisation of scRNA-seq datasets, and generate synthetic scRNA-seq datasets from Boolean traces, as issued from Boolean networks, using biased sampling and dropout simulation. We present a case study demonstrating the application of scBoolSeq’s binarisation scheme in data-driven model inference. Furthermore, we compare synthetic scRNA-seq data generated by scBoolSeq with BoolODE’s, data for the same Boolean Network model. The comparison shows that our method better reproduces the statistics of real scRNA-seq datasets, such as the mean-variance and mean-dropout relationships while exhibiting clearly defined trajectories in two-dimensional projections of the data.

                <p>by Jesper J. Madsen, Y. Zenmei Ohkubo</p>

Membrane binding is a crucial mechanism for many proteins, but understanding the specific interactions between proteins and membranes remains a challenging endeavor. Coagulation factor Va (FVa) is a large protein whose membrane interactions are complicated due to the presence of multiple anchoring domains that individually can bind to lipid membranes. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we investigate the membrane binding of FVa and identify the key mechanisms that govern its interaction with membranes. Our results reveal that FVa can either adopt an upright or a tilted molecular orientation upon membrane binding. We further find that the domain organization of FVa deviates (sometimes significantly) from its crystallographic reference structure, and that the molecular orientation of the protein matches with domain reorganization to align the C2 domain toward its favored membrane-normal orientation. We identify specific amino acid residues that exhibit contact preference with phosphatidylserine lipids over phosphatidylcholine lipids, and we observe that mostly electrostatic effects contribute to this preference. The observed lipid-binding process and characteristics, specific to FVa or common among other membrane proteins, in concert with domain reorganization and molecular tilt, elucidate the complex membrane binding dynamics of FVa and provide important insights into the molecular mechanisms of protein-membrane interactions. An updated version of the HMMM model, termed extHMMM, is successfully employed for efficiently observing membrane bindings of systems containing the whole FVa molecule.

                <p>by Mason A. McCool, Carson J. Bryant, Laura Abriola, Yulia V. Surovtseva, Susan J. Baserga</p>

Cancer initiates as a consequence of genomic mutations and its subsequent progression relies in part on increased production of ribosomes to maintain high levels of protein synthesis for unchecked cell growth. Recently, cytidine deaminases have been uncovered as sources of mutagenesis in cancer. In an attempt to form a connection between these 2 cancer driving processes, we interrogated the cytidine deaminase family of proteins for potential roles in human ribosome biogenesis. We identified and validated APOBEC3A and APOBEC4 as novel ribosome biogenesis factors through our laboratory’s established screening platform for the discovery of regulators of nucleolar function in MCF10A cells. Through siRNA depletion experiments, we highlight APOBEC3A’s requirement in making ribosomes and specific role within the processing and maturation steps that form the large subunit 5.8S and 28S ribosomal (r)RNAs. We demonstrate that a subset of APOBEC3A resides within the nucleolus and associates with critical ribosome biogenesis factors. Mechanistic insight was revealed by transient overexpression of both wild-type and a catalytically dead mutated APOBEC3A, which both increase cell growth and protein synthesis. Through an innovative nuclear RNA sequencing methodology, we identify only modest predicted APOBEC3A C-to-U target sites on the pre-rRNA and pre-mRNAs. Our work reveals a potential direct role for APOBEC3A in ribosome biogenesis likely independent of its editing function. More broadly, we found an additional function of APOBEC3A in cancer pathology through its function in ribosome biogenesis, expanding its relevance as a target for cancer therapeutics.

                <p>by Omer Sharon, Eti Ben Simon, Vyoma D. Shah, Tenzin Desel, Matthew P. Walker</p>

In the past 20 years, more remarkable revelations about sleep and its varied functions have arguably been made than in the previous 200. Building on this swell of recent findings, this essay provides a broad sampling of selected research highlights across genetic, molecular, cellular, and physiological systems within the body, networks within the brain, and large-scale social dynamics. Based on this raft of exciting new discoveries, we have come to realize that sleep, in this moment of its evolution, is very much polyfunctional (rather than monofunctional), yet polyfunctional for reasons we had never previously considered. Moreover, these new polyfunctional insights powerfully reaffirm sleep as a critical biological, and thus health-sustaining, requisite. Indeed, perhaps the only thing more impressive than the unanticipated nature of these newly emerging sleep functions is their striking divergence, from operations of molecular mechanisms inside cells to entire group societal dynamics.

                Fibroblasts are mesenchymal cells that are responsible for creating and maintaining tissue architecture through the production of extracellular matrix. These cells also play critical roles in processes such as wound repair and immune modulation in normal tissues and various disease states including fibrosis, autoimmunity, and cancer. Fibroblasts have a complex repertoire of functions that vary by organ, inflammatory state, and the developmental stage of an organism. How fibroblasts manage so many functions in such a context-dependent manner represents a gap in our understanding of these cells. One possibility is that a tissue-resident precursor cell state exists that provides the fibroblast lineage with flexibility during growth, inflammation, or other contexts that require dynamic tissue changes. Recent work has suggested that a precursor fibroblast cell state is marked by expression of Peptidase inhibitor 16 (Pi16). This review aims to concatenate and compare studies on fibroblasts that express Pi16 to clarify the roles of this cell state in fibroblast lineage development and other functions.

                Abstract* Hypoglossal nerve injuries are classified according to their anatomical localization in: Infranuclear, nuclear, and supranuclear. Supranuclear injuries can occur in cerebral cortex, corticobulbar tracts, internal capsule, cerebral peduncles, or in the pons, and most often caused by a stroke. These lesions usually do not generate a significant alteration of tongue motility due to the bilateral innervation of both nuclei from the cortex. We present a case of a 43-year-old male with dysarthria, left central facial paralysis, and an important tongue palsy and deviation to the same side. Brain CT revealed a right frontotemporal stroke with little hemorrhagic transformation, and an EKG that showed auricular fibrillation. He received treatment with amiodarone and rivaroxaban was initiated when a second brain CT scan showed no evidence of hemorrhage. This case is remarkable due the unusual presentation in a supranuclear lesion of the hypoglossal nerve. It is important to enrich the semiology and consider the possibility of cortical cerebrovascular events in patients with acute deviation of the tongue, even in the absence of involvement of other cranial nerves; or marked ipsilateral motor implication.

                Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic is caused by SARS-CoV-2 that has infected more than 600 million people and killed more than 6 million people worldwide. This infection affects mainly certain groups of people that have high susceptibility to present severe COVID-19 due to comorbidities. Moreover, the long-COVID-19 comprises a series of symptoms that may remain in some patients for months after infection that further compromises their health. Thus, since this pandemic is profoundly affecting health, economy, and social life of societies, a deeper understanding of viral replication cycle could help to envisage novel therapeutic alternatives that limit or stop COVID-19. Several findings have unexpectedly discovered that mitochondria play a critical role in SARS-CoV-2 cell infection. Indeed, it has been suggested that this organelle could be the origin of its replication niches, the double membrane vesicles (DMV). In this regard, mitochondria derived vesicles (MDV), involved in mitochondria quality control, discovered almost 15 years ago, comprise a subpopulation characterized by a double membrane. MDV shedding is induced by mitochondrial stress, and it has a fast assembly dynamic, reason that perhaps has precluded their identification in electron microscopy or tomography studies. These and other features of MDV together with recent SARS-CoV-2 protein interactome and other findings link SARS-CoV-2 to mitochondria and support that these vesicles are the precursors of SARS-CoV-2 induced DMV. In this work, the morphological, biochemical, molecular, and cellular evidence that supports this hypothesis is reviewed and integrated into the current model of SARS-CoV-2 cell infection. In this scheme, some relevant questions are raised as pending topics for research that would help in the near future to test this hypothesis. The intention of this work is to provide a novel framework that could open new possibilities to tackle SARS-CoV-2 pandemic through mitochondria and DMV targeted therapies.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92764">Human promoter directionality is determined by transcriptional initiation and the opposing activities of INTS11 and CDK9</a></h4>

              
                RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) transcription initiates bidirectionally at many human protein-coding genes. Sense transcription usually dominates and leads to messenger RNA production, whereas antisense transcription rapidly terminates. The basis for this directionality is not fully understood. Here, we show that sense transcriptional initiation is more efficient than in the antisense direction, which establishes initial promoter directionality. After transcription begins, the opposing functions of the endonucleolytic subunit of Integrator, INTS11, and cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9) maintain directionality. Specifically, INTS11 terminates antisense transcription, whereas sense transcription is protected from INTS11-dependent attenuation by CDK9 activity. Strikingly, INTS11 attenuates transcription in both directions upon CDK9 inhibition, and the engineered recruitment of CDK9 desensitises transcription to INTS11. Therefore, the preferential initiation of sense transcription and the opposing activities of CDK9 and INTS11 explain mammalian promoter directionality.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92990">Chemoproteomics validates selective targeting of Plasmodium M1 alanyl aminopeptidase as an antimalarial strategy</a></h4>

              
                New antimalarial drug candidates that act via novel mechanisms are urgently needed to combat malaria drug resistance. Here, we describe the multi-omic chemical validation of <i>Plasmodium</i> M1 alanyl metalloaminopeptidase as an attractive drug target using the selective inhibitor, MIPS2673. MIPS2673 demonstrated potent inhibition of recombinant <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> (<i>Pf</i>A-M1) and <i>Plasmodium vivax</i> (<i>Pv</i>A-M1) M1 metalloaminopeptidases, with selectivity over other <i>Plasmodium</i> and human aminopeptidases, and displayed excellent in vitro antimalarial activity with no significant host cytotoxicity. Orthogonal label-free chemoproteomic methods based on thermal stability and limited proteolysis of whole parasite lysates revealed that MIPS2673 solely targets <i>Pf</i>A-M1 in parasites, with limited proteolysis also enabling estimation of the binding site on <i>Pf</i>A-M1 to within ~5 Å of that determined by X-ray crystallography. Finally, functional investigation by untargeted metabolomics demonstrated that MIPS2673 inhibits the key role of <i>Pf</i>A-M1 in haemoglobin digestion. Combined, our unbiased multi-omic target deconvolution methods confirmed the on-target activity of MIPS2673, and validated selective inhibition of M1 alanyl metalloaminopeptidase as a promising antimalarial strategy.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90318">EEG-fMRI in awake rat and whole-brain simulations show decreased brain responsiveness to sensory stimulations during absence seizures</a></h4>

              
                In patients suffering absence epilepsy, recurring seizures can significantly decrease their quality of life and lead to yet untreatable comorbidities. Absence seizures are characterized by spike-and-wave discharges on the electroencephalogram associated with a transient alteration of consciousness. However, it is still unknown how the brain responds to external stimuli during and outside of seizures. This study aimed to investigate responsiveness to visual and somatosensory stimulation in Genetic Absence Epilepsy Rats from Strasbourg (GAERS), a well-established rat model for absence epilepsy. Animals were imaged under non-curarized awake state using a quiet, zero echo time, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) sequence. Sensory stimulations were applied during interictal and ictal periods. Whole-brain hemodynamic responses were compared between these two states. Additionally, a mean-field simulation model was used to explain the changes of neural responsiveness to visual stimulation between states. During a seizure, whole-brain responses to both sensory stimulations were suppressed and spatially hindered. In the cortex, hemodynamic responses were negatively polarized during seizures, despite the application of a stimulus. The mean-field simulation revealed restricted propagation of activity due to stimulation and agreed well with fMRI findings. Results suggest that sensory processing is hindered or even suppressed by the occurrence of an absence seizure, potentially contributing to decreased responsiveness during this absence epileptic process.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94709">Early evolution of the ecdysozoan body plan</a></h4>

              
                Extant ecdysozoans (moulting animals) are represented by a great variety of soft-bodied or articulated organisms that may or may not have appendages. However, controversies remain about the vermiform nature (i.e. elongated and tubular) of their ancestral body plan. We describe here <i>Beretella spinosa</i> gen. et sp. nov. a tiny (maximal length 3 mm) ecdysozoan from the lowermost Cambrian, Yanjiahe Formation, South China, characterized by an unusual sack-like appearance, single opening, and spiny ornament. <i>Beretella spinosa</i> gen. et sp. nov has no equivalent among animals, except <i>Saccorhytus coronarius</i>, also from the basal Cambrian. Phylogenetic analyses resolve both fossil species as a sister group (Saccorhytida) to all known Ecdysozoa, thus suggesting that ancestral ecdysozoans may have been non-vermiform animals. Saccorhytids are likely to represent an early off-shot along the stem-line Ecdysozoa. Although it became extinct during the Cambrian, this animal lineage provides precious insight into the early evolution of Ecdysozoa and the nature of the earliest representatives of the group.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/87292">DHODH inhibition enhances the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade by increasing cancer cell antigen presentation</a></h4>

              
                Pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis is a druggable metabolic dependency of cancer cells, and chemotherapy agents targeting pyrimidine metabolism are the backbone of treatment for many cancers. Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) is an essential enzyme in the de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway that can be targeted by clinically approved inhibitors. However, despite robust preclinical anticancer efficacy, DHODH inhibitors have shown limited single-agent activity in phase 1 and 2 clinical trials. Therefore, novel combination therapy strategies are necessary to realize the potential of these drugs. To search for therapeutic vulnerabilities induced by DHODH inhibition, we examined gene expression changes in cancer cells treated with the potent and selective DHODH inhibitor brequinar (BQ). This revealed that BQ treatment causes upregulation of antigen presentation pathway genes and cell surface MHC class I expression. Mechanistic studies showed that this effect is (1) strictly dependent on pyrimidine nucleotide depletion, (2) independent of canonical antigen presentation pathway transcriptional regulators, and (3) mediated by RNA polymerase II elongation control by positive transcription elongation factor B (P-TEFb). Furthermore, BQ showed impressive single-agent efficacy in the immunocompetent B16F10 melanoma model, and combination treatment with BQ and dual immune checkpoint blockade (anti-CTLA-4 plus anti-PD-1) significantly prolonged mouse survival compared to either therapy alone. Our results have important implications for the clinical development of DHODH inhibitors and provide a rationale for combination therapy with BQ and immune checkpoint blockade.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93052">Sex-specific resilience of neocortex to food restriction</a></h4>

              
                Mammals have evolved sex-specific adaptations to reduce energy usage in times of food scarcity. These adaptations are well described for peripheral tissue, though much less is known about how the energy-expensive brain adapts to food restriction, and how such adaptations differ across the sexes. Here, we examined how food restriction impacts energy usage and function in the primary visual cortex (V1) of adult male and female mice. Molecular analysis and RNA sequencing in V1 revealed that in males, but not in females, food restriction significantly modulated canonical, energy-regulating pathways, including pathways associated waith AMP-activated protein kinase, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha, mammalian target of rapamycin, and oxidative phosphorylation. Moreover, we found that in contrast to males, food restriction in females did not significantly affect V1 ATP usage or visual coding precision (assessed by orientation selectivity). Decreased serum leptin is known to be necessary for triggering energy-saving changes in V1 during food restriction. Consistent with this, we found significantly decreased serum leptin in food-restricted males but no significant change in food-restricted females. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that cortical function and energy usage in female mice are more resilient to food restriction than in males. The neocortex, therefore, contributes to sex-specific, energy-saving adaptations in response to food restriction.

                The visual space is sampled by cortical field maps in which nearby neuronal populations encode nearby locations of images received from the retina. Whether this retinotopic cortical organization already emerges in the prenatal human brain before visual experience is currently unknown. To answer this question in vivo, we applied population connective field modeling to 526 functional magnetic resonance imaging datasets ranging from prenatal to young adult age. We found retinotopically organized eccentricity and polar angle connectivity maps in V2 of the visual cortex as early as in the 21st week of gestation while connective field model fits increased significantly throughout development. These results highlight that retinotopic cortical maps develop in the second trimester of pregnancy, predating visual experience.

">Humans forage for reward in reinforcement learning tasks</a></h4>

              
                How do we make good decisions in uncertain environments? In psychology and neuroscience, the classic answer is that we calculate the value of each option and then compare the values to choose the most rewarding, modulo some exploratory noise. An ethologist, conversely, would argue that we commit to one option until its value drops below a threshold, at which point we start exploring other options. In order to determine which view better describes human decision-making, we developed a novel, foraging-inspired sequential decision-making model and used it to ask whether humans compare to threshold ("Forage") or compare alternatives ("Reinforcement-Learn" [RL]). We found that the foraging model was a better fit for participant behavior, better predicted the participants' tendency to repeat choices, and predicted the existence of held-out participants with a pattern of choice that was almost impossible under RL. Together, these results suggest that humans use foraging computations, rather than RL, even in classic reinforcement learning tasks.

">Default Mode Network activation at task switches reflects mental task-set structure</a></h4>

              
                Recent findings challenge traditional views of the Default Mode Network (DMN) as purely task-negative or self-oriented, showing increased DMN activity during demanding switches between externally-focused tasks (Crittenden et al., 2015; Smith et al., 2018; Zhou et al., 2024). However, it is unclear what modulates the DMN at switches, with transitions within a stimulus domain activating DMN regions in some studies but not others. Differences in the number of tasks suggest that complexity or structure of the set of tasks may be important. In this fMRI study, we examined whether the DMN's response to task switches depends on the complexity of the active set of tasks, manipulated by the number of tasks in a run, or abstract task groupings based on instructional order. Core DMN activation at task switches was unaffected by the number of currently relevant tasks. Instead, it depended on the order in which groups of tasks had been learnt. Multivariate decoding revealed that Core DMN hierarchically represents individual tasks, task domains, and higher-order task groupings based on instruction order. We suggest that, as the complexity of instructions increases, rules are increasingly organized into higher-level chunks, and Core DMN activity is highest at switches between chunks.

">Beta-frequency sensory stimulation enhances gait rhythmicity through strengthened coupling between striatal networks and stepping movement</a></h4>

              
                Stepping movement is delta (1-4 Hz) rhythmic and depends on sensory inputs. In addition to delta rhythms, beta (10-30 Hz) frequency dynamics are also prominent in the motor circuits and are coupled to neuronal delta rhythms both at the network and the cellular levels. Since beta rhythms are broadly supported by cortical and subcortical sensorimotor circuits, we explore how beta-frequency sensory stimulation influences delta-rhythmic stepping movement, and dorsal striatal circuit regulation of stepping. We delivered audiovisual stimulation at 10 Hz or 145 Hz to mice voluntarily locomoting, while simultaneously recording stepping movement, striatal cellular calcium dynamics and local field potentials (LFPs). We found that 10 Hz, but not 145 Hz stimulation prominently entrained striatal LFPs. Even though sensory stimulation at both frequencies promoted locomotion and desynchronized striatal network, only 10 Hz stimulation enhanced the delta rhythmicity of stepping movement and strengthened the coupling between stepping and striatal LFP delta and beta oscillations. These results demonstrate that higher frequency sensory stimulation can modulate lower frequency dorsal striatal neural dynamics and improve stepping rhythmicity, highlighting the translational potential of non-invasive beta-frequency sensory stimulation for improving gait.

                The capacity of the brain to compensate for insults during development depends on the type of cell loss, whereas the consequences of genetic mutations in the same neurons are difficult to predict. We reveal powerful compensation from outside the cerebellum when the excitatory cerebellar output neurons are ablated embryonically and demonstrate that the minimum requirement for these neurons is for motor coordination and not learning and social behaviors. In contrast, loss of the homeobox transcription factors Engrailed1/2 (EN1/2) in the cerebellar excitatory lineage leads to additional deficits in adult learning and spatial working memory, despite half of the excitatory output neurons being intact. Diffusion MRI indicates increased thalamo-cortico-striatal connectivity in En1/2 mutants, showing that the remaining excitatory neurons lacking En1/2 exert adverse effects on extracerebellar circuits regulating motor learning and select non-motor behaviors. Thus, an absence of cerebellar output neurons is less disruptive than having cerebellar genetic mutations.

                Up to 30% of epilepsy patients suffer from drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE). The search for innovative therapies is therefore important to close the existing treatment gap in these patients. The adenosinergic system possesses potent anticonvulsive effects, mainly through the adenosine A1 receptor (A1R). However, clinical application of A1R agonists is hindered by severe systemic side effects. To achieve local modulation of A1Rs, we employed a photopharmacological approach using a caged version of the A1R agonist N6-cyclopentyladenosine, termed cCPA. We performed the first in vivo study with intracerebroventricularly (ICV) administered cCPA to investigate the potential to uncage sufficient amounts of cCPA in the hippocampus by local illumination in order to suppress hippocampal excitability and seizures in mice. Using hippocampal evoked potential recordings, we showed a reduction in hippocampal neurotransmission after photo-uncaging of cCPA, similar to that obtained with ICV injection of CPA. Furthermore, in the intrahippocampal kainic acid mouse model for DRE, photo-uncaging of CPA in the epileptic hippocampus resulted in a strong suppression of seizures. Finally, we demonstrated that intrahippocampal photo-uncaging of CPA resulted in less impairment of motor performance in the rotarod test compared to ICV administration of CPA. These results provide a proof of concept for photopharmacological A1R modulation as an effective precision treatment for DRE.

">Calcium-triggered (de)ubiquitination events in synapses</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal communication relies on neurotransmitter release from synaptic vesicles (SVs), whose dynamics are controlled by calcium-dependent pathways, as many thoroughly studied phosphorylation cascades. However, little is known about other post-translational modifications, as ubiquitination. To address this, we analysed resting and stimulated synaptosomes (isolated synapses) by quantitative mass spectrometry. We identified more than 5,000 ubiquitination sites on [~]2,000 proteins, the majority of which participate in SV recycling processes. Several proteins showed significant changes in ubiquitination in response to calcium influx, with the most pronounced changes in CaMKII and the clathrin adaptor protein AP180. To validate this finding, we generated a CaMKII mutant lacking the ubiquitination target site (K291) and analysed it both in neurons and non-neuronal cells. K291 ubiquitination influences CaMKII activity and synaptic function by modulating its autophosphorylation at a functionally important site (T286). We suggest that ubiquitination in response to synaptic activity is an important regulator of synaptic function.

">EM-Compressor: Electron Microscopy Image Compression in Connectomics with Variational Autoencoders</a></h4>

              
                The ongoing pursuit to map detailed brain structures at high resolution using electron microscopy (EM) has led to advancements in imaging that enable the generation of connectomic volumes that have reached the petabyte scale and are soon expected to reach the exascale for whole mouse brain collections. To tackle the high costs of managing these large-scale datasets, we have developed a data compression approach employing Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to significantly reduce data storage requirements. Due to their ability to capture the complex patterns of EM images, our VAE models notably decrease data size while carefully preserving important image features pertinent to connectomics-based image analysis. Through a comprehensive study using human EM volumes (H01 dataset), we demonstrate how our approach can reduce data to as little as 1/128th of the original size without significantly compromising the ability to subsequently segment the data, outperforming standard data size reduction methods. This performance suggests that this method can greatly alleviate requirements for data management for connectomics applications, and enable more efficient data access and sharing. Additionally, we developed a cloud-based application named EM-Compressor on top of this work to enable on-the-fly interactive visualization: https://em-compressor-demonstration.s3.amazonaws.com/EM-Compressor+App.mp4.

">Astroglial atrophy associates with loss of nuclear S100A10 in the hippocampus of aged male tree shrews</a></h4>

              
                Astrocytes are glial cells that participate in multiple physiological functions, such as protecting neurons against all types of damage. However, astrocytes develop morphological alterations during aging, such as decreased length, volume, and branch points of their processes, also known as astrocytic atrophy. Until now, the exact mechanism associated with the onset of atrophy is unknown. Tree shrew (Tupaia belangeri) is a long-lived animal from the Scadentia order that develops several age-dependent brain alterations. In this study, we analyzed the morphology of GFAP+ astrocytes in the hippocampal region of adult, old, and aged male tree shrews. Aged animals presented more GFAP+ astrocytes in the proximal subiculum, CA3, and CA2-CA1 subregions than younger animals, being significantly higher only in CA3. However, in aged subjects, the number of atrophic astrocytes was significantly higher in the dentate gyrus and CA2 subregion compared to old animals. Interestingly, in the proximal subiculum, astrocytes had a reduced arborization at all ages evaluated. S100A10, a protein overexpressed by neuroprotective-type astrocytes, was mainly found in the nucleus of astrocytes of adult and old subjects. However, in old and aged animals, S100A10 was located in the cytoplasmic compartment of atrophic astrocytes. Furthermore, in astrocytes of aged tree shrews, cytoplasmic inclusions of S100A10 colocalized with the nuclear export protein, Crm-1. These results suggest that the transport of S100A10 from the nucleus to the cytoplasmic compartment of astrocytes could be a process related to astroglial atrophy during the aging process in the hippocampus of three shrews.

">eLemur: A cellular-resolution 3D atlas of the mouse lemur brain</a></h4>

              
                The gray mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus), one of the smallest living primates, emerges as a promising model organism for neuroscience research. This is due to its genetic similarity to humans, its evolutionary position between rodents and humans, and its primate-like features encapsulated within a rodent-sized brain. Despite its potential, the absence of a comprehensive reference brain atlas impedes the progress of research endeavors in this species, particularly at the microscopic level. Existing references have largely been confined to the macroscopic scale, lacking detailed anatomical information. Here, we present eLemur, a new resource, comprising a repository of high-resolution brain-wide images immunostained with multiple cell type and structural markers, elucidating the cyto- and chemoarchitecture of the mouse lemur brain. Additionally, it encompasses a segmented two-dimensional (2D) reference and 3D anatomical brain atlas delineated into cortical, subcortical, and other vital regions. Furthermore, eLemur includes a comprehensive 3D cell atlas, providing densities and spatial distributions of non-neuronal and neuronal cells across the mouse lemur brain. Accessible via a web-based viewer (https://eeum-brain.com/#/lemurdatasets), the eLemur resource streamlines data sharing and integration, fostering the exploration of new hypotheses and experimental designs using the mouse lemur as a model organism. Moreover, in conjunction with the growing 3D datasets for rodents, non-human primates, and humans, our eLemur 3D digital framework enhances the potential for comparative analysis and translation research, facilitating the integration of extensive rodent study data into human studies.

">Enhancing Perceptual, Attentional, and Working Memory Demands through Variable Practice Schedules: Insights from High-Density EEG Multi-Scale Analyses</a></h4>

              
                Contextual interference (CI) enhances learning by practicing motor tasks in a random order rather than a blocked order. One hypothesis suggests that the benefits arise from enhanced early perceptual/attentional processes, while another posits that better learning is due to highly activated mnemonic processes. We propose to harness high-density electroencephalography in a multi-scale analysis approach, including topographic analyses, source estimations, and functional connectivity, to examine the intertwined dynamics of attentional and mnemonic processes within short time windows. We recorded scalp activity from 35 participants as they performed an aiming task at three different distances, under both random and blocked conditions using a crossover design. Our results showed that topographies associated with processes related to perception/attention (N1, P3a) and working memory (P3b) were more pronounced in the random condition. Source estimation analyses supported these findings, revealing greater involvement of the perceptual ventral pathway and the anterior cingulate and parietal cortices, along with increased functional connectivity in ventral alpha and frontoparietal theta band networks during random practice. Our results suggest that CI is driven, in the random compared to the blocked condition, by enhanced specific processes such as perceptual, attentional, and mnemonic, as well as large-scale general processes.

	<p>Neuroscience has revolved around brain structural changes, functional activity, and connectivity alteration in Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s Disease (PD); however, how the network topology organization becomes altered is still unclear, specifically in Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s patients with severe hyposmia. In this study, we have examined the functional network topological alteration in patients affected by Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s Disease with normal cognitive ability (ODN), Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s Disease with severe hyposmia (ODP), and healthy controls (HCs) using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) data. We have analyzed brain topological organization using popular graph measures such as network segregation (clustering coefficient, modularity), network integration (participation coefficient, path length), small-worldness, efficiency, centrality, and assortativity. Then, we used a feature ranking approach based on the diagonal adaptation of neighborhood component analysis, aiming to determine a graph measure that is sensitive enough to distinguish between these three different groups. We noted significantly lower segregation and local efficiency and small-worldness in ODP compared to ODN and HCs. On the contrary, we did not find differences in network integration in ODP compared to ODN and HCs, which indicates that the brain network becomes fragmented in ODP. At the brain network level, a progressive increase in the DMN (Default Mode Network) was observed from healthy controls to ODN to ODP, and a continuous decrease in the cingulo-opercular network was observed from healthy controls to ODN to ODP. Further, the feature ranking approach has shown that the whole-brain clustering coefficient and small-worldness are sensitive measures to classify ODP vs. ODN, as well as HCs. Looking at the brain regional network segregation, we have found that the cerebellum and limbic, fronto-parietal, and occipital lobes have higher ODP reductions than ODN and HCs. Our results suggest network topological measures, specifically whole-brain segregation and small-worldness decreases. At the network level, an increase in DMN and a decrease in the cingulo-opercular network could be used as biomarkers to characterize ODN and ODP.</p>

	<p>This research on sleep disturbances emerged during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our study investigated the association between self-reported sleep disturbances among teleworkers and the preventive measures employers took to improve their working environment. Answers obtained via a web survey gathered from 1086 teleworkers (517 in the spring of 2021 and 569 in the spring of 2022) were analysed. The odds of self-reported sleep disturbances were significantly higher for all preventive measures in the group of respondents reporting a lack of a particular measure. The highest odds ratios were observed for the statement &amp;amp;ldquo;My employer identified conditions where I am teleworking&amp;amp;rdquo; (adjusted OR = 2.98, 95% CI 2.10&amp;amp;ndash;4.23) and &amp;amp;ldquo;Online team-building events were organised&amp;amp;rdquo; (adjusted OR = 2.85, 95% CI 1.88&amp;amp;ndash;4.35). The results of our study have revealed that workplace interventions that serve as a mediator for sleep disorders, even if they are not directly targeted at managing sleep disturbances or stress, can reduce the number of teleworkers reporting sleep disturbances. According to our knowledge, this is the first study reporting the effectiveness of employer interventions that help teleworkers manage their sleep disturbances.</p>

	<p>Schizophrenia is a chronic psychiatric disorder severely affecting patients&amp;amp;rsquo; functioning and quality of life. Unlike positive symptoms, cognitive impairment and negative symptoms cannot be treated pharmacologically and represent consistent predictors of the illness&amp;amp;rsquo;s prognosis. Cognitive remediation (CR) interventions have been applied to target these symptoms. Brain stimulation also provides promising yet preliminary results in reducing negative symptoms, whereas its effect on cognitive impairment remains heterogeneous. Here, we combined intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) with CR to improve negative symptoms and cognitive impairment in schizophrenia spectrum patients. One hundred eligible patients were invited, and twenty-one participated. We randomized them into four groups, manipulating the stimulation condition (real vs. sham) and CR (no training vs. training). We delivered fifteen iTBS sessions over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex for three weeks, followed (or not) by 50 min of training. Consensus-based clinical and cognitive assessment was administered at baseline and after the treatment, plus at three follow-ups occurring one, three, and six months after the intervention. Mixed-model analyses were run on cognitive and negative symptom scores. The preliminary findings highlighted a marginal modulation of iTBS on negative symptoms, whereas CR improved isolated cognitive functions. We herein discuss the limitations and strengths of the methodological approach.</p>

                Caveolins are a family of transmembrane proteins located in caveolae, small lipid raft invaginations of the plasma membrane. The roles of caveolin-enriched lipid rafts are diverse, and include mechano-protection, lipid homeostasis, metabolism, transport, and cell signaling. Caveolin-1 (Cav-1) and other caveolins were described in endothelial cells and later in various other cell types of the central nervous system (CNS), including neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, microglia, and pericytes. This pancellular presence of caveolins demands a better understanding of their functional roles in each cell type. In this review we describe the various functions of Cav-1 in the cells of normal and pathological brains. Several emerging preclinical findings suggest that Cav-1 could represent a potential therapeutic target in brain disorders.

                Introduction Mitochondria are cell organelles that function as the cell’s main power plant, producing ATP, the main energy molecule in cells. Mitochondria play an important role in the context of neuroprotection, and mitochondrial function has been implicated in various neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Recent research in the field of neuroprotection has focused on the development of therapies that target mitochondria. Natural ingredients have long been used in traditional medicine and show potential as neuroprotective agents. Methods In this work, a literature review methodology is employed to gather data from the Scopus database using the keywords natural agents, herb*, neuroprotective, and mitochondria. The data were analyzed using Biblioshiny and VOSviewer software to produce visualizations and bibliometric maps. We conducted quantitative and qualitative analyses. Results The research trend found are documents by year, most global cited document, most relevant sources, A factorial map illustrating the leading contributors of papers, documents by author, documents by country or territory, documents by subject area, network visualization, overlay visualization of scopus database using vosviewer, density visualization, thematic map, thematic evolution, cluster analysis, qualitative analysis, and word cloud. Conclusions Natural Agent Neurotropik is a natural substance that influences the brain’s nervous system and peripheral nervous system, enhancing cognition, mood, and brain function. Derived from herbs, spices, and herbal products, it has advantages over other natural agents in energy production, brain biogenesis, and neuroprotection.

                <p>CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing represents an exciting avenue to study genes of unknown function and can be combined with genetically encoded tools such as fluorescent proteins, channelrhodopsins, DREADDs, and various biosensors to more deeply probe the function of these genes in different cell types. However, current strategies to also manipulate or visualize edited cells are challenging due to the large size of Cas9 proteins and the limited packaging capacity of adeno-associated viruses (AAVs). To overcome these constraints, we developed an alternative gene editing strategy using a single AAV vector and mouse lines that express Cre-dependent Cas9 to achieve efficient cell-type specific editing across the nervous system. Expressing Cre-dependent Cas9 from a genomic locus affords space to package guide RNAs for gene editing together with Cre-dependent, genetically encoded tools to manipulate, map, or monitor neurons using a single virus. We validated this strategy with three common tools in neuroscience: ChRonos, a channelrhodopsin, for studying synaptic transmission using optogenetics, GCaMP8f for recording Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients using photometry, and mCherry for tracing axonal projections. We tested these tools in multiple brain regions and cell types, including GABAergic neurons in the nucleus accumbens, glutamatergic neurons projecting from the ventral pallidum to the lateral habenula, dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area, and proprioceptive neurons in the periphery. This flexible approach could help identify and test the function of novel genes affecting synaptic transmission, circuit activity, or morphology with a single viral injection.</p>

                <p>Previous studies have shown that ligands that bind to sigma-2 receptor/TMEM97 (s<SUB>2</SUB>R/TMEM97), a transmembrane protein, have anxiolytic/antidepressant-like properties and relieve neuropathic pain-like effects in rodents. Despite medical interest in s<SUB>2</SUB>R/TMEM97, little affective and pain behavioral characterization has been done using transgenic mice, which limits the development of s<SUB>2</SUB>R/TMEM97 as a viable therapeutic target. Using wild-type (WT) and global <I>Tmem97</I> knock-out (KO) mice, we sought to identify the contribution of <I>Tmem97</I> in modulating affective and pain-like behaviors using a battery of affective and pain assays, including open field, light/dark preference, elevated plus maze, forced swim test, tail suspension test, and the mechanical sensitivity tests. Our results demonstrate that female <I>Tmem97</I> KO mice show less anxiety-like and depressive-like behaviors in light/dark preference and tail suspension tests but not in an open field, elevated plus maze, and forced swim tests at baseline. We next performed spared nerve injury in WT and <I>Tmem97</I> KO mice to assess the role of <I>Tmem97</I> in neuropathic pain-induced anxiety and depression. WT mice, but not <I>Tmem97</I> KO mice, developed a prolonged neuropathic pain-induced depressive-like phenotype when tested 10&nbsp;weeks after nerve injury in females. Our results show that <I>Tmem97</I> plays a role in modulating anxiety-like and depressive-like behaviors in naive animals with a significant change in the presence of nerve injury in female mice. Overall, these data demonstrate that <I>Tmem97</I> could be a target to alleviate affective comorbidities of pain disorders.</p>

                Background This study seeks to examine the causal link between financial deepening, national security, ecological footprint, and economic growth in Nigeria, in order to contribute to the contradicting evidence on economic growth drivers. Methods The dynamic ARDL model was employed as the baseline model to establish the link between the phenomena, and the FMOLS and DOLS as robust models using time series data spanning from 1995 to 2022. The FMOLS and DOLS models take into consideration the presence of endogeneity, cross-sectional dependency, and heterogeneity. Results The results demonstrate that whereas ecological footprint has positive and significant long-term relationships with economic growth, financial deepening and national security have negative and significant long-run relationships with economic growth. There was a 34% and 50% correction to the short-term to long-term adjustment speed, respectively. The findings of the Granger causality, interaction terms, marginal (ME), and threshold (TH) effects demonstrate: a) a significant bidirectional causal relationship between national security and economic growth, as well as a one-way significant causal link between financial deepening and economic growth; b) changes in national security and ecological footprint have a significant and negative impact on the financial deepening effect on economic growth; c) significant negative and marginal effects of national security on economic growth, as well as significant positive marginal effects of ecological footprints on economic growth; and d) the impact of financial deepening on economic growth becomes apparent when the increases in the marginal effect of the ecological footprint reach a critical limit over the ( TH CO 2 = 0.981) threshold. Conclusions This study highlights the significant link between Nigeria’s financial deepening, national security, ecological footprint, and economic growth. It recommends that viable policies be put in place to support the development of financial institutions, increasing security infrastructure investment, and promoting renewable energy use for sustainable environment and reduced carbon emissions.

                Background This study aims to develop a vulnerability map for Surabaya using GIS-based Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) to assess the city’s vulnerability to COVID-19. Methods Six key factors influencing vulnerability were identified and their relative importance determined through the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) pairwise comparison matrix. GIS was utilized to classify Surabaya’s vulnerability into five levels: very low, low, medium, high, and very high. Results The resulting vulnerability map provides essential insights for decision-makers, healthcare professionals, and disaster management teams. It enables strategic resource allocation, targeted interventions, and formulation of comprehensive response strategies tailored to specific needs of vulnerable districts. Conclusions Through these measures, Surabaya can enhance its resilience and preparedness, ensuring the well-being of its residents in the face of potential emergency outbreaks.

                Background: The microbiota in the intestine is made up of trillions of living bacteria that coexist with the host. Administration of antibiotics during neonatal infection causes depletion of gut flora resulting in gut dysbiosis. Over the last few decades, probiotics have been created and promoted as microbiota management agents to enrich gut flora. Probiotics decrease the overgrowth of pathogenic bacteria in the gut of preterm neonates, reducing the frequency of nosocomial infections in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICUs). Methods: The systematic review will include randomized control trials (RCTs) of premier neonates with sepsis. Studies will be retrieved from global databases like Cochrane CENTRAL, CINAHL Plus via EBSCO host, MEDLINE via PubMed, EMBASE, SCOPUS, Ovid, Web of Science, ProQuest Medical Library, Microsoft academic, and DOAJ by utilizing database-specific keywords. Screening, data extraction, and critical appraisal of included research will be carried out separately by two review writers. Findings will be reported in accordance with the PRISMS-P 2020 guidelines. Conclusions: The findings of this systematic review will help to translate the evidence-based information needed to encourage the implementation of potential research output in the field of neonatal intensive care, guide best clinical practise, assist policy making and implementation to prevent gut dysbiosis in neonates with sepsis by summarising and communicating the evidence on the topic. PROSPERO registration number: This systematic review protocol has been registered in PROSPERO (Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews) on 10th March 2022. The registration number is CRD42022315980.

                The 2020 world population data sheet indicates that world population is projected to increase from 7.8 billion in 2020 to 9.9 billion by 2050 (Increase of more than 25%). Due to the expected growth in human population, the demand for meats that could improve health status and provide therapeutic benefits is also projected to rise. The dromedary also known as the Arabian camel, or one-humped camel (Camelus dromedarius), a pseudo ruminant adapted to arid climates, has physiological, biological and metabolic characteristics which give it a legendary reputation for surviving in the extreme conditions of desert environments considered restrictive for other ruminants. Camel meat is an ethnic food consumed across the arid regions of Middle East, North-East Africa, Australia and China. For these medicinal and nutritional benefits, camel meat can be a great option for sustainable meat worldwide supply. A considerable amount of literature has been published on technological aspects and quality properties of beef, lamb and pork but the information available on the technological aspects of the meat of the one humped camel is very limited. Camels are usually raised in less developed countries and their meat is as nutritionally good as any other traditional meat source. Its quality also depends on the breed, sex, age, breeding conditions and type of muscle consumed. A compilation of existing literature related to new technological advances in packaging, shelf-life and quality of camel meat has not been reviewed to the best of our knowledge. Therefore, this review attempts to explore the nutritional composition, health benefits of camel meat, as well as various technological and processing interventions to improve its quality and consumer acceptance. This review will be helpful for camel sector and highlight the potential for global marketability of camel meat and to generate value added products.

                <p>by Pau Clusella, Linus Manubens-Gil, Jordi Garcia-Ojalvo, Mara Dierssen</p>

Cognitive disorders, including Down syndrome (DS), present significant morphological alterations in neuron architectural complexity. However, the relationship between neuromorphological alterations and impaired brain function is not fully understood. To address this gap, we propose a novel computational model that accounts for the observed cell deformations in DS. The model consists of a cross-sectional layer of the mouse motor cortex, composed of 3000 neurons. The network connectivity is obtained by accounting explicitly for two single-neuron morphological parameters: the mean dendritic tree radius and the spine density in excitatory pyramidal cells. We obtained these values by fitting reconstructed neuron data corresponding to three mouse models: wild-type (WT), transgenic (TgDyrk1A), and trisomic (Ts65Dn). Our findings reveal a dynamic interplay between pyramidal and fast-spiking interneurons leading to the emergence of gamma activity (∼40 Hz). In the DS models this gamma activity is diminished, corroborating experimental observations and validating our computational methodology. We further explore the impact of disrupted excitation-inhibition balance by mimicking the reduction recurrent inhibition present in DS. In this case, gamma power exhibits variable responses as a function of the external input to the network. Finally, we perform a numerical exploration of the morphological parameter space, unveiling the direct influence of each structural parameter on gamma frequency and power. Our research demonstrates a clear link between changes in morphology and the disruption of gamma oscillations in DS. This work underscores the potential of computational modeling to elucidate the relationship between neuron architecture and brain function, and ultimately improve our understanding of cognitive disorders.

The practical application of new single molecule protein sequencing (SMPS) technologies requires accurate estimates of their associated sequencing error rates. Here, we describe the development and application of two distinct parameter estimation methods for analyzing SMPS reads produced by fluorosequencing. A Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based approach, extends whatprot, where we previously used HMMs for SMPS peptide-read matching. This extension offers a principled approach for estimating key parameters for fluorosequencing experiments, including missed amino acid cleavages, dye loss, and peptide detachment. Specifically, we adapted the Baum-Welch algorithm, a standard technique to estimate transition probabilities for an HMM using expectation maximization, but modified here to estimate a small number of parameter values directly rather than estimating every transition probability independently. We demonstrate a high degree of accuracy on simulated data, but on experimental datasets, we observed that the model needed to be augmented with an additional error type, N-terminal blocking. This, in combination with data pre-processing, results in reasonable parameterizations of experimental datasets that agree with controlled experimental perturbations. A second independent implementation using a hybrid of DIRECT and Powell’s method to reduce the root mean squared error (RMSE) between simulations and the real dataset was also developed. We compare these methods on both simulated and real data, finding that our Baum-Welch based approach outperforms DIRECT and Powell’s method by most, but not all, criteria. Although some discrepancies between the results exist, we also find that both approaches provide similar error rate estimates from experimental single molecule fluorosequencing datasets.

Animals continuously detect information via multiple sensory channels, like vision and hearing, and integrate these signals to realise faster and more accurate decisions; a fundamental neural computation known as multisensory integration. A widespread view of this process is that multimodal neurons linearly fuse information across sensory channels. However, does linear fusion generalise beyond the classical tasks used to explore multisensory integration? Here, we develop novel multisensory tasks, which focus on the underlying statistical relationships between channels, and deploy models at three levels of abstraction: from probabilistic ideal observers to artificial and spiking neural networks. Using these models, we demonstrate that when the information provided by different channels is not independent, linear fusion performs sub-optimally and even fails in extreme cases. This leads us to propose a simple nonlinear algorithm for multisensory integration which is compatible with our current knowledge of multimodal circuits, excels in naturalistic settings and is optimal for a wide class of multisensory tasks. Thus, our work emphasises the role of nonlinear fusion in multisensory integration, and provides testable hypotheses for the field to explore at multiple levels: from single neurons to behaviour.

                <p>by Xun Fu, Jack Withers, Juri A. Miyamae, Talia Y. Moore</p>

Computational models of musculoskeletal systems are essential tools for understanding how muscles, tendons, bones, and actuation signals generate motion. In particular, the OpenSim family of models has facilitated a wide range of studies on diverse human motions, clinical studies of gait, and even non-human locomotion. However, biological structures with many joints, such as fingers, necks, tails, and spines, have been a longstanding challenge to the OpenSim modeling community, especially because these structures comprise numerous bones and are frequently actuated by extrinsic muscles that span multiple joints—often more than three—and act through a complex network of branching tendons. Existing model building software, typically optimized for limb structures, makes it difficult to build OpenSim models that accurately reflect these intricacies. Here, we introduce ArborSim, customized software that efficiently creates musculoskeletal models of highly jointed structures and can build branched muscle-tendon architectures. We used ArborSim to construct toy models of articulated structures to determine which morphological features make a structure most sensitive to branching. By comparing the joint kinematics of models constructed with branched and parallel muscle-tendon units, we found that among various parameters—the number of tendon branches, the number of joints between branches, and the ratio of muscle fiber length to muscle tendon unit length—the number of tendon branches and the number of joints between branches are most sensitive to branching modeling method. Notably, the differences between these models showed no predictable pattern with increased complexity. As the proportion of muscle increased, the kinematic differences between branched and parallel models units also increased. Our findings suggest that stress and strain interactions between distal tendon branches and proximal tendon and muscle greatly affect the overall kinematics of a musculoskeletal system. By incorporating complex muscle-tendon branching into OpenSim models using ArborSim, we can gain deeper insight into the interactions between the axial and appendicular skeleton, model the evolution and function of diverse animal tails, and understand the mechanics of more complex motions and tasks.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012228">Joint modeling of choices and reaction times based on Bayesian contextual behavioral control</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Sarah Schwöbel, Dimitrije Marković, Michael N. Smolka, Stefan Kiebel</p>

In cognitive neuroscience and psychology, reaction times are an important behavioral measure. However, in instrumental learning and goal-directed decision making experiments, findings often rely only on choice probabilities from a value-based model, instead of reaction times. Recent advancements have shown that it is possible to connect value-based decision models with reaction time models. However, typically these models do not provide an integrated account of both value-based choices and reaction times, but simply link two types of models. Here, we propose a novel integrative joint model of both choices and reaction times by combining a computational account of Bayesian sequential decision making with a sampling procedure. This allows us to describe how internal uncertainty in the planning process shapes reaction time distributions. Specifically, we use a recent context-specific Bayesian forward planning model which we extend by a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampler to obtain both choices and reaction times. As we will show this makes the sampler an integral part of the decision making process and enables us to reproduce, using simulations, well-known experimental findings in value based-decision making as well as classical inhibition and switching tasks. Specifically, we use the proposed model to explain both choice behavior and reaction times in instrumental learning and automatized behavior, in the Eriksen flanker task and in task switching. These findings show that the proposed joint behavioral model may describe common underlying processes in these different decision making paradigms.

                <p>by Robyn M. Stuart, Jamie A. Cohen, Cliff C. Kerr, Prashant Mathur, National Disease Modelling Consortium of India , Romesh G. Abeysuriya, Marita Zimmermann, Darcy W. Rao, Mariah C. Boudreau, Serin Lee, Luojun Yang, Daniel J. Klein</p>

In 2020, the WHO launched its first global strategy to accelerate the elimination of cervical cancer, outlining an ambitious set of targets for countries to achieve over the next decade. At the same time, new tools, technologies, and strategies are in the pipeline that may improve screening performance, expand the reach of prophylactic vaccines, and prevent the acquisition, persistence and progression of oncogenic HPV. Detailed mechanistic modelling can help identify the combinations of current and future strategies to combat cervical cancer. Open-source modelling tools are needed to shift the capacity for such evaluations in-country. Here, we introduce the Human papillomavirus simulator (HPVsim), a new open-source software package for creating flexible agent-based models parameterised with country-specific vital dynamics, structured sexual networks, and co-transmitting HPV genotypes. HPVsim includes a novel methodology for modelling cervical disease progression, designed to be readily adaptable to new forms of screening. The software itself is implemented in Python, has built-in tools for simulating commonly-used interventions, includes a comprehensive set of tests and documentation, and runs quickly (seconds to minutes) on a laptop. Performance is greatly enhanced by HPVsim’s multi-scale modelling functionality. HPVsim is open source under the MIT License and available via both the Python Package Index (via pip install) and GitHub (hpvsim.org).

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The physiological aging process is well known for functional decline in visual abilities. Among the components of the visual system, the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (DLG) and superior colliculus (SC) provide a good model for aging investigations, as these structures constitute the main visual pathways for retinal inputs reaching the visual cortex. However, there are limited data available on quantitative morphological and neurochemical aspects in DLG and SC across lifespan. Here, we used optical density to determine immunoexpression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and design-based stereological probes to estimate the neuronal number, total volume, and layer volume of the DLG and SC in marmosets (<i>Callithrix jacchus</i>), ranging from 36 to 143 months of age. Our results revealed an age-related increase in total volume and layer volume of the DLG, with an overall stability in SC volume. Furthermore, a stable neuronal number was demonstrated in DLG and superficial layers of SC (SCv). A decrease in GFAP immunoexpression was observed in both visual centers. The results indicate region-specific variability in volumetric parameter, possibly attributed to structural plastic events in response to inflammation and compensatory mechanisms at the cellular and subcellular level. Additionally, the DLG and SCv seem to be less vulnerable to aging effects in terms of neuronal number. The neuropeptidergic data suggest that reduced GFAP expression may reflect morphological atrophy in the astroglial cells. This study contributes to updating the current understanding of aging effects in the visual system and stablishes a crucial foundation for future research on visual perception throughout the aging process.</p>

                Background As a post-COVID complication in children, multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is important because of its varied and life-threatening manifestations. With this background, this study attempts to focus on MIS-C cases in an underprivileged rural setting in north-eastern India, with most patients being treated with methylprednisolone rather than intravenous immunoglobulin due to financial constraints. Methods In this prospective longitudinal cohort study at MGM Medical College, 27 MIS-C cases diagnosed following WHO criteria were included. Laboratory and radiological investigations, including echocardiography, were performed as required for diagnosis and to assess prognosis. Most patients were treated with methylprednisolone. A follow-up assessment was done six weeks after discharge for any residual impairment. Results The most frequently affected age group was 5–10 years (59.28%), while respiratory (48.14%) and cardiac (40.74%) were the most commonly involved systems. Logistic regression studies established a significant association between serum ferritin level and prolonged hospital stay (coefficient 0.0674, p=0.0041), possibly due to greater complications in cases with high ferritin levels. Organ impairment was found to increase the need for inotrope use (coefficient 3.8797, p=0.00584). Most cases were treated with methylprednisolone alone (85.18%) with a favourable response and no death occurred. Conclusion The favourable response in cases treated with methylprednisolone only affirms the effectiveness of the drug as a cheaper alternative in a resource-poor setting. The study highlights that higher ferritin levels in complicated cases leads to prolonged hospitalisation and the increased need for inotropes in cases with organ impairment.

                Hydatidosis is a pathology that is still common. Hydatid cysts commonly involves the liver and lung. Cases of multi visceral echinococcosis with atypical localization are rare. We, herein, report the case of a 53-year-old Maghrebi farmer with multiple organ hydatidosis including 13 hydatid cysts involving the lungs, the liver, the left heart ventricle, the left kidney, the abdomen cavity, the muscles (psoas, adductors), and the subcutaneous gluteal area. The majority of these cysts were already treated surgically, and some of them were due to be removed.

                Background It is important and challenging to distinguish between acute myocardial infarction and Wellens syndrome due to its time to intervention. Difficulties in differentiating between subtypes could mean the patients are overtreated or receive undertreatment. Case report A 57-year-old man was referred to our emergency ward with acute onset of chest pain. Electrocardiograms changes were suggestive of type A Wellens syndrome. Nitroglycerin was administrated, the patient's chest pain disappeared, and we planned an early invasive strategy. He had a previous documented electrocardiogram before he went for catheterization and based on the second electrocardiogram changes were suggestive of an ST-elevation. As the result of the invasive strategy, it was found that there was single-vessel disease, critical occlusion in the middle of the left anterior descending artery coronary artery with collateral from the right coronary artery. After two days of observation in the Intensive Cardiovascular Care Unit, the patient improved and was transferred to Low Care Unit. Conclusions The case highlights Wellens syndrome in acute critical occlusion with collateral artery.

                Background Removal of the microbial deposits (plaque and calculus) by performing effective scaling and root planing (SRP) is the fundamental step for managing periodontal disease (gingivitis and periodontitis). Various adjuncts in the form of mouthwash, gels, and toothpaste are also being used as adjuncts to SRP for managing periodontitis. Recently, Lycium barbarum (L. barbarum), commonly known as goji berry or wolfberry, has gained popularity for managing chronic inflammatory and infectious diseases. However, its efficacy in managing periodontitis has never been explored. Hence the present study aims to evaluate the efficacy of goji berry mouthwash compared to chlorhexidine mouthwash for managing periodontitis. Methods 60 adult participants were divided randomly using computer-generated random sequences into two groups (case group: L. barbarum mouthwash (Males: 16; Female: 14); control group: 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate mouthwash (Males: 14; Females: 16)). The changes in the gingival index (Gi), plaque index (Pi), bleeding on probing (BOP), clinical attachment loss (CAL), probing pocket depth (PPD), microbial load, and antioxidant levels (protein thiol) in saliva were noted at the baseline, at 15 days and one month. Results A significant reduction in the mean PPD, Pi, and Gi was seen from baseline to one month in both the control (P-value=0.006, 0.027, and 0.036 respectively) and test groups (P-value=0.035, 0.000, and 0.000 respectively). CAL was reduced significantly only in the control group. However, the antioxidant levels (protein thiol) in saliva were significantly increased only in the test group. Conclusion Goji berry mouthwash along with SRP reduced the Gi, Pi, BOP, and PPD in patients with periodontitis. However, no statistically significant difference was noted between the use of goji berry and chlorhexidine mouthwash. Goji berry mouthwash was more effective than chlorhexidine in increasing the antioxidant levels in saliva.

                Background The goal of eliminating tuberculosis has not yet shown a bright spot. Specifically for HIV patients (PLHIV), WHO has made it a special category as a pillar for eliminating tuberculosis. The tuberculosis screening has not yet reached the national target because it is carried out manually by health workers, requiring optimization following technological developments. This study aims to determine the effectiveness of tuberculosis case finding using a self-assessment paradigm in HIV patients. Methods This research was cross-sectional. The data obtained from HIV patients before and after using the E-TIBI application for 3 months each was analyzed using the compare mean independent t-test. Then the Chi-squared test was carried out on the E-TIBI screening characteristic variables. Result In total, there were 921 respondents with 148 (16%) presumptive TB. It was found that there was a significant difference (p<0.05) in the number of presumptive TB cases found in HIV patients before and after using the E-TIBI application. The person with presumptive TB showed 20 of 24 characteristic variables that were statistically significant (p<0.05). Conclusion E-TIBI can increase the tuberculosis case finding in HIV patients so it has the potential to be implemented as a screening tool in the PLHIV community.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-749/v1?src=rss">The potential role of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor for hepatocellular carcinoma screening: a systematic review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) stands as the third most fatal malignancy worldwide, accounting for over 830,000 fatalities annually. This pressing concern has spurred extensive research into potential early diagnostic biomarkers, with a particular focus on the role of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in recognizing angiogenesis within HCC. VEGF offers an intricate insight into the angiogenic processes, among its multifaceted advantages. Methods We systematically curated articles from PubMed and Epistemonikos, concentrating on the determination of VEGF’s diagnostic cutoff value, sensitivity, and specificity for HCC. Employing the PRISMA 2020 flowchart, we meticulously delineated the process of article selection. Results In total, our review encompasses nine studies, encompassing 576 HCC patients, subject to qualitative analysis. The collective findings indicate that the specificity of VEGF outweighs its sensitivity, indicating its aptitude in distinguishing HCC from both a healthy population and other high-risk conditions, most notably in comparison with these high-risk conditions. Specificity holds pivotal significance as a preferred parameter for a screening test, endorsing the prospective utility of VEGF in HCC screening. Conclusions For individuals, especially those within the normal alpha-fetoprotein range, VEGF may serve as a viable alternative for HCC screening, facilitating the differentiation of this condition from other high-risk conditions.

                Multimorbidity and the associated consumption of multiple medications are common among the older population, posing a significant health concern. This leads to an increased incidence of side effects, adverse drug reactions, and higher healthcare costs for the individual, their family, and the country’s overall healthcare expenditure. Older adults experience complications due to the natural aging process and polypharmacy. The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic variables of medications play a crucial role in their recovery and overall health. While many studies have highlighted the rising incidence of multimorbidity among older adults, they often overlook the importance of optimizing medication therapy to reduce complications, side effects, adverse drug reactions, falls, and improve medication adherence. This narrative review focuses on the impact of polypharmacy on older adults, age-related pharmacokinetic changes, pharmacodynamics in this population, and various methods to optimize pharmacotherapy. The findings of this review aim to provide healthcare providers with a better understanding of how to optimize pharmacotherapies and reduce drug-related complications in older adults.

                Background Diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB) in resource-limited countries relies primarily on bacteriological confirmation using Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) stain or culture. However, this method has low sensitivity due to suboptimal sampling and techniques. Neutrophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes are crucial in the pathogenesis of granulomatous inflammation and immune reactions. We investigated the usefulness of the haematological parameters and their ratios, like the Neutrophil to Lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and Monocyte to Lymphocyte ratio (MLR), for diagnosing tuberculosis. Methods We retrospectively grouped 114 patients with fever into those diagnosed with TB and control groups. We obtained their haematological data and calculated their derived ratios. The ratios obtained from the two groups were compared. Their sensitivity and specificity were calculated. Results Haematological parameters like MLR were higher in TB patients than in the control group. Although NLR was not significantly increased, MLR was significantly increased with p values <0.05. These tests had low sensitivity but high specificity. Conclusion Serum NLR and MLR emerge as valuable tools in TB diagnosis. Their simplicity and cost-effectiveness render them particularly suitable for screening and recurrence monitoring in rural and remote settings, thereby mitigating loss to follow-up.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-746/v1?src=rss">Planet activeness: a new concept to enhance the accuracy of Astromet weather forecast. [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Astrometeorology is an ancient science, that deals the relationship between planet position and weather events. Several Indian studies proved that Astrometeorology could be a complementary method to improve numerical weather forecast accuracy. Since 2011, Tamil Nadu Agricultural University is conducting astrometeorological research and devised a novel concept “Planet Activeness Chart”. The principle is that “planets’ influence on a location’s weather varies throughout the day and may be negative, inactive, active, highly active and rule depending on their angle to that location”. Most existing astromet studies used planetary position to predict the occurrence of weather events (yes/no) but failed to capture intensity of the event. The “Planet Activeness Concept” could address this limitation and enhance forecast usability. Methods A study was carried out from 2018 to 2021 with six years data (2011-16) to verify the “Planet activeness” on hourly rainfall and windspeed events in Tamil Nadu. The frequency of planet activeness for a weather event was calculated by dividing the number of times a planet was in the selected activeness during a specific event category by the total number of events. Results The results indicated that negative state of the Sun, active status of the Saturn, Uranus, Venus and Moon were positively associated with rainfall intensity. The windy planet Mercury and Neptune at active state, the Sun and Saturn at rule state, Venus and Uranus at negative state, Jupiter at highly active state had significant influence on the increased wind speed. Conclusion Applying the planet activeness concept with azimuth could enhance the accuracy and usability of Astrometeorological forecasts. This study establishes a mathematical relationship between planet activeness and weather as a first step to understand the science behind this relationship. It is suggested to study different combination of planet activeness during a weather event for more insights.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91327">Early parafoveal semantic integration in natural reading</a></h4>

              
                Humans can read and comprehend text rapidly, implying that readers might process multiple words per fixation. However, the extent to which parafoveal words are previewed and integrated into the evolving sentence context remains disputed. We investigated parafoveal processing during natural reading by recording brain activity and eye movements using MEG and an eye tracker while participants silently read one-line sentences. The sentences contained an unpredictable target word that was either congruent or incongruent with the sentence context. To measure parafoveal processing, we flickered the target words at 60 Hz and measured the resulting brain responses (i.e. <i>Rapid Invisible Frequency Tagging, RIFT</i>) during fixations on the pre-target words. Our results revealed a significantly weaker tagging response for target words that were incongruent with the previous context compared to congruent ones, even within 100ms of fixating the word immediately preceding the target. This reduction in the RIFT response was also found to be predictive of individual reading speed. We conclude that semantic information is not only extracted from the parafovea but can also be integrated with the previous context before the word is fixated. This early and extensive parafoveal processing supports the rapid word processing required for natural reading. Our study suggests that theoretical frameworks of natural reading should incorporate the concept of deep parafoveal processing.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91685">Factorized visual representations in the primate visual system and deep neural networks</a></h4>

              
                Object classification has been proposed as a principal objective of the primate ventral visual stream and has been used as an optimization target for deep neural network models (DNNs) of the visual system. However, visual brain areas represent many different types of information, and optimizing for classification of object identity alone does not constrain how other information may be encoded in visual representations. Information about different scene parameters may be discarded altogether (‘invariance’), represented in non-interfering subspaces of population activity (‘factorization’) or encoded in an entangled fashion. In this work, we provide evidence that factorization is a normative principle of biological visual representations. In the monkey ventral visual hierarchy, we found that factorization of object pose and background information from object identity increased in higher-level regions and strongly contributed to improving object identity decoding performance. We then conducted a large-scale analysis of factorization of individual scene parameters – lighting, background, camera viewpoint, and object pose – in a diverse library of DNN models of the visual system. Models which best matched neural, fMRI, and behavioral data from both monkeys and humans across 12 datasets tended to be those which factorized scene parameters most strongly. Notably, invariance to these parameters was not as consistently associated with matches to neural and behavioral data, suggesting that maintaining non-class information in factorized activity subspaces is often preferred to dropping it altogether. Thus, we propose that factorization of visual scene information is a widely used strategy in brains and DNN models thereof.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89292">Nucleotide binding to the ATP-cone in anaerobic ribonucleotide reductases allosterically regulates activity by modulating substrate binding</a></h4>

              
                A small, nucleotide-binding domain, the ATP-cone, is found at the N-terminus of most ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) catalytic subunits. By binding adenosine triphosphate (ATP) or deoxyadenosine triphosphate (dATP) it regulates the enzyme activity of all classes of RNR. Functional and structural work on aerobic RNRs has revealed a plethora of ways in which dATP inhibits activity by inducing oligomerisation and preventing a productive radical transfer from one subunit to the active site in the other. Anaerobic RNRs, on the other hand, store a stable glycyl radical next to the active site and the basis for their dATP-dependent inhibition is completely unknown. We present biochemical, biophysical, and structural information on the effects of ATP and dATP binding to the anaerobic RNR from <i>Prevotella copri</i>. The enzyme exists in a dimer–tetramer equilibrium biased towards dimers when two ATP molecules are bound to the ATP-cone and tetramers when two dATP molecules are bound. In the presence of ATP, <i>P. copri</i> NrdD is active and has a fully ordered glycyl radical domain (GRD) in one monomer of the dimer. Binding of dATP to the ATP-cone results in loss of activity and increased dynamics of the GRD, such that it cannot be detected in the cryo-EM structures. The glycyl radical is formed even in the dATP-bound form, but the substrate does not bind. The structures implicate a complex network of interactions in activity regulation that involve the GRD more than 30 Å away from the dATP molecules, the allosteric substrate specificity site and a conserved but previously unseen flap over the active site. Taken together, the results suggest that dATP inhibition in anaerobic RNRs acts by increasing the flexibility of the flap and GRD, thereby preventing both substrate binding and radical mobilisation.

	<p>Lateropulsion is a post-stroke phenomenon marked by an active push of the body across the midline towards the more affected side and/or a resistance of the weight shift towards the less affected side. Within the mechanisms of treatment, feedback systems have been shown to be effective. The aim of the present study was to create a body of knowledge by performing a literature review on the use of feedback mechanisms in the treatment of lateropulsion and to report two cases of lateropulsion patients who had undergone feedback-based treatment. Methods: The review was performed across five different databases (Embase, Medline/PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and PEDro) up to February 2024, and haptic feedback intervention was incorporated into the case series (with lateropulsion and ambulation capacity as the main variables). Results: In total, 211 records were identified and 6 studies were included after the review of the literature. The most used feedback modality was visual feedback. In the case series, positive results were observed from the intervention, particularly in the recovery of lateropulsion and balance, as well as in the improvement of gait for one patient. Patients demonstrated good adherence to the intervention protocol without adverse effects. Conclusions: Visual feedback is the most commonly used feedback modality in lateropulsion patients but other mechanisms such as haptic feedback also are feasible and should be taken into account. Larger sample sizes, extended follow-up periods, and the isolation of feedback mechanisms must be established to clarify evidence.</p>

	<p>Objectives: To study the correlation between positive cochlin tomoprotein testing (CTP), magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, and the auditory and vestibular function amongst patients with sudden hearing loss. Study Design: Prospective case series. Methods: We prospectively examined eight patients who presented with sudden hearing loss (&amp;amp;gt;60 dB) with or without vertigo or tinnitus. We performed an ELISA-based CTP detection test using middle ear lavage samples. In addition to the CTP examination, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination was performed using different sequences (T1 and a T1 sequence with a contrast medium (CM), a T2 sequence, 4 h delayed intravenous gadolinium-enhanced three-dimensional fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (3D FLAIR)). Results: All patients with sudden hearing loss (&amp;amp;gt;60 dB) presented a non-specific contrast enhancement in the cochlea and vestibulum on the affected side on delayed 3D-FLAIR MRI. Four patients had a positive CTP test, suggesting a perilymphatic fistula (PLF). However, no specific MRI signal for a PLF was observed. Conclusions: Using multimodal diagnostic measures, such as CTP testing and different MRI sequences, no correlation could be found in patients with a PLF.</p>

                Background: Aortoiliac occlusive disease (AIOD) or Leriche syndrome, is a peripheral artery disease, specifically affecting the infrarenal aorta and iliac arteries. Presentation of AIOD patients ranged from asymptomatic to having limb-threatening emergencies. Advances and innovations in endovascular devices have replaced surgical approach for AIOD treatment. Here we reported a 52-year-old man presenting with AIOD managed by endovascular approach using kissing stent technique. Case presentation: A 52-year-old man, with history of chronic coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus type 2, long-standing hypertension, and who was a heavy smoker, was admitted to our hospital with symptoms of long time with bilateral claudication and became leg rest pain. He had history of aorto-infrarenal occlusion known from previous percutaneous coronary intervention from right and left femoral artery access. Aortoiliac occlusive disease (TASC II Type D Class) diagnosis was made by lower extremity duplex ultrasound and CT angiography. The patient underwent urgent percutaneous transluminal angioplasty with kissing stent technique. The patient was discharged 4 days after the procedure without any significant complaints, received optimal medical treatment, and was educated about smoking cessation. Conclusion: Treatment of AIOD should include both modification of risk factors and efforts to increase perfusion to the lower extremities. An endovascular approach is an excellent alternative and may replace surgical approach in complex aortoiliac obstructive disease. In this case report, an endovascular approach with kissing stent technique showed good results for the patient.

                Introduction The aim of the research was to demonstrate the efficiency of microorganisms and the effectiveness of biodegradation techniques on Low-density polyethylene (LDPE) plastics. The research question was: What is the efficiency of LDPE-degrading microorganisms and the effectiveness of biodegradation techniques? Methods The systematic review was based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. Articles were obtained from Scopus, Web of Science (WOS), Embase, and Google Scholar. The DeCS/Mesh search terms were: Low-density polyethylene, efficiency, biodegradation, microbial consortia, fungi, bacteria. Inclusion criteria were: scientific articles that included bacteria, fungi, and microbial consortia reported as LDPE degraders that report the percentage of weight loss; articles published from January 2010 to October 2022, and publications in Spanish and English with open access. Exclusion criteria were: studies that do not report gravimetry, the biodegradation time of LDPE, and the genus or species of the polyethylene-degrading microorganism. Results Out of 483 studies found, 50 were included in this Systematic Review (SR). The most frequent study techniques were scanning electron microscopy (SEM), gravimetry, and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and in the case of microorganisms, the most studied belonged to the genus Pseudomonas, Bacillus, and Aspergillus. Regarding the isolation place, the most frequent mentioned in the reviewed articles were landfill soil and sanitary landfill soil. The efficiency of LDPE-degrading microorganisms was higher in bacteria such as Enterobacter spp., Pantoea spp., Pseudomonas spp., Escherichia coli, and Bacillus spp., which obtained a range of DE of 9.00-70.00%, 24.00-64%, 1.15 – 61.00%, 45.00%, and 1.5-40% with DT of 4-150, 120, 4-150, 30, and 30-120 days, respectively; in the case of fungi, the main microorganisms are Neopestalotiopsis phangngaensis, Colletotrichum fructicola, and Thyrostroma jaczewskii with efficiencies of 54.34, 48.78, and 46.34%, in 90 days, respectively; and the most efficient microbial consortia were from Enterobacter spp. and Pantoea sp. with 38.00 – 81.00%, in 120 days; and, Pseudomonas protegens, Stenotrophomonas sp., B. vallismortis and Paenibacillus sp. with 55. 00 – 75.00% in 120 days. Conclusions The most efficient microorganisms in LDPE degradation are Enterobacter spp., Pantoea spp., Pseudomonas spp., Escherichia coli, and Bacillus spp.; in fungi Neopestalotiopsis phangngaensis, Colletotrichum fructicola, and Thyrostroma jaczewskii; and in microbial consortia, those formed by Enterobacter spp. and Pantoea sp., and that of P. protegens, Stenotrophomonas sp., B. vallismortis and Paenibacillus sp.; and the most effective techniques used in LDPE biodegradation are SEM, gravimetry, and FTIR.

                Background Recent innovations are making radiology more advanced for patient and patient services. Under the immense burden of radiology practice, Artificial Intelligence (AI) assists in obtaining Computed Tomography (CT) images with less scan time, proper patient placement, low radiation dose (RD), and improved image quality (IQ). Hence, the aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the positioning accuracy, RD, and IQ of AI-based automatic and manual positioning techniques for CT kidney ureters and bladder (CT KUB). Methods This prospective study included 143 patients in each group who were referred for computed tomography (CT) KUB examination. Group 1 patients underwent manual positioning (MP), and group 2 patients underwent AI-based automatic positioning (AP) for CT KUB examination. The scanning protocol was kept constant for both the groups. The off-center distance, RD, and quantitative and qualitative IQ of each group were evaluated and compared. Results The AP group (9.66±6.361 mm) had significantly less patient off-center distance than the MP group (15.12±9.55 mm). There was a significant reduction in RD in the AP group compared with that in the MP group. The quantitative image noise (IN) was lower, with a higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) in the AP group than in the MP group (p<0.05). Qualitative IQ parameters such as IN, sharpness, and overall IQ also showed significant differences (p< 0.05), with higher scores in the AP group than in the MP group. Conclusions The AI-based AP showed higher positioning accuracy with less off-center distance (44%), which resulted in 12% reduction in RD and improved IQ for CT KUB imaging compared with MP.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-744/v1?src=rss">Teacher attributes as predictors of assessment practices in public universities of Ethiopia [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Higher education teachers dwell on various classroom assessment practices. Their assessment practices play a significant part of the teaching learning process and in determining student achievement. In this respect, their different attributes determine the nature of their classroom assessment practices. This cross-sectional survey study aimed to examine differences in assessment practices among public university teachers with respect to their academic status, teaching experience, assessment training and specializations. Methods The study adopted Assessment Practices Inventory (API) which was distributed to a sample of 380 randomly selected teachers from four public universities. The majorities (93.4%) of questionnaires which were properly completed were entered to SPSS version 25 software and used for analysis. Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was used for analysis and Pillai’s Trace was utilized for interpretation of the results. Results The results showed that academic status (P= .000); teaching experience (P = .000); and assessment training (P =.030) had significant differences for the combined dependent variables (assessment practice). However, field of specialization (P =.130) did not show significant difference in the overall assessment practice although differences were observed in assessment design and interpretation. Conclusion Academic status, teaching experience, and assessment training are important attributes of teachers that shape their assessment practices. Therefore, as teachers hold the sole responsibility of classroom assessment, training and development courses in assessment, experience sharing and learning opportunities are necessary regardless of their specializations, academic status, and teaching experience.

                Abstract* Background Attachment style and object relation maturity have been linked to patterns of relating to others and mental health outcomes. However, little research has tested how these processes relate or the level of unique variance they each account for in outcomes. This study aimed to explore these issues. Methods A sample of n = 77 adults completed self-report scales of attachment style, splitting and dyadic splitting tendencies and mental distress (measured via the General Anxiety Disorder (GAD7) and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ8) scales). Questionnaires were completed online. Results The results suggested that anxious attachment and tendency towards splitting were related to higher levels of mental distress. Splitting was positively related to attachment anxiety and avoidance. However, a series of mediation models (testing the relationship between splitting and mental health, mediated by attachment avoidance and anxiety) suggested that anxious attachment did not predict unique variance in distress. Splitting remained related to mental distress but was not mediated by anxious or avoidant attachment styles. Conclusions The findings point towards potential links between two distinct aspects of systems that influence relating and psychological wellbeing. They also suggested that addressing both aspects will be beneficial in helping clients improve their relationships and well-being.

                Background The objective was to investigate the impact of physical activity (PA) teaching and learning approaches in healthcare professionals (HCPs) education on PA-related knowledge, confidence, and behaviour. Methods Eligible experimental studies investigated the effect of interventions that incorporate PA in to the undergraduate and postgraduate education, and continuous professional development of any HCP (medical doctors, nurses, physiotherapists, etc.) on PA-related outcomes including knowledge, perceptions, and confidence to prescribe PA. Six databases (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CINAHL, Embase, ERIC, Medline, and SPORTDiscus) were searched from inception to October 2022. Risk of bias was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal tools. A narrative data synthesis was undertaken to assess the overall effectiveness of the reviewed educational interventions: knowledge, perceptions, confidence, attitudes, beliefs, and changes in behaviour/practice. Results A total of 32 studies comprising 3,256 participants fulfilled the eligibility criteria. The most frequently employed learning approach in eligible studies was training workshops (n=13), followed by experiential learning (n=4). Half of the studies included knowledge as an outcome (n=16) and 10 studies each included a measure of confidence and changes in behaviour/practice. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (n=7), showed no improvement in any measure of knowledge, confidence, or behaviour. Two RCTs reported beneficial effects of experiential learning on confidence and perceived behavioural control. In non-randomised studies, training workshops and didactic input with and without simulated e-learning led to statistical improvements in knowledge, confidence, perceived competence, and attitudes. Discussion Most of the eligible studies lacked an adequate sample size, and, in many cases, there was a high loss to follow up which represents a threat to the internal validity of the studies. We found that a blended approach to teaching and learning supported with experiential or simulated experiences to improve the knowledge, perceived competence, and confidence to prescribe PA.

                Health systems are experiencing increasing pressures worldwide due to heightened service demands, demographic aging, stringent regulations, and economic constraints, making efficiency and efficacy in health management critical aspects. At the heart of this complexity, health managers seek to optimize resources and improve care delivery at a time when the adoption of digital technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI), becomes increasingly imperative. This necessity reflects not only the pursuit of innovation but also the urgency to adapt to an ever-evolving environment. However, the effective characterization, availability, and incorporation of these technologies as support tools still represent an emerging challenge that is insufficiently explored in the literature. In response, this project proposes the development of a framework of theoretical and practical guidelines for the implementation and management of digital tools in health systems in the age of AI. Adopting a mixed-methods approach that includes systematic review, analyses of commercial off-the-shelf solutions, and qualitative studies with health managers and practitioners, the aim is to map current technology use, identify gaps and best practices, and provide a guide for future direction. This project also intends to develop in co-creation with professionals in the field to ensure the relevance and practical applicability of the developed guidelines. The results are expected to not only contribute to the scientific literature but also offer an evidence-based guide to optimizing the use of digital technologies in health management, promoting a significant transformation in the development and adoption of innovative digital solutions.

[version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Childhood visual impairment (VI) is less common than in adults, but research has demonstrated that it can have significant long-term negative impacts on the health-related quality of life (HR-QoL) of children and adolescents. Unfortunately, there is currently a lack of vision-specific instruments available for accurately assessing HR-QoL in children and adolescents with VI, particularly in resource-limited settings. The objective of this scoping review is to methodically evaluate the evidence pertaining to (1) the accessibility and usage of instruments specifically designed to assess HR-QoL in children and adolescents who have VI, (2) summarise studies on HR-QoL in children and adolescent with VI, and (3) describe the psychometric properties of vision-specific instruments used for assessing HR-QoL in children and adolescents with VI. The review will be conducted in accordance with the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) guideline (2020) for scoping reviews, utilizing frameworks by Arksey and O’Malley, and methodological enhancements suggested by Levac (2010). A systematic search will be performed through various databases, including PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus, Web of Science, and EBSCOhost, to identify peer-reviewed articles published in English from inception until 31 December 2023. The EBSCOhost platform will include several databases, such as Academic Search Complete, APA PsycINFO, Health Source-Consumer Edition, Health Source: Nursing/Academic Edition, and Open Dissertations. The extracted data will be analysed narratively using QualCoder 1.9 version, and the study’s findings will be reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR). The researchers anticipate that the literature will assist in exploring and relating various types of HR-QoL tools used globally. This review’s conclusion will help researchers ascertain research gaps in vision-related QoL instruments based on different economies, countries, and environments. This will further aid researchers in planning and developing tools suitable for African contexts and languages.

                Background Healthcare, like other industries, emphasizes performance, quality, and consumer experience while also attempting to reduce costs. However, high-quality healthcare remains paramount for vulnerable and ill patients. This study aimed to investigate parents' and caregivers' level of satisfaction with physiotherapy services provided to neuropediatric outpatients on the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Methods This descriptive cross-sectional study included 103 parents/caregivers of children with neurological disabilities that were randomly selected from different Emirates Health Services Hospitals in the UAE. Data was collected using the long-form Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire (PSQ-III). Results The overall mean satisfaction was 159±7.73 (out of 250 points). Communication (20.36/25), interpersonal factors (20.17/35), and doctor-patient time (20.17/35) had the highest mean satisfaction scores (8.06/10). The lowest mean satisfaction scores were for access/availability/convenience (34.60/60), technical quality (33.17/50), and economic elements (23.83/40). Conclusion Despite participants’ overall satisfaction scores being positive, some service domains require improvement to improve satisfaction, specifically the access/availability/convenience, technical quality, and economic elements. These areas should be prioritized by service providers and managers to improve patients’ experiences and clinical outcomes.

<p>Immunohistochemical staining for vesicular glutamate transporter 2 reveals the “core” thalamocortical projection to the neocortex in the African elephant. In the elephant and other mammals with unusual skin (such as pachydermatous skin), layer 4 is cytoarchitecturally indistinct, possibly absent, and the thalamocortical input terminates primarily on the neurons forming the inner sublamina of layer 3. Scale bar = 1 mm.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Although the mammalian cerebral cortex is most often described as a hexalaminar structure, there are cortical areas (primary motor cortex) and species (elephants, cetaceans, and hippopotami), where a cytoarchitecturally indistinct, or absent, layer 4 is noted. Thalamocortical projections from the core, or first order, thalamic system terminate primarily in layers 4/inner 3. We explored the termination sites of core thalamocortical projections in cortical areas and in species where there is no cytoarchitecturally distinct layer 4 using the immunolocalization of vesicular glutamate transporter 2, a known marker of core thalamocortical axon terminals, in 31 mammal species spanning the eutherian radiation. Several variations from the canonical cortical column outline of layer 4 and core thalamocortical inputs were noted. In shrews/microchiropterans, layer 4 was present, but many core thalamocortical projections terminated in layer 1 in addition to layers 4 and inner 3. In primate primary visual cortex, the sublaminated layer 4 was associated with a specialized core thalamocortical projection pattern. In primate primary motor cortex, no cytoarchitecturally distinct layer 4 was evident and the core thalamocortical projections terminated throughout layer 3. In the African elephant, cetaceans, and river hippopotamus, no cytoarchitecturally distinct layer 4 was observed and core thalamocortical projections terminated primarily in inner layer 3 and less densely in outer layer 3. These findings are contextualized in terms of cortical processing, perception, and the evolutionary trajectory leading to an indistinct or absent cortical layer 4.</p>

<p>This study matched physiology and anatomical subregions in the chicken inferior colliculus. We found neural topographies for binaural sound localization cues, but, in contrast to the well-studied barn owl, there was no distinct differentiation of responses in the different subregions. Together with previous work in pigeon and chicken, this suggests a plesiomorphic condition of multisensory integration in the midbrain that is dominated by lateral panoramic vision.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The sound localization behavior of the nocturnally hunting barn owl and its underlying neural computations is a textbook example of neuroethology. Differences in sound timing and level at the two ears are integrated in a series of well-characterized steps, from brainstem to inferior colliculus (IC), resulting in a topographical neural representation of auditory space. It remains an important question of brain evolution: How is this specialized case derived from a more plesiomorphic pattern? The present study is the first to match physiology and anatomical subregions in the non-owl avian IC. Single-unit responses in the chicken IC were tested for selectivity to different frequencies and to the binaural difference cues. Their anatomical origin was reconstructed with the help of electrolytic lesions and immunohistochemical identification of different subregions of the IC, based on previous characterizations in owl and chicken. In contrast to barn owl, there was no distinct differentiation of responses in the different subregions. We found neural topographies for both binaural cues but no evidence for a coherent representation of auditory space. The results are consistent with previous work in pigeon IC and chicken higher-order midbrain and suggest a plesiomorphic condition of multisensory integration in the midbrain that is dominated by lateral panoramic vision.</p>

   title="Link to external resource: RRID:SCR_017001">RRID:SCR_017001</a>) searching for genes expressed selectively throughout the adult mouse mesocortex (transitional cortex ring predicted within the concentric ring theory of mammalian cortical structure, in contrast with central isocortex [ICx] and peripheral allocortex). We aimed to explore a shared molecular profile selective of all or most mesocortex areas. This approach checks and corroborates the precision of other previous definitory criteria, such as poor myelination and high kainate receptor level. Another aim was to examine which cortical areas properly belong to mesocortex. A total of 34 positive adult selective marker genes of mesocortex were identified, jointly with 12 negative selective markers, making a total of 46 markers. All of them identify the same set of cortical areas surrounding the molecularly different ICx as well as excluding adjacent allocortex. Four representative mesocortex markers—<i>Crym</i>, <i>Lypd1</i>, <i>Cdh13</i>, and <i>Smoc2</i>—are amply illustrated, jointly with complementary material including <i>myelin basic protein</i>, to check myelination, and <i>Rorb</i>, to check layer 4 presence. The retrosplenial (ReSp) area, long held to be mesocortical, does not share any of the 46 markers of mesocortex and instead expresses <i>Nr4a2</i> and <i>Tshz2</i>, selective parahippocampal allocortex markers. Moreover, it is not hypomyelinic and lacks a <i>Rorb</i>-positive layer 4, aspects generally present in mesocortex. Exclusion of the ReSp area from the mesocortex ring reveals the latter to be closed at this locus instead by two adjacent areas previously thought to be associative visual ICx (reidentified here molecularly as postsplenial and parasplenial mesocortex areas). The concepts of ICx, mesocortex, and parahippocampal allocortex are thus subtly modified by substantial molecular evidence.</p>
