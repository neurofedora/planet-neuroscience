	<p>This study explores the multifaceted influence of litter size, maternal care, exercise, and aging on rats&amp;amp;rsquo; neurobehavioral plasticity and dentate gyrus microglia dynamics. Body weight evolution revealed a progressive increase until maturity, followed by a decline during aging, with larger litters exhibiting lower weights initially. Notably, exercised rats from smaller litters displayed higher body weights during the mature and aged stages. The dentate gyrus volumes showed no significant differences among groups, except for aged sedentary rats from smaller litters, which exhibited a reduction. Maternal care varied significantly based on litter size, with large litter dams showing lower frequencies of caregiving behaviors. Behavioral assays highlighted the detrimental impact of a sedentary lifestyle and reduced maternal care/large litters on spatial memory, mitigated by exercise in aged rats from smaller litters. The microglial dynamics in the layers of dentate gyrus revealed age-related changes modulated by litter size and exercise. Exercise interventions mitigated microgliosis associated with aging, particularly in aged rats. These findings underscore the complex interplay between early-life experiences, exercise, microglial dynamics, and neurobehavioral outcomes during aging.</p>

                <p>by Feng Jiao, Jing Li, Ting Liu, Yifeng Zhu, Wenhao Che, Leonidas Bleris, Chen Jia</p>

In experiments, the distributions of mRNA or protein numbers in single cells are often fitted to the random telegraph model which includes synthesis and decay of mRNA or protein, and switching of the gene between active and inactive states. While commonly used, this model does not describe how fluctuations are influenced by crucial biological mechanisms such as feedback regulation, non-exponential gene inactivation durations, and multiple gene activation pathways. Here we investigate the dynamical properties of four relatively complex gene expression models by fitting their steady-state mRNA or protein number distributions to the simple telegraph model. We show that despite the underlying complex biological mechanisms, the telegraph model with three effective parameters can accurately capture the steady-state gene product distributions, as well as the conditional distributions in the active gene state, of the complex models. Some effective parameters are reliable and can reflect realistic dynamic behaviors of the complex models, while others may deviate significantly from their real values in the complex models. The effective parameters can also be applied to characterize the capability for a complex model to exhibit multimodality. Using additional information such as single-cell data at multiple time points, we provide an effective method of distinguishing the complex models from the telegraph model. Furthermore, using measurements under varying experimental conditions, we show that fitting the mRNA or protein number distributions to the telegraph model may even reveal the underlying gene regulation mechanisms of the complex models. The effectiveness of these methods is confirmed by analysis of single-cell data for <i>E. coli</i> and mammalian cells. All these results are robust with respect to cooperative transcriptional regulation and extrinsic noise. In particular, we find that faster relaxation speed to the steady state results in more precise parameter inference under large extrinsic noise.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012110">Learning with filopodia and spines: Complementary strong and weak competition lead to specialized, graded, and protected receptive fields</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Albert Albesa-González, Claudia Clopath</p>

Filopodia are thin synaptic protrusions that have been long known to play an important role in early development. It has recently been found that they are more abundant in the adult cortex than previously thought, and more plastic than spines (button-shaped mature synapses). Inspired by these findings, we introduce a new model of synaptic plasticity that jointly describes learning of filopodia and spines. The model assumes that filopodia exhibit strongly competitive learning dynamics -similarly to additive spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). At the same time it proposes that, if filopodia undergo sufficient potentiation, they consolidate into spines. Spines follow weakly competitive learning, classically associated with multiplicative, soft-bounded models of STDP. This makes spines more stable and sensitive to the fine structure of input correlations. We show that our learning rule has a selectivity comparable to additive STDP and represents input correlations as well as multiplicative models of STDP. We also show how it can protect previously formed memories and act as a synaptic consolidation mechanism. Overall, our results can be seen as a phenomenological description of how filopodia and spines could cooperate to overcome the difficulties that strong and weak competition each have.

                <p>by Tanmoy Sarkar, Matej Krajnc</p>

Cell rearrangements are fundamental mechanisms driving large-scale deformations of living tissues. In three-dimensional (3D) space-filling cell aggregates, cells rearrange through local topological transitions of the network of cell-cell interfaces, which is most conveniently described by the vertex model. Since these transitions are not yet mathematically properly formulated, the 3D vertex model is generally difficult to implement. The few existing implementations rely on highly customized and complex software-engineering solutions, which cannot be transparently delineated and are thus mostly non-reproducible. To solve this outstanding problem, we propose a reformulation of the vertex model. Our approach, called Graph Vertex Model (GVM), is based on storing the topology of the cell network into a knowledge graph with a particular data structure that allows performing cell-rearrangement events by simple graph transformations. Importantly, when these same transformations are applied to a two-dimensional (2D) polygonal cell aggregate, they reduce to a well-known T1 transition, thereby generalizing cell-rearrangements in 2D and 3D space-filling packings. This result suggests that the GVM’s graph data structure may be the most natural representation of cell aggregates and tissues. We also develop a Python package that implements GVM, relying on a graph-database-management framework Neo4j. We use this package to characterize an order-disorder transition in 3D cell aggregates, driven by active noise and we find aggregates undergoing efficient ordering close to the transition point. In all, our work showcases knowledge graphs as particularly suitable data models for structured storage, analysis, and manipulation of tissue data.

                <p>by Daniel L. Barton, Yow-Ren Chang, William Ducker, Jure Dobnikar</p>

In this work, we quantitatively compare computer simulations and existing cell tracking data of <i>P. aeruginosa</i> surface motility in order to analyse the underlying motility mechanism. We present a three dimensional twitching motility model, that simulates the extension, retraction and surface association of individual Type IV Pili (TFP), and is informed by recent experimental observations of TFP. Sensitivity analysis is implemented to minimise the number of model parameters, and quantitative estimates for the remaining parameters are inferred from tracking data by approximate Bayesian computation. We argue that the motility mechanism is highly sensitive to experimental conditions. We predict a TFP retraction speed for the tracking data we study that is in a good agreement with experimental results obtained under very similar conditions. Furthermore, we examine whether estimates for biologically important parameters, whose direct experimental determination is challenging, can be inferred directly from tracking data. One example is the width of the distribution of TFP on the bacteria body. We predict that the TFP are broadly distributed over the bacteria pole in both walking and crawling motility types. Moreover, we identified specific configurations of TFP that lead to transitions between walking and crawling states.

                <p>by Chun-Chih Tseng, Thomas E. Woolley, Ting-Xin Jiang, Ping Wu, Philip K. Maini, Randall B. Widelitz, Chuong Cheng-Ming</p>

Periodic patterning requires coordinated cell–cell interactions at the tissue level. Turing showed, using mathematical modeling, how spatial patterns could arise from the reactions of a diffusive activator-inhibitor pair in an initially homogenous 2D field. Most activators and inhibitors studied in biological systems are proteins, and the roles of cell–cell interaction, ions, bioelectricity, etc. are only now being identified. Gap junctions (GJs) mediate direct exchanges of ions or small molecules between cells, enabling rapid long-distance communications in a cell collective. They are therefore good candidates for propagating nonprotein-based patterning signals that may act according to the Turing principles. Here, we explore the possible roles of GJs in Turing-type patterning using feather pattern formation as a model. We found 7 of the 12 investigated GJ isoforms are highly dynamically expressed in the developing chicken skin. In ovo functional perturbations of the GJ isoform, <i>connexin 30</i>, by siRNA and the dominant-negative mutant applied before placode development led to disrupted primary feather bud formation. Interestingly, inhibition of gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC) in the ex vivo skin explant culture allowed the sequential emergence of new feather buds at specific spatial locations relative to the existing primary buds. The results suggest that GJIC may facilitate the propagation of long-distance inhibitory signals. Thus, inhibition of GJs may stimulate Turing-type periodic feather pattern formation during chick skin development, and the removal of GJ activity would enable the emergence of new feather buds if the local environment were competent and the threshold to form buds was reached. We further propose Turing-based computational simulations that can predict the sequential appearance of these ectopic buds. Our models demonstrate how a Turing activator-inhibitor system can continue to generate patterns in the competent morphogenetic field when the level of intercellular communication at the tissue scale is modulated.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002620">Seasonal tissue-specific gene expression in wild crown-of-thorns starfish reveals reproductive and stress-related transcriptional systems</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Marie Morin, Mathias Jönsson, Conan K. Wang, David J. Craik, Sandie M. Degnan, Bernard M. Degnan</p>

Animals are influenced by the season, yet we know little about the changes that occur in most species throughout the year. This is particularly true in tropical marine animals that experience relatively small annual temperature and daylight changes. Like many coral reef inhabitants, the crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS), well known as a notorious consumer of corals and destroyer of coral reefs, reproduces exclusively in the summer. By comparing gene expression in 7 somatic tissues procured from wild COTS sampled on the Great Barrier Reef, we identified more than 2,000 protein-coding genes that change significantly between summer and winter. COTS genes that appear to mediate conspecific communication, including both signalling factors released into the surrounding sea water and cell surface receptors, are up-regulated in external secretory and sensory tissues in the summer, often in a sex-specific manner. Sexually dimorphic gene expression appears to be underpinned by sex- and season-specific transcription factors (TFs) and gene regulatory programs. There are over 100 TFs that are seasonally expressed, 87% of which are significantly up-regulated in the summer. Six nuclear receptors are up-regulated in all tissues in the summer, suggesting that systemic seasonal changes are hormonally controlled, as in vertebrates. Unexpectedly, there is a suite of stress-related chaperone proteins and TFs, including HIFa, ATF3, C/EBP, CREB, and NF-κB, that are uniquely and widely co-expressed in gravid females. The up-regulation of these stress proteins in the summer suggests the demands of oogenesis in this highly fecund starfish affects protein stability and turnover in somatic cells. Together, these circannual changes in gene expression provide novel insights into seasonal changes in this coral reef pest and have the potential to identify vulnerabilities for targeted biocontrol.

                <p>by Davide Crombie, Martin A. Spacek, Christian Leibold, Laura Busse</p>

The processing of sensory information, even at early stages, is influenced by the internal state of the animal. Internal states, such as arousal, are often characterized by relating neural activity to a single “level” of arousal, defined by a behavioral indicator such as pupil size. In this study, we expand the understanding of arousal-related modulations in sensory systems by uncovering multiple timescales of pupil dynamics and their relationship to neural activity. Specifically, we observed a robust coupling between spiking activity in the mouse dorsolateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) of the thalamus and pupil dynamics across timescales spanning a few seconds to several minutes. Throughout all these timescales, 2 distinct spiking modes—individual tonic spikes and tightly clustered bursts of spikes—preferred opposite phases of pupil dynamics. This multi-scale coupling reveals modulations distinct from those captured by pupil size per se, locomotion, and eye movements. Furthermore, coupling persisted even during viewing of a naturalistic movie, where it contributed to differences in the encoding of visual information. We conclude that dLGN spiking activity is under the simultaneous influence of multiple arousal-related processes associated with pupil dynamics occurring over a broad range of timescales.

                The Neuroscientist, Ahead of Print. <br/>The discovery of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is frequently attributed to Dr. Gustav Oppenheim—a man who has been largely passed over in history. Oppenheim’s clinical and neuropathologic research covered a variety of disorders, but his name is best known for his work on senile dementia and CAA. Although Oppenheim was in fact not the first to discover CAA, his neuropathologic observations and inferences on neurodegenerative disease proved to be remarkably faithful to our modern understanding of neurodegenerative diseases. As a neurologist, he served in the First World War and was later subjected to religious persecutions in the leadup to the Holocaust but was not fortunate enough to emigrate before his death. The life, social impact, and previously overlooked contributions to science and medicine by Oppenheim are detailed.

     alt="The differential effects of palmitic acid and oleic acid on the metabolic response of hypothalamic astrocytes from male and female mice"/>
<p>Astrocytes in the hypothalamus differentially metabolize palmitic acid and oleic acid, two fatty acids commonly found in our diets, with this possibly being involved in our differential overall metabolic response to these nutrients.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Diets rich in saturated fats are more detrimental to health than those containing mono- or unsaturated fats. Fatty acids are an important source of energy, but they also relay information regarding nutritional status to hypothalamic metabolic circuits and when in excess can be detrimental to these circuits. Astrocytes are the main site of central fatty acid β-oxidation, and hypothalamic astrocytes participate in energy homeostasis, in part by modulating hormonal and nutritional signals reaching metabolic neurons, as well as in the inflammatory response to high-fat diets. Thus, we hypothesized that how hypothalamic astrocytes process-specific fatty acids participates in determining the differential metabolic response and that this is sex dependent as males and females respond differently to high-fat diets. Male and female primary hypothalamic astrocyte cultures were treated with oleic acid (OA) or palmitic acid (PA) for 24 h, and an untargeted metabolomics study was performed. A clear predictive model for PA exposure was obtained, while the metabolome after OA exposure was not different from controls. The observed modifications in metabolites, as well as the expression levels of key metabolic enzymes, indicate a reduction in the activity of the Krebs and glutamate/glutamine cycles in response to PA. In addition, there were specific differences between the response of astrocytes from male and female mice, as well as between hypothalamic and cerebral cortical astrocytes. Thus, the response of hypothalamic astrocytes to specific fatty acids could result in differential impacts on surrounding metabolic neurons and resulting in varied systemic metabolic outcomes.</p>

                The descending-pain modulating circuit controls the experience of pain by modulating transmission of sensory signals through the dorsal horn. This circuit’s key output node, the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM), integrates ‘top-down’ and ‘bottom-up’ inputs that regulate functionally defined RVM cell types, ‘OFF-cells’ and ‘ON-cells’, which respectively suppress or facilitate pain-related sensory processing. While recent advances have sought molecular definition of RVM cell types, conflicting behavioral findings highlight challenges involved in aligning functional and molecularly defined types. This review summarizes current understanding, derived primarily from rodent studies but with corroborating evidence from human imaging, of the role of RVM populations in pain modulation and persistent pain states and explores recent advances outlining inputs to, and outputs from, RVM pain-modulating neurons.

">Stress-induced dysfunction of neurovascular astrocytes contributes to sex-specific behavioral deficits</a></h4>

              
                Astrocytes form an integral component of the neurovascular unit, ensheathing brain blood vessels with projections high in aquaporin-4 (AQP4) expression. These AQP4-rich projections facilitate interaction between the vascular endothelium, astrocytes, and neurons, and help stabilize vascular morphology. Studies using preclinical models of psychological stress and post-mortem tissue from patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) have reported reductions in AQP4, loss of astrocytic structures, and vascular impairment in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Though compelling, the role of AQP4 in mediating stress-induced alterations in blood vessel function and behavior remains unclear. Here, we address this, alongside potential sex differences in chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) effects on astrocyte phenotype, blood-brain barrier integrity, and behavior. CUS led to pronounced shifts in stress-coping behavior and working memory deficits in male -but not female- mice. Following behavioral testing, astrocytes from the frontal cortex were isolated for gene expression analyses. We found that CUS increased various transcripts associated with blood vessel maintenance in astrocytes from males, but either had no effect on- or decreased- these genes in females. Furthermore, CUS caused a reduction in vascular-localized AQP4 and elevated extravasation of a small molecule fluorescent reporter (Dextran) in the PFC in males but not females. Studies showed that knockdown of AQP4 in the PFC in males is sufficient to disrupt astrocyte phenotype and increase behavioral susceptibility to a sub-chronic stressor. Collectively, these findings provide initial evidence that sex-specific alterations in astrocyte phenotype and neurovascular integrity in the PFC contribute to behavioral and cognitive consequences following chronic stress.

                Amyloid beta (A{beta}), a stable protein, undergoes posttranslational glycation, forming glycated A{beta} (gA{beta}), an advanced glycation end product (AGE) observed in Alzheimers' disease (AD), yet the pathological role of gA{beta} remains understudied. This work explores the role of gA{beta} in inducing neuronal mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) efflux in a VDAC1-dependent manner and in activating the innate immune cGAS-STING pathway in AD. Findings demonstrate cGAS-mtDNA binding induced by gA{beta} in neuro-cytoplasm along with cGAS-STING activation in aged AD mice and human AD brains. Knockdown of RAGE, cGAS, or STING protects APP mice from mitochondrial dysfunction and AD-like pathology, as does inhibiting VDAC1. Moreover, RAGE inhibition in APP knock-in mice, coupled with spatially enhanced resolution omics-sequencing, confirms downregulation of innate immune responses and disease-associated genes in AD. Therefore, this study identifies a crucial link between gA{beta} and innate immunity, indicating therapeutic targeting of VDAC1, RAGE, or cGAS-STING may enhance resilience against gA{beta}-related pathological insults in AD.

                Neurons in primary visual cortex (V1) respond to natural scenes with a sparse and irregular spike code that is carefully balanced by an interplay between excitatory and inhibitory neurons. These neuron classes differ in their spike statistics, tuning preferences, connectivity statistics and temporal dynamics. To date, no single computational principle has been able to account for these properties. We developed a recurrently connected spiking network of excitatory and inhibitory units trained for efficient temporal prediction of natural movie clips. We found that the model exhibited simple and complex cell-like tuning, V1-like spike statistics, and, notably, also captured key differences between excitatory and inhibitory V1 neurons. This suggests that these properties collectively serve to facilitate efficient prediction of the sensory future.

">Stress hyperglycemia exacerbates inflammatory brain injury after stroke</a></h4>

              
                Post-stroke hyperglycemia occurs in 30% - 60% of ischemic stroke patients as part of the systemic stress response, but neither clinical evidence nor pre-clinical studies indicate whether post-stroke hyperglycemia affects stroke outcome. Here we investigated this issue using a mouse model of permanent ischemia. Mice were maintained either normoglycemic or hyperglycemic during the interval of 17 - 48 hours after ischemia onset. Post-stroke hyperglycemia was found to increase infarct volume, blood-brain barrier disruption, and hemorrhage formation, and to impair motor recovery. Post-stroke hyperglycemia also increased superoxide formation by peri-infarct microglia/macrophages. In contrast, post-stroke hyperglycemia did not increase superoxide formation or exacerbate motor impairment in p47phox-/- mice, which cannot form an active superoxide-producing NADPH oxidase-2 complex. These results suggest that hyperglycemia occurring hours-to-days after ischemia can increase oxidative stress in peri-infarct tissues by fueling NADPH oxidase activity in reactive microglia/macrophages, and by this mechanism contribute to worsened functional outcome.

">Roles and mechanisms of leptomeningeal collaterals in human distal MCA territory ischemia</a></h4>

              
                Objective: Leptomeningeal collaterals (LMCs) provided hemodynamic support and reperfusion during acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Although regulation details have been deeply acquired from animal models, human cortex may share limited hemodynamic patterns due to larger physical scale that needs further investigation. Approach and Results: We performed 'sequential hierarchical blocking' during awake craniotomy on fourteen human subjects to mimic AIS in middle cerebral artery (MCA) M4 segment territory. Widefield microscope was applied to reveal microcirculation of LMCs. Relative flow rate (RFR) was measured to evaluate the impact of LMCs hierarchy on microcirculation maintenance. Single-cell sequencing and spatial transcriptomics were further performed to analyze the mechanism of different LMCs recruitment abilities. LMCs RFR decreased to 30.75% immediately (95% CI, 6.64 - 54.86%, P < 0.001), and about 80.25% RFR was finally recovered within 5 minutes (95% CI, 55.2 - 105.3%, P = 0.0034) during M4 occlusion. For M5 and pial branches occlusion, RFR decreased to 55.78% with no further recovery (95% CI, 22.50-89.05%, P = 0.014), and 4 in 11 subjects had no valid microcirculation. For subjects with better recruitment ability, the proportion of arteriole is much higher in leptomeninx (76 - 79% vs. 36 - 56%). There were more significant interaction pairs associated with key signaling pathways between arteriole and neuron/astrocyte (TGF-beta signaling pathway, ECM-receptor interaction). Conclusion: Abundant LMCs supported hemodynamic stability during AIS in human subjects. The proportion of arteriole is much higher in leptomeninx for subjects with better recruitment ability. The Active neuron/astrocyte - arteriole interaction may improve LMCs recruitment.

">An algorithm for identifying task-specific brain subnetworks using the visuomotor system as an example</a></h4>

              
                We describe an algorithm that identifies a subnetwork of brain regions involved in producing a task-specific behavior, here visuomotor behavior, from an anatomically defined primate brain connectome. The algorithm first finds the brain regions connected to an output region (here, primary motor cortex, M1) by one connection. It then identifies all regions, termed layer 2 regions, connected to these layer 1 regions by one connection. This process continues until the layer containing the input region (here, primary visual cortex, V1) is reached. The algorithm then finds, subject to a user-set maximum step number, all paths linking the input and output regions. The brain regions in these paths constitute the initial subnetwork identification that performs the task. Regions known not to be task-involved (for example, regions in the ventral stream of visual information vs. the dorsal stream, which helps generate visuomotor behavior) are then removed. Structural subnetwork analysis showed that the intraparietal sulcus of the parietal cortex (PCIP) was most, and the secondary visual (V2) and superior parietal (PCS) cortices second-most, central to local network activity. Changing PCIP, V2 and PCS activity was thus most likely to alter activity of the entire subnetwork. Model sufficiency was tested by instantiating each brain region inherent activity with multiple versions of a simple two-dimensional (2D) model that can produce oscillatory activity and synaptically interconnecting the regions to produce a macroscopic visuomotor model. The model reproduced the experimental local field potential (LFP) activity of the brain regions identified as part of the visuomotor subnetwork.

">Automated segmentation of epilepsy surgical resection cavities: comparison of four methods to manual segmentation</a></h4>

              
                Accurate resection cavity segmentation on MRI is important for neuroimaging research involving epilepsy surgical outcomes. Manual segmentation, the gold standard, is highly labour intensive. Automated pipelines are an efficient potential solution; however, most have been developed for use following temporal epilepsy surgery. Our aim was to compare the accuracy of four automated segmentation pipelines following surgical resection in a mixed cohort of subjects following temporal or extra temporal epilepsy surgery. We identified 4 open-source automated segmentation pipelines. Epic-CHOP and ResectVol utilise SPM-12 within MATLAB, while Resseg and Deep Resection utilise 3D U-net convolutional neural networks. We manually segmented the resection cavity of 50 consecutive subjects who underwent epilepsy surgery (30 temporal, 20 extratemporal). We calculated Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) for each algorithm compared to the manual segmentation. No algorithm identified all resection cavities. ResectVol (n=44, 88%) and Epic-CHOP (n=43, 86%) were able to detect more resection cavities than Resseg (n=22, 44%, P<0.001) and Deep Resection (n=21, 42%, P<0.001). The SPM-based pipelines (Epic-CHOP and ResectVol) performed better than the deep learning-based pipelines in the overall and extratemporal surgery cohorts, however there was no difference between methods in the temporal surgery cohort. These pipelines could be applied to machine learning studies of outcome prediction to improve efficiency in pre-processing data, however human quality control is still required.

">Immunotherapy-related cognitive impairment after CAR T cell therapy in mice</a></h4>

              
                Persistent central nervous system (CNS) immune dysregulation and consequent dysfunction of multiple neural cell types is central to the neurobiological underpinnings of a cognitive impairment syndrome that can occur following traditional cancer therapies or certain infections. Immunotherapies have revolutionized cancer care for many tumor types, but the potential long-term cognitive sequelae are incompletely understood. Here, we demonstrate in mouse models that chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy for both CNS and non-CNS cancers can impair cognitive function and induce a persistent CNS immune response characterized by white matter microglial reactivity and elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cytokines and chemokines. Consequently, oligodendroglial homeostasis and hippocampal neurogenesis are disrupted. Microglial depletion rescues oligodendroglial deficits and cognitive performance in a behavioral test of attention and short-term memory function. Taken together, these findings illustrate similar mechanisms underlying immunotherapy-related cognitive impairment (IRCI) and cognitive impairment following traditional cancer therapies and other immune challenges.

">Neural Processing of Naturalistic Audiovisual Events in Space and Time</a></h4>

              
                Our brain seamlessly integrates distinct sensory information to form a coherent percept. However, when real-world audiovisual events are perceived, the specific brain regions and timings for processing different levels of information remain less investigated. To address that, we curated naturalistic videos and recorded fMRI and EEG data when participants viewed videos with accompanying sounds. Our findings reveal early asymmetrical cross-modal interaction, with acoustic information represented in both early visual and auditory regions, while visual information only identified in visual cortices. The visual and auditory features were processed with similar onset but different temporal dynamics. High-level categorical and semantic information emerged in multi-modal association areas later in time, indicating late cross-modal integration and its distinct role in converging conceptual information. Comparing neural representations to a two-branch deep neural network model highlighted the necessity of early fusion to build a biologically plausible model of audiovisual perception. With EEG-fMRI fusion, we provided a spatiotemporally resolved account of neural activity during the processing of naturalistic audiovisual stimuli.

">SAUSI: a novel assay for measuring social anxiety and motivation</a></h4>

              
                Social anxiety is one of the most prevalent mental health disorders, though the underlying neurobiology is poorly understood. Progress in understanding the etiology of social anxiety has been hindered by the lack of comprehensive tools to assess social anxiety in model systems. Here, we created a new behavioral task - Selective Access to Unrestricted Social Interaction (SAUSI), which combines elements of social motivation, hesitancy, decision-making, and free interaction to enable the wholistic assessment of social anxiety-like behaviors in mice. Using this novel assay, we found that social isolation-induced social anxiety-like behaviors in female mice are largely driven by increases in social fear, social hesitancy, and altered ultrasonic vocalizations. Deep learning analyses were able to computationally identify a unique behavioral footprint underlying the state produced by social isolation, demonstrating the compatibility of modern computational approaches with SAUSI. Finally, we compared the results of SAUSI to traditionally social assays including the 3-chamber sociability assay and the resident intruder task. This revealed that behavioral changes induced by isolation were highly context dependent, and that while fragments of social anxiety measured in SAUSI were replicable across other tasks, a wholistic assessment was not obtainable from these alternative assays. Our findings debut a novel task for the behavioral toolbox - one which overcomes limitations of previous assays, allowing for both social choice as well as free interaction, and offers a new approach for assessing social anxiety in rodents.

">A toolbox for genetic targeting of the claustrum</a></h4>

              
                The claustrum (CLA), a subcortical nucleus in mammals, essentially composed of excitatory projection neurons and known for its extensive connections with the neocortex, has recently been associated with a variety of functions ranging from consciousness to impulse control. However, research on the CLA has been challenging due to difficulties in specifically and comprehensively targeting its neuronal populations. In various cases, this limitation has led to inconsistent findings and a lack of reliable data. In the present work, we describe the expression profile of the Smim32 gene, which is almost exclusively transcribed in excitatory neurons of the CLA and the endopiriform nucleus, as well as in inhibitory neurons of the thalamic reticular nucleus. Leveraging this unique expression pattern, we developed a series of Cre- and Flippase-expressing knockin and BAC transgenic mouse lines with different expression profiles. With these novel tools in hand, we propose new standards for the interrogation of CLA function.

">Cortical Dynamics during Contour Integration</a></h4>

              
                Integrating visual elements into contours is important for object recognition. Previous studies emphasized the role that the primary visual cortex (V1) plays in this process. However, recent evidence suggests that contour integration relies on the coordination of hierarchical substrates of cortical regions through recurrent connections. Many previous studies presented the contour at the same onset-time as the trial, which caused the subsequent neural imaging data to incorporate both visual evocation and contour integration activities, and thus confounding the two. In this study, we varied both the contour onset-time and contour fidelity and used EEG to examine the cortical activities under these conditions. Our results suggest that the middle temporal N300 represents the grouping and integration of visual elements into contours. Before this signature, we observed interhemispheric connections between lateral frontal and posterior parietal regions that were contingent on the contour location and peaked at around 150ms after contour appearance. Also, the magnitudes of connections between medial frontal and superior parietal regions were dependent on the timing of contour onset and peaked at around 250ms after contour onset. These activities appear to be related to the bottom-up and top-down attentional processing during contour integration, respectively, and shed light on how these processes cooperate dynamically during contour integration.

">Melanopsin ganglion cells in the mouse retina independently evoke pupillary light reflex</a></h4>

              
                Purpose: The pupillary light reflex (PLR) is crucial for protecting the retina from bright light. The intrinsic photosensitive ganglion cells (ipRGCs) in the retina mediate the PLR, which directly sense light and receive inputs from rod/cone photoreceptors. Previous work used genetic knockout mice to reveal that rod/cone photoreceptors drive transient constriction, and ipRGCs drive the sustained component. We acutely ablated photoreceptors by a chemical injection to examine the role of rod and cone photoreceptors in PLR. Methods: PLR and the multiple electrode array (MEA) recording were conducted with C57BL6/J (wildtype: WT) and Cnga3-/-; Gnat1-/- (rod/cone dysfunctional) mice. n-Nitroso-n-methylurea (MNU) was applied to C57 mice by intraperitoneal injection, and PLR was conducted after 5-7 days of injection. Three different light levels (mesopic, low photopic, and high photopic) were tested. Immunohistochemistry was conducted using the anti-Gnat1 and anti-melanopsin antibodies with DAPI. Results: PLR was induced by all light levels we tested, and the level of constriction increased as the light level increased. After the MNU injection, PLR was not induced at mesopic light stimulus, but was fully induced by high light. The level of PLR was identical between WT and MNU mice, suggesting that ipRGCs fully contributed to the PLR at this light level. Immunohistochemistry revealed that photoreceptors were ablated by the MNU injection, but ipRGCs were preserved. The MEA recording revealed that a population of ipRGCs generated fast and robust spikes in MNU-injected retinal tissues in ex vivo. Conclusions: Contrary to previous observations, our results demonstrate that ipRGCs are the major contributor to the PLR induced by high light.

">Task-irrelevant stimuli reliably boost phasic pupil-linked arousal but do not affect decision formation</a></h4>

              
                The arousal systems of the brainstem, specifically the locus coeruleus-noradrenaline system, respond "phasically" during decisions. These central arousal transients are accompanied by dilations of the pupil. Mechanistic attempts to understand the impact of phasic arousal on cognition would benefit from the ability to experimentally manipulate arousal in a temporally precise manner. Here, we evaluated a non-invasive candidate approach for such a manipulation in humans: presenting task-irrelevant auditory stimuli at different latencies during the execution of a challenging task. Task-irrelevant auditory stimuli drive responses of brainstem nuclei involved in the control of pupil size. But it is unknown whether such sound-evoked responses mimic the central arousal transients evoked during cognitive computations. A large body of evidence has implicated central arousal transients in a bias reduction during challenging perceptual decisions. We thus used challenging visual decisions as a testbed, combining them with task-irrelevant sounds of varying onset latency or duration. Across three experiments, the sounds consistently elicited well-controlled pupil responses that superimposed onto task-evoked responses. While we replicated a negative correlation between task-evoked pupil responses and bias established in previous work, the task-irrelevant sounds had no behavioral effect. This dissociation suggests that cognitive task engagement and task-irrelevant sounds may recruit distinct neural systems contributing to the control of pupil size.

">Replay without sharp wave ripples in a spatial memory task.</a></h4>

              
                Sharp-wave ripples in the hippocampus are believed to be a fundamental mechanism for the consolidation of episodic memories. During ripples, hippocampal neurons are re-activated in sequences called replay, which have been hypothesized to reflect episodic memory content. Ripples and replay are usually reported to co-occur, and are commonly thought to reflect the same process. Here we report that, in rats performing an open field spatial memory task, replays readily occur in the complete absence of ripples. Moreover, the occurrence of ripple-less and ripple-containing replays is not random, but precisely organized in terms of virtual space: Ripples are confined to "ripple fields", which are spatially-restricted areas defined over the virtual locations depicted during replay and independent of the actual location of the animal. Similar to allocentric coding by place fields, ripple fields are independent of the direction of travel, and stable throughout the recording session. Ripple fields track changes to environmental structure caused by the addition or subtraction of barriers to movement, consistent with ripples conveying information about the incorporation of novel experiences. Moreover, ripple fields were matched across different rats experiencing the same barrier configuration, highlighting the robustness of the ripple field spatial code. We hypothesize a new relationship between ripples and replay, in which a subset of replays that is particularly relevant to learning or novelty is paired with ripples, in order to promote its selective broadcast to the rest of the brain for consolidation.

">Competition and integration of visual and goal vector signals for spatial navigation</a></h4>

              
                Integrating different sources of information is essential to successful spatial navigation. For instance, animals must often rely on a combination of visual impressions, self-motion, olfaction, and other signals to navigate to a goal. This is especially important when navigating in uncertain environments, where switching from one source of information to another or integrating multiple sources of information may be required to make navigation decisions. We propose a computational model of the interaction of visual and goal-vector signals based on reinforcement learning and use it to study behavior and spatial representations. Our model demonstrates that the ability to navigate using each information source independently, in addition to integrating them, is crucial to successfully navigating in uncertain environments. Counterintuitively, our model also shows that when one of the signals is removed, navigation may be improved if the remaining signal is reliable and sufficient to navigate, however, this improvement comes at the expense of robustness.

">Sex dependent effects of amyloidosis on functional network hub topology is associated with downregulated neuronal gene signatures in the APPswe/PSEN1dE9 double transgenic mouse</a></h4>

              
                Extracellular beta-amyloid (A{beta}) is thought to cause impairments in brain wide functional connectivity, although mechanisms linking A{beta} to broader functional network processing remain elusive. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of A{beta} on fear memory and functional connectome measures in male and female mice. Middle-aged (9-11mo) double transgenic APP-PS1 mice and age and sex-matched controls were tested on a fear conditioning protocol and then imaged at 11.1 Tesla. Brains were harvested and processed for analysis of A{beta} plaques and Iba1 immunolabeling in neocortical areas, hippocampus, and basolateral amygdala. Additional RNA sequencing data from separate age, strain, and sex matched mice were analyzed for differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and weighted gene co-expression networks. In both male and female mice, we observed increased functional connectivity in a dorsal striatal/amygdala network as a result of A{beta}. Increased functional connectivity within this network was matched by increases in APP gene expression, A{beta} and Iba1 immunolabeling, and an upregulated cluster of DEGs involved in the immune response. Conversely, the network measure representing node hubness, eigenvector centrality, was increased in prefrontal cortical brain regions, but only in female APP-PS1 mice. This female specific-effect of amyloid was associated with downregulation of a cluster of DEGs involved in cortical and striatal GABA transmission, anxiogenic responses, and motor activity, in female APP-PS1 mice, but not males. Our results contribute to a growing literature linking between A{beta}, immune activation and functional network connectivity. Furthermore, our results reveal effects of A{beta} on gene expression patterns in female mice that may contribute to amyloidosis-induced dysregulation of non-cognitive circuitry.

">Ketamine reverses stress-induced hypersensitivity to sunk costs</a></h4>

              
                How mood interacts with information processing in the brain is thought to mediate the maladaptive behaviors observed in depressed individuals. However, the neural mechanisms underlying impairments in emotion-cognition interactions are poorly understood. This includes influencing the balance between how past-sensitive vs. future-looking one is during decision-making. Recent insights from the field of neuroeconomics offer novel approaches to study changes in such valuation processes in a manner that is biologically tractable and readily translatable across species. We recently discovered that rodents are sensitive to sunk costs - a feature of higher cognition previously thought to be unique to humans. The sunk costs bias describes the phenomenon in which an individual overvalues and escalates commitment to continuing an ongoing endeavor, even if suboptimal, as a function of irrecoverable past (sunk) losses - information that, according to classic economic theory, should be ignored. In the present study, mice were exposed to chronic social defeat stress paradigm, a well-established animal model used for the study of depression. Mice were then tested on our longitudinal neuroeconomic foraging task, Restaurant Row. We found mice exposed to this severe stressor displayed an increased sensitivity to sunk costs, without altering overall willingness to wait. Mice were then randomly assigned to receive a single intraperitoneal injection of either saline or ketamine (20 mg/kg). We discovered that stress-induced hypersensitivity to sunk costs was renormalized following a single dose of ketamine. Interestingly, in non-defeated mice, ketamine treatment completely abolished sunk cost sensitivity, causing mice to no longer value irrecoverable losses during re-evaluation decisions who instead based choices solely on the future investment required to obtain a goal. These findings suggest that the antidepressant effects of ketamine may be mediated in part through changes in the processing of past-sensitive information during on-going decision-making, reducing its weight as a potential source of cognitive dissonance that could modulate behavior and instead promoting more future-thinking behavior.

">Distinct functional classes of CA1 hippocampal interneurons are modulated by cerebellar stimulation in a coordinated manner</a></h4>

              
                There is mounting evidence that the cerebellum impacts hippocampal functioning, but the impact of the cerebellum on hippocampal interneurons remains obscure. Using miniscopes in freely behaving animals, we find optogenetic stimulation of Purkinje cells alters the calcium activity of a large percentage of CA1 interneurons. This includes both increases and decreases in activity. Remarkably, this bidirectional impact occurs in a coordinated fashion, in line with interneurons' functional properties. Specifically, CA1 interneurons activated by cerebellar stimulation are commonly locomotion-active, while those inhibited by cerebellar stimulation are commonly rest-active interneurons. We additionally find that subsets of CA1 interneurons show altered activity during object investigations, suggesting a role in the processing of objects in space. Importantly, these neurons also show coordinated modulation by cerebellar stimulation: CA1 interneurons that are activated by cerebellar stimulation are more likely to be activated, rather than inhibited, during object investigations, while interneurons that show decreased activity during cerebellar stimulation show the opposite profile. Therefore, CA1 interneurons play a role in object processing and in cerebellar impacts on the hippocampus, providing insight into previously noted altered CA1 processing of objects in space with cerebellar stimulation. We examined two different stimulation locations (IV/V Vermis; Simplex) and two different stimulation approaches (7Hz or a single 1s light pulse) - in all cases, the cerebellum induces similar coordinated CA1 interneuron changes congruent with an explorative state. Overall, our data show that the cerebellum impacts CA1 interneurons in a bidirectional and coordinated fashion, positioning them to play an important role in cerebello-hippocampal communication.

">An integrated microfluidic and fluorescence platform for probing in vivo neuropharmacology</a></h4>

              
                Neurotechnologies and genetic tools for dissecting neural circuit functions have advanced rapidly over the past decade, although the development of complementary pharmacological methodologies has comparatively lagged. Understanding the precise pharmacological mechanisms of neuroactive compounds is critical for advancing basic neurobiology and neuropharmacology, as well as for developing more effective treatments for neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders. However, integrating modern tools for assessing neural activity in large-scale neural networks with spatially localized drug delivery remains a major challenge. Here, we present a dual microfluidic-photometry platform that enables simultaneous intracranial drug delivery with neural dynamics monitoring in the rodent brain. The integrated platform combines a wireless, battery-free, miniaturized fluidic microsystem with optical probes, allowing for spatially and temporally specific drug delivery while recording activity-dependent fluorescence using genetically encoded calcium indicators (GECIs), neurotransmitter sensors GRABNE and GRABDA, and neuropeptide sensors. We demonstrate the performance this platform for investigating neuropharmacological mechanisms in vivo and characterize its efficacy in probing precise mechanistic actions of neuroactive compounds across several rapidly evolving neuroscience domains.

">Shared spatial selectivity in early visual cortex and face-selective brain regions</a></h4>

              
                Face recognition is widely considered to be ''special'', involving dedicated brain regions with unique patterns of selectivity. This contrasts with increasing evidence for common patterns of 'visuospatial coding', where even high-level category-selective areas share the spatial properties of earlier brain regions. Here we examined whether the retinotopic properties of face-selective areas vary around the visual field in a similar fashion to those of early visual cortex, and whether these spatial properties could explain variations in face perception around the visual field. We carried out retinotopic mapping of early (V1-V3) and face-selective cortical regions (OFA, pFus, mFus) using large-field bars of faces (21{degrees} eccentricity), with spatial selectivity measured via population receptive field (pRF) analysis. While pRFs were considerably larger in face-selective regions than in V1-V3, their size did not vary consistently either across areas or in line with behavioural anisotropies. However, both early cortex and face-selective areas show a greater number of pRFs and a concomitant increase in visual field coverage along the horizontal vs. vertical meridian and in the lower vs. upper field. Variations in our face-recognition abilities around the visual field could thus be driven by these differences in sampling. We also show that pRF numbers (and subsequent coverage) in mFus were typically greater for upright than inverted faces, suggesting these properties could similarly support the perceptual advantage for upright faces, at least in part. The commonality of these variations in visual field sampling between face-selective cortex and earlier visual regions further support a hierarchical model whereby the spatial selectivity of higher-level areas is built upon the selectivity of lower regions, even for specialised face processing.

">The hippocampus supports interpolation into new states during category abstraction</a></h4>

              
                The hippocampus forms concepts by integrating multi-feature relations into a unified representation. A common yet unconfirmed assumption is that such cognitive maps afford interpolations to never-experienced states. We approach this question as a category-learning problem in which prototypes are omitted from training but guide category-based decisions in a subsequent feature-inference task. Consistent with behavior, missing inferred stimulus features were represented at prototypical values in neocortex. This cortical completion effect correlated with hippocampal responses, which in turn reflected the distance between imagined prototypes and experienced exemplars. This was paralleled by a learning-dependent grid-like representation of the underlying concept space in entorhinal cortex. Our results suggest that abstracted prototypes correspond to interpolated central states in a cognitive map that guide cortical pattern completion during category-based decisions.

">STEMorph: Morphed Emotional Face Stimuli</a></h4>

              
                Emotion recognition is crucial for interpreting social cues, with facial expressions being the primary channel for such communication. Despite its importance, emotion recognition is often influenced by biases, in which we show a systematic recognition advantage for a particular emotion. These biases, however, are inconsistently reported across studies, likely due to methodological variations, underlining the necessity for a standardized approach. Traditional face morphing methods, although widely used, can create unnatural-looking stimuli, which may confound the interpretation of emotions. Addressing this issue, we here introduce STEMorph, a validated stimulus set based on the NimStim facial expression set. Our approach utilizes neutral-anchored morphing and neural-network-generated masks to ensure the natural appearance and integrity of the depicted emotions. We validated our stimulus set by presenting morphed emotional faces to participants and asking them to rate the emotional valence of each stimulus. The STEMorph's validity was confirmed through linear regression analysis, showing a strong correlation between subjective ratings and targeted emotional states. Additionally, subgroup analysis by gender of both the depicted faces and the participants showed uniform results. Moreover, we confirmed the reliability of STEMorph by asking the same participants to rate the stimuli two weeks later. In conclusion, by introducing a controlled, validated, and ecologically valid stimulus set of emotional faces, our study paves the way for further investigations aimed at unraveling the complexities of facial emotion recognition and deepening our understanding of this vital aspect of human interaction.

">Differential effects of prolonged post-fixation on immunohistochemical and histochemical staining for postmortem human brains</a></h4>

              
                Immunohistochemical (IHC) and histochemical (HC) staining is widely used for human brains postfixed in formalin for years and decades. Understanding the effect of prolonged post-fixation, postmortem interval (PMI) and age on these staining procedures is important for interpreting their outcomes, thus improving diagnosis and research of brain disorders. In this study, we performed both IHC and HC staining for prefrontal cortex (PFC) of postmortem human brains postfixed for 1, 5, 10, 15 and 20 years. A negative correlation was detected between the intensity of neuron marker NeuN, microglia marker Iba1, cresyl violet and Luxol fast blue staining versus post-fixation times. By contrast, a positive correlation was seen between the intensity of astrocyte marker GFAP and H&E staining versus post-fixation times. No correlation was found between most of these parameters versus age or PMI. These data suggest that prolonged post-fixation exerts both positive and negative effects, but age and PMI have limited effects, on these IHC and HC parameters. Hence these differential changes need to be considered in the interpretation of the results when using tissues with prolonged post-fixation. It is recommended to perform IHC and HC staining for human brains with similar post-fixation time to offset its impact on downstream analyses.

                Substrate-borne cues are important species-specific signals that are widely used during courtship of many animals, from arthropods to vertebrates. They allow mating partners to communicate with, recognise and choose one another. Animals often produce substrate-borne signals by vibrating a body part, such as the abdomen. During Drosophila courtship, species-specific substrate-borne vibrations are generated by the males regular up-and-down abdominal tremulations and these must be precisely controlled to produce an effective and specific signal. The vibrations immobilise the female, therefore facilitating copulation. It is not known how the males nervous system regulates this abdominal tremulation. Here, we demonstrate a role for the dorsal abdominal longitudinal stretch receptors (LSR), which include the dorsal bipolar dendritic (dbd) neurons. These neurons are a set of conserved proprioceptors found throughout Insecta. We show that impairing the function of dbd neurons through general inhibition results in males exhibiting high level of arhythmic abdominal movements (referred to as bobbing) and decreased level of tremulation. Strikingly, this causes a failure in the females response during courtship. We show that depleting the mechanosensitive ion channel TRPA1 (but not Piezo) in the dbd neurons leads to a similar increase in bobbing movements. Thus, we identify neurons and a key molecular player necessary for males to perform this important mode of communication.

">Joint population coding and temporal coherence link an attended talker's voice and location features in naturalistic multi-talker scenes.</a></h4>

              
                Listeners readily extract multi-dimensional auditory objects such as a {acute}localized talker{acute} from complex acoustic scenes with multiple talkers. Yet, the neural mechanisms underlying simultaneous encoding and linking of different sound features -- for example, a talker{acute}s voice and location -- are poorly understood. We analyzed invasive intracranial recordings in neurosurgical patients attending to a localized talker in real-life cocktail party scenarios. We found that sensitivity to an individual talker{acute}s voice and location features was distributed throughout auditory cortex and that neural sites exhibited a gradient from sensitivity to a single feature to joint sensitivity to both features. On a population level, cortical response patterns of both dual-feature sensitive sites but also single-feature sensitive sites revealed simultaneous encoding of an attended talker{acute}s voice and location features. However, for single-feature sensitive sites, the representation of the primary feature was more precise. Further, sites which selective tracked an attended speech stream concurrently encoded an attended talker{acute}s voice and location features, indicating that such sites combine selective tracking of an attended auditory object with encoding of the object{acute}s features. Finally, we found that attending a localized talker selectively enhanced temporal coherence between single-feature voice sensitive sites and single-feature location sensitive sites, providing an additional mechanism for linking voice and location features in multi-talker scenes. These results demonstrate that a talker{acute}s voice and location features are linked during multi-dimensional object formation in naturalistic multi-talker scenes by joint population coding as well as by temporal coherence between neural sites.

">BlueRecording: A Pipeline for the efficient calculation of extracellular recordings in large-scale neural circuit models</a></h4>

              
                As the size and complexity of network simulations accessible to computational neuroscience grows, new avenues open for research into extracellularly recorded electric signals. Biophysically detailed simulations permit the identification of the biological origins of the different components of recorded signals, the evaluation of signal sensitivity to different anatomical, physiological, and geometric factors, and selection of recording parameters to maximize the signal information content. Simultaneously, virtual extracellular signals produced by these networks may become important metrics for neuro-simulation validation. To enable efficient calculation of extracellular signals from large neural network simulations, we have developed BlueRecording, a pipeline consisting of standalone Python code, along with extensions to the Neurodamus simulation control application, the CoreNEURON computation engine, and the SONATA data format, to permit online calculation of such signals. In particular, we implement a general form of the reciprocity theorem, which is capable of handling non-dipolar current sources, such as may be found in long axons and recordings close to the current source, as well as complex tissue anatomy, dielectric heterogeneity, and electrode geometries. To our knowledge, this is the first application of this generalized (i.e., non-dipolar) reciprocity-based approach to simulate EEG recordings. We use these tools to calculate extracellular signals from an in silico model of the rat somatosensory cortex and to study signal contribution differences.

">Cone bipolar cell synapses generate transient versus sustained signals in parallel ON pathways of the mouse retina</a></h4>

              
                Parallel processing is a fundamental organizing principle in the nervous system, and understanding how parallel neural circuits generate distinct outputs from common inputs is a key goal of neuroscience. In the mammalian retina, divergence of cone signals into multiple feed-forward bipolar cell pathways forms the initial basis for parallel retinal circuits dedicated to specific visual functions. Here, we used patch-clamp electrophysiology, electron microscopy and two photon imaging of a fluorescent glutamate sensor to examine how kinetically distinct responses arise in transient versus sustained ON alpha RGCs (ON-T and ON-S RGCs) of the mouse retina. We directly compared the visual response properties of these RGCs with their presynaptic bipolar cell partners, which we identified using 3D electron microscopy reconstruction. Different ON bipolar cell subtypes (type 5i, type 6 and type 7) had indistinguishable light-driven responses whereas extracellular glutamate signals around RGC dendrites and postsynaptic excitatory currents measured in ON-T and ON-S RGCs in response to the identical stimuli used to probe bipolar cells were kinetically distinct. Anatomical examination of the bipolar cell axon terminals presynaptic to ON-T and ON-S RGCs suggests bipolar subtype-specific differences in the size of synaptic ribbon-associated vesicle pools may contribute to transient versus sustained kinetics. Our findings indicate bipolar cell synapses are a primary point of divergence in kinetically distinct visual pathways.

">Early and widespread engagement of the cerebellum during hippocampal epileptiform activity</a></h4>

              
                Despite research illustrating the cerebellum may be a critical circuit element in the epilepsies, remarkably little is known about cerebellar engagement during seizures. We therefore implemented a novel method for repeated imaging of the cerebellum in awake, chronically epileptic animals. We found widespread changes in cerebellar calcium signals during behavioral seizures and during hippocampal seizures that remained electrographic only, arguing against cerebellar modulation simply reflecting motor components. Moreover, even brief interictal spikes produced widespread alterations in cerebellar activity. Changes were noted in the anterior and posterior cerebellum, along the midline, and both ipsilaterally and contralaterally to the seizure focus. Remarkably, changes in the cerebellum also occurred prior to any noticeable change in the hippocampal electrographic recordings, suggesting a special relationship between the cerebellum and hippocampal epileptiform activity. Together these results underscore the importance of the cerebellum in epilepsy, warranting a more consistent consideration of the cerebellum when evaluating epilepsy patients.

">Slow Oscillations Modulate Functional Brain Changes Supporting Working Memory</a></h4>

              
                Working memory (WM), the temporary mental storage and manipulation of information, is a skill that can improve with training. Sleep, and specifically slow oscillations (SOs), has been linked with WM improvement, yet it is unknown how processing during SOs modulates WM function across sleep. The current study examines how WM-related neural processing changes with sleep, and how these changes are related to activity during SOs. To do so, participants performed a WM task during fMRI before and after sleep, and the first 2.5 hrs of sleep was monitored by simultaneous EEG-fMRI. Reliable overnight changes in WM-related activity patterns were found, with reduced recruitment of the dorsal precuneus after compared to before sleep. Moreover, greater neural activation during SOs was associated with reduced overnight recruitment during WM across multiple levels of analysis. Our findings highlight the important role of SOs, elucidating how SOs may support changes in WM function across sleep.

	<p>Lucid dreaming involves becoming aware that one&amp;amp;rsquo;s current experience is a dream, which has similarities with the notion of mindfulness&amp;amp;mdash;becoming aware of moment-to-moment changes in experience. Additionally, meta-awareness, the ability to explicitly notice the current content of one&amp;amp;rsquo;s own mental state, has also been proposed to play an important role both in lucid dreaming and mindfulness meditation practices. However, research has shown conflicting strengths of associations between mindfulness, meditation, and lucid dreaming frequency, and the link between lucid dreaming and meta-awareness has not yet been empirically studied. This study evaluated the associations between lucid dreaming frequency and different meditation practice styles, mindfulness traits, and individual differences in meta-awareness through an online survey (n = 635). The results suggest that daily frequent meditators experience more lucid dreams than non-frequent meditators. However, weekly frequent meditators did not have a higher lucid dreaming frequency. A positive association was observed between open monitoring styles of meditation and lucid dreaming. The findings also indicate that meta-awareness is higher for meditators and weekly lucid dreamers. Furthermore, frequent lucid dreaming was commonly associated with a non-reactive stance and experiencing transcendence. Overall, the findings suggest a positive relationship between specific meditation practices and lucid dreaming as well as the importance of meta-awareness as a cognitive process linking meditation, mindfulness, and lucid dreaming.</p>

                <p>Singing-based treatments of aphasia can improve language outcomes, but the neural benefits of group-based singing in aphasia are unknown. Here, we set out to determine the structural neuroplasticity changes underpinning group-based singing-induced treatment effects in chronic aphasia. Twenty-eight patients with at least mild nonfluent poststroke aphasia were randomized into two groups that received a 4-month multicomponent singing intervention (singing group) or standard care (control group). High-resolution T1 images and multishell diffusion-weighted MRI data were collected in two time points (baseline/5&nbsp;months). Structural gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) neuroplasticity changes were assessed using language network region of interest-based voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and quantitative anisotropy-based connectometry, and their associations to improved language outcomes (Western Aphasia Battery Naming and Repetition) were evaluated. Connectometry analyses showed that the singing group enhanced structural WM connectivity in the left arcuate fasciculus (AF) and corpus callosum as well as in the frontal aslant tract (FAT), superior longitudinal fasciculus, and corticostriatal tract bilaterally compared with the control group. Moreover, in VBM, the singing group showed GM volume increase in the left inferior frontal cortex (Brodmann area 44) compared with the control group. The neuroplasticity effects in the left BA44, AF, and FAT correlated with improved naming abilities after the intervention. These findings suggest that in the poststroke aphasia group, singing can bring about structural neuroplasticity changes in left frontal language areas and in bilateral language pathways, which underpin treatment-induced improvement in speech production.</p>

                <p>Infrared neural stimulation (INS) is a promising area of interest for the clinical application of a neuromodulation method. This is in part because of its low invasiveness, whereby INS modulates the activity of the neural tissue mainly through temperature changes. Additionally, INS may provide localized brain stimulation with less tissue damage. The inferior colliculus (IC) is a crucial auditory relay nucleus and a potential target for clinical application of INS to treat auditory diseases and develop artificial hearing devices. Here, using continuous INS with low to high-power density, we demonstrate the laminar modulation of neural activity in the mouse IC in the presence and absence of sound. We investigated stimulation parameters of INS to effectively modulate the neural activity in a facilitatory or inhibitory manner. A mathematical model of INS-driven brain tissue was first simulated, temperature distributions were numerically estimated, and stimulus parameters were selected from the simulation results. Subsequently, INS was administered to the IC of anesthetized mice, and the modulation effect on the neural activity was measured using an electrophysiological approach. We found that the modulatory effect of INS on the spontaneous neural activity was bidirectional between facilitatory and inhibitory effects. The modulatory effect on sound-evoked responses produced only an inhibitory effect to all examined stimulus intensities. Thus, this study provides important physiological evidence on the response properties of IC neurons to INS. Overall, INS can be used for the development of new therapies for neurological disorders and functional support devices for auditory central processing.</p>

                Background This study conducted a comprehensive bibliometric analysis to identify the gaps in the existing literature related to Online marketing and brand awareness strategies for HEI. It has evaluated the current state of the literature on the given topic showing the pivotal role of online marketing and brand awareness in higher education for enrollment. Methods The study used a web-based application, Biblioshiny, which comes in the bibliometrix package. The study used the Scopus database to create the data set, given its conventional construction and quality of the sources. The analysis done is descriptive. By using the bibliometrix software, the study showed the authors name, articles, sources, citations, relevant journals and co-citation from the year 2017 to 2022. The time period selected by the study was five years which means that articles published from 2017 to 2022 have been taken for the study. Results We found that HEI online marketing and brand awareness have not been explored much as it has not reached the stage of maturity. Most of the publication was done during the time of Covid-19. Also, the role of brand awareness in student enrollment decisions for HEI requires more investigation. Top most publications their sources and top authors are identified. Conclusions Bibliometric analysis has provided valuable insights into the seminal work, emerging trends, and the gap in the study. This area of study has been explored but not as much as challenges, and the effectiveness of online marketing tools like seo, sem,ppc and more has not been measured. Further, this paper allows researchers to study by examining the pattern of publications by seeing the different authorships, co-authors, collaborations, relevant sources, and citations. The insights of this paper will help education policymakers devise more creative strategies to increase enrollment, ensuring sustained relevance and competitive advantage in higher education institutions .

                <p>by Marko Šterk, Yaowen Zhang, Viljem Pohorec, Eva Paradiž Leitgeb, Jurij Dolenšek, Richard K. P. Benninger, Andraž Stožer, Vira Kravets, Marko Gosak</p>

Within the islets of Langerhans, beta cells orchestrate synchronized insulin secretion, a pivotal aspect of metabolic homeostasis. Despite the inherent heterogeneity and multimodal activity of individual cells, intercellular coupling acts as a homogenizing force, enabling coordinated responses through the propagation of intercellular waves. Disruptions in this coordination are implicated in irregular insulin secretion, a hallmark of diabetes. Recently, innovative approaches, such as integrating multicellular calcium imaging with network analysis, have emerged for a quantitative assessment of the cellular activity in islets. However, different groups use distinct experimental preparations, microscopic techniques, apply different methods to process the measured signals and use various methods to derive functional connectivity patterns. This makes comparisons between findings and their integration into a bigger picture difficult and has led to disputes in functional connectivity interpretations. To address these issues, we present here a systematic analysis of how different approaches influence the network representation of islet activity. Our findings show that the choice of methods used to construct networks is not crucial, although care is needed when combining data from different islets. Conversely, the conclusions drawn from network analysis can be heavily affected by the pre-processing of the time series, the type of the oscillatory component in the signals, and by the experimental preparation. Our tutorial-like investigation aims to resolve interpretational issues, reconcile conflicting views, advance functional implications, and encourage researchers to adopt connectivity analysis. As we conclude, we outline challenges for future research, emphasizing the broader applicability of our conclusions to other tissues exhibiting complex multicellular dynamics.

Changes in risk preference have been reported when making a series of independent risky choices or non-foraging economic decisions. Behavioral economics has put forward various explanations for specific effects on risk preference in non-foraging tasks, but a consensus regarding the general principle underlying these effects has not been reached. In contrast, recent studies have investigated human economic risky choices using tasks adapted from foraging theory, which require consideration of past choices and future opportunities to make optimal decisions. In these foraging tasks, human economic risky choices are explained by the ethological principle of fitness maximization, which naturally leads to dynamic risk preference. Here, we conducted two online experiments to investigate whether the principle of fitness maximization can explain risk preference dynamics in a non-foraging task. Participants were asked to make a series of independent risky economic decisions while the environmental richness changed. We found that participants’ risk preferences were influenced by the current and past environments, making them more risk-averse during and after the rich environment compared to the poor environment. These changes in risk preference align with fitness maximization. Our findings suggest that the ethological principle of fitness maximization might serve as a generalizable principle for explaining dynamic preferences, including risk preference, in human economic decision-making.

                <p>by Blox Bloxham, Hyunseok Lee, Jeff Gore</p>

How natural communities maintain their remarkable biodiversity and which species survive in complex communities are central questions in ecology. Resource competition models successfully explain many phenomena but typically predict only as many species as resources can coexist. Here, we demonstrate that sequential resource utilization, or diauxie, with periodic growth cycles can support many more species than resources. We explore how communities modify their own environments by sequentially depleting resources to form sequences of temporal niches, or intermediately depleted environments. Biodiversity is enhanced when community-driven or environmental fluctuations modulate the resource depletion order and produce different temporal niches on each growth cycle. Community-driven fluctuations under constant environmental conditions are rare, but exploring them illuminates the temporal niche structure that emerges from sequential resource utilization. With environmental fluctuations, we find most communities have more stably coexisting species than resources with survivors accurately predicted by the same temporal niche structure and each following a distinct optimal strategy. Our results thus present a new niche-based approach to understanding highly diverse fluctuating communities.

                <p>by Fleur Zeldenrust, Niccolò Calcini, Xuan Yan, Ate Bijlsma, Tansu Celikel</p>

Sensory neurons reconstruct the world from action potentials (spikes) impinging on them. To effectively transfer information about the stimulus to the next processing level, a neuron needs to be able to adapt its working range to the properties of the stimulus. Here, we focus on the intrinsic neural properties that influence information transfer in cortical neurons and how tightly their properties need to be tuned to the stimulus statistics for them to be effective. We start by measuring the intrinsic information encoding properties of putative excitatory and inhibitory neurons in L2/3 of the mouse barrel cortex. Excitatory neurons show high thresholds and strong adaptation, making them fire sparsely and resulting in a strong compression of information, whereas inhibitory neurons that favour fast spiking transfer more information. Next, we turn to computational modelling and ask how two properties influence information transfer: 1) spike-frequency adaptation and 2) the shape of the IV-curve. We find that a subthreshold (but not threshold) adaptation, the ‘h-current’, and a properly tuned leak conductance can increase the information transfer of a neuron, whereas threshold adaptation can increase its working range. Finally, we verify the effect of the IV-curve slope in our experimental recordings and show that excitatory neurons form a more heterogeneous population than inhibitory neurons. These relationships between intrinsic neural features and neural coding that had not been quantified before will aid computational, theoretical and systems neuroscientists in understanding how neuronal populations can alter their coding properties, such as through the impact of neuromodulators. Why the variability of intrinsic properties of excitatory neurons is larger than that of inhibitory ones is an exciting question, for which future research is needed.

                <p>by Moo K. Chung, Shih-Gu Huang, Ian C. Carroll, Vince D. Calhoun, H. Hill Goldsmith</p>

We introduce an innovative, data-driven topological data analysis (TDA) technique for estimating the state spaces of dynamically changing functional human brain networks at rest. Our method utilizes the Wasserstein distance to measure topological differences, enabling the clustering of brain networks into distinct topological states. This technique outperforms the commonly used k-means clustering in identifying brain network state spaces by effectively incorporating the temporal dynamics of the data without the need for explicit model specification. We further investigate the genetic underpinnings of these topological features using a twin study design, examining the heritability of such state changes. Our findings suggest that the topology of brain networks, particularly in their dynamic state changes, may hold significant hidden genetic information.

                <p>by Ariana Chriss, G. Valentin Börner, Shawn D. Ryan</p>

During meiosis, pairing of homologous chromosomes (homologs) ensures the formation of haploid gametes from diploid precursor cells, a prerequisite for sexual reproduction. Pairing during meiotic prophase I facilitates crossover recombination and homolog segregation during the ensuing reductional cell division. Mechanisms that ensure stable homolog alignment in the presence of an excess of non-homologous chromosomes have remained elusive, but rapid chromosome movements during prophase I appear to play a role in the process. Apart from homolog attraction, provided by early intermediates of homologous recombination, dissociation of non-homologous associations also appears to contribute to homolog pairing, as suggested by the detection of stable non-homologous chromosome associations in pairing-defective mutants. Here, we have developed an agent-based model for homolog pairing derived from the dynamics of a naturally occurring chromosome ensemble. The model simulates unidirectional chromosome movements, as well as collision dynamics determined by attractive and repulsive forces arising from close-range physical interactions. Chromosome number and size as well as movement velocity and repulsive forces are identified as key factors in the kinetics and efficiency of homologous pairing in addition to homolog attraction. Dissociation of interactions between non-homologous chromosomes may contribute to pairing by crowding homologs into a limited nuclear area thus creating preconditions for close-range homolog attraction. Incorporating natural chromosome lengths, the model accurately recapitulates efficiency and kinetics of homolog pairing observed for wild-type and mutant meiosis in budding yeast, and can be adapted to nuclear dimensions and chromosome sets of other organisms.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>For stroke patients with unknown time of onset, mismatch between diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can guide thrombolytic intervention. However, access to MRI for hyperacute stroke is limited. Here, we sought to evaluate whether a portable, low-field (LF)-MRI scanner can identify DWI-FLAIR mismatch in acute ischemic stroke.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Eligible patients with a diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke underwent LF-MRI acquisition on a 0.064-T scanner within 24 h of last known well. Qualitative and quantitative metrics were evaluated. Two trained assessors determined the visibility of stroke lesions on LF-FLAIR. An image coregistration pipeline was developed, and the LF-FLAIR signal intensity ratio (SIR) was derived.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The study included 71 patients aged 71 ± 14 years and a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale of 6 (interquartile range 3–14). The interobserver agreement for identifying visible FLAIR hyperintensities was high (<i>κ</i> = 0.85, 95% CI 0.70–0.99). Visual DWI-FLAIR mismatch had a 60% sensitivity and 82% specificity for stroke patients &lt;4.5 h, with a negative predictive value of 93%. LF-FLAIR SIR had a mean value of 1.18 ± 0.18 &lt;4.5 h, 1.24 ± 0.39 4.5–6 h, and 1.40 ± 0.23 &gt;6 h of stroke onset. The optimal cut-point for LF-FLAIR SIR was 1.15, with 85% sensitivity and 70% specificity. A cut-point of 6.6 h was established for a FLAIR SIR &lt;1.15, with an 89% sensitivity and 62% specificity.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>A 0.064-T portable LF-MRI can identify DWI-FLAIR mismatch among patients with acute ischemic stroke. Future research is needed to prospectively validate thresholds and evaluate a role of LF-MRI in guiding thrombolysis among stroke patients with uncertain time of onset.

                Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) shows a wide range of clinical manifestations, including asymptomatic presentation to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and respiratory failure. Although COVID-19 disease progression was studied elsewhere, it is largely unknown in Bangladesh. Methods We conducted this cross-sectional study in November 2020 to January 2021 on patients diagnosed with COVID-19 confirmed by Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR). Pearson chi-square tests were used to assess the disease progressions across selected variables. A logistic regression model was used to assess the associated factors of COVID-19 infection for explanatory variables. All statistics were performed using the Stata software version 14.0 (Stata corporation, college station, Texas, USA). Results A total of 384 of respondents were involved in the survey. Of participants, most males (73%), unmarried (69%), aged 18 to 35 years during survey, and lived in urban community (73%). Overall, 41% of patients were in asymptotic condition, 44% were in mild condition, while 17% were moderate to severe conditions. Male patients and patients over 50 years had severe symptoms, accounting for 52% and 50%, respectively. Nearly half of business persons and office employees had severe symptoms. Almost all married patients (98%) had severe symptoms. The severity of symptoms was also higher for patients living in urban areas (79%), smoking (95%), and not physically active (52%). Patients with diabetes, asthma/COPD, and cancer were significantly associated with severe stage of COVID-19 (p≤0.05). Patient’s age, gender, smoking status, diabetics, working conditions significantly affect Covid-19 disease progression. Conclusion The study found that 7.03% of patients had severe, 9.11% had moderate and 40.36% had asymptomatic conditions. The heterogenic association between the disease progressions with age, sex, residence, marital status, smoking habits, diabetes, physical exercise, working conditions, sedentary lifestyles. Findings highlight the idea of using vulnerability ratings for each risk factor related to disease progression.

                Background Pseudomonads are gram negative bacteria and readily form biofilms in the environment, allowing long-term colonization and persistence in sinks, water systems. They pose a risk of life-threatening opportunistic infections in immune-compromised individuals. MDR strains, make treatment increasingly difficult. Environmentally persistent MDR strains are typically problematic within healthcare facilities, however, data on MDR pseudomonad reservoirs in settings with community-acquired infections to inform preventive interventions, in resource-constrained settings is scarce. Here, we determined reservoirs and antibiotic susceptibility of Pseudomonas species in water sources in Kisumu County, Kenya with reported high levels of community acquired pseudomonad infections. Methods We adopted a cross-sectional design, randomly collecting 297 samples from tap heads, sinks, tanks, vendor and household storage containers in six selected sub-locations and one hospital (KCRH). Standard microbiological procedures were used for identification and AST of the isolates. Results We isolated Pseudomonads from 14.1% of the samples collected, predominantly from the community 10.4%. Seven different pseudomonads were identified, with Pseudomonas aeruginosa predominating 6.7% overall, in the community samples 5.7%, and among isolates from water tanks 21.4%. Pseudomonad isolates were 62% non-susceptible to piperacillin, 57% to tigecycline, 24% meropenem, 21% cefepime, 19% levofloxacin and 14% colistin. Carbapenem resistance was mainly detected in P. aeruginosa 80% (8/10) from Milimani sub-location 75% (6/8). 45% of the isolates recovered were MDR, mainly community-associated carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa (CRPA) 42%, strains susceptible to colistin. The MDR pseudomonads exhibited high multiple antibiotic resistance indices, ranging from 0.43 to 1. Conclusion This study reveals a higher prevalence of MDR pseudomonads, including CRPA strains in community water sources. These potential conduits of drug resistance present a critical public health threat, especially among immunocompromised. Regular cleaning of water storage facilities, water treatment and implementation of antimicrobial stewardship programs, are required to prevent a rise in AMR and eliminate the environmental reservoirs that put the vulnerable populations at risk.

	<p>Background: Patients with supratentorial cavernous malformations (SCMs) commonly present with seizures. First-line treatments for cavernoma-related epilepsy (CRE) include conservative management (antiepileptic drugs (AEDs)) and surgery. We compared seizure outcomes of CRE patients after early (&amp;amp;le;6 months) vs. delayed (&amp;amp;gt;6 months) surgery. Methods: We compared outcomes of CRE patients with SCMs surgically treated at our large-volume cerebrovascular center (1 January 2010&amp;amp;ndash;31 July 2020). Patients with 1 sporadic SCM and &amp;amp;ge;1-year follow-up were included. Primary outcomes were International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) class 1 seizure freedom and AED independence. Results: Of 63 CRE patients (26 women, 37 men; mean &amp;amp;plusmn; SD age, 36.1 &amp;amp;plusmn; 14.6 years), 48 (76%) vs. 15 (24%) underwent early (mean &amp;amp;plusmn; SD, 2.1 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1.7 months) vs. delayed (mean &amp;amp;plusmn; SD, 6.2 &amp;amp;plusmn; 7.1 years) surgery. Most (32 (67%)) with early surgery presented after 1 seizure; all with delayed surgery had &amp;amp;ge;2 seizures. Seven (47%) with delayed surgery had drug-resistant epilepsy. At follow-up (mean &amp;amp;plusmn; SD, 5.4 &amp;amp;plusmn; 3.3 years), CRE patients with early surgery were more likely to have ILAE class 1 seizure freedom and AED independence than those with delayed surgery (92% (44/48) vs. 53% (8/15), p = 0.002; and 65% (31/48) vs. 33% (5/15), p = 0.03, respectively). Conclusions: Early CRE surgery demonstrated better seizure outcomes than delayed surgery. Multicenter prospective studies are needed to validate these findings.</p>

	<p>Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) enables the assessment of changes in brain tissue microstructure during maturation and ageing. In general, patterns of cerebral maturation and decline render non-monotonic lifespan trajectories of DTI metrics with age, and, importantly, the rate of microstructural changes is heterochronous for various white matter fibres. Recent studies have demonstrated that diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) metrics are more sensitive to microstructural changes during ageing compared to those of DTI. In a previous work, we demonstrated that the Cohen&amp;amp;rsquo;s d of mean diffusional kurtosis (dMK) represents a useful biomarker for quantifying maturation heterochronicity. However, some inferences on the maturation grades of different fibre types, such as association, projection, and commissural, were of a preliminary nature due to the insufficient number of fibres considered. Hence, the purpose of this follow-up work was to further explore the heterochronicity of microstructural maturation between pre-adolescence and middle adulthood based on DTI and DKI metrics. Using the effect size of the between-group parametric changes and Cohen&amp;amp;rsquo;s d, we observed that all commissural fibres achieved the highest level of maturity, followed by the majority of projection fibres, while the majority of association fibres were the least matured. We also demonstrated that dMK strongly correlates with the maxima or minima of the lifespan curves of DTI metrics. Furthermore, our results provide substantial evidence for the existence of spatial gradients in the timing of white matter maturation. In conclusion, our data suggest that DKI provides useful biomarkers for the investigation of maturation spatial heterogeneity and heterochronicity.</p>

	<p>The duration of slow-wave sleep (SWS) is related to the reported sleep quality and to the important variables of mental and physical health. The internal cues to end an episode of SWS are poorly understood. One such internal cue is the initiation of a body movement, which is detectable as electromyographic (EMG) activity in sleep-electroencephalography (EEG). In the present study, we characterized the termination of SWS episodes by movement to explore its potential as a biomarker. To this end, we characterized the relation between the occurrence of SWS termination by movement and individual characteristics (age, sex), SWS duration and spectral content, chronotype, depression, medication, overnight memory performance, and, as a potential neurological application, epilepsy. We analyzed 94 full-night EEG-EMG recordings (75/94 had confirmed epilepsy) in the video-EEG monitoring unit of the EpiCARE Centre Salzburg, Austria. Segments of SWS were counted and rated for their termination by movement or not through the visual inspection of continuous EEG and EMG recordings. Multiple linear regression was used to predict the number of SWS episodes that ended with movement by depression, chronotype, type of epilepsy (focal, generalized, no epilepsy, unclear), medication, gender, total duration of SWS, occurrence of seizures during the night, occurrence of tonic-clonic seizures during the night, and SWS frequency spectra. Furthermore, we assessed whether SWS movement termination was related to overnight memory retention. According to multiple linear regression, patients with overall longer SWS experienced more SWS episodes that ended with movement (t = 5.64; p = 0.001). No other variable was related to the proportion of SWS that ended with movement, including no epilepsy-related variable. A small sample (n = 4) of patients taking Sertraline experienced no SWS that ended with movement, which was significant compared to all other patients (t = 8.00; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) and to n = 35 patients who did not take any medication (t = 4.22; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). While this result was based on a small subsample and must be interpreted with caution, it warrants replication in a larger sample with and without seizures to further elucidate the role of the movement termination of SWS and its potential to serve as a biomarker for sleep continuity and for medication effects on sleep.</p>

	<p>Once thought of as an immune-privileged site, we now know that the nervous system communicates in a bidirectional manner with the immune system via the neuroimmune axis. Neuropeptides constitute a component of this axis, playing critical roles in the brain and periphery. The function of salivary neuropeptides in the acute stress response is not well understood. The purpose of this study is to investigate salivary neuropeptide levels during acute stress. Salivary samples were collected from fire recruits engaged in a stress training exercise previously shown to induce acute stress, at three separate timepoints during the exercise and levels of oxytocin, neurotensin, Substance P, &amp;amp;alpha;-MSH, and &amp;amp;beta;-Endorphin were measured using the Human Neuropeptide 5-Plex Custom Assay Eve Technologies. All neuropeptides increased throughout the acute stress simulation and during the recovery phase. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) identified one factor contributing to baseline values across five neuropeptides and Pairwise Pearson Correlation Coefficient analysis showed positive correlations &amp;amp;gt;0.9 for almost all neuropeptide combinations at the pre-stress timepoint. Further analysis identified negative and positive correlations between past-life trauma and self-assessed hardiness, respectively. Calculated neuropeptide scores showed an overall positive correlation to self-assessed hardiness. Altogether, our results suggest that salivary neuropeptides increase synchronously during acute stress and higher levels correlate with an increase in self-assessed hardiness. Further study is required to determine if interventions designed to enhance neuropeptide activity can increase stress resilience, especially in high-stress occupations such as firefighting.</p>

	<p>Executive functions (EFs) are related abilities, associated with the frontal lobes functions, that allow individuals to modify behavioral patterns when they become unsatisfactory. The aim of this study was to assess EFs in children with sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) and in children with &amp;amp;ldquo;specific language impairment&amp;amp;rdquo; (SLI), compared with a control group of children with normal development, to identify specific skill deficits. Three groups of preschool children aged between 2 and 6 years were assessed: 19 children with normal hearing, cognitive, and language development, 10 children with SNHL, and 20 children with SLI. The FE-PS 2-6 Battery was used for the assessment of preschool EFs, supplemented with the Modified Bell Test for the analysis of selective attention. Statistically significant differences were found between the two experimental groups and the control one, regarding the investigated skills. Children with SNHL showed a clear deficit in flexibility, whereas children with SLI had greater problems in self-regulation and management of waiting for gratification. Selective attention was found to be deficient in all three groups, with no statistically significant differences. This study shows that the skills investigated were found to be deficient in both SNHL and SLI patients. It is essential to start targeted exercises based on specific deficient skills as part of the rehabilitation program. It is of great importance to understand the consequences of EF deficit in preschool children to achieve an accurate diagnosis and carry out customized rehabilitation programs.</p>

	<p>Background: In recent years, new technologies have been applied in cerebral palsy. Among these, immersive virtual reality is one with promising motor and cognitive effects along with the reduced costs of its application. The level of immersion of the subject in the illusional world gives the feeling of being a real part of the virtual environment. This study aims to investigate the safety and the efficacy of immersive virtual reality in children affected by cerebral palsy. Methods: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, RehabData, and Web of Science were screened up to February 2023 to identify eligible clinical studies. Results: Out of 788, we included 15 studies involving CP patients. There was high heterogeneity in the outcomes considered, and the results showed non-inferiority to conventional therapy and initial additional benefits in comparison with conventional rehabilitation. Conclusions: Immersive virtual reality emerges as a pivotal technological tool in rehabilitation, seamlessly integrating with conventional therapy within CP rehabilitation programs. Indeed, it not only enhances motivation but significantly increases children&amp;amp;rsquo;s functional capacity and abilities.</p>

<p>Our results suggest that the lateral spiriform nucleus of the pretectum in birds modulates brainstem-projecting tectobulbar neurons in a manner comparable to the influence of globus pallidus internus on motor thalamus in mammals and receives its striatal input from a newly recognized third striatal region called the intrapeduncular nucleus.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>We used diverse methods to characterize the role of avian lateral spiriform nucleus (SpL) in basal ganglia motor function. Connectivity analysis showed that SpL receives input from globus pallidus (GP), and the intrapeduncular nucleus (INP) located ventromedial to GP, whose neurons express numerous striatal markers. SpL-projecting GP neurons were large and aspiny, while SpL-projecting INP neurons were medium sized and spiny. Connectivity analysis further showed that SpL receives inputs from subthalamic nucleus (STN) and substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr), and that the SNr also receives inputs from GP, INP, and STN. Neurochemical analysis showed that SpL neurons express ENK, GAD, and a variety of pallidal neuron markers, and receive GABAergic terminals, some of which also contain DARPP32, consistent with GP pallidal and INP striatal inputs. Connectivity and neurochemical analysis showed that the SpL input to tectum prominently ends on GABAA receptor-enriched tectobulbar neurons. Behavioral studies showed that lesions of SpL impair visuomotor behaviors involving tracking and pecking moving targets. Our results suggest that SpL modulates brainstem-projecting tectobulbar neurons in a manner comparable to the demonstrated influence of GP internus on motor thalamus and of SNr on tectobulbar neurons in mammals. Given published data in amphibians and reptiles, it seems likely the SpL circuit represents a major direct pathway-type circuit by which the basal ganglia exerts its motor influence in nonmammalian tetrapods. The present studies also show that avian striatum is divided into three spatially segregated territories with differing connectivity, a medial striato-nigral territory, a dorsolateral striato-GP territory, and the ventrolateral INP motor territory.</p>

	<p>Background: Clinical case illustrations of patients with an impairment of personality functioning (IPF) have repeatedly reported that progress during psychotherapy is reflected by alterations in dream content. However, quantitative studies based on samples of psychotherapy patients are scarce. As a core component of both personality functioning and contemporary psychodynamic dream theory, the construct of affect regulation is of specific significance in this context. Aims: To test if improvement in personality functioning in the course of psychotherapy is associated with an increasing ability to regulate affects in dreams. Method: In a longitudinal design, affect regulation was compared in N = 94 unsolicited dream reports from the first vs. last third of long term psychotherapy of ten patients with initial IPF. Dream reports were transcribed from recordings of the sessions. Expert ratings of the level of personality functioning were obtained using the Scales of Psychological Capacities. The capacity for affect regulation was assessed using the Zurich Dream Process Coding System. Group differences were assessed using linear mixed models, controlling for dream length as well as the nested structure of this data set. Results: Patients demonstrated an increased capacity for affect regulation in dreams that was primarily evident in three core features: the complexity of dream elements (cf., e.g., parameter attributes, p = 0.024); the extent of affective involvement in the dream ego (cf., e.g., parameter subject feeling, p = 0.014); and the flexibility to regulate the dynamics of safety/involvement processes (p &amp;amp;le; 0.001). This pattern was especially prominent in a subgroup (n = 7) of patients with more pronounced improvements in personality functioning. Conclusion: These findings support the hypotheses that decreasing IPF during psychotherapy is associated with increases in the capacity for affect regulation in dreams. Thus, researchers and therapists can utilize dream reports to illuminate the important aspects of treatment progress in clinical practice.</p>

	<p>(1) Background: The discovery of novel diagnostic methods and therapies for Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD) faces significant challenges. Previous research has shed light on the neuroprotective properties of Apelin-13 in neurodegenerative disorders. However, elucidating the mechanism underlying its efficacy in combating AD-related nerve injury is imperative. In this study, we aimed to investigate Apelin-13&amp;amp;rsquo;s mechanism of action in an in vivo model of AD induced by streptozocin (STZ). (2) Methods: We utilized an STZ-induced nerve injury model of AD in mice to investigate the effects of Apelin-13 administration. Apelin-13 was administered intranasally, and cognitive impairment was assessed using standardized behavioral tests, primarily, behavioral assessment, histological analysis, and biochemical assays, in order to evaluate synaptic plasticity and oxidative stress signaling pathways. (3) Results: Our findings indicate that intranasal administration of Apelin-13 ameliorated cognitive impairment in the STZ-induced AD model. Furthermore, we observed that this effect was potentially mediated by the enhancement of synaptic plasticity and the attenuation of oxidative stress signaling pathways. (4) Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that intranasal administration of Apelin-13 holds promise as a therapeutic strategy for preventing neurodegenerative diseases such as AD. By improving synaptic plasticity and mitigating oxidative stress, Apelin-13 may offer a novel approach to neuroprotection in AD and related conditions.</p>

	<p>Exploring the spatiotemporal dynamic patterns of multi-channel electroencephalography (EEG) is crucial for interpreting dementia and related cognitive decline. Spatiotemporal patterns of EEG can be described through microstate analysis, which provides a discrete approximation of the continuous electric field patterns generated by the brain cortex. Here, we propose a novel microstate spatiotemporal dynamic indicator, termed the microstate sequence non-randomness index (MSNRI). The essence of the method lies in initially generating a sequence of microstate transition patterns through state space compression of EEG data using microstate analysis. Following this, we assess the non-randomness of these microstate patterns using information-based similarity analysis. The results suggest that this MSNRI metric is a potential marker for distinguishing between health control (HC) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) (HC vs. FTD: 6.958 vs. 5.756, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01), as well as between HC and populations with Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD) (HC vs. AD: 6.958 vs. 5.462, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Healthy individuals exhibit more complex macroscopic structures and non-random spatiotemporal patterns of microstates, whereas dementia disorders lead to more random spatiotemporal patterns. Additionally, we extend the proposed method by integrating the Complementary Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (CEEMD) method to explore spatiotemporal dynamic patterns of microstates at specific frequency scales. Moreover, we assessed the effectiveness of this innovative method in predicting cognitive scores. The results demonstrate that the incorporation of CEEMD-enhanced microstate dynamic indicators significantly improved the prediction accuracy of Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores (R2 = 0.940). The CEEMD-enhanced MSNRI method not only aids in the exploration of large-scale neural changes in populations with dementia but also offers a robust tool for characterizing the dynamics of EEG microstate transitions and their impact on cognitive function.</p>

	<p>Background: The COVID-19 pandemic increased symptoms of stress and anxiety and induced changes in sleep quality, dream activity, and parasomnia episodes. It has been shown that stressful factors and/or bad sleep habits can affect parasomnia behaviors. However, investigations on how COVID-19 has affected sleep, dreams, and episode frequency in parasomnias are rare. The current study focuses on the impact of the pandemic on a specific parasomnia characterized by speech production (sleep talking, ST). Methods: We selected 27 participants with frequent ST episodes (STs) during the pandemic and compared them with 27 participants with frequent STs from a previous study conducted during a pre-pandemic period. All participants performed home monitoring through sleep logs and recorded their nocturnal STs for one week. Results: We observed a higher frequency of STs in the pandemic group. Moreover, STs were related to the emotional intensity of dreams, independent of the pandemic condition. The pandemic was associated with lower bizarreness of dreams in the pandemic group. There were no differences in sleep variables between the two groups. Conclusion: Overall, these results suggest a stressful effect of COVID-19 on the frequency of STs. Both the pandemic and the frequency of STs affect qualitative characteristics of dreams in this population.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/11/5/ENEURO.0509-23.2024?rss=1">Increased Retinal Metabolism Induced by Flicker in the Isolated Mouse Retina</a></h4>

              
                <p>Both the retina and brain exhibit neurovascular coupling, increased blood flow during increased neural activity. In the retina increased blood flow can be evoked by flickering light, but the magnitude of the metabolic change that underlies this is not known. Local changes in oxygen consumption (QO<SUB>2</SUB>) are difficult to measure in vivo when both supply and demand are changing. Here we isolated the C57BL/6J mouse retina and supplied it with oxygen from both sides of the tissue. Microelectrode recordings of PO<SUB>2</SUB> were made in darkness and during 20&nbsp;s of high scotopic flickering light at 1&nbsp;Hz. Flicker led to a PO<SUB>2</SUB> increase in the outer retina and a decrease in the inner retina, indicating that outer retinal QO<SUB>2</SUB> (QOR) decreased and inner retinal QO<SUB>2</SUB> (QIR) increased. A four-layer oxygen diffusion model was fitted to PO<SUB>2</SUB> values obtained in darkness and at the end of flicker to determine the values of QOR and QIR. QOR in flicker was 76 &plusmn; 14% (mean and SD, <I>n</I> = 10) of QOR in darkness. The increase in QIR was smaller, 6.4 &plusmn; 5.0%. These metabolic changes are likely smaller than the maximum changes, because with no regeneration of pigment in the isolated retina, we limited the illumination. Further modeling indicated that at high illumination, QIR could increase by up to 45%, which is comparable to the magnitude of flow changes. This suggests that the blood flow increase is at least roughly matched to the increased metabolic demands of activity in the retina.</p>

                Background The aim of this study was to observe and analyze vascular function in ‘prolonged sitting’, followed by a yoga asana routine and pranayama intervention. Participants in this study include those who work from desks in offices. The study required the participants to attend on three separate days at random, and they had to finish a computerized test on each day. On the first day, participants were required to complete a computer test while sitting still for four hours (with the exception of washroom breaks). The next day, they underwent a computerized test along with a pranayama intervention. Finally, on the last day, they underwent a computerized test along with a yoga asana intervention. At the start of the study and after two and four hours, we measured the diameter and velocity of the common carotid artery (CCA) and superficial femoral artery (SFA). Methods The study was a within-subjects prospective single-center trial conducted in the Department of Radio-Diagnosis and Imaging, Kasturba Medical Hospital, Manipal, India, between September 2022 and January 2023. Participants were asked to do one of the following ‘activities’ over successive weeks: Week 1 – Prolonged sitting; Week 2 – Pranayama intervention; and Week 3 – Yoga asana intervention during prolonged sitting. The baseline and follow-up variables of pulse velocity, endothelial thickness, and shear rate were assessed for normality through a Shapiro-Wilk Test. Results Our sample included 11 participants with moderate physical activity, five with high physical activity and one with low physical activity. Yoga asana intervention comprised participants sitting continuously for four hours, with a yoga asana intervention being provided every hour, lasting for 10 minutes. Conclusions Yoga asana improves vascular functions in prolonged sitting conditions. This routine can promote the concept of interrupted sitting and ways to reduce it with efficient yoga asana practice without changing the work culture and provide better physical relief.

                Dysfunctional uterine bleeding (DUB), a serious clinical challenge caused by incomplete abortion in female, calls for efficient and minimally invasive therapies to treat symptoms and protect reproductive health. Uterine artery embolization (UAE) has been discovered as a viable therapeutic strategy to treat DUB following an incomplete abortion. The existing information and clinical experience of UAE for this particular indication were thoroughly reviewed. A female’s quality of life may be negatively affected by incomplete abortion, which is defined as residual fetal tissue inside the uterine cavity. This frequently results in heavy and continuous uterine bleeding. Medical procedures and traditional management techniques such as dilatation and curettage (D&C) do not always produce the desired effects or might have inherent dangers. UAE, a less invasive technique first developed for treating uterine fibroids, has shown promise as a substitute solution for DUB caused by an incomplete abortion.

                <p>by Meng Wang, Xinyue Yan, Yanan Dong, Xiaoqin Li, Bin Gao</p>

The heterogeneity of Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) poses a barrier to effective treatment. Stratifying highly heterogeneous HCC into molecular subtypes with similar features is crucial for personalized anti-tumor therapies. Although driver genes play pivotal roles in cancer progression, their potential in HCC subtyping has been largely overlooked. This study aims to utilize driver genes to construct HCC subtype models and unravel their molecular mechanisms. Utilizing a novel computational framework, we expanded the initially identified 96 driver genes to 1192 based on mutational aspects and an additional 233 considering driver dysregulation. These genes were subsequently employed as stratification markers for further analyses. A novel multi-omics subtype classification algorithm was developed, leveraging mutation and expression data of the identified stratification genes. This algorithm successfully categorized HCC into two distinct subtypes, CLASS A and CLASS B, demonstrating significant differences in survival outcomes. Integrating multi-omics and single-cell data unveiled substantial distinctions between these subtypes regarding transcriptomics, mutations, copy number variations, and epigenomics. Moreover, our prognostic model exhibited excellent predictive performance in training and external validation cohorts. Finally, a 10-gene classification model for these subtypes identified <i>TTK</i> as a promising therapeutic target with robust classification capabilities. This comprehensive study provides a novel perspective on HCC stratification, offering crucial insights for a deeper understanding of its pathogenesis and the development of promising treatment strategies.

                Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a prominent cause of illness and mortality worldwide, with a significant amount of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgeries performed each year. It is a complicated technique that results in several clinical and functional issues. While CABG is an effective treatment, it comes with clinical and functional challenges, including reduced lung volume, maximal inspiratory and expiratory pressure, and thoracic mobility after surgery. Incisional pain has been associated with a decline in postoperative lung function; however, this resolves a month following surgery. There is no documented association between respiratory muscle strength and lung function after heart surgery. The POWERbreathe Medic Plus is intended for patients who have extremely weak breathing muscles as a result of illness, hospitalization, or existing respiratory health disorders such as Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and asthma. To address these challenges, a study will investigate the efficacy of the POWERbreathe Medic Plus device in improving maximal inspiratory pressure, functional capacity, and quality of life in CABG patients.

                Research data and software are widely accepted as an outcome of scientific work. However, in comparison to text-based publications, there is not yet an established process to assess and evaluate quality of research data and research software publications. This paper presents an attempt to fill this gap. Initiated by the Working Group Open Science of the Helmholtz Association, the Task Group Helmholtz Quality Indicators for Data and Software Publications currently develops a quality indicator for research data and research software publications to be used within the Association. This report summarizes the vision of the group of what all contributes to such an indicator. The proposed approach relies on generic well-established concepts for quality criteria, such as the FAIR Principles and the COBIT Maturity Model. It does – on purpose – not limit itself to technical implementation possibilities to avoid using an existing metric for a new purpose. The intention of this paper is to share the current state for further discussion with all stakeholders, particularly with other groups also working on similar metrics but also with entities that use the metrics.

	<p>Background: Parents report associations between children&amp;amp;rsquo;s sleep disturbances and behaviors. Children with neurodevelopmental conditions (e.g., Williams Syndrome and autism) are consistently reported to experience increased sleeping problems. Sleep in children with vision impairment and children with a dual diagnosis of vision impairment and autism remains understudied. Methods: Our exploratory study compared sleep profiles in 52 children (aged 4&amp;amp;ndash;12 years) and their parents (n = 37), across four groups: children with vision impairment (VI; n = 9), autism (n = 10), comorbid vision impairment + autism (n = 6), and typically developing children (n = 27). Childhood sleep was measured using the parental report Childhood Sleep Habits Questionnaire and sleep diaries. Children&amp;amp;rsquo;s cognitive functioning was measured using digit span, semantic, and phonemic verbal fluency measures. Parental sleep was measured via the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and Epworth Sleepiness Scale. Results: Clinically disordered sleep was reported in all child groups (p &amp;amp;le; 0.001), particularly children with VI + autism. Age, not sleep quality/quantity, predicted cognitive task performance in TD and autistic groups, but not in VI and VI + autism groups. The child&amp;amp;rsquo;s diagnosis affected parental sleep, particularly in children with a dual diagnosis of VI + autism. Conclusions: All participants experienced problematic sleep to varying degrees. Those most affected were children and parents in the VI + autism group, suggesting that autism may be the main driver of sleep problems in our sample.</p>

	<p>Recently, we and others have shown that manipulating the activity of cholinergic interneurons (CIN) present in the NAc can modulate binge alcohol consumption. The present study is designed to examine the relationship between binge alcohol consumption and the activity of the CIN in real time by using an in vivo microendoscopic technique. We hypothesized that mice exposed to Drinking in the Dark (DID)&amp;amp;mdash;a recognized mouse model for binge drinking&amp;amp;mdash;would exhibit increased activity in the accumbal shell region (NAcSh). To test this hypothesis, male mice expressing Cre-recombinase in the cholinergic neurons were exposed to binge alcohol consumption (alcohol group), employing the DID method, and utilized in vivo calcium imaging to observe CIN activity in real time during alcohol consumption. The control (sucrose) group was exposed to 10% (w/v) sucrose. As compared to sucrose, mice in the alcohol group displayed a significant increase in the frequency and amplitude of discharge activity, which was measured using calcium transients in the CIN present in the NAcSh. In summary, our findings suggest that the activity of CIN in the NAcSh plays a crucial role in alcohol self-administration. These results emphasize the potential significance of targeting CIN activity as a therapeutic approach for addressing AUD.</p>

	<p>Background: Despite the availability of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy for treating obsessive&amp;amp;ndash;compulsive disorder (OCD), alternative approaches need to be explored due to the high likelihood of treatment resistance. Neuronavigated 20 Hz theta burst stimulation (TBS-20 Hz), targeting the bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) augmented with the right orbitofrontal cortex (ROFC), was tested for treating OCD comorbid with depression and anxiety disorders. Methods: A retrospective chart review was performed on fourteen patients treated for moderate-to-severe OCD in a private outpatient clinic. Twelve patients had comorbid major depressive disorder (MDD), and thirteen patients had either generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) or panic disorder (PD). Patients completed the Y-BOCS-SR, BDI-II, and BAI rating scales weekly, which were used to measure the changes in OCD, depression, and anxiety symptoms, respectively. Results: Neuronavigated TBS-20 Hz was sequentially applied to the right DLPFC (RDLPFC), left DLPFC (LDLPFC), and ROFC. A total of 64% (9/14) of patients achieved remission from OCD (Y-BOCS-SR &amp;amp;le; 14) in an average of 6.1 weeks of treatment (SD = 4.0). A total of 58% (7/12) of patients remitted from MDD (BDI &amp;amp;lt; 13) in an average of 4.1 weeks (SD = 2.8), and 62% (8/13) of patients remitted from GAD/PD (BAI &amp;amp;lt; 8) in an average of 4.3 weeks (SD = 2.5). Conclusions: The neuronavigated TBS-20 Hz sequential stimulation of RDLPFC and LDLPFC, followed by ROFC, significantly reduced OCD, MDD, and GAD/PD symptoms. Randomized sham controls are warranted to validate these results.</p>

	<p>Objective: The aim of this study is to investigate the association between Cathepsin B and Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s Disease (PD), with a particular focus on determining the role of N-acetylaspartate as a potential mediator. Methods: We used summary-level data from Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) for a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis, exploring the association between Cathepsin B (3301 cases) and PD (4681 cases). A sequential two-step MR approach was applied (8148 cases) to study the role of N-acetylaspartate. Results: The MR analysis yielded that genetically predicted elevated Cathepsin B levels correlated with a reduced risk of developing PD (p = 0.0133, OR: 0.9171, 95% CI: 0.8563&amp;amp;ndash;0.9821). On the other hand, the analysis provided insufficient evidence to determine that PD affected Cathepsin B levels (p = 0.8567, OR: 1.0035, 95% CI: 0.9666&amp;amp;ndash;1.0418). The estimated effect of N-acetylaspartate in this process was 7.52% (95% CI = &amp;amp;minus;3.65% to 18.69%). Conclusions: This study suggested that elevated Cathepsin B levels decreased the risk of developing PD, with the mediation effect of N-acetylaspartate. Further research is needed to better understand this relationship.</p>

	<p>Hyperserotonemia is one of the most studied endophenotypes in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), but there are still no unequivocal results about its causes or biological and behavioral outcomes. This systematic review summarizes the studies investigating the relationship between blood serotonin (5-HT) levels and ASD, comparing diagnostic tools, analytical methods, and clinical outcomes. A literature search on peripheral 5-HT levels and ASD was conducted. In total, 1104 publications were screened, of which 113 entered the present systematic review. Of these, 59 articles reported hyperserotonemia in subjects with ASD, and 26 presented correlations between 5-HT levels and ASD-core clinical outcomes. The 5-HT levels are increased in about half, and correlations between hyperserotonemia and clinical outcomes are detected in a quarter of the studies. The present research highlights a large amount of heterogeneity in this field, ranging from the characterization of ASD and control groups to diagnostic and clinical assessments, from blood sampling procedures to analytical methods, allowing us to delineate critical topics for future studies.</p>

                <p>The primary motor cortex (M1) integrates sensory and cognitive inputs to generate voluntary movement. Its functional impairments have been implicated in the pathophysiology of motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD). Specifically, dopaminergic degeneration and basal ganglia dysfunction entrain M1 neurons into the abnormally synchronized bursting pattern of activity throughout the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamocortical network. However, how degeneration of the midbrain dopaminergic neurons affects the anatomy, microcircuit connectivity, and function of the M1 network remains poorly understood. The present study examined whether and how the loss of dopamine (DA) affects the morphology, cellular excitability, and synaptic physiology of Layer 5 parvalbumin-expressing (PV<sup>+</sup>) cells in the M1 of mice of both sexes. Here, we reported that loss of midbrain dopaminergic neurons does not alter the number, morphology, and physiology of Layer 5 PV<sup>+</sup> cells in M1. Moreover, we demonstrated that the number of perisomatic PV<sup>+</sup> puncta of M1 pyramidal neurons as well as their functional innervation of cortical pyramidal neurons were not altered following the loss of DA. Together, the present study documents an intact GABAergic inhibitory network formed by PV<sup>+</sup> cells following the loss of midbrain dopaminergic neurons.</p>

                <p>More and more patients worldwide are diagnosed with dementia, which emphasizes the urgent need for early detection markers. In this study, we built on the auditory hypersensitivity theory of a previous study&mdash;which postulated that responses to auditory input in the subcortex as well as cortex are enhanced in cognitive decline&mdash;and examined auditory encoding of natural continuous speech at both neural levels for its indicative potential for cognitive decline. We recruited study participants aged 60 years and older, who were divided into two groups based on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, one group with low scores (<I>n</I> = 19, participants with signs of cognitive decline) and a control group (<I>n</I> = 25). Participants completed an audiometric assessment and then we recorded their electroencephalography while they listened to an audiobook and click sounds. We derived temporal response functions and evoked potentials from the data and examined response amplitudes for their potential to predict cognitive decline, controlling for hearing ability and age. Contrary to our expectations, no evidence of auditory hypersensitivity was observed in participants with signs of cognitive decline; response amplitudes were comparable in both cognitive groups. Moreover, the combination of response amplitudes showed no predictive value for cognitive decline. These results challenge the proposed hypothesis and emphasize the need for further research to identify reliable auditory markers for the early detection of cognitive decline.</p>

                Background Chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) is the most advanced stage of peripheral artery disease (PAD) and has poor clinical outcomes. Recently, stimulating arteriogenesis has been proposed to improve clinical outcomes. Several studies have shown that miRNAs have beneficial effects on limb ischemia related to arteriogenesis. This study aimed to review the roles of therapeutic miRNAs in the arteriogenesis of limb ischemia. Methods A systematic search was conducted through July 2021 using the PubMed, Scopus, and ScienceDirect databases. Two authors independently assessed studies that investigated the role of miRNAs in the arteriogenesis of limb ischemia, both in vivo and in clinical studies. Results All selected studies were in vivo studies, with a total of 36 articles and 28 types of miRNAs. miRNAs potentially regulate arteriogenesis by targeting different targets. The following miRNAs were upregulated to enhance arteriogenesis: miRNA-126-3p, -93, -675, -143-3p, -130a, -210, -146b, -21, -let-7g, -132/212, -150, and 155. Meanwhile, microRNAs needed to be downregulated, namely: miRNA-939-5p, -503, -199a-5p, -146a, -92a, -14q32 microRNA gene cluster, -15a/16, -100, -133a, -139-5p, -223, -352, -615-5p, -15b/5p, -124-3p, and 29a. MiRNA-126 was the most studied miRNA, and SPRED1 was the most common target of microRNA. However, the included studies showed high heterogeneity in terms of inducing hindlimb ischemia, the timing of administration, and the method used for evaluating arteriogenesis. Moreover, most studies presented unclear or high-risk bias. Conclusion MicroRNA application in a preclinical model of hindlimb ischemia has beneficial effects on arteriogenesis. This result indicates that miRNAs might be potentially beneficial in patients with CLTI. Registration The review protocol was registered with PROSPERO under registration number CRD42024484988.

                Introduction This study protocol outlines a comprehensive investigation into the impact of phototherapy on electrolyte levels in newborns with hyperbilirubinemia. With a focus on neonates admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) at Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College and AVBR Hospital, Sawangi, Wardha, Central India, the research aims to contribute valuable insights into the physiological changes associated with this common neonatal condition. The study’s introduction highlights the rationale, significance, and gaps in current knowledge, emphasising the need for a detailed exploration of electrolyte dynamics before and after phototherapy. Method The methodology involves a descriptive, interventional cross-sectional design with a calculated sample size of 264 neonates. Standardised protocols for data collection, including serum electrolyte analysis and urine-specific gravity assessment, will be employed. Inclusion and exclusion criteria are clearly defined to ensure a homogenous study population. Statistical analyses, utilising R Studio 4.3.1 will encompass descriptive statistics, comparative analysis, correlation analysis, and multivariate analysis to explore the nuanced relationships between variables. Rigorous ethical considerations and transparency in reporting will guide the data collection process. Expected Result Anticipated outcomes include a nuanced understanding of changes in serum electrolyte levels following phototherapy and the correlation of these changes with the treatment duration. The study is poised to shed light on the impact of gestational age and birth weight on electrolyte responses. Through rigorous statistical analysis, the research aims to provide evidence-based insights that can inform neonatal care protocols. The anticipated findings hold the potential to influence clinical practices, enhancing the quality of care provided to newborns with hyperbilirubinemia undergoing phototherapy.

                The routine genomic surveillance of pathogens in diverse geographical settings and equitable data sharing are critical to inform effective infection control and therapeutic development. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic highlighted the importance of routine genomic surveillance of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to detect emerging variants of concern. However, the majority of high-income countries sequenced >0.5% of their COVID-19 cases, unlike low- and middle-income countries. By the end of 2022, many countries around the world had managed to establish capacity for pathogen genomic surveillance. Notably, Beta and Omicron; 2 of the 5 current SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern were first discovered in Africa through an aggressive sequencing campaign led by African scientists. To sustain such infrastructure and expertise beyond this pandemic, other endemic pathogens should leverage this investment. Therefore, countries are establishing multi-pathogen genomic surveillance strategies. Here we provide a catalog of the current landscape of sequenced and publicly shared pathogens in different countries in Africa. Drawing upon our collective knowledge and expertise, we review the ever-evolving challenges and propose innovative recommendations.

                Background With the rapid aging of the population, increasing life satisfaction among older adults is essential. Negative perceptions of older adults are internalized, leading to poor mental health. This study hypothesized that participants with more negative perceptions of older adults would have lower life satisfaction. Methods A cross-sectional survey of older adults was conducted across five wards and four cities in Tokyo, Japan. Participants responded to questions regarding demographics, life satisfaction, and negative perceptions of older adults. Data from 285 participants (264 women, M = 71.97 years) were analyzed. Results The intraclass correlation coefficient for life satisfaction concerning residential areas was. 03 (95% confidence interval [CI] = [-.03, .10]). Instead of multilevel models, a multiple regression model with life satisfaction as the dependent variable and negative perceptions of older adults and demographics as the independent variables yielded the best fit. Results indicated that participants with more negative perceptions of older adults reported lower life satisfaction (β = -.16, 95% CI = [-.28, -.04], p = .008), supporting our hypothesis. Conclusions This study was constrained by limited variance in residential areas and a predominantly female participant pool. Previous studies have shown that higher life satisfaction is associated with increased social participation and extended life expectancy, and interventions aimed at enhancing life satisfaction in older adults are significant. Further exploration is warranted to ascertain whether a causal relationship exists, wherein more negative perceptions of older adults diminish life satisfaction.

                <p>by Hazal Koptagel, Seong-Hwan Jun, Joanna Hård, Jens Lagergren</p>

Cell lineage tree reconstruction methods are developed for various tasks, such as investigating the development, differentiation, and cancer progression. Single-cell sequencing technologies enable more thorough analysis with higher resolution. We present Scuphr, a distance-based cell lineage tree reconstruction method using bulk and single-cell DNA sequencing data from healthy tissues. Common challenges of single-cell DNA sequencing, such as allelic dropouts and amplification errors, are included in Scuphr. Scuphr computes the distance between cell pairs and reconstructs the lineage tree using the neighbor-joining algorithm. With its embarrassingly parallel design, Scuphr can do faster analysis than the state-of-the-art methods while obtaining better accuracy. The method’s robustness is investigated using various synthetic datasets and a biological dataset of 18 cells.

                <p>by Raphael Sonabend, Hugo Gruson, Leo Wolansky, Agnes Kiragga, Daniel S. Katz</p>

This paper extends the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) guidelines to provide criteria for assessing if software conforms to best practices in open source. By adding “USE” (User-Centered, Sustainable, Equitable), software development can adhere to open source best practice by incorporating user-input early on, ensuring front-end designs are accessible to all possible stakeholders, and planning long-term sustainability alongside software design. The FAIR-USE4OS guidelines will allow funders and researchers to more effectively evaluate and plan open-source software projects. There is good evidence of funders increasingly mandating that all funded research software is open source; however, even under the FAIR guidelines, this could simply mean software released on public repositories with a Zenodo DOI. By creating FAIR-USE software, best practice can be demonstrated from the very beginning of the design process and the software has the greatest chance of success by being impactful.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-1546/v3?src=rss">In vitro assessment and comparison of quality of alcohol-based hand rubs, pre- and peri-COVID-19 pandemic outbreak in Kenya [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background In the wake of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the World Health Organization recommended the use of alcohol-based hand rubs (ABHRs) to curb transmission, leading to increased production and use. This has posed a danger of production and use of poor-quality ABHRs. Methods This study assessed and compared the quality of ABHRs in the Kenyan market that were produced before and after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. Quality testing was carried out against European EN 1500:2013 and Kenyan EAS 789:2013 Standards and 20 samples analyzed for alcohol content by GC-FID. Results The study found that 27.8% of the peri-COVID-19 pandemic sanitizers had less than 90% bactericidal reduction activity as compared to 12.5% manufactured pre-COVID-19 pandemic. Only 25% peri-COVID-19 pandemic ABHRs met the EAS 789:2013 acceptable limit of over 60% alcohol content. Product adulteration with methanol was found in 20 % of the samples with only 5% complying with FDA approval limit of <0.063% v/v methanol. Study found no correlation between the total alcohol content and the efficacy of ABHRs. Conclusions The study found that more substandard products were produced during the pandemic. This raises a concern about possible emergence of alcohol resistant strains of microorganisms. The study therefore recommends an adequate quality monitoring system to curb against substandard products.

                Background Parthenium is an invasive annual weed that affects crop production, rangelands, grasslands, animals, the environment, and human health. Since its introduction into Ethiopia, different management options such as uprooting, slashing, burning, plowing, and applying synthetic herbicides have been practiced. However, these options are not sustainable in weed management. However, Zygogramma bicolorata is known to be used in different countries. Although many countries use it under field conditions, its population-based efficacy has not been well studied in Ethiopia. This study aimed to determine the effectiveness of Z. bicolorata populations on parthenium plants under greenhouse conditions. Methods This experiment was conducted at the Ambo Agricultural Research Center. Different numbers of Z. bicolorata per plant were used as treatments and were laid out in a completely randomized design with three replications. The numbers of damaged leaves, eggs, and larvae were recorded daily until the leaves were completely defoliated. The collected data and the correlation between beetle population and leaf defoliation were analyzed using SAS. Results The result revealed that all beetle populations caused damage to weed plants. A higher population of beetles completely defoliated the leaves within 12 days. However, lower numbers required 21 days to completely defoliate the weed. In contrast, a higher number of eggs (328.67) and larvae (272.33) were obtained from plants that received 20 pairs of beetles. The beetle population and exposure time were positively correlated, and the effectiveness of the bioagent was greater following the emergence of larvae. Conclusions Z. bicolorata can manage parthenium weeds, even with a lower population. However, more than 15 pairs of beetles could be suggested to manage weeds in a shorter time, and further study is needed under field conditions by considering the different agroecologies of the country.

                Background This study aims to develop a vulnerability map for Surabaya using GIS-based Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) to assess the city’s vulnerability to COVID-19. Methods Six key factors influencing vulnerability were identified and their relative importance determined through the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) pairwise comparison matrix. GIS was utilized to classify Surabaya’s vulnerability into five levels: very low, low, medium, high, and very high. Results The resulting vulnerability map provides essential insights for decision-makers, healthcare professionals, and disaster management teams. It enables strategic resource allocation, targeted interventions, and formulation of comprehensive response strategies tailored to specific needs of vulnerable districts. Conclusions Through these measures, Surabaya can enhance its resilience and preparedness, ensuring the well-being of its residents in the face of potential emergency outbreaks.

                Small intestinal adenocarcinomas, comprising less than 5% of digestive cancers, present diagnostic and therapeutic intricacies often overshadowed by more common digestive malignancies. This report highlights the unique metachronous characteristic of the case, emphasizing the presence of intussusception, to contribute valuable knowledge and refine medical approaches for optimizing outcomes in these rare and complex scenarios. A 73-year-old male, previously operated for right colon adenocarcinoma, developed metachronous liver metastasis a year later, successfully treated. Presenting with acute intestinal obstruction, imaging confirmed mechanical obstruction, prompting small intestine resection and stoma creation. The postoperative phase, characterized by meticulous care, ensures ongoing close oncological follow-up for this complex medical journey, with the added complication of intussusception. Amid the rarity of small intestinal adenocarcinomas in digestive cancers, our unique case sheds light on the challenges in diagnosis and treatment, particularly highlighting the presence of intussusception. The distinctive approach of small intestine resection and stoma creation underscores ongoing debates on adjuvant chemotherapy, reflecting an evolving management landscape. This underscores the crucial role of continuous research and multidisciplinary strategies in optimizing outcomes for patients facing this uncommon malignancy complicated by intussusception. This report provides valuable insights into the complexities of diagnosing and managing small intestinal adenocarcinomas, particularly when complicated by intussusception. As we navigate this nuanced medical terrain, continuous research and multidisciplinary approaches remain pivotal for refining our understanding and optimizing outcomes in small intestinal adenocarcinomas.

                Background Twenty-two Arab countries share a common language, history, and culture. Nevertheless, governmental policies, healthcare systems, and resources differ from one Arab country to another. We have been following Coronavirus (COVID-19) from the beginning in each Arab country. In the present study, we aimed to assess the prevalence of COVID-19 in the Arab world and to compare these findings with other significantly affected countries. Methods Websites of the World Health Organization, World COVID-vaccinations tracker, Worldometer, and Ministries of Health were used to extract COVID-19 data in all Arab countries between the period January 2020 to December 2022. Results All Arab countries had 14,218,042 total confirmed COVID-19 cases, 13,384,924 total recovered cases and 173,544 total related deaths. The trend demonstrated that the third quarter of 2021 recorded the highest death toll and the first quarter of 2022 recorded the highest number of confirmed and recovered cases. Compared to the top 15 affected countries, the Arab world ranked last as it had the lowest overall incidence per million population (PMP) of 31,609. The data on total deaths PMP showed that India had the lowest number of deaths with only 377 cases followed by the Arab world with 386 cases. Conclusions Although the number of confirmed, death, and subsequently recovered cases of COVID-19 have greatly reduced in the last quarter of 2022 in most Arab countries, many Arab countries still need to re-campaign about COVID-19 vaccines and raise awareness programs about boosters. COVID-19 has had a relatively smaller impact on Arab countries than on other countries that have been significantly affected.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Bradykinesia and rigidity are considered closely related motor signs in Parkinson disease (PD), but recent neurophysiological findings suggest distinct pathophysiological mechanisms. This study aims to examine and compare longitudinal changes in bradykinesia and rigidity in PD patients treated with bilateral subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In this retrospective cohort study, the clinical progression of appendicular and axial bradykinesia and rigidity was assessed up to 15 years after STN-DBS in the best treatment conditions (ON medication and ON stimulation). The severity of bradykinesia and rigidity was examined using ad hoc composite scores from specific subitems of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale motor part (UPDRS-III). Short- and long-term predictors of bradykinesia and rigidity were analyzed through linear regression analysis, considering various preoperative demographic and clinical data, including disease duration and severity, phenotype, motor and cognitive scores (eg, frontal score), and medication.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 301 patients were examined before and 1 year after surgery. Among them, 101 and 56 individuals were also evaluated at 10-year and 15-year follow-ups, respectively. Bradykinesia significantly worsened after surgery, especially in appendicular segments (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Conversely, rigidity showed sustained benefit, with unchanged clinical scores compared to preoperative assessment (<i>p</i> &gt; 0.05). Preoperative motor disability (eg, composite scores from the UPDRS-III) predicted short- and long-term outcomes for both bradykinesia and rigidity (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01). Executive dysfunction was specifically linked to bradykinesia but not to rigidity (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Bradykinesia and rigidity show long-term divergent progression in PD following STN-DBS and are associated with independent clinical factors, supporting the hypothesis of partially distinct pathophysiology. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26948?af=R">Electroencephalographic Correlates of Clinical Severity in the Natural history study of RTT and Related Disorders</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>This study was undertaken to characterize quantitative electroencephalographic (EEG) features in participants from the Natural history study of RTT and Related Disorders and to assess the potential for these features to act as objective measures of cortical function for Rett syndrome (RTT).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>EEG amplitude and power features were derived from the resting EEG of 60 females with RTT (median age = 10.7 years) and 26 neurotypical females (median age = 10.6 years). Analyses focus on group differences and within the RTT group, associations between the EEG parameters and clinical severity. For a subset of participants (n = 20), follow-up data were available for assessing the reproducibility of the results and the stability in the parameters over 1 year.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Compared to neurotypical participants, participants with RTT had greater amplitude variability and greater low-frequency activity as reflected by greater delta power, more negative 1/f slope, and lower theta/delta, alpha/delta, beta/delta, alpha/theta, and beta/theta ratios. Greater delta power, more negative 1/f slope, and lower power ratios were associated with greater severity. Analyses of year 1 data replicated the associations between 1/f slope and power ratios and clinical severity and demonstrated good within-subject consistency in these measures.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Overall, group comparisons reflected a greater predominance of lower versus higher frequency activity in participants with RTT, which is consistent with prior clinical interpretations of resting EEG in this population. The observed associations between the EEG power measures and clinical assessments and the repeatability of these measures underscore the potential for EEG to provide an objective measure of cortical function and clinical severity for RTT.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Classic research has shown a division in the neuroanatomical structures that support flexible (e.g., short-cutting) and habitual (e.g., familiar route following) navigational behavior, with hippocampal–caudate systems associated with the former and putamen systems with the latter. There is, however, disagreement about whether the neural structures involved in navigation process particular forms of spatial information, such as associations between constellations of cues forming a cognitive map, versus single landmark-action associations, or alternatively, perform particular reinforcement learning algorithms that allow the use of different spatial strategies, so-called model-based (flexible) or model-free (habitual) forms of learning. We sought to test these theories by asking participants (<i>N</i> = 24) to navigate within a virtual environment through a previously learned, 9-junction route with distinctive landmarks at each junction while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). In a series of probe trials, we distinguished knowledge of individual landmark-action associations along the route versus knowledge of the correct <i>sequence</i> of landmark-action associations, either by having absent landmarks, or “out-of-sequence” landmarks. Under a map-based perspective, sequence knowledge would not require hippocampal systems, because there are no constellations of cues available for cognitive map formation. Within a learning-based model, however, responding based on knowledge of sequence <i>would</i> require hippocampal systems because prior context has to be utilized. We found that hippocampal–caudate systems were more active in probes requiring sequence knowledge, supporting the learning-based model. However, we also found greater putamen activation in probes where navigation based purely on sequence memory could be planned, supporting models of putamen function that emphasize its role in action sequencing.</p>

                Aging may lead to low-level chronic inflammation that increases the susceptibility to age-related conditions, including memory impairment and progressive loss of brain volume. As brain health is essential to promoting healthspan and lifespan, it is vital to understand age-related changes in the immune system and central nervous system (CNS) that drive normal brain aging. However, the relative importance, mechanistic interrelationships, and hierarchical order of such changes and their impact on normal brain aging remain to be clarified. Here, we synthesize accumulating evidence that age-related DNA damage and cellular senescence in the immune system and CNS contribute to the escalation of neuroinflammation and cognitive decline during normal brain aging. Targeting cellular senescence and immune modulation may provide a logical rationale for developing new treatment options to restore immune homeostasis and counteract age-related brain dysfunction and diseases.

                Neurons capable of mixed selectivity enhance the brain’s computational capabilities by responding to various inputs in complex ways, beyond simple combinations. Here, we describe possible neural mechanisms underlying mixed selectivity and discuss how they contribute to the brain’s dynamic flexibility in processing diverse information with efficiency.

                Gauld et al. use all-optical interrogation to probe sparse coding in the barrel cortex. They find that targeted photostimulation of task-silent neurons evokes perceptual choice bias and that these neurons are selectively suppressed by inhibition during whisker processing. Their findings show that silent neurons can be recruited to enhance behavior.

                Peterman et al. show that skin-resident macrophages, known as Langerhans cells, possess dynamic dendrites capable of surveilling the skin using actin- and ROCK-dependent mechanisms. Under steady-state conditions and upon tissue damage, Langerhans cells require the ROCK pathway to maintain cell morphology and respond to tissue damage.

	<p>In patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a lower level of cognitive function is associated with a higher likelihood of progression to dementia. In addition, gait disturbances and structural changes on brain MRI scans reflect cognitive levels. Therefore, we aimed to classify MCI based on cognitive level using gait parameters and brain MRI data. Eighty patients diagnosed with MCI from three dementia centres in Gangwon-do, Korea, were recruited for this study. We defined MCI as a Clinical Dementia Rating global score of &amp;amp;ge;0.5, with a memory domain score of &amp;amp;ge;0.5. Patients were classified as early-stage or late-stage MCI based on their mini-mental status examination (MMSE) z-scores. We trained a machine learning model using gait and MRI data parameters. The convolutional neural network (CNN) resulted in the best classifier performance in separating late-stage MCI from early-stage MCI; its performance was maximised when feature patterns that included multimodal features (GAIT + white matter dataset) were used. The single support time was the strongest predictor. Machine learning that incorporated gait and white matter parameters achieved the highest accuracy in distinguishing between late-stage MCI and early-stage MCI.</p>

	<p>The Michelangelo effect is a phenomenon that shows a reduction in perceived effort and an improvement in performance among both healthy subjects and patients when completing a motor task related to artistic stimuli, compared to performing the same task with non-artistic stimuli. It could contribute to the efficacy of art therapy in neurorehabilitation. In this study, the possible occurrence of this effect was tested in a cognitive task by asking 15 healthy subjects and 17 patients with a history of stroke to solve a digital version of the classical memory card game. Three different types of images were used in a randomized order: French cards, artistic portraits, and photos of famous people (to compensate for the possible effects of face recognition). Healthy subjects were involved to test the usability and the load demand of the developed system, reporting no statistically significant differences among the three sessions (p &amp;amp;gt; 0.05). Conversely, patients had a better performance in terms of time (p = 0.014) and the number of attempts (p = 0.007) needed to complete the task in the presence of artistic stimuli, accompanied by a reduction in the perceived effort (p = 0.033). Furthermore, artistic stimuli, with respect to the other two types of images, seemed more associated with visuospatial control than linguistic functions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/10-972/v2?src=rss">Online food delivery services: cross-sectional study of consumers’ attitude in Malaysia during and after the COVID-19 pandemic [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background During the COVID-19 pandemic, Malaysian consumers were more likely to purchase food online and have it delivered to their doorstep. To stay afloat, many restaurants were pushed to provide online food delivery services (OFDS), and this sector has grown tremendously. However, will the trend persist after the pandemic? This study aims to look into how consumers’ perceptions of OFDS affect their attitude towards them. It investigates the relationship between convenience motivation, perceived ease of use, time-saving orientation and price-saving orientation in terms of future intent to use OFDS. Method Primary data was collected from 307 respondents in Malaysia using convenience sampling method through an online survey. Respondents’ demographic background was presented statistically in cross tabulation tables to study the ratio comparison implicitly. Consistent Partial Least Square approach and bootstrapping techniques with 5,000 subsamples was employed, with the aid of SmartPLS.V3 software, to identify the significant factors influencing consumers’ continuance intention after the pandemic. Result Perceived ease of use does not contribute significantly to continuance intention as most consumers have prior online purchase experience. Nevertheless, time-saving orientation has a positive correlation with perceived ease of use due to the simplicity of placing an order with just a click. It is also found that price-saving orientation is related to convenience motivation, particularly when prices can be compared on the websites or online ordering platforms. Consumers’ intention to continue using OFDS even after the COVID-19 pandemic is positively influenced by all the parameters studied, except for perceived ease of use. Conclusion Limited work has been done on the continuance intention to use OFDS beyond the pandemic. This study provides insight for food retailers on how to enhance their business and retain their customers with the support of technology, even after the COVID-19 pandemic.

                Introduction HIV affects over 38 million people worldwide, affecting the immune system and leading to symptoms like fever, lymphadenopathy, and sore throat. High viral loads can lead to opportunistic infections and tumors. The life expectancy of HIV patients has increased due to high-efficiency combination anti-retroviral therapy. Urothelial carcinoma, a malignant development, damages the urinary canal lining. The connection between HIV and urinary cancers is unclear, the aims of this study to report a case of urethral urothelial Carcinoma in HIV patient who underwent total urethrectomy and perineal urethrostomy. Case presentation A 34-year-old male patient with a papilliferous lump on the glans penis for over six months was admitted to the hospital. Preoperative screening revealed HIV and a urethral mass was found. A partial urethrectomy was performed, revealing high grade papillary urothelial Carcinoma. Five months after surgery, the patient developed a recurrent lump, requiring a total urethrectomy, TUR (transurethral resection) of the mass in the prostatic urethra, and perineal urethrostomy. Conclusion Primary carcinoma of the urethra in HIV patient is an extremely rare case. To date, there is no consensus on the primary urethral carcinoma therapy. The treatment of primary urethral carcinoma is tailored specifically to the patient based on the location, histology, and stage of the carcinoma.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-460/v1?src=rss">Case Report: Branch retinal vein occlusion following COVID-19 vaccination and SARS-CoV-2 infection while taking oral contraceptives [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Oral contraceptive use, vaccination for Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection are risk factors for venous thromboembolism. Branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) generally develops mid-60s patients. Herein, we present a case of BRVO caused by the above mentioned risk factors in a young woman. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report about BRVO associated with oral contraceptives, COVID-19 vaccination, and SARS-CoV-2. A 21-year-old woman presented with loss of visual acuity in her right eye for 10 days. She had been receiving oral contraceptives for 2 years for oligomenorrhea before noticing ophthalmological symptoms. Despite having received two doses of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, she contracted COVID-19 and developed fever, sore throat, cough, low back pain, and general malaise about 40 days before the initial visit. However, only cough persisted for more than a month. The right eye showed BRVO with macular edema (ME). She did not smoke nor had diabetes or hypertension. Blood test results, including cardiolipin antibody IgG, were normal. She was treated with an intravitreal aflibercept injection. ME in the fundus showed rapid improvement and resolution. Although more than 20 months have passed since the first injection, there has been no relapse of ME. The combination of oral contraceptive use, COVID-19 vaccination, and subsequent SARS-CoV-2 infection could induce the development of venous thromboembolism, thereby leading to BRVO. Given that cases of COVID-19 have increased globally, patients with retinal vein occlusion who use oral contraceptives are likely to be encountered more frequently.
