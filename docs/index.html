<h2>Graphical Abstract</h2>
<p>: Color coded maps showing the major target sites and relative densities of projections from the five divisions of the orbital cortex (medial, ventral, ventrolateral, lateral, and dorsolateral cortices) to nuclei of the thalamus. Of note, the orbital cortex almost exclusively distributes to the nuclei of the “limbic thalamus”; that is, to the midline, intralaminar, submedial, anterior, and mediodorsal nuclei.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The orbital cortex (ORB) of the rat consists of five divisions: the medial (MO), ventral (VO), ventrolateral (VLO), lateral (LO), and dorsolateral (DLO) orbital cortices. No previous report has comprehensively examined and compared projections from each division of the ORB to the thalamus. Using the anterograde anatomical tracer, <i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i> leucoagglutinin, we describe the efferent projections from the five divisions of the ORB to the thalamus in the rat. We demonstrated that, with some overlap, each division of the ORB distributed in a distinct (and unique) manner to nuclei of the thalamus. Overall, ORB projected to a relatively restricted number of sites in the thalamus, and strikingly distributed entirely to structures of the medial/midline thalamus, while completely avoiding lateral regions or principal nuclei of the thalamus. The main termination sites in the thalamus were the paratenial nucleus (PT) and nucleus reuniens (RE) of the midline thalamus, the medial (MDm) and central (MDc) divisions of the mediodorsal nucleus, the intermediodorsal nucleus, the central lateral, paracentral, and central medial nuclei of the rostral intralaminar complex and the submedial nucleus (SM). With some exceptions, medial divisions of the ORB (MO, VO) mainly targeted “limbic-associated” nuclei such as PT, RE, and MDm, whereas lateral division (VLO, LO, DLO) primarily distributed to “sensorimotor-associated” nuclei including MDc, SM, and the rostral intralaminar complex. As discussed herein, the medial/midline thalamus may represent an important link (or bridge) between the orbital cortex and the hippocampus and between the ORB and medial prefrontal cortex. In summary, the present results demonstrate that each division of the orbital cortex projects in a distinct manner to nuclei of the thalamus which suggests unique functions for each division of the orbital cortex.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Compromised endocytosis in neurons leads to synapse overgrowth and altered organization of synaptic proteins. However, the molecular players and the signaling pathways which regulate the process remain poorly understood. Here, we show that 2-adaptin, one of the subunits of the AP2-complex, genetically interacts with Mad, Medea and Dad (components of BMP signaling) to control neuromuscular junction (NMJ) growth in <I>Drosophila</I>. Ultrastructural analysis of <I>2-adaptin</I> mutants show an accumulation of large vesicles and membranous structures akin to endosomes at the synapse. We found that mutations in <I>2-adaptin</I> lead to an accumulation of Tkv receptors at the presynaptic membrane. Interestingly, the level of small GTPase Rab11 was significantly reduced in the <I>2-adaptin</I> mutant synapses. However, expression of Rab11 does not restore the synaptic defects of <I>2-adaptin</I> mutations. We propose a model in which AP2 regulates Tkv internalization and endosomal recycling to control synaptic growth.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Experiments employing chronic monitoring of neurophysiological signals and video are commonly used in studies of epilepsy to characterize behavioral correlates of seizures. Our objective was to design a low-cost platform that enables chronic monitoring of several animals simultaneously, synchronizes bilateral local field potential (LFP) and video streams in real time, and parses recorded data into manageable file sizes. We present a hardware solution leveraging Intan and Open Ephys acquisition systems and a software solution implemented in Bonsai. The platform was tested in 48-h continuous recordings simultaneously from multiple mice (male and female) with chronic epilepsy. To enable seizure detection and scoring, we developed a graphical user interface (GUI) that reads the data produced by our workflow and allows a user with no coding expertise to analyze events. Our Bonsai workflow was designed to maximize flexibility for a wide variety of experimental applications, and our use of the Open Ephys acquisition board would allow for scaling recordings up to 128 channels per animal.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Spike Afterhyperpolarizations Govern Persistent Firing Dynamics in Rat Neocortical and Hippocampal Pyramidal Cells</a></h4>

              
                <p>Persistent firing is commonly reported in both cortical and subcortical neurons under a variety of behavioral conditions. Yet the mechanisms responsible for persistent activity are only partially resolved with support for both intrinsic and synaptic circuit-based mechanisms. Little also is known about physiological factors that enable epochs of persistent firing to continue beyond brief pauses and then spontaneously terminate. In the present study, we used intracellular recordings in rat (both sexes) neocortical and hippocampal brain slices to assess the ionic mechanisms underlying persistent firing dynamics. Previously, we showed that blockade of ether-&aacute;-go-go-related gene (ERG) potassium channels abolished intrinsic persistent firing in the presence of low concentrations of muscarinic receptor agonists and following optogenetic activation of cholinergic axons. Here we show the slow dynamics of ERG conductance changes allows persistent firing to outlast the triggering stimulus and even to initiate discharges following ~7 s poststimulus firing pauses. We find that persistent firing dynamics is regulated by the interaction between ERG conductance and spike afterhyperpolarizations (AHPs). Increasing the amplitude of spike AHPs using either SK channel activators or a closed-loop reactive feedback system allows persistent discharges to spontaneously terminate in both neocortical neurons and hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells. The interplay between ERG and the potassium channels that mediate spike AHPs grades the duration of persistent firing, providing a novel, generalizable mechanism to explain self-terminating persistent firing modes observed behaving animals.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Many classes of neurons generate prolonged spiking responses to transient stimuli. These discharges often outlast the stimulus by seconds to minutes in some <I>in vitro</I> models of persistent firing. While recent work has identified key synaptic and intrinsic components that enable persistent spiking responses, less is known about mechanisms that can terminate and regulate the dynamics of these responses. The present study identified the spike afterhyperpolarizations as a potent mechanism that regulates the duration of persistent firing. We found that amplifying spike afterpotentials converted bistable persistent firing into self-terminating discharges. Varying the spike AHP amplitude grades the duration of persistent discharges, generating <I>in vitro</I> responses that mimic firing modes associated with neurons associated with short-term memory function.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Oxytocin-Modulated Ion Channel Ensemble Controls Depolarization, Integration and Burst Firing in CA2 Pyramidal Neurons</a></h4>

              
                <p>Oxytocin (OXT) and OXT receptor (OXTR)-mediated signaling control excitability, firing patterns, and plasticity of hippocampal CA2 pyramidal neurons, which are pivotal in generation of brain oscillations and social memory. Nonetheless, the ionic mechanisms underlying OXTR-induced effects in CA2 neurons are not fully understood. Using slice physiology in a reporter mouse line and interleaved current-clamp and voltage-clamp experiments, we systematically identified the ion channels modulated by OXT signaling in CA2 pyramidal cells (PYRs) in mice of both sexes and explored how changes in channel conductance support altered electrical activity. Activation of OXTRs inhibits an outward potassium current mediated by inward rectifier potassium channels (<I>I</I><SUB>Kir</SUB>) and thus favoring membrane depolarization. Concomitantly, OXT signaling also diminishes inward current mediated by hyperpolarization-activated cyclic-nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels (<I>I</I><SUB>h</SUB>), providing a hyperpolarizing drive. The combined reduction in both <I>I</I><SUB>Kir</SUB> and <I>I</I><SUB>h</SUB> synergistically elevate the membrane resistance and favor dendritic integration while the membrane potential is restrained from quickly depolarizing from rest. As a result, the responsiveness of CA2 PYRs to synaptic inputs is highly sharpened during OXTR activation. Unexpectedly, OXTR signaling also strongly enhances a tetrodotoxin-resistant (TTX-R), voltage-gated sodium current that helps drive the membrane potential to spike threshold and thus promote rhythmic firing. This novel array of OXTR-stimulated ionic mechanisms operates in close coordination and underpins OXT-induced burst firing, a key step in CA2 PYRs' contribution to hippocampal information processing and broader influence on brain circuitry. Our study deepens our understanding of underpinnings of OXT-promoted social memory and general neuropeptidergic control of cognitive states.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Oxytocin (OXT) plays key roles in reproduction, parenting and social and emotional behavior, and deficiency in OXT receptor (OXTR) signaling may contribute to neuropsychiatric disorders. We identified a novel array of OXTR-modulated ion channels that operate in close coordination to retune hippocampal CA2 pyramidal neurons, enhancing responsiveness to synaptic inputs and sculpting output. OXTR signaling inhibits both potassium conductance (<I>I</I><SUB>Kir</SUB>) and mixed cation conductance (<I>I</I><SUB>h</SUB>), engaging opposing influences on membrane potential, stabilizing it while synergistically elevating membrane resistance and electrotonic spread. OXT signaling also facilitates a tetrodotoxin-resistant (TTX-R) Na<sup>+</sup> current, not previously described in hippocampus (HP), engaged on further depolarization. This TTX-R current lowers the spike threshold and supports rhythmic depolarization and burst firing, a potent driver of downstream circuitry.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Cerebellar GABA Change during Visuomotor Adaptation Relates to Adaptation Performance and Cerebellar Network Connectivity: A Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic Imaging Study</a></h4>

              
                <p>Motor adaptation is crucial for performing accurate movements in a changing environment and relies on the cerebellum. Although cerebellar involvement has been well characterized, the neurochemical changes in the cerebellum underpinning human motor adaptation remain unknown. We used a novel magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) technique to measure changes in the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA in the human cerebellum during visuomotor adaptation. Participants (<I>n</I> = 17, six female) used their right hand to adapt to a rotated cursor in the scanner, compared with a control task requiring no adaptation. We spatially resolved adaptation-driven GABA changes at the cerebellar nuclei and cerebellar cortex in the left and the right cerebellar hemisphere independently and found that simple right-hand movements increase GABA in the right cerebellar nuclei and decreases GABA in the left. When isolating adaptation-driven GABA changes, we found that GABA in the left cerebellar nuclei and the right cerebellar nuclei diverged, although GABA change from baseline at the right cerebellar nuclei was not different from zero at the group level. Early adaptation-driven GABA fluctuations in the right cerebellar nuclei correlated with adaptation performance. Participants showing greater GABA decrease adapted better, suggesting early GABA change is behaviorally relevant. Early GABA change also correlated with functional connectivity change in a cerebellar network. Participants showing greater decreases in GABA showed greater strength increases in cerebellar network connectivity. Results were specific to GABA, to adaptation, and to the cerebellar network. This study provides first evidence for plastic changes in cerebellar neurochemistry during motor adaptation. Characterizing these naturally occurring neurochemical changes may provide a basis for developing therapeutic interventions to facilitate human motor adaptation.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Despite motor adaptation being fundamental to maintaining accurate movements, its neurochemical basis remains poorly understood, perhaps because measuring neurochemicals in the human cerebellum is technically challenging. Using a novel magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging method, this study provides evidence for GABA changes in the left compared with the right cerebellar nuclei driven by both simple movement and motor adaptation. Although right cerebellar GABA changes were not significantly different from zero at the group level, the adaptation-driven GABA fluctuations in the right cerebellar nuclei correlated with adaptation performance and with functional connectivity change in a cerebellar network. These results show the first evidence for plastic changes in cerebellar neurochemistry during a cerebellar learning task. This provides the basis for developing therapeutic interventions that facilitate these naturally occurring changes to amplify cerebellar-dependent learning.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Axonal Barcode Analysis of Pyramidal Tract Projections from Mouse Forelimb M1 and M2</a></h4>

              
                <p>Forelimb-related areas of the motor cortex communicate directly to downstream areas in the brainstem and spinal cord via axons that project to and through the pyramidal tract (PT). To better understand the diversity of the brainstem branching patterns of these pyramidal tract projections, we used MAPseq, a molecular barcode technique for population-scale sampling with single-axon resolution. In experiments using mice of both sexes, we first confirmed prior results demonstrating the basic efficacy of axonal barcode identification of primary motor cortex (M1) PT-type axons, including corticobulbar (CBULB) and corticospinal (CSPI) subclasses. We then used multiplexed MAPseq to analyze projections from M1 and M2 (caudal and rostral forelimb areas). The four basic axon subclasses comprising these projections (M1-CSPI, M1-CBULB, M2-CSPI, M2-CBULB) showed a complex mix of differences and similarities in their brainstem projection profiles. This included relatively abundant branching by all classes in the dorsal midbrain, by M2 subclasses in the pons, and by CSPI subclasses in the dorsal medulla. Cluster analysis showed graded distributions of the basic subclasses within the PT class. Clusters were of diversely mixed subclass composition and showed distinct rostrocaudal and/or dorsomedial projection biases. Exemplifying these patterns was a subcluster likely enriched in corticocuneate branches. Overall, the results indicate high yet systematic PT axon diversity at the level of brainstem branching patterns; projections of M1 and M2 appear qualitatively similar, yet with quantitative differences in subclasses and clusters.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Axons of the PT class of cortical projection neurons, which includes corticospinal and corticobulbar neurons, anatomically link motor cortex to brainstem and spinal cord circuits. Both of these subclasses can form branches to brainstem destinations along the way, but the extent and diversity of these branching patterns is incompletely understood. Here, we used MAPseq to tag PT axons with individual molecular barcodes for high-throughput quantification of branching patterns across the brainstem. The results reveal diverse, complex, yet systematic branching patterns of corticospinal and corticobulbar neurons arising from two motor cortex areas, M1 and M2.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Cannabinoids and Opioids Differentially Target Extrinsic and Intrinsic GABAergic Inputs onto the Periaqueductal Grey Descending Pathway</a></h4>

              
                <p>The midbrain periaqueductal gray (PAG) plays a central role in pain modulation via descending pathways. Opioids and cannabinoids are thought to activate these descending pathways by relieving intrinsic GABAergic inhibition of PAG neurons which project to the rostroventromedial medulla (RVM), a process known as disinhibition. However, the PAG also receives descending extrinsic GABAergic inputs from the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) which are thought to inhibit PAG GABAergic interneurons. It remains unclear how opioids and cannabinoids act at these different synapses to control descending analgesic pathways. We used optogenetics, tract tracing and electrophysiology to identify the circuitry underlying opioid and cannabinoid actions within the PAG of male and female rats. It was observed that both RVM-projection and nonprojection PAG neurons received intrinsic-PAG and extrinsic-CeA synaptic inputs, which were predominantly GABAergic. Opioids acted via presynaptic &micro;-receptors to suppress both intrinsic and extrinsic GABAergic inputs onto all PAG neurons, although this inhibition was greater in RVM-projection neurons. By contrast, cannabinoids acted via presynaptic CB1 receptors to exclusively suppress the direct descending GABAergic input from the CeA onto RVM-projection PAG neurons. These findings indicate the CeA controls PAG output neurons which project to the RVM via parallel direct and indirect GABAergic pathways. While &micro;-opioids indiscriminately inhibit GABAergic inputs onto all PAG neurons, cannabinoids selectively inhibit a direct extrinsic GABAergic input from the amygdala onto PAG projection neurons. These differential actions of opioids and cannabinoids provide a flexible system to gate the descending control of analgesia from the PAG.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The disinhibition hypothesis of analgesia states that opioids activate the midbrain periaqueductal gray (PAG) descending pathway by relieving the tonic inhibition of projection neurons from GABAergic interneurons. However, the PAG also receives extrinsic GABAergic inputs and is the locus of action of cannabinoid analgesics. Here, we show the relative sensitivity of GABAergic synapses to opioids and cannabinoids within the PAG depends on both the origin of presynaptic inputs and their postsynaptic targets. While opioids indiscriminately inhibit all GABAergic inputs onto all PAG neurons, cannabinoids selectively inhibit a direct extrinsic GABAergic input from the amygdala onto PAG descending projection neurons. These differential actions of opioids and cannabinoids provide a flexible system to gate PAG descending outputs.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">A Combinatorial Input Landscape in the "Higher-Order Relay" Posterior Thalamic Nucleus</a></h4>

              
                <p>All pathways targeting the thalamus terminate directly onto the thalamic projection cells. As these cells lack local excitatory interconnections, their computations are fundamentally defined by the type and local convergence patterns of the extrinsic inputs. These two key variables, however, remain poorly defined for the "higher-order relay" (HO) nuclei that constitute most of the thalamus in large-brained mammals, including humans. Here, we systematically analyzed the input landscape of a representative HO nucleus of the mouse thalamus, the posterior nucleus (Po). We examined in adult male and female mice the neuropil distribution of terminals immunopositive for markers of excitatory or inhibitory neurotransmission, mapped input sources across the brain and spinal cord and compared the intranuclear distribution and varicosity size of axons originated from each input source. Our findings reveal a complex landscape of partly overlapping input-specific microdomains. Cortical layer (L)5 afferents from somatosensory and motor areas predominate in central and ventral Po but are relatively less abundant in dorsal and lateral portions of the nucleus. Excitatory inputs from the trigeminal complex, dorsal column nuclei (DCN), spinal cord and superior colliculus as well as inhibitory terminals from anterior pretectal nucleus and zona incerta (ZI) are each abundant in specific Po regions and absent from others. Cortical L6 and reticular thalamic nucleus terminals are evenly distributed across Po. Integration of specific input motifs by particular cell subpopulations may be commonplace within HO nuclei and favor the emergence of multiple, functionally diverse input-output subnetworks.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Because thalamic projection neurons lack local interconnections, their output is essentially determined by the kind and convergence of the long-range inputs that they receive. Fragmentary evidence suggests that these parameters may vary within the "higher-order relay" (HO) nuclei that constitute much of the thalamus, but such variation has not been systematically analyzed. Here, we mapped the origin and local convergence of all the extrinsic inputs reaching the posterior nucleus (Po), a typical HO nucleus of the mouse thalamus by combining multiple neuropil labeling and axon tracing methods. We report a complex mosaic of partly overlapping input-specific domains within Po. Integration of different input motifs by specific cell subpopulations in HO nuclei may favor the emergence of multiple, computationally specialized thalamocortical subnetworks.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">General Auditory and Speech-Specific Contributions to Cortical Envelope Tracking Revealed Using Auditory Chimeras</a></h4>

              
                <p>In recent years research on natural speech processing has benefited from recognizing that low-frequency cortical activity tracks the amplitude envelope of natural speech. However, it remains unclear to what extent this tracking reflects speech-specific processing beyond the analysis of the stimulus acoustics. In the present study, we aimed to disentangle contributions to cortical envelope tracking that reflect general acoustic processing from those that are functionally related to processing speech. To do so, we recorded EEG from subjects as they listened to auditory chimeras, stimuli composed of the temporal fine structure of one speech stimulus modulated by the amplitude envelope (ENV) of another speech stimulus. By varying the number of frequency bands used in making the chimeras, we obtained some control over which speech stimulus was recognized by the listener. No matter which stimulus was recognized, envelope tracking was always strongest for the ENV stimulus, indicating a dominant contribution from acoustic processing. However, there was also a positive relationship between intelligibility and the tracking of the perceived speech, indicating a contribution from speech-specific processing. These findings were supported by a follow-up analysis that assessed envelope tracking as a function of the (estimated) output of the cochlea rather than the original stimuli used in creating the chimeras. Finally, we sought to isolate the speech-specific contribution to envelope tracking using forward encoding models and found that indices of phonetic feature processing tracked reliably with intelligibility. Together these results show that cortical speech tracking is dominated by acoustic processing but also reflects speech-specific processing.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Activity in auditory cortex is known to dynamically track the energy fluctuations, or amplitude envelope, of speech. Measures of this tracking are now widely used in research on hearing and language and have had a substantial influence on theories of how auditory cortex parses and processes speech. But how much of this speech tracking is actually driven by speech-specific processing rather than general acoustic processing is unclear, limiting its interpretability and its usefulness. Here, by merging two speech stimuli together to form so-called auditory chimeras, we show that EEG tracking of the speech envelope is dominated by acoustic processing but also reflects linguistic analysis. This has important implications for theories of cortical speech tracking and for using measures of that tracking in applied research.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Midfrontal Theta Activity Is Sensitive to Approach-Avoidance Conflict</a></h4>

              
                <p>Midfrontal theta (FM) in the human EEG is commonly viewed as a generic and homogeneous mechanism of cognitive control in general and conflict processing in particular. However, the role of FM in approach&ndash;avoidance conflicts and its cross-task relationship to simpler stimulus-response conflicts remain to be examined more closely. Therefore, we recorded EEG data while 59 healthy participants (49 female, 10 male) completed both an approach&ndash;avoidance task and a flanker task. Participants showed significant increases in FM power in response to conflicts in both tasks. To our knowledge, this is the first study to show a direct relationship between FM and approach&ndash;avoidance conflicts. Crucially, FM activity was task dependent and showed no cross-task correlation. To assess the possibility of multiple FM sources, we applied source separation [generalized eigendecomposition (GED)] to distinguish independent FM generators. The activity of the components showed a similar pattern and was again task specific. However, our results did not yield a clear differentiation between task-specific FM sources for each of the participants. Overall, our results show FM increases in approach&ndash;avoidance conflicts, as has been established only for more simple response conflict paradigms so far. The independence of task-specific FM increases suggests differential sensitivity of FM to different forms of behavioral conflict.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> FM is well established as an indicator for cognitive conflict in tasks involving simple stimulus&ndash;response conflicts. However, we do not yet know about its role in more complex forms of goal ambivalence, such as approach&ndash;avoidance conflicts. Thus, we implemented an approach&ndash;avoidance task and a flanker task to investigate FM in response to simple as well as more complex response conflicts. To our knowledge, this is the first study to show a direct relationship between FM and approach&ndash;avoidance conflicts. Although the transient FM increase is similar to that induced in a simple response conflict task, individual FM responsiveness to these two forms of conflict were independent of each other, suggesting intraindividual differences in the sensitivity of FM to different forms of behavioral conflict.</p>

                <p>Probing the external world is essential for eukaryotes to distinguish beneficial from pathogenic micro-organisms. If it is clear that the main part of this task falls to the immune cells, recent work shows that neurons can also detect microbes, although the molecules and mechanisms involved are less characterized. In <I>Drosophila,</I> detection of bacteria-derived peptidoglycan by pattern recognition receptors of the peptidoglycan recognition protein (PGRP) family expressed in immune cells triggers nuclear factor-B (<I>NF</I>-B)/immune deficiency (IMD)-dependent signaling. We show here that one PGRP protein, called PGRP-LB, is expressed in bitter gustatory neurons of proboscises. <I>In vivo</I> calcium imaging in female flies reveals that the PGRP/IMD pathway is cell-autonomously required in these neurons to transduce the peptidoglycan signal. We finally show that NF-B/IMD pathway activation in bitter-sensing gustatory neurons influences fly behavior. This demonstrates that a major immune response elicitor and signaling module are required in the peripheral nervous system to sense the presence of bacteria in the environment.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> In addition to the classical immune response, eukaryotes rely on neuronally controlled mechanisms to detect microbes and engage in adapted behaviors. However, the mechanisms of microbe detection by the nervous system are poorly understood. Using genetic analysis and calcium imaging, we demonstrate here that bacteria-derived peptidoglycan can activate bitter gustatory neurons. We further show that this response is mediated by the PGRP-LC membrane receptor and downstream components of a noncanonical NF-B signaling cascade. Activation of this signaling cascade triggers behavior changes. These data demonstrate that bitter-sensing neurons and immune cells share a common detection and signaling module to either trigger the production of antibacterial effectors or to modulate the behavior of flies that are in contact with bacteria. Because peptidoglycan detection doesn't mobilize the known gustatory receptors, it also demonstrates that taste perception is much more complex than anticipated.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Spatial Attention Tunes Temporal Processing in Early Visual Cortex by Speeding and Slowing Alpha Oscillations</a></h4>

              
                <p>The perception of dynamic visual stimuli relies on two apparently conflicting perceptual mechanisms: rapid visual input must sometimes be integrated into unitary percepts but at other times must be segregated or parsed into separate objects or events. Though they have opposite effects on our perceptual experience, the deployment of spatial attention benefits both operations. Little is known about the neural mechanisms underlying this impact of spatial attention on temporal perception. Here, we record magnetoencephalography (MEG) in male and female humans to demonstrate that the deployment of spatial attention for the purpose of segregating or integrating visual stimuli impacts prestimulus oscillatory activity in retinotopic visual brain areas where the attended location is represented. Alpha band oscillations contralateral to an attended location are therefore faster than ipsilateral oscillations when stimuli appearing at this location will need to be segregated, but slower in expectation of the need for integration, consistent with the idea that &alpha; frequency is linked to perceptual sampling rate. These results demonstrate a novel interaction between temporal visual processing and the allocation of attention in space.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Our environment is dynamic and visual input therefore varies over time. To make sense of continuously changing information, our visual system balances two complementary processes: temporal segregation in order to identify changes, and temporal integration to identify consistencies in time. When we know that a circumstance requires use of one or the other of these operations, we are able to prepare for this, and this preparation can be tracked in oscillatory brain activity. Here, we show how this preparation for temporal processing can be focused spatially. When we expect to integrate or segregate visual stimuli that will appear at a specific location, oscillatory brain activity changes in visual areas responsible for the representation of that location. In this way, spatial and temporal mechanisms interact to support adaptive, efficient perception.</p>

                <p>Autism is characterized by two key diagnostic criteria including social deficits and repetitive behaviors. Although recent studies implicated ventral striatum in social deficits and dorsal striatum in repetitive behaviors, here we revealed coexisting and opposite morphologic and functional alterations in the dorsostriatal direct and indirect pathways, and such alterations in these two pathways were found to be responsible, respectively, for the two abovementioned different autism-like behaviors exhibited by male mice prenatally exposed to valproate. The alteration in direct pathway was characterized by a potentiated state of basal activity, with impairment in transient responsiveness of D1-MSNs during social exploration. Concurrent alteration in indirect pathway was a depressed state of basal activity, with enhancement in transient responsiveness of D2-MSNs during repetitive behaviors. A causal relationship linking such differential alterations in these two pathways to the coexistence of these two autism-like behaviors was demonstrated by the cell type-specific correction of abnormal basal activity in the D1-MSNs and D2-MSNs of valproate-exposed mice. The findings support those differential alterations in two striatal pathways mediate the two coexisting autism-like behavioral abnormalities, respectively. This result will help in developing therapeutic options targeting these circuit alterations.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Autism is characterized by two key diagnostic criteria including social deficits and repetitive behaviors. Although a number of recent studies have implicated ventral striatum in social deficits and dorsal striatum in repetitive behaviors, but social behaviors need to be processed by a series of actions, and repetitive behaviors, especially the high-order repetitive behaviors such as restrictive interests, have its scope to cognitive and emotional domains. The current study, for the first time, revealed that prenatal valproate exposure induced coexisting and differential alterations in the dorsomedial striatal direct and indirect pathways, and that these alterations mediate the two coexisting autism-like behavioral abnormalities, respectively. This result will help in developing therapeutic options targeting these circuit alterations to address the behavioral abnormalities.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Endogenous PTEN-Induced Kinase 1 Regulates Dendritic Architecture and Spinogenesis</a></h4>

              
                <p>Mutations in PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1) contribute to autosomal recessive Parkinson's disease with cognitive and neuropsychiatric comorbidities. Disturbances in dendritic and spine architecture are hallmarks of neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric conditions, but little is known of the impact of PINK1 on these structures. We used <I>Pink1</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice to study the role of endogenous PINK1 in regulating dendritic architecture, spine density, and spine maturation. <I>Pink1</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> cortical neurons of unknown sex showed decreased dendritic arborization, affecting both apical and basal arbors. Dendritic simplification in <I>Pink1</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> neurons was primarily driven by diminished branching with smaller effects on branch lengths. <I>Pink1</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> neurons showed reduced spine density with a shift in morphology to favor filopodia at the expense of mushroom spines. Electrophysiology revealed significant reductions in miniature EPSC (mEPSC) frequency in <I>Pink1</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> neurons, consistent with the observation of decreased spine numbers. Transfecting with human PINK1 rescued changes in dendritic architecture, in thin, stubby, and mushroom spine densities, and in mEPSC frequency. Diminished spine density was also observed in Golgi&ndash;Cox stained adult male <I>Pink1</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> brains. Western blot study of <I>Pink1</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> brains of either sex revealed reduced phosphorylation of NSFL1 cofactor p47, an indirect target of PINK1. Transfection of <I>Pink1</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> neurons with a phosphomimetic p47 plasmid rescued dendritic branching and thin/stubby spine density with a partial rescue of mushroom spines, implicating a role for PINK1-regulated p47 phosphorylation in dendrite and spine development. These findings suggest that PINK1-dependent synaptodendritic alterations may contribute to the risk of cognitive and/or neuropsychiatric pathologies observed in PINK1-mutated families.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Loss of PINK1 function has been implicated in both familial and sporadic neurodegenerative diseases. Yet surprisingly little is known of the impact of PINK1 loss on the fine structure of neurons. Neurons receive excitatory synaptic signals along a complex network of projections that form the dendritic tree, largely at tiny protrusions called dendritic spines. We studied cortical neurons and brain tissues from mice lacking PINK1. We discovered that PINK1 deficiency causes striking simplification of dendritic architecture associated with reduced synaptic input and decreased spine density and maturation. These changes are reversed by reintroducing human PINK1 or one of its downstream mediators into PINK1-deficient mouse neurons, indicating a conserved function, whose loss may contribute to neurodegenerative processes.</p>

                 Studying  medicine is uphill and tiring requiring long hours of study and, continuous dealing with patients and death. A medical student in River Nile state suffers from a high rate of depression due to academic stress, expectations of parents, and comparisons with peers.  Medical education is stressful and exhausting for mental health and has a negative impact on academic, health, and social performance. It also affects the student’s future as a doctor and patient care. The aim of this study knowledge prevalence of depression and its relation to socio-demographic variables among medical students in River Nile State Universities. This cross-sectional study in River Nile State describes the prevalence of depression. We used random samples of students from the first to fifth years, including 335 questionnaires, the Hospital Anxiety, and Depression Scale (HADS) data tool, and an additional question regarding the demographic variable. We found a high prevalence of depression .77.9%(depression 38.8 and borderline depression 39.1%). There was no significant association between college and depression (p= 0.67) and no significant in depression scores among different academic year (p= 0.21), gender (p= 0.23), notionally (p=0.7), smoking (p=0.79), and showed associated drugs (p=0.5). There are some risk factors other than university and smoking that lead to depression The rate of depression is high among medical students. Students must be identified and assisted and taken seriously.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Parafibromin governs cell polarity and centrosome assembly in Drosophila neural stem cells</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Qiannan Deng, Cheng Wang, Chwee Tat Koe, Jan Peter Heinen, Ye Sing Tan, Song Li, Cayetano Gonzalez, Wing-Kin Sung, Hongyan Wang</p>

Neural stem cells (NSCs) divide asymmetrically to balance their self-renewal and differentiation, an imbalance in which can lead to NSC overgrowth and tumor formation. The functions of Parafibromin, a conserved tumor suppressor, in the nervous system are not established. Here, we demonstrate that <i>Drosophila</i> Parafibromin/Hyrax (Hyx) inhibits ectopic NSC formation by governing cell polarity. Hyx is essential for the asymmetric distribution and/or maintenance of polarity proteins. <i>hyx</i> depletion results in the symmetric division of NSCs, leading to the formation of supernumerary NSCs in the larval brain. Importantly, we show that human Parafibromin rescues the ectopic NSC phenotype in <i>Drosophila hyx</i> mutant brains. We have also discovered that Hyx is required for the proper formation of interphase microtubule-organizing center and mitotic spindles in NSCs. Moreover, Hyx is required for the proper localization of 2 key centrosomal proteins, Polo and AurA, and the microtubule-binding proteins Msps and D-TACC in dividing NSCs. Furthermore, Hyx directly regulates the <i>polo</i> and <i>aurA</i> expression in vitro. Finally, overexpression of <i>polo</i> and <i>aurA</i> could significantly suppress ectopic NSC formation and NSC polarity defects caused by <i>hyx</i> depletion. Our data support a model in which Hyx promotes the expression of <i>polo</i> and <i>aurA</i> in NSCs and, in turn, regulates cell polarity and centrosome/microtubule assembly. This new paradigm may be relevant to future studies on Parafibromin/HRPT2-associated cancers.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Feasibility of contextualizing the Informed Health Choices learning resources in Italy: A pilot study in a primary school in Florence [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background The Informed Health Choices (IHC) project team developed learning resources for primary school children to teach critical thinking about treatments claims and health choices and evaluated their effect in a randomized controlled trial of 120 schools in Uganda. Children taught with these resources showed a better ability to think critically about treatments claims and health choices than children not taught with these resources. Teams in multiple countries are contextualising the IHC resources for use in other languages and settings; in this pilot we describe contextualization for use in Italian primary school.  Methods After translating the IHC resources to Italian and holding an introductory workshop with participating schoolteachers, we piloted the resources with two classes of a primary school in Florence over nine lessons. Our aims were: 1) to assess the feasibility of introducing the IHC curriculum in Italian primary school; 2) to evaluate students’ ability to assess health claims and make informed health choices; to explore 3) students’ and 4) teachers’ experiences with the IHC learning resources; 5) to identify barriers and facilitators to implementation of IHC learning resources in Italian primary school. To assess these objectives, we used qualitative and quantitative methods. Results Both qualitative and quantitative analyses consistently showed that the IHC learning resources had a positive impact on the objectives examined. The resources integrated well into the Italian primary school curriculum. Both students and teachers considered these resources comprehensible, appealing in design and content, and stimulating for the development of a critical attitude. The only barrier teachers and students expressed was using the resources in a remote learning context.  Conclusions Findings from our contextualisation of IHC learning resources in Italian primary school indicate that these resources are well-suited for Italian teachers and students in a primary school context and compatible with the Italian primary school curriculum.

                Background Hypereutrophic conditions in major water reservoirs used for irrigation purposes in South Africa promote the co-existence of cyanotoxins and other pollutants such as linear alkylbenzene sulfonate (LAS). LAS is known to alter the permeability of membranes and promote the uptake of other pollutants by plants. In light of the potential human health risks and prevailing hypereutrophic conditions in some catchments in South Africa, we investigated the combined effects of LAS and microcystins (MCs) when cyanobacteria infested water is used to irrigate terrestrial crops. Methods To understand the potential risks, pot-culture experiments were conducted to assess the effect of LAS on the accumulation of MCs in Brassica oleracea (cabbage) and Solanum tuberosum (potato) plants. The plants were watered with dam water containing 3.48 mg L-1 of the LAS (sodium dodecyl sulfate) and MCs (MC-LR: 10.47 ± 3.879; 6.158 ± 4.127 for MC-RR and 8.160 ± 2.544 for MC-YR μg L-1) for 20 days. Results The presence of LAS, at environmentally relevant concentrations in the irrigation water, did not enhance the uptake of MCs in the two plants, as demonstrated by statistically insignificant differences in the means of the treatments (with and without LAS). In addition, the presence of LAS, high pH, electrical conductivity (EC), and cyanotoxins in the water did not affect the total chlorophyll or the well-being of the plants. However, in some cases the levels of MCs bioaccumulated by the two plants exceeded the WHO recommended tolerable daily intake (TDI). Conclusions These findings imply that the tested levels of LAS and MCs did not have any synergic effects on the two plant species, but irrigating food crops with such water still poses a human health risk.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) is an mRNA binding protein that is essential for neural circuit assembly and synaptic plasticity. Loss of functional FMRP leads to Fragile X syndrome (FXS), a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by sensory dysfunction including abnormal auditory processing. While the central mechanisms of FMRP regulation have been studied in the brain, whether FMRP is expressed in the auditory periphery and how it develops and functions remains unknown. In this study, we characterized the spatiotemporal distribution pattern of FMRP immunoreactivity in the inner ear of mice, rats, gerbils, and chickens. Across species, FMRP was expressed in hair cells and supporting cells, with a particularly high level in immature hair cells during the prehearing period. Interestingly, the distribution of cytoplasmic FMRP displayed an age-dependent translocation in hair cells, and this feature was conserved across species. In the auditory ganglion (AG), FMRP immunoreactivity was detected in neuronal cell bodies as well as their peripheral and central processes. Distinct from hair cells, FMRP intensity in AG neurons was high both during development and after maturation. Additionally, FMRP was evident in mature glial cells surrounding AG neurons. Together, these observations demonstrate distinct developmental trajectories across cell types in the auditory periphery. Given the importance of peripheral inputs to the maturation of auditory circuits, these findings implicate involvement of FMRP in inner ear development as well as a potential contribution of periphery FMRP to the generation of auditory dysfunction in FXS.</p>

                Beckman et al. show that SARS-CoV-2 proteins are found in olfactory areas of the brains of Rhesus macaques at 7 days post-infection. In addition to direct neuronal infection, extensive neuroinflammation and vascular disruptions are observed, and these effects are exacerbated in aged, diabetic animals.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Tumor elimination by clustered microRNAs miR-306 and miR-79 via non-canonical activation of JNK signaling</a></h4>

              
                JNK signaling plays a critical role in both tumor promotion and tumor suppression. Here, we identified clustered microRNAs (miRNAs) miR-306 and miR-79 as novel tumor-suppressor miRNAs that specifically eliminate JNK-activated tumors in <i>Drosophila</i>. While showing only a slight effect on normal tissue growth, miR-306 and miR-79 strongly suppressed growth of multiple tumor models including malignant tumors caused by Ras activation and cell polarity defects. Mechanistically, these miRNAs commonly target the mRNA of an E3 ubiquitin ligase ring finger protein 146 (RNF146). We found that RNF146 promotes degradation of tankyrase (Tnks), an ADP-ribose polymerase that promotes JNK activation in a non-canonical manner. Thus, downregulation of RNF146 by miR-306 and miR-79 leads to hyper-enhancement of JNK activation. Our data show that, while JNK activity is essential for tumor growth, elevation of miR-306 or miR-79 overactivate JNK signaling to the lethal level via non-canonical JNK pathway and thus eliminate tumors, providing a new miRNA-based strategy against cancer.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The centrosomal protein 83 (CEP83) regulates human pluripotent stem cell differentiation towards the kidney lineage</a></h4>

              
                During embryonic development, the mesoderm undergoes patterning into diverse lineages including axial, paraxial, and lateral plate mesoderm (LPM). Within the LPM, the so-called intermediate mesoderm (IM) forms kidney and urogenital tract progenitor cells, while the remaining LPM forms cardiovascular, hematopoietic, mesothelial, and additional progenitor cells. The signals that regulate these early lineage decisions are incompletely understood. Here, we found that the centrosomal protein 83 (CEP83), a centriolar component necessary for primary cilia formation and mutated in pediatric kidney disease, influences the differentiation of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) towards intermediate mesoderm. We induced inactivating deletions of <i>CEP83</i> in hiPSCs and applied a 7 day in vitro protocol of intermediate mesoderm kidney progenitor differentiation, based on timed application of WNT and FGF agonists. We characterized induced mesodermal cell populations using single cell and bulk transcriptomics and tested their ability to form kidney structures in subsequent organoid culture. While hiPSCs with homozygous <i>CEP83</i> inactivation were normal regarding morphology and transcriptome, their induced differentiation into IM progenitor cells was perturbed. Mesodermal cells induced after 7 days of monolayer culture of <i>CEP83</i>-deficient hiPCS exhibited absent or elongated primary cilia, displayed decreased expression of critical IM genes (<i>PAX8</i>, <i>EYA1</i>, <i>HOXB7</i>), and an aberrant induction of LPM markers (e. g. <i>FOXF1</i>, <i>FOXF2</i>, <i>FENDRR</i>, <i>HAND1</i>, <i>HAND2</i>). Upon subsequent organoid culture, wildtype cells differentiated to form kidney tubules and glomerular-like structures, whereas <i>CEP83</i>-deficient cells failed to generate kidney cell types, instead upregulating cardiomyocyte, vascular, and more general LPM progenitor markers. Our data suggest that <i>CEP83</i> regulates the balance of intermediate mesoderm and lateral plate mesoderm formation from human pluripotent stem cells, identifying a potential link between centriolar or ciliary function and mesodermal lineage induction.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Arnold tongue entrainment reveals dynamical principles of the embryonic segmentation clock</a></h4>

              
                Living systems exhibit an unmatched complexity, due to countless, entangled interactions across scales. Here, we aim to understand a complex system, that is, segmentation timing in mouse embryos, without a reference to these detailed interactions. To this end, we develop a coarse-grained approach, in which theory guides the experimental identification of the segmentation clock entrainment responses. We demonstrate period- and phase-locking of the segmentation clock across a wide range of entrainment parameters, including higher-order coupling. These quantifications allow to derive the phase response curve (PRC) and Arnold tongues of the segmentation clock, revealing its essential dynamical properties. Our results indicate that the somite segmentation clock has characteristics reminiscent of a highly non-linear oscillator close to an infinite period bifurcation and suggests the presence of long-term feedbacks. Combined, this coarse-grained theoretical-experimental approach reveals how we can derive simple, essential features of a highly complex dynamical system, providing precise experimental control over the pace and rhythm of the somite segmentation clock.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A model-based analysis of the health impacts of COVID-19 disruptions to primary cervical screening by time since last screen for current and future disruptions</a></h4>

              
                We evaluated how temporary disruptions to primary cervical cancer (CC) screening services may differentially impact women due to heterogeneity in their screening history and test modality. We used three CC models to project the short- and long-term health impacts assuming an underlying primary screening frequency (i.e., 1, 3, 5, or 10 yearly) under three alternative COVID-19-related screening disruption scenarios (i.e., 1-, 2-, or 5-year delay) versus no delay in the context of both cytology-based and human papillomavirus (HPV)-based screening. Models projected a relative increase in symptomatically detected cancer cases during a 1-year delay period that was 38% higher (Policy1-Cervix), 80% higher (Harvard), and 170% higher (MISCAN-Cervix) for underscreened women whose last cytology screen was 5 years prior to the disruption period compared with guidelines-compliant women (i.e., last screen 3 years prior to disruption). Over a woman’s lifetime, temporary COVID-19-related delays had less impact on lifetime risk of developing CC than screening frequency and test modality; however, CC risks increased disproportionately the longer time had elapsed since a woman’s last screen at the time of the disruption. Excess risks for a given delay period were generally lower for HPV-based screeners than for cytology-based screeners. Our independent models predicted that the main drivers of CC risk were screening frequency and screening modality, and the overall impact of disruptions from the pandemic on CC outcomes may be small. However, screening disruptions disproportionately affect underscreened women, underpinning the importance of reaching such women as a critical area of focus, regardless of temporary disruptions.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Active tactile discrimination is coupled with and modulated by the cardiac cycle</a></h4>

              
                Perception and cognition are modulated by the phase of the cardiac signal in which the stimuli are presented. This has been shown by locking the presentation of stimuli to distinct cardiac phases. However, in everyday life sensory information is not presented in this passive and phase-locked manner, instead we actively move and control our sensors to perceive the world. Whether active sensing is coupled and modulated with the cardiac cycle remains largely unknown. Here we recorded the electrocardiograms of human participants while they actively performed a tactile grating orientation task. We show that the duration of subjects' touch varied as a function of the cardiac phase in which they initiated it. Touches initiated in the systole phase were held for longer periods of time than touches initiated in the diastole phase. This effect was most pronounced when elongating the duration of the touches to sense the most difficult gratings. Conversely, while touches in the control condition were coupled to the cardiac cycle, their length did not vary as a function of the phase in which these were initiated. Our results reveal that we actively spend more time sensing during systole periods, the cardiac phase associated with lower perceptual sensitivity (<i>vs.</i> diastole). In line with interoceptive inference accounts, these results indicate that we actively adjust the acquisition of sense data to our internal bodily cycles.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">KLC4 shapes axon arbors during development and mediates adult behavior</a></h4>

              
                Development of elaborate and polarized neuronal morphology requires precisely regulated transport of cellular cargos by motor proteins such as kinesin-1. Kinesin-1 has numerous cellular cargos which must be delivered to unique neuronal compartments. The process by which this motor selectively transports and delivers cargo to regulate neuronal morphogenesis is poorly understood, although the cargo-binding kinesin light chain (KLC) subunits contribute to specificity. Our work implicates one such subunit, KLC4, as an essential regulator of axon branching and arborization pattern of sensory neurons during development. Using live imaging approaches in <i>klc4</i> mutant zebrafish, we show that KLC4 is required for stabilization of nascent axon branches, proper microtubule (MT) dynamics, and endosomal transport. Furthermore, KLC4 is required for proper tiling of peripheral axon arbors: in <i>klc4 </i>mutants, peripheral axons showed abnormal fasciculation, a behavior characteristic of central axons. This result suggests that KLC4 patterns axonal compartments and helps establish molecular differences between central and peripheral axons. Finally, we find that <i>klc4</i> mutant larva are hypersensitive to touch and adults show anxiety-like behavior in a novel tank test, implicating <i>klc4</i> as a new gene involved in stress response circuits.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Interoperability of RTN1A in dendrite dynamics and immune functions in human Langerhans cells</a></h4>

              
                Skin is an active immune organ where professional antigen-presenting cells such as epidermal Langerhans cells (LCs) link innate and adaptive immune responses. While Reticulon 1A (RTN1A) was recently identified in LCs and dendritic cells in cutaneous and lymphoid tissues of humans and mice, its function is still unclear. Here, we studied the involvement of this protein in cytoskeletal remodeling and immune responses toward pathogens by stimulation of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) in resident LCs (rLCs) and emigrated LCs (eLCs) in human epidermis ex vivo and in a transgenic THP-1 RTN1A<sup>+</sup> cell line. Hampering RTN1A functionality through an inhibitory antibody induced significant dendrite retraction of rLCs and inhibited their emigration. Similarly, expression of RTN1A in THP-1 cells significantly altered their morphology, enhanced aggregation potential, and inhibited the Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux. Differentiated THP-1 RTN1A<sup>+</sup> macrophages exhibited long cell protrusions and a larger cell body size in comparison to wild-type cells. Further, stimulation of epidermal sheets with bacterial lipoproteins (TLR1/2 and TLR2 agonists) and single-stranded RNA (TLR7 agonist) resulted in the formation of substantial clusters of rLCs and a significant decrease of RTN1A expression in eLCs. Together, our data indicate involvement of RTN1A in dendrite dynamics and structural plasticity of primary LCs. Moreover, we discovered a relation between activation of TLRs, clustering of LCs, and downregulation of RTN1A within the epidermis, thus indicating an important role of RTN1A in LC residency and maintaining tissue homeostasis.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Ligand-induced shifts in conformational ensembles that describe transcriptional activation</a></h4>

              
                Nuclear receptors function as ligand-regulated transcription factors whose ability to regulate diverse physiological processes is closely linked with conformational changes induced upon ligand binding. Understanding how conformational populations of nuclear receptors are shifted by various ligands could illuminate strategies for the design of synthetic modulators to regulate specific transcriptional programs. Here, we investigate ligand-induced conformational changes using a reconstructed, ancestral nuclear receptor. By making substitutions at a key position, we engineer receptor variants with altered ligand specificities. We combine cellular and biophysical experiments to characterize transcriptional activity, as well as elucidate mechanisms underlying altered transcription in receptor variants. We then use atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with enhanced sampling to generate ensembles of wildtype and engineered receptors in combination with multiple ligands, followed by conformational analysis and correlation of MD-based predictions with functional ligand profiles. We determine that conformational ensembles accurately describe ligand responses based on observed population shifts. These studies provide a platform which will allow structural characterization of physiologically-relevant conformational ensembles, as well as provide the ability to design and predict transcriptional responses in novel ligands.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Antiviral function and viral antagonism of the rapidly evolving dynein activating adapter NINL</a></h4>

              
                Viruses interact with the intracellular transport machinery to promote viral replication. Such host-virus interactions can drive host gene adaptation, leaving signatures of pathogen-driven evolution in host genomes. Here we leverage these genetic signatures to identify the dynein activating adaptor, ninein-like (NINL), as a critical component in the antiviral innate immune response and as a target of viral antagonism. Unique among genes en­­coding components of active dynein complexes, NINL has evolved under recurrent positive (diversifying) selection, particularly in its carboxy-terminal cargo binding region. Consistent with a role for NINL in host immunity, we demonstrate that NINL knockout cells exhibit an impaired response to interferon, resulting in increased permissiveness to viral replication. Moreover, we show that proteases encoded by diverse picornaviruses and coronaviruses cleave and disrupt NINL function in a host- and virus-specific manner. Our work reveals the importance of NINL in the antiviral response and the utility of using signatures of host-virus genetic conflicts to uncover new components of antiviral immunity and targets of viral antagonism.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The Na+/K+ pump dominates control of glycolysis in hippocampal dentate granule cells</a></h4>

              
                Cellular ATP that is consumed to perform energetically expensive tasks must be replenished by new ATP through the activation of metabolism. Neuronal stimulation, an energetically demanding process, transiently activates aerobic glycolysis, but the precise mechanism underlying this glycolysis activation has not been determined. We previously showed that neuronal glycolysis is correlated with Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, but is not activated by feedforward Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling (Díaz-García, Meyer, et al., 2021). Since ATP-powered Na<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> pumping activities are increased following stimulation to restore ion gradients and are estimated to consume most neuronal ATP, we aimed to determine if they are coupled to neuronal glycolysis activation. By using two-photon imaging of fluorescent biosensors and dyes in dentate granule cell somas of acute mouse hippocampal slices, we observed that production of cytoplasmic NADH, a byproduct of glycolysis, is strongly coupled to changes in intracellular Na<sup>+</sup>, while intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> could only increase NADH production if both forward Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchange and Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> pump activity were intact. Additionally, antidromic stimulation-induced intracellular [Na<sup>+</sup>] increases were reduced &gt;50% by blocking Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry. These results indicate that neuronal glycolysis activation is predominantly a response to an increase in activity of the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> pump, which is strongly potentiated by Na<sup>+</sup> influx through the Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchanger during extrusion of Ca<sup>2+</sup> following stimulation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Transversal functional connectivity and scene-specific processing in the human entorhinal-hippocampal circuitry</a></h4>

              
                Scene and object information reach the entorhinal-hippocampal circuitry in partly segregated cortical processing streams. Converging evidence suggests that such information-specific streams organize the cortical - entorhinal interaction and the circuitry's inner communication along the transversal axis of hippocampal subiculum and CA1. Here, we leveraged ultra-high field functional imaging and advance Maass, Berron et al. (2015) who report two functional routes segregating the entorhinal cortex (EC) and the subiculum. We identify entorhinal subregions based on preferential functional connectivity with perirhinal Area 35 and 36, parahippocampal and retrosplenial cortical sources (referred to as EC<sub>Area35-based</sub>, EC<sub>Area36-based</sub>, EC<sub>PHC-based</sub>, EC<sub>RSC-based</sub>, respectively). Our data show specific scene processing in the functionally connected EC<sub>PHC-based</sub> and distal subiculum. Another route, that functionally connects the EC<sub>Area35-based</sub> and a newly identified EC<sub>RSC-based</sub> with the subiculum/CA1 border, however, shows no selectivity between object and scene conditions. Our results are consistent with transversal information-specific pathways in the human entorhinal-hippocampal circuitry, with anatomically organized convergence of cortical processing streams and a unique route for scene information. Our study thus further characterizes the functional organization of this circuitry and its information-specific role in memory function.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">High resolution species assignment of Anopheles mosquitoes using k-mer distances on targeted sequences</a></h4>

              
                The ANOSPP amplicon panel is a genus-wide targeted sequencing panel to facilitate large-scale monitoring of <i>Anopheles</i> species diversity. Combining information from the 62 nuclear amplicons present in the ANOSPP panel allows for a more nuanced species assignment than single gene (e.g. COI) barcoding, which is desirable in the light of permeable species boundaries. Here, we present NNoVAE, a method using Nearest Neighbours (NN) and Variational Autoencoders (VAE), which we apply to <i>k-</i>mers resulting from the ANOSPP amplicon sequences in order to hierarchically assign species identity. The NN step assigns a sample to a species-group by comparing the <i>k</i>-mers arising from each haplotype’s amplicon sequence to a reference database. The VAE step is required to distinguish between closely related species, and also has sufficient resolution to reveal population structure within species. In tests on independent samples with over 80% amplicon coverage, NNoVAE correctly classifies to species level 98% of samples within the <i>An. gambiae </i>complex and 89% of samples outside the complex. We apply NNoVAE to over two thousand new samples from Burkina Faso and Gabon, identifying unexpected species in Gabon. NNoVAE presents an approach that may be of value to other targeted sequencing panels, and is a method that will be used to survey <i>Anopheles</i> species diversity and <i>Plasmodium</i> transmission patterns through space and time on a large scale, with plans to analyse half a million mosquitoes in the next five years.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The clock gene Per1 expression may exert diurnal control over hippocampal memory consolidation</a></h4>

              
                The circadian system influences many different biological processes, including memory performance. While the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) functions as the central pacemaker of the brain, satellite clocks have also been identified in other brain regions, such as the memory-relevant dorsal hippocampus. Although it is unclear how these satellite clocks contribute to brain function, one possibility is that they may serve to exert diurnal control over local processes. Within the hippocampus, for example, the local clock may contribute to time-of-day effects on memory. Here, we used the hippocampus-dependent Object Location Memory task to determine how memory is regulated across the day/night cycle in mice. First, we systematically determined which phase of memory (acquisition, consolidation, or retrieval) is modulated across the 24h day. We found that mice show better long-term memory performance during the day than at night, an effect that was specifically attributed to diurnal changes in memory consolidation, as neither memory acquisition nor memory retrieval fluctuated across the day/night cycle. Using RNA-sequencing we identified the circadian clock gene Period1 (Per1) as a key mechanism capable of supporting this diurnal fluctuation in memory consolidation, as Per1 oscillates in tandem with memory performance. We then show that local knockdown of Per1 within the dorsal hippocampus has no effect on either the circadian rhythm or sleep behavior, although previous work has shown this manipulation impairs memory. Thus, Per1 may independently function within the dorsal hippocampus to regulate memory in addition to its known role in regulating the circadian rhythm within the SCN. Per1 may therefore exert local diurnal control over memory consolidation within the dorsal hippocampus.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Therapeutic trial of anle138b in mouse models of genetic prion disease</a></h4>

              
                Phenotypic screening has yielded small molecule inhibitors of prion replication that are effective in vivo against certain prion strains but not others. Here we sought to test the small molecule anle138b in multiple mouse models of prion disease. In mice inoculated with the RML strain of prions, anle138b doubled survival and durably suppressed astrogliosis measured by live animal bioluminescence imaging. In knock-in mouse models of the D178N and E200K mutations that cause genetic prion disease, however, we were unable to identify a clear, quantifiable disease endpoint against which to measure therapeutic efficacy. Among untreated animals, the mutations did not impact overall survival, and bioluminescence remained low out to >20 months of age. Vacuolization and PrP deposition were observed in some brain regions in a subset of mutant animals, but appeared unable to carry the weight of a primary endpoint in a therapeutic study. We conclude that not all animal models of prion disease are suited to well-powered therapeutic efficacy studies, and care should be taken in choosing the models that will support drug development programs.

	<p>Although the introduction of HAART has completely changed the natural course of HIV infection, the number of chronic forms of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) has risen. It is estimated that up to half of subjects undergoing HAART therapy exhibit mild cognitive impairments. In the current study, we apply the gene co-expression network modular analysis, a well-established system biology approach, to the gene expression profiles of cases from the National NeuroAIDS Tissue Consortium (NNTC). We observed a negative enrichment for genes associated with the control of immune responses and putatively regulated by the transcription factors IRF8 and SPI1 and by both type I and II interferons. Our study provides evidence of altered immune responses, which are likely associated with the occurrence of HAND in the absence of HIV encephalitis (HIVE).</p>

	<p>Background: Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is used as treatment for auditory verbal hallucinations (AVH). The theory behind the treatment is that tDCS increases activity in prefrontal cognitive control areas, which are assumed to be hypoactive, and simultaneously decreases activity in temporal speech perception areas, which are assumed to be hyperactive during AVH. We tested this hypofrontal/hypertemporal reversal theory by investigating anatomical, neurotransmitter, brain activity, and network connectivity changes over the course of tDCS treatment. Methods: A double-blind, randomized controlled trial was conducted with 21 patients receiving either sham or real tDCS treatment (2 mA) twice daily for 5 days. The anode was placed over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and the cathode over the left temporo-parietal cortex (TPC). Multimodal neuroimaging as well as clinical and neurocognitive functioning assessment were performed before, immediately after, and three months after treatment. Results: We found a small reduction in AVH severity in the real tDCS group, but no corresponding neuroimaging changes in either DLPFCD or TPC. Limitations: The study has a small sample size. Conclusion: The results suggest that the currently leading theory behind tDCS treatment of AVH may need to be revised, if confirmed by studies with larger N. Tentative findings point to the involvement of Broca&amp;amp;rsquo;s area as a critical structure for tDCS treatment.</p>

	<p>Low-grade epilepsy-associated tumors (LEATs) are common in the temporal lobe and can cause drug-resistant epilepsy. Complete resection of LEATs is sufficient for seizure relief. However, hippocampal resection might result in postoperative cognitive impairment. This study aimed to clarify the necessity of hippocampal resection for seizure and cognitive outcomes in patients with temporal lobe LEATs and a normal hippocampus. The study included 32 patients with temporal lobe LEATs and without hippocampal abnormalities. All patients underwent gross total resection as treatment for drug-resistant epilepsy at our tertiary epilepsy center from 2005 to 2020, followed by at least a 12-month follow-up period. Seizure and cognitive outcomes were compared between patients who underwent additional hippocampal resection (Resected group) and those who did not (Preserved group). Among the participants, 14 underwent additional hippocampal resection and 28 (87.5%) achieved seizure freedom irrespective of hippocampal resection. The seizure-free periods were not different between the two groups. Additional hippocampal resection resulted in a significantly negative impact on the postoperative verbal index. In conclusion, additional hippocampal resection in patients with temporal lobe LEATs without hippocampal abnormalities is unnecessary because lesionectomy alone results in good seizure control. Additional hippocampal resection may instead adversely affect the postoperative language function.</p>

	<p>Motor function assessment is essential for post-stroke rehabilitation, while the requirement for professional therapists&amp;amp;rsquo; participation in current clinical assessment limits its availability to most patients. By means of sensors that collect the motion data and algorithms that conduct assessment based on such data, an automated system can be built to optimize the assessment process, benefiting both patients and therapists. To this end, this paper proposed an automated Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) upper extremity system covering all 30 voluntary items of the scale. RGBD sensors, together with force sensing resistor sensors were used to collect the patients&amp;amp;rsquo; motion information. Meanwhile, both machine learning and rule-based logic classification were jointly employed for assessment scoring. Clinical validation on 20 hemiparetic stroke patients suggests that this system is able to generate reliable FMA scores. There is an extremely high correlation coefficient (r = 0.981, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01) with that yielded by an experienced therapist. This study offers guidance and feasible solutions to a complete and independent automated assessment system.</p>

	<p>(1) Background: Major depressive disorder (MDD) generates a large proportion of global disease burden. Stereotactic radiofrequency ablation (SRA) may be beneficial for selected patients with its most debilitating and refractory forms, but effect size is uncertain. (2) Methods: A systematic literature review and meta-analysis on SRA for MDD was carried out. Patient-level data were extracted from articles reporting validated depression measures (Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Montgomery&amp;amp;ndash;&amp;amp;Aring;sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS)), pre- and at least six months post surgery. To accommodate different outcome measures, the standardised mean difference (SMD) between both scores was used as the principal effect size. Data were synthesised using a random-effects model. (3) Results: Five distinct studies were identified, comprising 116 patients (64 included in meta-analysis). Effect size comparing post- vs. pre-operative scores was 1.66 (CI 1.25&amp;amp;ndash;2.07). Anterior cingulotomy (two studies, n = 22) and anterior capsulotomy (three studies, n = 42) showed similar effect sizes: 1.51 (CI 0.82&amp;amp;ndash;2.20) vs. 1.74 (CI 1.23&amp;amp;ndash;2.26). Multiple procedures were performed in 30 of 116 (25.9%) patients. Based on patient-level data, 53% (n = 47) were responders (&amp;amp;ge;50% improvement), of which 34% reached remission (MADRS &amp;amp;le; 10 or BDI &amp;amp;le; 11). BDI mean improvement was 16.7 (44.0%) after a second procedure (n = 19). (4) Conclusions: The results are supportive of the benefit of SRA in selected patients with refractory MDD.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Family size desires and intentions in the lowest fertility region in Vietnam [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Vietnam's total fertility rate has been relatively stable around the replacement level since 2005. Meanwhile, fertility in the Southeast of Vietnam has always been far below the replacement level. As reproductive desires and intentions are important determinants of fertility, the article estimates family size desires and intentions in the Southeast and analyse related sociodemographic factors, contributing insights to the low fertility in this region. Methods: Based on data from a survey of people aged 18-45 in the Southeast in 2020, bivariate analysis and multinomial logistic regressions were applied to examine family size desires and intentions in this region.  Results: Most respondents want two (57.3%) or more (33.1%) children, and only 8.4% of them want to have fewer than two children. There are wide gaps within reproductive desires and intentions and the actual fertility. The mean intended family size is nearly 2.1, lower than the mean desired family size but much higher than the total fertility rate in 2020. Young people and unmarried females are more likely to have desires and intentions of fewer than two children. The most frequent reason for no intention of attaining desired family sizes is the fear of not having enough financial resources to raise their children as their expectations. Discussion and Conclusion: The low fertility in the Southeast of Vietnam is not due to a substantial decline in the value of children, but mainly because socioeconomic conditions are not favourable for having two or more children. In the current context in the Southeast, when most people of reproductive age still want and intend to have at least two children, support policies to reduce difficulties and obstacles to having would be much more effective in increasing the fertility rate than later when the desire of fewer than two children become more popular.

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Decreased Dorsomedial Striatum Direct Pathway Neuronal Activity Is Required for Learned Motor Coordination</a></h4>

              
                <p>It has been suggested that the dorsomedial striatum (DMS) is engaged in the early stages of motor learning for goal-directed actions, whereas at later stages, control is transferred to the dorsolateral striatum (DLS), a process that enables learned motor actions to become a skill or habit. It is not known whether these striatal regions are simultaneously active while the expertise is acquired. To address this question, we developed a mouse "Treadmill Training Task" that tracks changes in mouse locomotor coordination during running practice and simultaneously provides a means to measure local neuronal activity using photometry. To measure change in motor coordination over treadmill practice sessions, we used DeepLabCut (DLC) and custom-built code to analyze body position and paw movements. By evaluating improvements in motor coordination during training with simultaneous neuronal calcium activity in the striatum, we found that DMS direct pathway neurons exhibited decreased activity as the mouse gained proficiency at running. In contrast, direct pathway activity in the DLS was similar throughout training. Pharmacological blockade of D1 dopamine receptors in these subregions during task performance demonstrated that dopamine neurotransmission in the direct pathway activity is necessary for efficient motor coordination learning. These results provide new tools to measure changes in fine motor skills with simultaneous recordings of brain activity and reveal fundamental features of the neuronal substrates of motor learning.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Correcting the hebbian mistake: Toward a fully error-driven hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yicong Zheng, Xiaonan L. Liu, Satoru Nishiyama, Charan Ranganath, Randall C. O’Reilly</p>

The hippocampus plays a critical role in the rapid learning of new episodic memories. Many computational models propose that the hippocampus is an autoassociator that relies on Hebbian learning (i.e., “cells that fire together, wire together”). However, Hebbian learning is computationally suboptimal as it does not learn in a way that is driven toward, and limited by, the objective of achieving effective retrieval. Thus, Hebbian learning results in more interference and a lower overall capacity. Our previous computational models have utilized a powerful, biologically plausible form of error-driven learning in hippocampal CA1 and entorhinal cortex (EC) (functioning as a sparse autoencoder) by contrasting local activity states at different phases in the theta cycle. Based on specific neural data and a recent abstract computational model, we propose a new model called Theremin (Total Hippocampal ERror MINimization) that extends error-driven learning to area CA3—the mnemonic heart of the hippocampal system. In the model, CA3 responds to the EC monosynaptic input prior to the EC disynaptic input through dentate gyrus (DG), giving rise to a temporal difference between these two activation states, which drives error-driven learning in the EC→CA3 and CA3↔CA3 projections. In effect, DG serves as a teacher to CA3, correcting its patterns into more pattern-separated ones, thereby reducing interference. Results showed that Theremin, compared with our original Hebbian-based model, has significantly increased capacity and learning speed. The model makes several novel predictions that can be tested in future studies.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Co-occurring anthropogenic stressors reduce the timeframe of environmental viability for the world’s coral reefs</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Renee O. Setter, Erik C. Franklin, Camilo Mora</p>

Anthropogenic disturbances are posing unprecedented challenges to the persistence of ecosystems worldwide. The speed at which these disturbances reach an ecosystem’s tolerance thresholds will determine the time available for adaptation and conservation. Here, we aim to calculate the year after which a given environmental stressor permanently exceeds the bounds of an ecosystem’s tolerance. Ecosystem thresholds are here defined as limits in a given stressor beyond which ecosystems have showed considerable changes in community assembly and functioning, becoming remnants of what they once were, but not necessarily leading to species extirpation or extinction. Using the world’s coral reefs as a case example, we show that the projected effects of marine heatwaves, ocean acidification, storms, land-based pollution, and local human stressors are being underestimated considerably by looking at disturbances independently. Given the spatial complementarity in which numerous disturbances impact the world’s coral reefs, we show that the timelines of environmental suitability are halved when all disturbances are analyzed simultaneously, as opposed to independently. Under business-as-usual scenarios, the median year after which environmental conditions become unsuitable for the world’s remaining coral reefs was, at worse, 2050 for any one disturbance alone (28 years left); but when analyzed concurrently, this date was shortened to 2035 (13 years left). When analyzed together, disturbances reduced the date of environmental suitability because areas that may remain suitable under one disturbance could become unsuitable by any of several other variables. The significance of co-occurring disturbances at reducing timeframes of environmental suitability was evident even under optimistic scenarios. The best-case scenario, characterized by strong mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions and optimistic human development, resulted in 41% of global coral reefs with unsuitable conditions by 2100 under any one disturbance independently; yet when analyzed in combination up to 64% of the world’s coral reefs could face unsuitable environmental conditions by one disturbance or another. Under the worst-case scenario, nearly all coral reef ecosystems worldwide (approximately 99%) will permanently face unsuitable conditions by 2055 in at least one of the disturbances analyzed. Prior studies have indicated the projected dire effects of climate change on coral reefs by mid-century; by analyzing a multitude of projected disturbances, our study reveals a much more severe prognosis for the world’s coral reefs as they have significantly less time to adapt while highlighting the urgent need to tackle available solutions to human disturbances.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Potential of in vivo stress reporter models to reduce animal use and provide mechanistic insights in toxicity studies [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Chemical risk assessment ensures protection from the toxic effects of drugs and manmade chemicals. To comply with regulatory guidance, studies in complex organisms are required, as well as mechanistic studies to establish the relevance of any toxicities observed to man. Although in vitro toxicity models are improving, in vivo studies remain central to this process. Such studies are invariably time-consuming and often involve large numbers of animals. New regulatory frameworks recommend the implementation of “smart” in vivo approaches to toxicity testing that can effectively assess safety for humans and comply with societal expectations for reduction in animal use. A major obstacle in reducing the animals required is the time-consuming and complexity of the pathological endpoints used as markers of toxicity. Such endpoints are prone to inter-animal variability, subjectivity and require harmonisation between testing sites. As a consequence, large numbers of animals per experimental group are required. To address this issue, we propose the implementation of sophisticated stress response reporter mice that we have developed. These reporter models provide early biomarkers of toxic potential in a highly reproducible manner at single-cell resolution, which can also be measured non-invasively and have been extensively validated in academic research as early biomarkers of stress responses for a wide range of chemicals at human-relevant exposures. In this report, we describe a new and previously generated models in our lab, provide the methodology required for their use and discuss how they have been used to inform on toxic risk. We propose our in vivo approach is more informative (refinement) and reduces the animal use (reduction) compared to traditional toxicity testing. These models could be incorporated into tiered toxicity testing and used in combination with in vitro assays to generate quantitative adverse outcome pathways and inform on toxic potential.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Characterization of virulence factors and antibiotic resistance pattern of uropathogenic Escherichia coli strains in a tertiary care center [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Urinary tract infections (UTI) are the most prevalent bacterial infection in humans. The uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) expresses a range of virulence factors that contribute to their pathogenicity. The emergence of multidrug resistance (MDR)-associated UTI is increasing. This study monitors the distribution of virulence factors among UPEC strains to note the antibiogram, outcome and type of associated UTI. Methods: A prospective cross-sectional time-bound study of six months was done on clinically significant urinary isolates of Escherichia coli. Detection of haemolysin production and serum resistance was done by phenotypic methods. Genotypic characterization of the virulence genes (papC, iutA, hlyA, cnf1) was done by multiplex PCR. Demographic data, clinical history, antibiogram and type of UTI was collected from clinical case records. Results:75 E.coli isolates from patients with suspected UTIs were included. Females had a higher preponderance of UTI (66.7%). 93% of patients were adults and the remaining 7% were from paediatrics.  24 (32%) isolates showed haemolysis by plate haemolysis and all isolates were serum-resistant. Out of 75 isolates, 65 were positive for at least one of four targeted genes, while remaining ten isolates were negative for all four genes. Multidrug resistance was found in 40 (53.3%) isolates. 97.4% of the UTI cases had a favourable clinical outcome at discharge. Mortality due to urosepsis was 2.6%. Conclusion: Association of hemolysin production with resistance to imipenem and norfloxacin in UPEC strains was significant. Presence of hlyA gene is positively associated with ceftazidime resistance. Nitrofurantoin, piperacillin, tazobactam, and cefaperazone sulbactam are possible candidates for empirical therapy of UTIs. Drugs like aminoglycosides, carbapenems and fosfomycin may be used as reserve drugs in the treatment of MDR-UTI. However, inappropriate usage can increase antibiotic resistance. Hence proper selection of antibiotics in hospitals taking into account the local antibiogram is needed to reduce the emergence of antibiotic resistance.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Trans‐synaptic degeneration following acute optic neuritis in multiple sclerosis</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Explore longitudinal changes in brain volumetric measures and retinal layer thicknesses following acute optic neuritis (AON) in people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS), to investigate the process of trans-synaptic degeneration and determine its clinical relevance.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>PwMS were recruited within 40 days of AON onset (n=49) and underwent baseline retinal optical coherence tomography (OCT) and brain MRI followed by longitudinal tracking for up to 5 years. A comparator cohort of PwMS without a recent episode of AON were similarly tracked (n=73). Mixed-effects linear regression models were used.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Accelerated atrophy of the occipital gray matter (GM), calcarine GM, and thalamus was seen in the AON cohort, as compared to the non-AON cohort (-0.76% versus -0.22% per year [p=0.01] for occipital GM, -1.83% versus -0.32% per year [p=0.008] for calcarine GM, -1.17% versus -0.67% per year [p=0.02] for thalamus), while rates of whole brain, cortical GM, non-occipital cortical GM atrophy and T2 lesion accumulation did not differ significantly between the cohorts. In the AON cohort, greater AON-induced reduction in ganglion cell+inner plexiform layer (GCIPL) thickness over the first year was associated with faster rates of whole brain (r=0.32, p=0.04), white matter (r=0.32, p=0.04) and thalamic (r=0.36, p=0.02) atrophy over the study period. Significant relationships were identified between faster atrophy of the subcortical GM and thalamus, with worse visual function outcomes after AON.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These results provide <i>in-vivo</i> evidence for anterograde trans-synaptic degeneration following AON in PwMS, and suggest that trans-synaptic degeneration may be related to clinically-relevant visual outcomes.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Olfactory neuron Prokineticin‐2 as a potential target in Parkinson's disease</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To outline dynamics of Prokineticin-2 pathway in relation to clinical-pathological features of Parkinson’s disease by examining olfactory neurons of patients.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Thirty-eight patients (26 <i>de novo</i>, newly diagnosed) and 31 sex/age-matched healthy controls underwent non-invasive mucosa brushing for olfactory neurons collection, and standard clinical assessment. Gene expression levels of Prokineticin-2, Prokineticin-2 receptors type 1 and 2, and Prokineticin-2-long peptide were measured in olfactory neurons by Real Time-PCR; moreover, the Prokineticin-2 protein and α-synuclein species (total and oligomeric) were quantified by immunofluorescence staining.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Prokineticin-2 expression was significantly increased in Parkinson’s disease. <i>De novo</i> patients had higher Prokineticin-2 levels, directly correlated with MDS-UPDRS pars III motor score. Also oligomeric α-synuclein was higher in Parkinson’s disease and directly correlated with Prokineticin-2 protein levels. Total α-synuclein did not differ between patients and controls.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Prokineticin-2 is a chemokine showing neuroprotective effects in experimental models of Parkinson’s disease, but translational proofs of its role in patients is still lacking. Here, we used olfactory neurons as the ideal tissue to analyse molecular stages of neurodegeneration <i>in vivo</i>, providing unprecedented evidence that Prokineticin-2 pathway is activated in Parkinson’s patients. Specifically, Prokineticin-2 expression in olfactory neurons was higher at early disease stages, proportional to motor severity, and associated with oligomeric α-synuclein accumulation. These data, consistently with preclinical findings, support Prokineticin-2 as candidate target in Parkinson’s disease, and validate reliability of olfactory neurons to reflect pathological changes of the disease.</p>

                Background: The “drive by wire” mechanism for managing the throttle is not applied to every modern motorcycle, but it is often managed through a steel wire. Here, there is a cam on the throttle control. Its shape allows the throttle opening to be faster or slower and its angle of rotation, required for full opening, to be greater or less. The maximum angle a rider's wrist can withstand depends on numerous musculoskeletal mobility factors, often limited by falls or surgery. Methods: Using a Progrip knob with interchangeable cams allows the customization of a special cam profile, to ensure the best engine response to throttle rotation and ergonomics for the rider. The use of FEA software and lattice structures, allows to realize a lightweight and efficient design, targeted for fabrication with additive manufacturing technologies. Results: The cam was manufactured by exploiting MSLA technology. Finally, a dimensional inspection procedure was performed before assembly. The main result is to have obtained a lighter and cheaper component than the original. Conclusions: This study has allowed the design of a mechanical component consisting of innovative shape, light weight, and ergonomics. Furthermore, it demonstrates the effectiveness in the use of lattice structures to enable weight optimization of a component while minimizing the increase in its compliance.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Responses of chemosensory perception to stimulation of the human brain</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Significant advances have been made in our understanding of the neural substrates of human chemosensory processing, involving the piriform cortex, insula and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). However, the important and challenging issues are to localize the brain regions with high anatomic precision that can causally produce chemosensory perception and further delineate the topography of different classifications of chemosensory perception.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We quantitatively measured subjective responses of chemosensory perception to intracranial electrical stimulation over the brain in neurosurgical patients (n = 302) with medically refractory epilepsy.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The chemosensory perceptions including olfaction, gustation and chemesthesis were elicited in 21 of 302 patients (7%). Chemosensory responses were evoked in 53 (0.2%) of 21,661 stimulated sites. The highest response rate (1.8%) was in the insula (37/2,051 stimulated sites from 15/163 patients). The chemosensory perception emerged predominantly during stimulations of the insula along the central sulcus axis. Notably, there existed a distinct pattern that the anteroventral insula predominately represented orthonasal olfaction, while different chemosensory modalities converged in the mid-dorsal insula.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This study provided a detailed characterization of chemosensory perception across the brain, especially in the insula. These results suggest that the cortex along the banks of the central sulcus of the insula may play a role in producing the supramodal sensation of flavor. It also indicates that dysfunction of the central insula should be considered during the evaluation of chemosensory-related epileptic seizures.</p>

     alt="Loss of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-receptor 1 and TNF-receptor 2 partially replicate effects of TNF deficiency on dendritic spines of granule cells in mouse dentate gyrus"/>
<p>Hippocampal granule cells of adult mice lacking canonical TNF-Rs were filled with Alexa568 and immunolabeled for Synaptopodin. Morphometric analysis of their spines revealed that TNF-R mutants partially replicate changes previously reported for TNF-deficient mice. Since TNF tunes network excitability via TNF-Rs, TNF deficiency and altered TNF-R-signaling may cause morphological spine changes. 

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is involved in the regulation of physiological and pathophysiological processes in the central nervous system. In previous work, we showed that mice lacking constitutive levels of TNF exhibit a reduction in spine density and changes in spine head size distribution of dentate granule cells. Here, we investigated which TNF-receptor pathway is responsible for this phenotype and analyzed granule cell spine morphology in TNF-R1-, TNF-R2-, and TNF-R1/R2-deficient mice. Single granule cells were filled with Alexa568 in fixed hippocampal brain slices and immunostained for the actin-modulating protein synaptopodin (SP), a marker for strong and stable spines. An investigator blind to genotype investigated dendritic spines using deconvolved confocal image stacks. Similar to TNF-deficient mice, TNF-R1 and TNF-R2 mutants showed a decrease in the size of small spines (SP−negative) with TNF-R1/R2-KO mice exhibiting an additive effect. TNF-R1 mutants also showed an increase in the size of large spines (SP−positive), mirroring the situation in TNF-deficient mice. Unlike the TNF-deficient mouse, none of the TNF-R mutants exhibited a reduction in their granule cell spine densities. Since TNF tunes the excitability of networks, lack of constitutive TNF reduces network excitation. This may explain why we observed alterations in spine head size distributions in TNF- and TNF-R-deficient granule cells. The changes in spine density observed in the TNF-deficient mouse could not be linked to canonical TNF-R-signaling. Instead, noncanonical pathways or unknown developmental functions of TNF may cause this phenomenon.</p>

<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The melanocortin system is a key regulator of appetite and food intake in vertebrates. This system includes the neuropeptides neuropeptide y (NPY), agouti-related peptide (AGRP), cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART), and pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC). An important center for appetite control in mammals is the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus, with neurons that coexpress either the orexigenic NPY/AGRP or the anorexigenic CART/POMC neuropeptides. In ray-finned fishes, such a center is less characterized. The Atlantic salmon (<i>Salmo salar</i>) has multiple genes of these neuropeptides due to whole-genome duplication events. To better understand the potential involvement of the melanocortin system in appetite and food intake control, we have mapped the mRNA expression of <i>npy</i>, <i>agrp</i>, <i>cart</i>, and <i>pomc</i> in the brain of Atlantic salmon parr using in situ hybridization. After identifying hypothalamic mRNA expression, we investigated the possible intracellular coexpression of <i>npy/agrp</i> and <i>cart/pomc</i> in the tuberal hypothalamus by fluorescent in situ hybridization. The results showed that the neuropeptides were widely distributed, especially in sensory and neuroendocrine brain regions. In the hypothalamic lateral tuberal nucleus, the putative homolog to the mammalian arcuate nucleus, <i>npya</i>, <i>agrp1</i>, <i>cart2b</i>, and <i>pomca</i> were predominantly localized in distinct neurons; however, some neurons coexpressed <i>cart2b/pomca</i>. This is the first demonstration of coexpression of <i>cart2b/pomca</i> in the tuberal hypothalamus of a teleost. Collectively, our data suggest that the lateral tuberal nucleus is the center for appetite control in salmon, similar to that of mammals. Extrahypothalamic brain regions might also be involved in regulating food intake, including the olfactory bulb, telencephalon, midbrain, and hindbrain.</p>

                <img src="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/06a83ccd-db36-445c-8073-cf9040cae9b3/cne25423-gra-0001-m.png"
     alt="Chromatic organization of retinal photoreceptors during eye migration of Atlantic halibut (Hippoglossus hippoglossus)"/>
<p>Flatfishes undergo a pronounced metamorphosis whereby a bilateral, pelagic larva transforms into a flattened, benthic juvenile with both eyes on the same side of the head. The changes in photoreceptor visual pigment protein (opsin) expression during this period of eye migration are unknown. Here, we describe the chromatic organization of photoreceptors during eye migration using antibodies that label blue (SWS2) opsin, and green (RH) and red (LWS) opsins simultaneously. Our results reveal opsin co-expression within individual cone photoreceptors and a gradient in SWS2-expressing cones that may guide the creation of the square mosaic from an hexagonal mosaic.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The retinas of fishes often have single and double cone photoreceptors that are organized in lattice-like mosaics. In flatfishes experiencing eye migration (i.e., the metamorphic process whereby one eye migrates to the other side of the head), the hexagonal lattice of single cones present in the larva undergoes major restructuring resulting in a dominant square mosaic postmetamorphosis consisting of four double cones surrounding each single cone. The expression of different opsin types during eye migration has not been examined despite its importance in understanding photoreceptor plasticity and whether cell fate (in terms of spectral phenotype) could influence square mosaic formation. Here, we probed the retina of Atlantic halibut undergoing eye migration for opsin expression using two antibodies, AHblue and AB5407, that labeled short wavelength sensitive 2 (SWS2) opsin and longer wavelength (predominantly middle wavelength sensitive, RH2) opsins, respectively. Throughout the retina, double and triple cones labeled with AB5407 exclusively, whereas the vast majority of single cones labeled with AHblue. A minority (&lt;5%) of single cones in the square mosaic of the centroventral retina labeled with AB5407. In regions of mosaic transition and near peripheral growth zones, some single cones co-expressed at least two opsins as they labeled with both antibodies. Short wavelength (SWS2 expressing, or S) cones formed a nonrandom mosaic gradient from central to dorsal retina in a region dominated by the larval single cone mosaic. Our results demonstrate the expression of at least two opsins throughout the postmetamorphic retina and suggest opsin switching as a mechanism to create new cone spectral phenotypes. In addition, the S cone gradient at the onset of eye migration may underlie a plastic, cell induction mechanism by which a cone's phenotype determines that of its neighbors and the formation of the square mosaic.</p>

     alt="In vivo tracking of KCC2b expression during early brain development"/><p>We used CRISPR/Cas9 transgenesis to generate a KCC2b:mCitrine fluorescence reporter zebrafish line and characterized KCC2b regional distribution and dynamics in vivo during early brain development. We demonstrate KCC2b expression in postmigration stage neurons and suppression of KCC2b expression by exposure to bisphenol-A. KCC2b:mCitrine zebrafish present a new method for visualizing this protein's complex dynamics during brain development and screening compounds aimed at modulating chloride homeostasis through KCC2b.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The neuronal chloride (Cl−) exporter, KCC2, regulates neuron excitability and development and undergoes a stereotypical pattern of delayed upregulation as neurons mature. KCC2 upregulation favors neural inhibition by establishing a negative Cl− gradient, ensuring GABA-induced Cl− currents are inward and inhibitory. We developed a zebrafish fluorescent reporter line, KCC2b:mCitrine, to track KCC2 expression in vivo during early brain development. KCC2b:mCitrine was first detected at 16 h postfertilization and by day 6 labeled most central and peripheral neurons and processes. At 20 h, expression was greatest in the soma-dense basal neuroepithelium but largely absent in apical and mantle zones where differentiation and migration primarily occur, and time lapse imaging at this stage supports a postmigration upregulation of KCC2b. Central dopamine neurons showed low KCC2b expression as observed in other species. KCC2b:mCitrine fluorescence was stable over minutes in most neurons, but brightness transients observed in single cells fit our expectation for real-time tracking of KCC2b upregulation in new neurons. To further assess whether fluorescence brightness tracks KCC2b expression, zebrafish embryos were exposed to bisphenol-A (BPA), which is known to suppress KCC2 expression. Fluorescence decreased after 6 days of BPA exposure but not after 2 or 4 days, suggesting that it is an accurate but delayed indicator of KCC2b expression. KCC2b:mCitrine zebrafish present a new method for visualizing KCC2b's complex dynamics during brain development, and potentially screening compounds aimed at modulating KCC2 expression.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Estrogen receptor β activation inhibits colitis by promoting NLRP6-mediated autophagy</a></h4>

              
                Fan et al. show that ERβ can directly transactivate Nlrp6 gene expression via binding to the Nlrp6 promoter and regulate NLRP6 inflammasome assembly. Activated NLRP6 inflammasome induces autophagy by separately interacting with autophagy proteins and stimulates autophagy suppressed inflammatory response by clearing redundant inflammasome ligands, cytokines, and damaged mitochondria.

                Wang et al. demonstrate that a PARP inhibitor used to treat breast tumors with homologous recombination (HR) deficiency reprograms the HR-proficient macrophages in the tumor microenvironment toward an anti-tumor phenotype. Blocking the “don’t-eat-me” signal on tumor cells with anti-CD47 antibodies enhances the therapeutic efficacy of olaparib in a mouse model.

                Di Gesù, Matz et al. find that maternal high-fat diet results in intergenerational (F1, F2), but not transgenerational (F3), descendant social dysfunction. Metataxonomic sequencing and fecal microbiota transplant data implicate dysbiosis of the maternal gut microbiome in intergenerational social deficits, which can be restored by post-weaning Limosilactobacillus reuteri-6475 supplementation.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">The tempo and mode of gene regulatory programs during bacterial infection</a></h4>

              
                Avital et al. show that bacterial infection induces discrete transcriptomic states in macrophages that correspond to different response functions. One of these states captures inflammatory activation characterized by four gene modules. The dynamics of this inflammatory trajectory can be impacted by modulation of bacterial stimulus, infection duration, and presence of toxins.

                Donker et al. show that epithelia adapt their rate of cell division to fluctuations in cell number by sensing corresponding changes in intercellular forces. These forces are transduced by E-cadherin adhesions to control cell-cycle progression through G2 phase via regulation of the kinase Wee1 and downstream inhibition of Cdk1.

                Webster et al. show that the transcriptional response to starvation is mounted early in larval somatic cells supporting survival but that it wanes over time. In contrast, they show that the germline remains transcriptionally quiescent deep into starvation, supporting reproductive potential, while maintaining its transcriptome via transcript stability.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Novel multicellular prokaryote discovered next to an underground stream</a></h4>

              
                A diversity of prokaryotes currently exhibit multicellularity with different generation mechanisms in a variety of contexts of ecology on Earth. In the present study, we report a new type of multicellular bacterium, HS-3, isolated from an underground stream. HS-3 self-organizes its filamentous cells into a layer-structured colony with the properties of a nematic liquid crystal. After maturation, the colony starts to form a semi-closed sphere accommodating clusters of coccobacillus daughter cells and selectively releases them upon contact with water. This is the first report that shows that a liquid-crystal status of cells can support the prokaryotic multicellular behavior. Importantly, the observed behavior of HS-3 suggests that the recurrent intermittent exposure of colonies to water flow in the cave might have been the ecological context that cultivated the evolutionary transition from unicellular to multicellular life. This is the new extant model that underpins theories regarding a role of ecological context in the emergence of multicellularity.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A single cell transcriptional roadmap of human pacemaker cell differentiation</a></h4>

              
                Each heartbeat is triggered by the sinoatrial node (SAN), the primary pacemaker of the heart. Studies in animal models have revealed that pacemaker cells share a common progenitor with the (pro)epicardium, and that the pacemaker cardiomyocytes further diversify into ‘transitional’, ‘tail’, and ‘head’ subtypes. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms, especially of human pacemaker cell development, are poorly understood. Here, we performed single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and trajectory inference on human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) differentiating to SAN-like cardiomyocytes (SANCMs) to construct a roadmap of transcriptional changes and lineage decisions. In differentiated SANCM, we identified distinct clusters that closely resemble different subpopulations of the in vivo SAN. Moreover, the presence of a side population of proepicardial cells suggested their shared ontogeny with SANCM, as also reported in vivo. Our results demonstrate that the divergence of SANCM and proepicardial lineages is determined by WNT signaling. Furthermore, we uncovered roles for TGFβ and WNT signaling in the branching of transitional and head SANCM subtypes, respectively. These findings provide new insights into the molecular processes involved in human pacemaker cell differentiation, opening new avenues for complex disease modeling in vitro and inform approaches for cell therapy-based regeneration of the SAN.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Cannabinoid signaling modulation through JZL184 restores key phenotypes of a mouse model for Williams–Beuren syndrome</a></h4>

              
                Williams–Beuren syndrome (WBS) is a rare genetic multisystemic disorder characterized by mild-to-moderate intellectual disability and hypersocial phenotype, while the most life-threatening features are cardiovascular abnormalities. Nowadays, there are no pharmacological treatments to directly ameliorate the main traits of WBS. The endocannabinoid system (ECS), given its relevance for both cognitive and cardiovascular function, could be a potential druggable target in this syndrome. We analyzed the components of the ECS in the complete deletion (CD) mouse model of WBS and assessed the impact of its pharmacological modulation in key phenotypes relevant for WBS. CD mice showed the characteristic hypersociable phenotype with no preference for social novelty and poor short-term object-recognition performance. Brain cannabinoid type-1 receptor (CB1R) in CD male mice showed alterations in density and coupling with no detectable change in main endocannabinoids. Endocannabinoid signaling modulation with subchronic (10 days) JZL184, a selective inhibitor of monoacylglycerol lipase, specifically normalized the social and cognitive phenotype of CD mice. Notably, JZL184 treatment improved cardiovascular function and restored gene expression patterns in cardiac tissue. These results reveal the modulation of the ECS as a promising novel therapeutic approach to improve key phenotypic alterations in WBS.
