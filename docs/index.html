                We developed a new time-calibrated tree incorporating primarily endemic along with some cryptic Ryukyu islands cicada data, following the recent publication of global cicada data by Marshall et al. (2018), Łukasik et al. (2018), Simon et al. (2019), Price et al. (2019), and Hill et al. (2021).  A total of 352 specimens were analyzed using BEAST v1. X software with a relaxed clock model. Fossil calibrations as old as Triassic were adopted largely following Johnson et al. (2018) and Moulds (2018), and a Quaternary geological event calibration was adopted following Osozawa et al. (2012, 2021b) and input into BEAST v1. X. Our timetree suggests that Tettigarctidae had a cicada basal lineage as old as 200.63 Ma, with Derotettiginae the next oldest lineage at 99.2 Ma. Tibicininae is a sister of the remaining subfamilies of Tettigomyiinae, Cicadettinae, and Cicadidae, and their species level differentiation and radiation began at 40.57 Ma. The Cicadinae clade consists of specific tribes with paraphyletic relationship, and the vicariance and adaptive radiation generated many cryptic species in each tribe. We estimated base substitution rate as a function of age, and the result strongly indicates an exponential increase of base substitution rate in recent geologic time. The consequent increase in cicada biodiversity, including generation of cryptic species in the Ryukyu Islands and surroundings, may have been driven by the generation and spreading of C4 grasses and coeval Quaternary climate change.

     alt="Fish That Fish for Fish—A Peculiar Location of “Fishing Motoneurons” in the Striated Frogfish Antennarius striatus"/>
<p>The first dorsal fin of frogfish is used to attract fish as prey and not involved in swimming. Motoneurons for the first dorsal fin (fishing motoneurons) are distributed in the dorsolateral zone of ventral horn, while those for the second, third, and fourth dorsal fins of frogfish, and first dorsal fin of filefish are present in the ventrolateral zone. Fishing motoneurons presumably assume this peculiar position in concert with the evolution of fishing behavior by the first dorsal fin. 

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>In lophiform teleosts, the first dorsal fin has evolved as a specialized structure called the “illicium” equipped with the esca, which is a modified skin flap used to attract small fish for predation. The motor control system of the illicium, however, remained unknown. The present study investigated the innervation of muscles for the illicium and morphology of motoneurons innervating them in the striated frogfish <i>Antennarius striatus</i>. We found that the dorsal ramus of occipital nerve innervates the muscles. Motoneurons for the illicium are present in the dorsolateral zone of ventral horn at the medullo-spinal boundary level, forming a cluster somewhat distinct from other motoneurons of the ventral horn. Motoneurons for the second to fourth dorsal fins and pectoral fin were located in the ventrolateral and ventromedial zones of ventral horn, respectively, whereas those of the dorsal trunk muscle in the dorsomedial zone of ventral horn. Motoneurons for the first dorsal spine of white-spotted pygmy filefish were also investigated for species comparison and were found to locate in the ventrolateral zone of ventral horn, similarly to the motoneurons for the second to fourth dorsal fins of the frogfish. These results suggest that motoneurons for the illicium have become segregated from other motoneurons to be situated in an unusual dorsal position for a motoneuron pool of a dorsal fin, in concert with the evolution of specialized “fishing behavior” performed by the illicium.</p>

<p>This study shows CART-expressing elements in the brain, spinal cord, and retina of a gecko, <i>Hemidactylus leschenaultii</i>. Two putative bioactive CART peptides in this gecko showed several similarities with the avian and mammalian CART. Arcuate nucleus CART neurons were organized into two distinct subdivisions, but only those in the dorsal part responded to NPY via Y<sub>1</sub>-receptor agonist treatment. Conserved neuroanatomy and interaction with NPY suggest CART as an essential molecule and a regulator of energy balance in <i>H. leschenaultii</i>. 

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Neuropeptide cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) is widely expressed in the brains of teleosts, amphibians, birds, and mammals and has emerged as a conserved regulator of energy balance across these vertebrate phyla. However, as yet, there is no information on CART in the reptilian brain. We characterized the cDNA encoding CART and mapped CART-containing elements in the brain of gecko, <i>Hemidactylus leschenaultii</i> (<i>hl</i>) using a specific anti-CART antiserum. We report a 683-bp <i>hlcart</i> transcript containing a 336-bp open reading frame, which encodes a putative 111-amino acid hl-preproCART. The 89-amino acid hl-proCART generated from hl-preproCART produced two putative bioactive hl-CART-peptides. These bioactive CART-peptides were &gt; 93% similar with those in rats/humans. Although reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) detected <i>hlcart</i>-transcript in the brain, CART-containing neurons/fibers were widely distributed in the telencephalon, diencephalon, mesencephalon, rhombencephalon, spinal cord, and retina. The mitral cells in olfactory bulb, neurons in the paraventricular, periventricular, arcuate (Arc), Edinger–Westphal, and brainstem nuclei were intensely CART-positive. In view of antagonistic roles of neuropeptide Y (NPY) and CART in energy balance in the framework of mammalian hypothalamus, we probed CART–NPY interaction in the hypothalamus of <i>H. leschenaultii</i>. Double immunofluorescence showed a dense NPY-innervation of Arc CART neurons. <i>Ex vivo</i> hypothalamic slices treated with NPY/NPY-Y<sub>1</sub>-receptor agonist significantly reduced <i>hlcart</i>-mRNA levels in the Arc-containing tissues and CART-ir in the dorsal-Arc. However, CART-ir in ventral-Arc was unaffected. NPY via Y<sub>1</sub>-receptors may regulate energy balance by inhibiting dArc CART neurons. This study on CART in a reptilian brain fills the current void in literature and underscores the conserved feature of the neuropeptide across the entire vertebrate phyla.</p>

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Rat strains differ in physiology, behavior, and recovery after central nervous system injury. To assess these differences, we compared the gross and local anatomy and neuromorphology of the lumbar spinal cord of the Wistar and Dark Agouti (DA) strains. The key findings include (i) distinct spatial relationships between vertebrae and spinal segments in the two strains; (ii) Wistar rats have larger volumes of spinal cord gray and white matter; (iii) DA rats have smaller total neuronal populations, thus indicating an expectation of smaller local neuronal populations; (iv) this expectation was confirmed for interneurons expressing calbindin 28 kDa. But contrary to expectations, (v) DA rats had more numerous populations of the interneurons expressing parvalbumin and a population of α-motoneurons. Consequently, these strains displayed divergent ratios in specific spinal neuronal populations. Researchers should consider these inter-strain differences when comparing data across different strains.</p>

">Computational neurodevelopment: infant decision-making in changing environments</a></h4>

              
                In recognition of the fact that most psychiatric conditions have neurodevelopmental origins, there is an increasing interest in applying the methodological and conceptual approaches from computational psychiatry to developmental cohorts. However, the challenge of acquiring and modelling behavioural responses in very young infants has thus far proven difficult to overcome. To address this we developed a novel gaze-contingent, cued-reversal paradigm that allowed 6-10 month old infants to make overt behavioural responses to assess learning of expectations and updating of behaviour in response to change. We then fit computational models to infant behaviour and, for the first time, were able to validate the winning model to the same standards as would be expected of adults (e.g. good parameter recoverability, model identifiability and simulated behavioural responses). Similar to prior findings in adults, model-based prediction error measures correlated with post-switch increases in pupil size; consistent with noradrenaline's hypothesised role in learning about change. Data-driven clustering based on model parameters revealed two infant behavioural subtypes hidden within the data; one with a perseverating profile and the other with a more exploratory decision-making pattern. This approach sheds new light on the classic finding that all infants under 12 months tend to perseverate. Crucially, there were no significant differences in age between the clusters, but differences in terms of adaptive skills and temperament measured via gold-standard developmental assessments. These results prime the field for infant computational psychiatry, demonstrating that we can reliably fit models to infant data and that the parameters from such models can identify subgroups with distinct cognitive profiles that are superior to those derived from the behavioural data alone.

                <p>by Yi Luo, Terry Lohrenz, Ellen A. Lumpkin, P. Read Montague, Kenneth T. Kishida</p>

Expectations shape our perception, profoundly influencing how we interpret the world. Positive expectations about sensory stimuli can alleviate distress and reduce pain (e.g., placebo effect), while negative expectations may heighten anxiety and exacerbate pain (e.g., nocebo effect). To investigate the impact of the (an)hedonic aspect of expectations on subjective experiences, we measured neurobehavioral responses to the taste of hot sauce among participants with heterogeneous taste preferences. By identifying participants who “liked” versus those who strongly “disliked” spicy flavors and by providing contextual cues about the spiciness of the sauce to be tasted, we dissociated the effects of positive and negative expectations from sensory stimuli (i.e., visual and gustatory stimuli), which were the same across all participants. Our results indicate that positive expectations lead to modulations in the intensity of subjective experience. These modulations were accompanied by increased activity in brain regions previously linked to information integration and the placebo effect, including the anterior insula, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, as well as a predefined “pleasure signature.” In contrast, negative expectations decreased hedonic experience and increased neural activity in the previously validated “Neurological Pain Signature” network. These findings demonstrate that hedonic aspects of one’s expectations asymmetrically shape how the brain processes sensory input and associated behavioral reports of one’s subjective experiences of intensity, pleasure, and pain. Our results suggest a dissociable impact of hedonic information: positive expectations facilitate higher-level information integration and reward processing, while negative expectations prime lower-level nociceptive and affective processes. This study demonstrates the powerful role of hedonic expectations in shaping subjective reality and suggests potential avenues for consumer and therapeutic interventions targeting expectation-driven neural processes.

                <p>by Ana María Triana, Juha Salmi, Nicholas Mark Edward Alexander Hayward, Jari Saramäki, Enrico Glerean</p>

Our behavior and mental states are constantly shaped by our environment and experiences. However, little is known about the response of brain functional connectivity to environmental, physiological, and behavioral changes on different timescales, from days to months. This gives rise to an urgent need for longitudinal studies that collect high-frequency data. To this end, for a single subject, we collected 133 days of behavioral data with smartphones and wearables and performed 30 functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans measuring attention, memory, resting state, and the effects of naturalistic stimuli. We find traces of past behavior and physiology in brain connectivity that extend up as far as 15 days. While sleep and physical activity relate to brain connectivity during cognitively demanding tasks, heart rate variability and respiration rate are more relevant for resting-state connectivity and movie-watching. This unique data set is openly accessible, offering an exceptional opportunity for further discoveries. Our results demonstrate that we should not study brain connectivity in isolation, but rather acknowledge its interdependence with the dynamics of the environment, changes in lifestyle, and short-term fluctuations such as transient illnesses or restless sleep. These results reflect a prolonged and sustained relationship between external factors and neural processes. Overall, precision mapping designs such as the one employed here can help to better understand intraindividual variability, which may explain some of the observed heterogeneity in fMRI findings. The integration of brain connectivity, physiology data and environmental cues will propel future environmental neuroscience research and support precision healthcare.

                Background Mucormycosis is a life-threatening fungal infection. Rhino-orbito-cerebral mucormycosis (ROCM) and pulmonary mucormycosis (PM) are the most common presentations. This systematic review focuses on the management of PM. Although the mortality from PM has improved over the last few decades, it is still high, at 49.8% (Muthu, Agarwal, et al., 2021). Objective The objective is to identify and map the management of PM. Design This review is designed for knowledge synthesis, with a systematic approach to identifying, synthesizing, and mapping treatment protocols for the management of PM. Methods This systematic review provides a clear, reproducible methodology. It is reported in accordance with PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses). Inclusion criteria were defined: peer-reviewed journal articles published in English from 2018 to 2023 relating to treatment protocols for PM, where the full text of the article was available. Exclusion criteria were also defined - articles that focus on limited treatment regimens, such as the use of amphotericin B only, or topics not relevant to the research question, such as fungal infections and pulmonary diseases unrelated to mucormycosis. Results The results span six years, from 2018 to 2023, with 355 articles identified. After removing duplicates, 227 papers remained. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied, with 202 articles excluded as a result. The remaining 19 articles were deemed relevant. In addition, seven relevant articles were identified via citation tracking and two articles identified by hand search. Thus, a total of 28 articles thus reviewed. The management of PM was mapped in tabular and diagrammatic form. Conclusion The results indicate that early diagnosis, early and aggressive surgery, and effective antifungals may improve survival. There is a shift away from using Am-B and a clear preference for L-AmB as a first-line antifungal. Posaconazole and Isavuconazole are the drugs of choice for stepdown, maintenance, and salvage therapy, and as alternative therapies. The control of co-morbidities is a crucial aspect of treatment. Cytokines and hyperbaric oxygen may be beneficial. The therapeutic value of iron chelators, zinc, and nebulized amphotericin B (NAB) merit further study.

                Despite the growing interest in social prescribing the diversification of health and social care strategies to support the well-being of patients has remained entrenched with a focus on the hospital setting within the Middle East. The United Arab Emirates has commenced progressing community mental health care to lead changes in how care and treatment are delivered within the United Arab Emirates. The authors adopted the use of the framework of Arksey and O’Malley (2005) to provide a systematic approach to searching the literature and creating a comprehensive foundation to guide the review. This scoping review provides a better understanding of the compatibility, content and outcomes of a selection of health models whilst also allowing further clarification before empirical studies. The scoping review findings will inform the proposed use of social prescribing as an actionable approach to create a focus on the need to include and empower the social determinants of mental health. This article proposes an evidence-based health strategy that supports and enhances recent additions to national legislation on the inclusion of the Mental Health Law within the United Arab Emirates to meditate and prevent inequities in addressing the mental health needs of citizens and residents within the nation’s diverse communities.

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The hippocampus is important for social behavior and exhibits unusual structural plasticity in the form of continued production of new granule neurons throughout adulthood, but it is unclear how adult neurogenesis contributes to social interactions. In the present study, we suppressed neurogenesis using a pharmacogenetic mouse model and examined social investigation and aggression in adult male mice to investigate the role of hippocampal adult-born neurons in the expression of aggressive behavior. In simultaneous choice tests with stimulus mice placed in corrals, mice with complete suppression of adult neurogenesis in adulthood (TK mice) exhibited normal social investigation behaviors, indicating that new neurons are not required for social interest, social memory, or detection of and response to social olfactory signals. However, mice with suppressed neurogenesis displayed decreased offensive and defensive aggression in a resident-intruder paradigm, and less resistance in a social dominance test, relative to neurogenesis-intact controls, when paired with weight and strain-matched (CD-1) mice. During aggression tests, TK mice were frequently attacked by the CD-1 intruder mice, which never occurred with WTs, and normal CD-1 male mice investigated TK mice less than controls when corralled in the social investigation test. Importantly, TK mice showed normal aggression toward prey (crickets) and smaller, nonaggressive (olfactory bulbectomized) C57BL/6J intruders, suggesting that mice lacking adult neurogenesis do not avoid aggressive social interactions if they are much larger than their opponent and will clearly win. Taken together, our findings show that adult hippocampal neurogenesis plays an important role in the instigation of intermale aggression, possibly by weighting a cost–benefit analysis against confrontation in cases where the outcome of the fight is not clear.</p>

                Zhang et al. show that STAMBPL1 reduces lysosome degradation of EGFR by binding to STAM1 and facilitates RNA splicing of EGFR by deubiquitinating TOE1. The EGFR-MYC axis promotes the transcription of STAMBPL1 and RNA splicing of EGFR. Inhibition of STAMBPL1 attenuates liver tumorigenesis and improves the antitumor activity of lenvatinib.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96190">A modified BPaL regimen for tuberculosis treatment replaces linezolid with inhaled spectinamides</a></h4>

              
                The Nix-TB clinical trial evaluated a new 6 month regimen containing three oral drugs; bedaquiline (B), pretomanid (Pa), and linezolid (L) (BPaL regimen) for the treatment of tuberculosis (TB). This regimen achieved remarkable results as almost 90% of the multidrug-resistant or extensively drug-resistant TB participants were cured but many patients also developed severe adverse events (AEs). The AEs were associated with the long-term administration of the protein synthesis inhibitor linezolid. Spectinamide 1599 is also a protein synthesis inhibitor of <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> with an excellent safety profile, but it lacks oral bioavailability. Here, we propose to replace L in the BPaL regimen with spectinamide (S) administered via inhalation and we demonstrate that inhaled spectinamide 1599, combined with BPa ––BPaS regimen––has similar efficacy to that of the BPaL regimen while simultaneously avoiding the L-associated AEs. The BPaL and BPaS regimens were compared in the BALB/c and C3HeB/FeJ murine chronic TB efficacy models. After 4-weeks of treatment, both regimens promoted equivalent bactericidal effects in both TB murine models. However, treatment with BPaL resulted in significant weight loss and the complete blood count suggested the development of anemia. These effects were not similarly observed in mice treated with BPaS. BPaL and BPa, but not the BPaS treatment, also decreased myeloid to erythroid ratio suggesting the S in the BPaS regimen was able to recover this effect. Moreover, the BPaL also increased concentration of proinflammatory cytokines in bone marrow compared to mice receiving BPaS regimen. These combined data suggest that inhaled spectinamide 1599 combined with BPa is an effective TB regimen without L-associated AEs.

                The gram-negative bacterium lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is frequently administered to generate models of systemic inflammation. However, there are several side effects and no effective treatment for LPS-induced systemic inflammation. PEGylated PDZ peptide based on zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) was analyzed for its effects on systemic inflammation induced by LPS. PDZ peptide administration led to the restoration of tissue injuries (kidney, liver, and lung) and prevented alterations in biochemical plasma markers. The production of pro-inflammatory cytokines was significantly decreased in the plasma and lung BALF in the PDZ-administered mice. Flow cytometry analysis revealed the PDZ peptide significantly inhibited inflammation, mainly by decreasing the population of M1 macrophages, and neutrophils (immature and mature), and increasing M2 macrophages. Using RNA sequencing analysis, the expression levels of the NF-κB-related proteins were lower in PDZ-treated cells than in LPS-treated cells. In addition, wild-type PDZ peptide significantly increased mitochondrial membrane integrity and decreased LPS-induced mitochondria fission. Interestingly, PDZ peptide dramatically could reduce LPS-induced NF-κB signaling, ROS production, and the expression of M1 macrophage marker proteins, but increased the expression of M2 macrophage marker proteins. These results indicated that PEGylated PDZ peptide inhibits LPS-induced systemic inflammation, reducing tissue injuries and reestablishing homeostasis, and may be a therapeutic candidate against systemic inflammation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92870">A novel bioinformatics pipeline for the identification of immune inhibitory receptors as potential therapeutic targets</a></h4>

              
                Despite major successes with inhibitory receptor blockade in cancer, the identification of novel inhibitory receptors as putative drug targets is needed due to lack of durable responses, therapy resistance, and side effects. Most inhibitory receptors signal via immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs) and previous studies estimated that our genome contains over 1600 ITIM-bearing transmembrane proteins. However, testing and development of these candidates requires increased understanding of their expression patterns and likelihood to function as inhibitory receptor. Therefore, we designed a novel bioinformatics pipeline integrating machine learning-guided structural predictions and sequence-based likelihood models to identify putative inhibitory receptors. Using transcriptomics data of immune cells, we determined the expression of these novel inhibitory receptors, and classified them into previously proposed functional categories. Known and putative inhibitory receptors were expressed across different immune cell subsets with cell type-specific expression patterns. Furthermore, putative immune inhibitory receptors were differentially expressed in subsets of tumour infiltrating T cells. In conclusion, we present an inhibitory receptor pipeline that identifies 51 known and 390 novel human inhibitory receptors. This pipeline will support future drug target selection across diseases where therapeutic targeting of immune inhibitory receptors is warranted.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92962">Alasemenia, the earliest ovule with three wings and without cupule</a></h4>

              
                The ovules or seeds (fertilized ovules) with wings are widespread and especially important for wind dispersal. However, the earliest ovules in the Famennian of the Late Devonian are rarely known about the dispersal syndrome and usually surrounded by a cupule. From Xinhang, Anhui, China, we now report a new taxon of Famennian ovules, <i>Alasemenia tria</i> gen. et sp. nov. Each ovule of this taxon possesses three integumentary wings evidently extending outwards, folding inwards along abaxial side and enclosing most part of nucellus. The ovule is borne terminally on smooth dichotomous branches and lacks a cupule. <i>Alasemenia</i> suggests that the integuments of the earliest ovules without a cupule evolved functions in probable photosynthetic nutrition and wind dispersal. It indicates that the seed wing originated earlier than other wind dispersal mechanisms such as seed plume and pappus, and that three- or four-winged seeds were followed by seeds with less wings. Mathematical analysis shows that three-winged seeds are more adapted to wind dispersal than seeds with one, two or four wings under the same condition.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98070">DTX3L ubiquitin ligase ubiquitinates single-stranded nucleic acids</a></h4>

              
                Ubiquitination typically involves covalent linking of ubiquitin (Ub) to a lysine residue on a protein substrate. Recently, new facets of this process have emerged, including Ub modification of non-proteinaceous substrates like ADP-ribose by the DELTEX E3 ligase family. Here, we show that the DELTEX family member DTX3L expands this non-proteinaceous substrate repertoire to include single-stranded DNA and RNA. Although the N-terminal region of DTX3L contains single-stranded nucleic acid binding domains and motifs, the minimal catalytically competent fragment comprises the C-terminal RING and DTC domains (RD). DTX3L-RD catalyses ubiquitination of the 3’-end of single-stranded DNA and RNA, as well as double-stranded DNA with a 3’ overhang of two or more nucleotides. This modification is reversibly cleaved by deubiquitinases. NMR and biochemical analyses reveal that the DTC domain binds single-stranded DNA and facilitates the catalysis of Ub transfer from RING-bound E2-conjugated Ub. Our study unveils the direct ubiquitination of nucleic acids by DTX3L, laying the groundwork for understanding its functional implications.

">Modeling the Effects of Propofol on Brain Activity: Insights from Computational EEG Studies</a></h4>

              
                The effects of anesthetic agents like propofol on brain activity provide critical insights into how consciousness is altered during anesthesia. This article presents a computational approach to modeling the impact of propofol on the brain's electrical activity using the COALIA model, a large-scale neural mass model of human EEG designed for consciousness research. Propofol enhances GABA_A-mediated synaptic inhibition, leading to characteristic EEG signatures such as alpha oscillations (8-12 Hz) and slow-wave oscillations (0.1-1.5 Hz). We model these effects by modulating the parameters of postsynaptic potentials and synaptic strength, simulating the action of propofol at both the molecular and network levels. COALIA's detailed representation of thalamo-cortical and cortico-cortical networks provides realistic simulations of brain dynamics under anesthesia, closely replicating experimental EEG data. Our findings highlight the importance of network-level interactions in producing the distinctive EEG changes observed during propofol-induced unconsciousness. This research paves the way for future applications in personalized anesthesia monitoring and consciousness assessment through EEG modeling.

                Neuronal dense core vesicles (DCVs) store and release a diverse array of neuromodulators, trophic factors and bioamines. The analysis of single DCVs has largely been possible only using electron microscopy, which makes understanding cargo segregation and DCV heterogeneity difficult. To address these limitations, we developed genetically-encoded markers for DCVs that can be used in combination with standard immunohistochemistry and expansion microscopy, to enable single-vesicle resolution with confocal microscopy.

">Task relevance selectively modulates sensorimotor adaptation in the presence of multiple prediction errors.</a></h4>

              
                Adaptation to consistently occurring sensorimotor errors is considered obligatory in nature. We probed the robustness of this finding by asking if humans can selectively attenuate adaptation based on the task-relevance of error signals. Subjects made planar reaches to three different targets: an arc (Experiment 1), a bar (Experiment 2), and a point (Experiment 3). During the reach, perturbations in extent (visuomotor gain), direction (visuomotor rotation) or both simultaneously were employed. In Experiment 1, subjects showed robust adaptation to the rotation when reaching to the arc even though the presence of this perturbation was irrelevant for achievement of the task goal. Interestingly however, rotation adaptation was strongly attenuated when it was presented simultaneously with a task-relevant gain perturbation. In Experiment 2, which involved reaches to the bar, again, subjects successfully adapted to the task-irrelevant gain perturbation when it occurred in isolation. However, adaptation was attenuated when the gain co-occurred with a task-relevant rotation. Experiment 3 revealed that the attenuation observed in the first two experiments was not due to an inability to adapt to co-occurring rotation and gain perturbations. Collectively, our results suggest that the sensorimotor system selectively tunes learning in the presence of multiple error signals, a finding that can potentially be explained by a biased competition mechanism. That is, given limited processing capacity, a salient attribute - the relevance of the error to the task goal in this case - is prioritized for processing and drives subsequent adaptive changes in motor output.

">Cholecystokinin-expressing GABA neurons elicit long-term potentiation in the cortical inhibitory synapses and attenuate sound-shock associative memory</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal interactions between inhibitory and excitatory neurons play a pivotal role in regulating the balance of excitation and inhibition in the central nervous system (CNS). Consequently, the efficacy of inhibitory/excitatory synapses profoundly affects neural network processing and overall neuronal functions. Here, we describe a novel form of long-term potentiation (LTP) induced at cortical inhibitory synapses and its behavioral consequences. We show that high-frequency laser stimulation (HFLS) of GABAergic neurons elicit inhibitory LTP (i-LTP) in pyramidal neurons of the auditory cortex (AC). The selective activation of cholecystokinin-expressing GABA (GABACCK) neurons is essential for the formation of HFLS-induced i-LTP, rather than the classical parvalbumin (PV) neurons and somatostatin (SST) neurons. Intriguingly, i-LTP can be evoked in the AC by adding the exogenous neuropeptide CCK when PV neurons and SST neurons are selectively activated in PV-Cre and SST-Cre mice, respectively. Additionally, we discovered that low-frequency laser stimulation (LFLS) of PV neurons paired with HFLS of GABACCK neurons potentiates the inhibitory effect of PV interneurons on pyramidal neurons, thereby generating heterosynaptic i-LTP in the AC. Notably, light activation of GABACCK neurons in CCK-Cre mice significantly attenuates sound- shock associative memory, while stimulation of PV neurons does not affect this memory in PV-Cre mice. In conclusion, these results demonstrate a critical mechanism regulating the excitation-inhibition balance and modulating learning and memory in cortical circuits. This mechanism might serve as a potential target for the treatment of neurological disorders, including epilepsy and Alzheimer disease.

	<p>Objectives: One of the behavioral problems strongly associated with emotional dysregulation (ED) in ASD is emotional outbursts (EOs) characterized by a pattern of challenging behavior that varies across individuals and across time. Cultural factors can modulate the expression of EOs. This study aimed to characterize the profile of emotional outbursts (EOs) in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) across various countries in Latin America and to identify clinical, emotional, and contextual factors that contribute to the onset and frequency of EOs within this diverse sample. Methods: A cross-sectional and cross-cultural study was conducted between 2023 and 2024 comprising samples from five countries in the Latin American Network for Autism-REAL: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Uruguay, and the Dominican Republic. We studied 689 children with ASD (age x = 8.7 &amp;amp;plusmn; 2.6 years) using the Emotional Outburst Questionnaire (EOQ). Results: We identified different types of EO among children with ASD in our sample. The most frequent was the &amp;amp;lsquo;behavioral indicators of emotion&amp;amp;rsquo; (52.0%) followed by &amp;amp;lsquo;increased motor activity&amp;amp;rsquo; (28.3%), &amp;amp;lsquo;non-speech vocalizations&amp;amp;rsquo;, (27.6%), &amp;amp;lsquo;mild verbal aggression&amp;amp;rsquo; (23.8%), and &amp;amp;lsquo;avoidance&amp;amp;rsquo; (21.5%). Children in a bad mood or having a bad day or experiencing irritability were the most significant factors that increased the likelihood of EOs. Conclusions: Our results revealed that irritability is an important trigger for EOs and should not be disregarded or underestimated when monitoring the mental health of children with ASD.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-781/v5?src=rss">Effects of priming duration and rhizosphere bacteria metabolite concentration on the germinability of cowpea, soybean, sesame, and okra seeds [version 5; peer review: 1 approved, 2 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Seed priming enhances germination and growth, which are important determinants of crop yield. This study was carried out to assess the effect of priming duration and metabolite concentration on the priming of five (5) crops using the metabolites of five (5) bacterial isolates. The crop seeds were treated in the cold-extracted metabolites of the five isolates at five (5) different priming durations (1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 h) and then in five metabolite concentrations (200, 400, 600, 800, and 1000 mg/L) of the five extracted metabolites at the optimal priming duration determined in the first experiment. Characterization of the cold-extracted metabolites was also carried out using gas-chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Results revealed that priming cowpea and soybean seeds for longer durations (< 3 h) could hinder their growth and development. Lower concentrations were observed to be optimal for cowpea and soybean, but for sesame and okra, there was no detectable pattern with metabolite concentration. The GC-MS revealed the presence of some molecules (e.g. hexadecanoic acid) that have shown plant growth promotion potential in other studies. This study showed that seeds with large endosperms, such as those of cowpea and soybean, are more prone to the harmful effects of treatment for longer durations. Further experiments should be undertaken to isolate and purify the bioactive moieties for further studies and application.

                A cerebral arteriovenous malformation (cAVM) is an abnormal tangle of cerebral blood vessels. The consensus document by the Joint Writing Group (JWG) highlighted which cAVM features should be recorded. Subsequent publications have reported cAVM angioarchitecture, but it is unknown if all followed the JWG recommendations. The aim of this systematic review was to describe use of the JWG guidelines. A database search, using the PRISMA checklist, was performed. We describe the proportion of publications that used JWG reporting standards, which standards were used, whether the definitions used differed from the JWG, or if any additional angiographic features were reported. Out of 4306 articles identified, 105 were selected, and a further 114 from other sources. Thirty-three studies (33/219; 15%) specifically referred to using JWG standards. Since the JWG publication, few studies have used their standards to report cAVMs. This implies that the angioarchitecture of cAVMs are not routinely fully described.

                Background: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and its consequences are a serious global public health issue. By 2030, the number of people with type 2 diabetes is predicted to reach 439 million. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the plasma levels of glucose, HbA1c, insulin, and lipid profile in Sudanese T2DM patients. Methods: This case control study included 165 Sudanese patients with diabetic type 2 and a cardiovascular condition as cases and 165 diabetic type 2 volunteers without a cardiovascular disorder as controls. The concentrations of plasma glucose, HbA1c, and lipid profile were assessed using a Mindray BS-480 auto-chemistry analyzer, and insulin was analyzed using a Cobase 411 auto analyzer. The collected data were analyzed using statistical tools for social science computer programs (SPSS version 21). Results: According to the findings, (59.4%) of patients between the ages of (50-69). Females made up 50.9%. (38.2%) of patients had an illness duration of between (8-15 years). (41.8%) of individuals did not have hypertension. There was a substantial rise in BMI, FBG, HbA1c, HDL-C, and insulin among diabetics with cardiovascular disease compared to diabetics without cardiovascular disease (p-value = 0.001, 0.000, 0.018, and 0.000). Females had significantly higher blood TC, LDL-C, HDL-C, and BMI than males (p-values = 0.000, 0,001, and 0.000, respectively). There were significant positive correlation between FBS, HBA1c, insulin and duration of disease (r=0.155, p, value=0.005) (r=0.160, p, value=0.004)(r=0.103, p. value=0.061)respectively, while there were significant negative correlation between TC, TG,LDL-C, HDL-C and duration of disease (r=-0.152, p, value= 0.006)(r=-0.023, p, value=0.678)(r=-0.113, p, value= 0.040)(r=-0.145, p, value=0.008)respectively. Conclusion: When comparing diabetics with cardiovascular disease to diabetics without cardiovascular disease, there was a substantial rise in BMI, FBG, HbA1c, HDL-C, and insulin. FBS, HBA1c, insulin, and illness duration all had a strong positive connection.

                This is a case of septic pulmonary embolism in a patient presented with a right foot ulcer as foci of infection. A Septic Pulmonary embolism is a thromboembolic event in which case an infected thrombus from an infectious focus; distal to the lung vasculature travels through the lung and results in occlusive, inflammatory and infectious insult to the lung. Clinically it may present as mild respiratory symptoms such as cough, fever or more severe symptoms such as shortness of breath (SOB), hemoptysis, pleuritic chest pain or difficulty breathing1; on computed tomography (CT) imaging, cavitary or non-cavitary peripheral nodules with or without feeding vessel, consolidation and Pleural effusion are prominent findings.2 In this case report, we present a rare case of septic pulmonary emboli from a foci of soft tissue infection.

                The psychosocial well-being of every individual is as important as the well-being of long-distance voyages, especially that they have to spend longer hours and days travelling to their destinations with all the experiences of adventure and adversities characterizing the journey. The aim of this systematic review is to explore the psychosocial well-being of long-distance travellers on board shipping vessels to gain an understanding of their psychological and social well-being with the objective of ameliorating the adversities associated with these travels. A systematic review will be conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (2020) statement. The databases to be searched for the data will be limited to Scopus, Web of Science, and Advanced Google Scholar using keywords selected by the reviewers. Meta-analysis, narrative synthesis, or both will be used depending on the extent of heterogeneity across eligible observational studies included in the review. Some specific countries will be selected for data extraction, and only data published in English will be included. It is expected that the findings from this review will bring to bear if these categories of travellers are prone to risks that affect their psychosocial wellbeing and if so discovered. This protocol was registered with the PROSPERO. PROSPERO registration number: CRD42024517277(08/03/2024)

                Background Methotrexate (MTX) is a classical folic acid antagonist widely used in the treatment of malignant and non-malignant disorders. However, its clinical application is often restricted by concomitant adverse effects, including renal damage. Numerous studies have highlighted the role of oxidative stress and inflammation in mediating MTX-related nephrotoxicity. Therefore, the current study aimed to explore the possible renoprotective action of Citronellol (CT), a natural compound with prominent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities, against nephrotoxicity induced by MTX. Methods To fulfill our objective, 24 adult male Wistar rats were randomly allocated into four groups: control, MTX, 100 mg/kg CT plus MTX and 200 mg/kg CT plus MTX. At the end of the study, the experimental rats were anesthetized, blood samples were collected for biochemical assays, and the kidneys were surgically removed for biochemical and gene expression analyses, after which all rats were sacrificed by exsanguination. Results Compared to the MTX-treated group, our results revealed that pre-supplementation with 100 or 200 mg/kg CT remarkably ameliorated renal damage biomarkers, including serum urea, serum creatinine, and kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1). In addition, pre-treatment with 100 or 200 mg/kg CT enhanced the activity of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx), diminished renal malondialdehyde (MDA) contents, and attenuated inflammation by suppressing renal nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling and diminishing tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) gene expression. Moreover, pre-treatment with 200 mg/kg CT markedly reduced interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) gene expression. Conclusion Our findings demonstrate, for the first time, that CT can serve as a new promising agent for mitigating nephrotoxicity induced by MTX through its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.

                Background Despite beneficial progress in policies, awareness and advocacy, accessibility gaps exist in public buildings in India. Challenges achieving full inclusivity still exist, due to a lack of clear guidance for implementing accessible solutions. Retrofitting older buildings, particularly in developing tier II cities is a major challenge. The authors of this paper aimed to address this issue using a four-round Delphi method to generate a Justice-Centered Best Practices (JCBPs) for accessibility provisions for individuals with mobility disabilities. Methods Conducted in Udupi, the study involved experts including administrators, policy implementers, auditors, advocates, healthcare professionals, individuals with disabilities and their caregivers. In the first round, a 117-item list was generated through triangulation of three methods. In subsequent rounds, experts rated each item using a 5-point Likert scale on feasibility, affordability and priority. Responses were considered valid if the agreement reached ≥80% on the total score. The prioritised list of JCBPs was finalised at a consensus meeting. Results Out of forty-eight experts who began the study, 16 participated in the final meeting. The Wilcoxon signed rank test (p value>0.05) of expert ranking indicated that the scoring of items remained consistent between the two rounds. A machine learning decision tree analysis identified items securing ≥ 80% agreement as the most reliable decision with an accuracy=71.43%. The McNemar’s Test p value=0.79 confirmed consistency of expert scoring on the items with high agreement rates. Conclusion Finally, 33 built and non-built environment items scored highest rank. Stakeholder engagement, use of low-cost technology solutions, coordination between public administrations, funding, good governance practice, awareness, and advocacy were few of the solutions that can help ensure accessibility is in place for individuals with mobility disabilities. The study methodology and findings create a robust foundation for evidence-based JCBPs for accessibility provisions for individuals with mobility disabilities.

                Introduction Current dietary assessment methods face challenges in accurately capturing individuals’ dietary habits, undermining the efficacy of public health strategies. The ‘Standardised and Objective Dietary Intake Assessment Tool’ (SODIAT)-1 study aims to assess the effectiveness of three emerging technologies (urine and capillary blood biomarkers, and wearable camera technology) and two online self-reporting dietary assessment tools to monitor dietary intake. Methods This randomised controlled crossover trial will recruit 30 participants (aged 18-70 years and BMI of 20-30 kg/m2) from Imperial College London and the University of Reading. Exclusion criteria include recent weight change, food allergies/intolerances, following restrictive diets, certain health conditions and medication use. Interested volunteers will be directed to an online screening questionnaire via REDCap and eligible participants will attend a pre-study visit. Volunteers will consume, in a random order, two highly-controlled diets (compliant and non-compliant with UK guidelines) for four days each. Each study arm will be separated by at least one-week. During each test period, dietary intake will be monitored continuously using wearable cameras and self-recorded using eNutri (food frequency questionnaire) and Intake24 (24-hour dietary recall). Urine and capillary blood samples will be collected for biomarker analysis. Data analysis will assess the accuracy of dietary reporting across these methods using Lin’s concordance correlation coefficient. Discussion and ethical considerations This study introduces a novel approach to dietary assessment, addressing the limitations of traditional methods by reducing misreporting and enhancing inclusivity, particularly for underrepresented populations with literacy or language barriers. However, challenges persist, such as variability in biomarker data due to failure to adhere to sample storage requirements and the practicalities of continuously wearing cameras. To protect privacy, participants will be instructed to remove cameras at inappropriate times, and artificial intelligence will be used to blur all images captured apart from food.

                Background Most people in third-world countries are impoverished and rely on small-holder farming as a source of income. Due to a lack of working capital to diversify their sources of income and acquire new sources, farmers are highly dependent on financial institutions to access microcredit. Method This study utilized logistic regression and propensity score matching methods to analyze the primary data collected from a sample of 385 household heads. Results The Estimation results of the study shows that Gender, age, family size, and education, access to irrigation, extension services, dependency ratio, and distance to credit sources were among the significant determinants of access to microcredit service. Conclusion Although microcredit led to an increase in household spending, real asset holdings did not improve. In addition to the need for supplementary interventions like financial literacy training and asset-building programs to encourage asset accumulation among these small-scale agrarian households, high interest rates and repayment burdens are blamed for this uneven result.

                Background When the brain is deprived of oxygen and nutrients due to stenosis or arterial rupture, neurons in the affected area suffer irreversible damage and cellular death. MicroRNA has been shown to regulate target genes implicated in arterial hypertension, atherosclerosis, and diabetes mellitus, all of which influence the risk of ischemic stroke through inflammation, oxidative stress, cell proliferation, and apoptosis. The study aims to determine the changes in miRNA expression, namely miRNA-21, between acute ischemic stroke patients and controls and their relationship to proinflammatory cytokines, clinical severity, and outcome. Methods Serum samples from tertiary hospitals and controls were used to evaluate miRNA-21 expression as well as cytokines TNF-α, IL-10, ICAM-1, and CCL5 levels within 7 days of stroke onset. The 30-day clinical severity and outcome were assessed using the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and modified Rankin Scale (mRS), respectively. Result A total of 64 acute ischemic stroke patients and 22 age-matched controls were recruited, with median ages of 56 and 55.5 years old, respectively. There were more male subjects than females (35 to 29). A statistically significant difference was observed in miRNA-21 expression between patients and controls (p<0.001). This finding implies that miRNA-21 expression may have a contribution in acute stroke patients. This was followed by an increase in proinflammatory markers TNF-α, IL-10, ICAM-1, and CCL5. However, no association was found between miRNA-21 and any pro-inflammatory cytokine. There was no significant correlation between miRNA-21 or cytokines markers with clinical severity or prognosis. Conclusion Our study demonstrated increased miRNA-21 expression and proinflammatory cytokine expression in acute ischemic stroke patients relative to controls. However, this was not related to clinical severity or clinical outcomes.

[version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has fomented a climate of fear worldwide due to its rapidly spreading nature, and high mortality rate. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared it as a global pandemic on 11th March, 2020. Many endeavors have been made to find appropriate medications to restrain the SARS CoV-2 infection from spreading but there is no specific antiviral therapy to date. However, a computer-aided drug design approach can be an alternative to identify probable drug candidates within a short time. SARS-CoV-2 main protease is a proven drug target, and it plays a pivotal role in viral replication and transcription. Methods: In this study, we identified a total of 114 essential oil compounds as a feasible anti-SARS-CoV-2 agent from several online reservoirs. These compounds were screened by incorporating ADMET profiling, molecular docking, and 50 ns of molecular dynamics simulation to identify potential drug candidates against the SARS-CoV-2 main protease. The crystallized SARS-CoV-2 main protease structure was collected from the RCSB PDB database (PDB ID 6LU7). Results: According to the results of the ADMET study, none of the compounds have any side effects that could reduce their druglikeness or pharmacokinetic properties. Out of 114 compounds, we selected bisabololoxide B, eremanthin, and leptospermone as our top drug candidates based on their higher binding affinity scores, and strong interaction with the Cys 145-His 41 catalytic dyad. Finally, the molecular dynamics simulation was implemented to evaluate the structural stability of the ligand-receptor complex. MD simulations disclosed that all the hits showed conformational stability compared to the positive control α-ketoamide. Conclusions: Our study showed that the top three hits might work as potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents, which can pave the way for discovering new drugs, but for experimental validation, they will require more in vivo trials.

                Purpose To explore how principles of social justice and equity are integrated into research concerning accessibility to public buildings for individuals with mobility disabilities. Methods Utilising a scoping review methodology to assess literature based on the criteria set by the Joanna Briggs Institute, seven databases were screened. Studies were selected using the framework: “persons with mobility disabilities” AND “accessibility” AND “public buildings”. A theoretical framework helped to extract codes and develop themes through an inductive-deductive analysis method. The results are presented descriptively. Results The examination of 84 studies uncovered a complex interplay between agencies, systemic challenges, discriminatory practices, and societal attitudes perpetuating marginalisation of individuals with mobility disabilities in their access to public buildings. The recommendations emphasize importance of practical measures, research imperatives, and policy developments to promote inclusivity. We present a ‘Ten-step approach’ to integrate social justice and equity into research on accessibility in public buildings for people with mobility disabilities. Conclusion Integrating diversity, active participation, and inclusive methodologies are essential to address systemic issues, discriminatory practices, and societal attitudes that hinder accessibility and inclusion. Collaborations with diverse stakeholders are crucial for policy changes, resource allocation, and advancing social justice and equity in accessibility research and practice.

                Objectives The primary objective of this systematic review was to identify the optimal timing for immunizing pregnant women to confer the most protection by reducing the incidence of laboratory-confirmed influenza or influenza-like illness in infants less than 6 months of age. Currently, there are gaps in research regarding the timing of administration during the gestational period to provide maximum immunogenicity to the infant. The research question being addressed is: ‘When considering immunization of pregnant mothers with the influenza vaccine, implementing a vaccination program during which trimester in pregnancy would optimize benefits for infants less than 6 months of age in terms of the incidence of laboratory-confirmed influenza and influenza-like illness?’ Design Systematic review/Meta-analysis Methods Randomized controlled trials (RCT’s) and observational studies comparing health outcomes of infants and children up to 6 months of age born to women who received inactivated influenza vaccine during pregnancy with mothers who did not receive the vaccine or received a control vaccine. The primary outcome was laboratory-confirmed influenza infection in infants. Secondary outcome measures included influenza –like illness diagnosed by a clinician and acute respiratory illness. Results 7 studies were included: 2 primary RCT’s and 5 observational studies (prospective and retrospective cohort studies).5 of the 7 studies were suitable to be included in the quantitative synthesis part and and were compared. Forrest plot analysis revealed that vaccinating pregnant mothers in the second and third trimester when compared with any trimester (1,2 and 3) (OR 0.18 vs. 0.65) conferred less protection, promoting vaccination in the first trimester. Conclusions Vaccinating pregnant mothers in the first trimester conferred greater protection to infants than any other trimester.

                Background: Secretomes have been gaining interest in treating several diseases due to their pharmaceutical effects, such as the immunomodulatory effect. This study aimed to determine the immunomodulatory effect of secretomes derived from human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and their safety. Methods: We conducted an in vivo immunomodulatory study using a carbon clearance assay. The safety of single-dose administration of secretome was done using fixed-dose methods of acute toxicity test. Results: The phagocytic index was higher in mice treated with secretome than in untreated mice. The acute toxicity study also showed that the administration of secretome derived from human umbilical cord MSCs did not change the mice’s body weight, physical examination results, organ weight, and gross anatomy examination. Conclusions: This study presents the potential of secretome derived from MSCs as a safe immunomodulatory agent.

                Background India’s National Policy for Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (NPSDE) was designed to capture the demographic dividend and upskill India’s youth, creating an ‘Athmanirbhar Bharat’ (self-reliant India) and in the process, also drive economic growth. Policy and Implications The NPSDE’s dual focus on skill development and entrepreneurship was intended to create a framework for empowering India’s workforce and fostering a culture of innovation. However, the policy has encountered several issues, including the ineffective functioning of Sector Skill Councils (SSCs), inadequate infrastructure, and insufficiently skilled trainers. Additionally, the policy’s efforts to include marginalized groups, particularly women, have fallen short due to entrenched social barriers and gender biases, impacting the effectiveness of training programs. Recommendations To improve the effectiveness of the NPSDE, we propose the following recommendations -adopt an entrepreneurial ecosystem approach to enhance coordination and support within the skill development framework; explicitly define ‘skill’ and ‘skilling’ to better align with socio-political realities and address barriers faced by marginalized individuals; and design training initiatives with an empowerment perspective, focusing on access to resources, agency, and social change. We feel these steps can help direct the NPSDE to create a more inclusive and impactful skilling environment. Conclusions While the NPSDE represents a significant effort towards upskilling India and fostering self-reliance and entrepreneurship, its implementation has revealed critical limitations. The policy’s progress has been insufficient, with persistent issues in meeting industry needs and addressing socio-economic barriers. Future revisions of the policy should focus on systemic improvements, adopting a more inclusive approach to skilling, and addressing the socio-political dimensions of skill valuation to better support India’s developmental aspirations.

                Background To gauge the impact of an interventional workshop conducted to measure the observation skills of 34 postgraduates during induction into an ophthalmology fellowship. Methods A seven-hour workshop was conducted with the ophthalmology trainees. Trainees from the 2022 batch of ophthalmology fellowships (21 females and 13 males) were included in the study. The pre-workshop assessment comprised two non-clinical images to spot the difference and five clinical images from various subspecialties of ophthalmology. This was followed by workshop and Post workshop assessment. The pre- and post-observation grades of participants were then compared by masked ophthalmologists. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare scores at two time points, with a p-value < 0.05 for statistical significance. Results Statistical analysis revealed that the observation skill score was significantly higher after the workshop intervention (Md = 4.00, n = 34) compared to the pre-workshop score (Md = 1.85, n = 34), p-value = 0.000. Conclusions Workshops on specific/selected foundational skills, such as observation skills and communication skills, must be integrated into the curricula of basic medical degree and specialty medicine to equip medical professionals with attentive observation and deep learning.

                Background This study aims to empirically test a comprehensive interrelationship between green supply chain management (GSCM), green technology innovation (GTI), waste management (WM), big data analytics capability powered by artificial intelligence (BDAC-AI), and their collective impact on sustainable performance (SP) in organizational contexts. Methods This study was conducted in Pakistan’s food processing sector. The respondents included 495 managers working in the food processing industry. A structural equation modelling (SEM) approach is used to examine direct and indirect relationships between the variables. The originality of this study lies in integration of the technology acceptance model (TAM) and dynamic capability theory (DCT) to understand sustainable practices in the context of the provided model. Results This study highlights that GSCM, GTI, WM, and BDAC-AI have positive, strong, and direct impacts on SP. Furthermore, GTI and WM only partially mediate the link between GSCM and SP, whereas the two moderate the link. In addition, BDAC-AI had a moderating effect on the relationship between GTI and SP. This study has managerial implications, including strategies that involve the use of theoretical frameworks for technological acceptance and dynamic capabilities to support sustainable initiatives. However, it is worth noting that the findings provide a practical contingency for managers and businesses interested in implementing green studies effectively, improving technologies, and strengthening sustainable performance capabilities. Conclusions The study extends the literature by establishing a model for operationalizing GSCM in the food processing sector. Furthermore, it adds value in that it first integrates TAM and DCT to explain sustainable operations and their impact on organizations. Furthermore, it extends the existing literature by establishing a relationship between GSCM and SC. It offers a model through which GSCM can be operationalized in the context of the FS sector.

Spatio-molecular data and microscopy images provide complementary information, essential to study structure and function of spatially organised multicellular systems such as healthy or diseased tissues. However, aligning these two types of data can be challenging due to distortions and differences in resolution, orientation, and position. Manual registration is tedious but may be necessary for challenging samples as well as for the generation of ground-truth data sets that enable benchmarking of existing and emerging automated alignment tools. To make the process of manual registration more convenient, efficient, and integrated, we created <i>BoReMi</i>, a python-based, Jupyter-integrated, visual tool that offers all the relevant functionalities for aligning and registering spatio-molecular data and associated microscopy images. We showcase <i>BoReMi’s</i> utility using publicly available data and images and make <i>BoReMi</i> as well as an interactive demo available on GitHub.

                <p>by Marta Mackowiak, Bartosz Adamczyk, Marta Szachniuk, Tomasz Zok</p>

RNA molecules, essential for viruses and living organisms, derive their pivotal functions from intricate 3D structures. To understand these structures, one can analyze torsion and pseudo-torsion angles, which describe rotations around bonds, whether real or virtual, thus capturing the RNA conformational flexibility. Such an analysis has been made possible by RNAtango, a web server introduced in this paper, that provides a trigonometric perspective on RNA 3D structures, giving insights into the variability of examined models and their alignment with reference targets. RNAtango offers comprehensive tools for calculating torsion and pseudo-torsion angles, generating angle statistics, comparing RNA structures based on backbone torsions, and assessing local and global structural similarities using trigonometric functions and angle measures. The system operates in three scenarios: single model analysis, model-versus-target comparison, and model-versus-model comparison, with results output in text and graphical formats. Compatible with all modern web browsers, RNAtango is accessible freely along with the source code. It supports researchers in accurately assessing structural similarities, which contributes to the precision and efficiency of RNA modeling.

                <p>by Fan Xia, Yanni Xiao, Junling Ma</p>

Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) are effective in mitigating infections during the early stages of an infectious disease outbreak. However, these measures incur significant economic and livelihood costs. To address this, we developed an optimal control framework aimed at identifying strategies that minimize such costs while ensuring full control of a cross-regional outbreak of emerging infectious diseases. Our approach uses a spatial SEIR model with interventions for the epidemic process, and incorporates population flow in a gravity model dependent on gross domestic product (GDP) and geographical distance. We applied this framework to identify an optimal control strategy for the COVID-19 outbreak caused by the Delta variant in Xi’an City, Shaanxi, China, between December 2021 and January 2022. The model was parameterized by fitting it to daily case data from each district of Xi’an City. Our findings indicate that an increase in the basic reproduction number, the latent period or the infectious period leads to a prolonged outbreak and a larger final size. This indicates that diseases with greater transmissibility are more challenging and costly to control, and so it is important for governments to quickly identify cases and implement control strategies. Indeed, the optimal control strategy we identified suggests that more costly control measures should be implemented as soon as they are deemed necessary. Our results demonstrate that optimal control regimes exhibit spatial, economic, and population heterogeneity. More populated and economically developed regions require a robust regular surveillance mechanism to ensure timely detection and control of imported infections. Regions with higher GDP tend to experience larger-scale epidemics and, consequently, require higher control costs. Notably, our proposed optimal strategy significantly reduced costs compared to the actual expenditures for the Xi’an outbreak.

                <p>by Lianghong Chen, Zi Huai Huang, Yan Sun, Mike Domaratzki, Qian Liu, Pingzhao Hu</p>

This study addresses the heterogeneity of breast cancer (BC) by employing a Conditional Probabilistic Diffusion Model (CPDM) to synthesize Magnetic Resonance Images (MRIs) based on multi-omic data, including gene expression, copy number variation, and DNA methylation. The lack of paired medical images and genomics data in previous studies presented a challenge, which the CPDM aims to overcome. The well-trained CPDM successfully generated synthetic MRIs for 726 TCGA-BRCA patients, who lacked actual MRIs, using their multi-omic profiles. Evaluation metrics such as Frechet’s Inception Distance (FID), Mean Square Error (MSE), and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) demonstrated the CPDM’s effectiveness, with an FID of 2.02, MSE of 0.02, and SSIM of 0.59 based on the 15-fold cross-validation. The synthetic MRIs were used to predict clinical attributes, achieving an Area Under the Receiver-Operating-Characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.82 and an Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC) of 0.84 for predicting ER+/HER2+ subtypes. Additionally, the MRIs accurately predicted BC patient survival with a Concordance-index (C-index) score of 0.88, outperforming other baseline models. This research demonstrates the potential of CPDMs in generating MRIs based on BC patients’ genomic profiles, offering valuable insights for radiogenomic research and advancements in precision medicine. The study provides a novel approach to understanding BC heterogeneity for early detection and personalized treatment.

                <p>by Brandon J. Thio, Nathan D. Titus, Nicole A. Pelot, Warren M. Grill</p>

Unmyelinated C-fibers constitute the vast majority of axons in peripheral nerves and play key roles in homeostasis and signaling pain. However, little is known about their ion channel expression, which controls their firing properties. Also, because of their small diameters (~ 1 μm), it has not been possible to characterize their membrane properties using voltage clamp. We developed a novel library of isoform-specific ion channel models to serve as the basis functions of our C-fiber models. We then developed a particle swarm optimization (PSO) framework that used the isoform-specific ion channel models to reverse engineer C-fiber membrane properties from measured autonomic and cutaneous C-fiber conduction responses. Our C-fiber models reproduced experimental conduction velocity, chronaxie, action potential duration, intracellular threshold, and paired pulse recovery cycle. The models also matched experimental activity-dependent slowing, a property not included in model optimization. We found that simple conduction responses, characterizing the action potential, were controlled by similar membrane properties in both the autonomic and cutaneous C-fiber models, but complicated conduction response, characterizing the afterpotenials, were controlled by differential membrane properties. The unmyelinated C-fiber models constitute important tools to study autonomic signaling, assess the mechanisms of pain, and design bioelectronic devices. Additionally, the novel reverse engineering approach can be applied to generate models of other neurons where voltage clamp data are not available.

The placenta is crucial for a successful pregnancy, facilitating oxygen exchange and nutrient transport between mother and fetus. Complications like fetal growth restriction and pre-eclampsia are linked to placental vascular structure abnormalities, highlighting the need for early detection of placental health issues. Computational modelling offers insights into how vascular architecture correlates with flow and oxygenation in both healthy and dysfunctional placentas. These models use synthetic networks to represent the multiscale feto-placental vasculature, but current methods lack direct control over key morphological parameters like branching angles, essential for predicting placental dysfunction.
We introduce a novel generative algorithm for creating <i>in silico</i> placentas, allowing user-controlled customisation of feto-placental vasculatures, both as individual components (placental shape, chorionic vessels, placentone) and as a complete structure. The algorithm is physiologically underpinned, following branching laws (i.e. Murray’s Law), and is defined by four key morphometric statistics: vessel diameter, vessel length, branching angle and asymmetry. Our algorithm produces structures consistent with <i>in vivo</i> measurements and <i>ex vivo</i> observations. Our sensitivity analysis highlights how vessel length variations and branching angles play a pivotal role in defining the architecture of the placental vascular network. Moreover, our approach is stochastic in nature, yielding vascular structures with different topological metrics when imposing the same input settings. Unlike previous volume-filling algorithms, our approach allows direct control over key morphological parameters, generating vascular structures that closely resemble real vascular densities and allowing for the investigation of the impact of morphological parameters on placental function in upcoming studies.

Formation of functional organs requires cell–cell communication between different cell lineages and failure in this communication can result in severe developmental defects. Hundreds of possible interacting pairs of proteins are known, but identifying the interacting partners that ensure a specific interaction between 2 given cell types remains challenging. Here, we use the <i>Drosophila</i> leg model and our cell type-specific transcriptomic data sets to uncover the molecular mediators of cell–cell communication between tendon and muscle precursors. Through the analysis of gene expression signatures of appendicular muscle and tendon precursor cells, we identify 2 candidates for early interactions between these 2 cell populations: <i>Amalgam (Ama</i>) encoding a secreted protein and <i>Neurotactin (Nrt)</i> known to encode a membrane-bound protein. Developmental expression and function analyses reveal that: (i) Ama is expressed in the leg myoblasts, whereas Nrt is expressed in adjacent tendon precursors; and (ii) in Ama and Nrt mutants, myoblast-tendon cell–cell association is lost, leading to tendon developmental defects. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Ama acts downstream of the FGFR pathway to maintain the myoblast population by promoting cell survival and proliferation in an Nrt-independent manner. Together, our data pinpoint Ama and Nrt as molecular actors ensuring early reciprocal communication between leg muscle and tendon precursors, a prerequisite for the coordinated development of the appendicular musculoskeletal system.

                Introduction Pharamcological treatment for acute low back pain (ALBP) typically involves opioid drugs, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Methocarbamol is utilized primarily for managing muscle spasms and pain. This systematic review aims to provide an updated synthesis of published literature on the effects of Methocarbamol on pain outcomes in ALBP. Methods This systematic review adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Original articles published until December 2023 were sourced from PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library. Articles focusing on the impact of Methocarbamol on pain outcomes in ALBP patients were included. Results Three studies met the inclusion criteria, published between 2018 and 2023. The total study population comprised 405 ALBP patients, with 163 receiving Methocarbamol. Compared to patients not receiving Methocarbamol, those in the Methocarbamol group showed pain improvement at one week. However, at 30 and 60 minutes after intravenous administration, Methocarbamol was less effective than Diazepam. The primary reported adverse event was nausea. Conclusion When administered in combination with Indomethacin or Naproxen, Methocarbamol shows potential for improving pain outcomes at one week in ALBP patients. However, its efficacy appears inferior to Diazepam in the short-term management of pain

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Visceral feedback from the body is often subconscious, but plays an important role in guiding motivated behaviors. Vagal sensory neurons relay “gut feelings” to noradrenergic (NA) neurons in the caudal nucleus of the solitary tract (cNTS), which in turn project to the anterior ventrolateral bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (vlBNST) and other hypothalamic-limbic forebrain regions. Prior work supports a role for these circuits in modulating memory consolidation and extinction, but a potential role in retrieval of conditioned avoidance remains untested. To examine this, adult male rats underwent passive avoidance conditioning. We then lesioned gut-sensing vagal afferents by injecting cholecystokinin-conjugated saporin toxin (CSAP) into the vagal nodose ganglia (Experiment 1), or lesioned NA inputs to the vlBNST by injecting saporin toxin conjugated to an antibody against dopamine-beta hydroxylase (DSAP) into the vlBNST (Experiment 2). When avoidance behavior was later assessed, rats with vagal CSAP lesions or NA DSAP lesions displayed significantly increased conditioned passive avoidance. These new findings support the view that gut vagal afferents and the cNTS<sup>NA</sup>-to-vlBNST circuit play a role in modulating the expression/retrieval of learned passive avoidance. Overall, our data suggest a dynamic modulatory role of vagal sensory feedback to the limbic forebrain in integrating interoceptive signals with contextual cues that elicit conditioned avoidance behavior.</p>

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The hippocampus (HC) is recognized for its pivotal role in memory-related plasticity and facilitating adaptive behavioral responses to reward shifts. However, the nature of its involvement in the response to reward downshifts remains to be determined. To bridge this knowledge gap, we explored the HC's function through a series of experiments in various tasks involving reward downshifts and using several neural manipulations in rats. In Experiment 1, complete excitotoxic lesions of the HC impaired choice performance in a modified T-maze after reducing the quantity of sugar pellet rewards. In Experiment 2, chemogenetic inhibition of the dorsal HC (dHC) disrupted anticipatory behavior following a food-pellet reward reduction. Experiments 3–5 impaired HC function by using peripheral lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration. This treatment, which induces peripheral inflammation affecting HC function, significantly increased cytokine levels in the dHC (Experiment 3) and impaired anticipatory choice behavior (Experiment 4). None of these dorsal hippocampal manipulations affected consummatory responses in animals experiencing sucrose downshifts. Accordingly, we found no evidence of increased neural activation in either the dorsal or ventral HC, as measured by c-Fos expression, after a sucrose downshift task involving consummatory suppression (Experiment 6). The results highlight the HC's pivotal role in adaptively modulating anticipatory behavior in response to a variety of situations involving frustrative nonreward, while having no effect on adjustments on consummatory behavior. The data supporting this conclusion were obtained under heterogeneous experimental conditions derived from a multi-laboratory collaboration, ensuring the robustness and high reproducibility of our findings. Spatial orientation, memory update, choice of reward signals of different values, and anticipatory versus consummatory adjustments to reward downshift are discussed as potential mechanisms that could account for the specific effects observed from HC manipulations.</p>

                Introduction ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) poses significant challenges in cardiovascular care, necessitating rapid and effective reperfusion strategies. The present study assesses the angiographic outcomes of pre-dilatation and thrombus aspiration (PD+TA) versus conventional treatment without thrombus aspiration (NOTA) in patients undergoing PPCI for STEMI. Methods This prospective cohort study included a total of 155 patients, with 78 assigned to the PD+TA group and 77 to the NOTA group. Baseline demographics, cardiovascular risk factors, and angiographic assessments including TIMI flow, TMPG flow, corrected TIMI frame count (CTFC), ST segment changes, and ejection fraction were compared between the groups. Results The PD+TA group exhibited significantly lower systolic (p-value: 0.021) and diastolic blood pressures (p-value: 0.046), better glucose control (p-value: 0.015), and a more pronounced reduction in ST segment elevation (p-value: 0.027) compared to the NOTA group. Although ejection fraction at presentation was similar between groups, the PD+TA group (52.29±8.80%) demonstrated a statistically significant improvement at one-month follow-up from NOTA (49.14±8.20%). TIMI 3 and TMPG 3 flow rates were comparable between groups before and after drug administration, with significant improvements in CTFC observed in the PD+TA group. Conclusion Pre-dilatation and TA during PPCI for STEMI patients may lead to improved acute angiographic outcomes, including enhanced myocardial reperfusion and reduced ischemic burden. The significant improvement in ejection fraction at one-month follow-up further supports the potential benefits of PD+TA in cardiac function recovery. Larger studies with longer-term follow-up are needed to validate these findings and determine the broader clinical implications of TA in STEMI management.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1137/v1?src=rss">Social epidemiology of female breast cancer in the region of Varna-Bulgaria in 2013-2021 – A retrospective study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Female breast cancer remains the most common malignant disease and a leading cause of death worldwide. We aim to follow up on the annual dynamics of its incidence, prevalence and mortality rates in the region of Varna, Bulgaria. Methods Data for the recent retrospective analyses was accessed through the information system of Marko Markov Specialized Hospital for Oncological Diseases of Varna for 2017-2021 and two most recent publications for 2013-2017, in accordance with the Medical University-Varna Ethical committee guidelines. Results The total number of newly registered cases of breast cancer in women aged between 24 and 95 years amounted to 1,341. Mean crude incidence rate in 2017-2021 was 108.83 per 100,000, ranging from 119.89 to 105.25 per 100,000 in 2017 and 2020, respectively. The age group of 61-70 years was most affected (26.55% of the cases). Mean crude prevalence rate during this period was 1496.32 per 100,000, varying from 1447.75 to 1549.71 per 100 000 in 2017 and 2020, respectively. The total number of deaths until the end of 2022 reached 310 with 2018 being the greatest in mortality rate (30.22% of the cases). In 2017-2021, bilateral breast cancer was diagnosed as synchronous in 15 women and metachronous in 9 women. Conclusions The regular regional epidemiological investigations could contribute to the enhancement of the effectiveness and quality of prevention, timely diagnosis and adequate complex treatment.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90465">Robust, fast and accurate mapping of diffusional mean kurtosis</a></h4>

              
                Diffusional kurtosis imaging (DKI) is a methodology for measuring the extent of non-Gaussian diffusion in biological tissue, which has shown great promise in clinical diagnosis, treatment planning, and monitoring of many neurological diseases and disorders. However, robust, fast, and accurate estimation of kurtosis from clinically feasible data acquisitions remains a challenge. In this study, we first outline a new accurate approach of estimating mean kurtosis via the sub-diffusion mathematical framework. Crucially, this extension of the conventional DKI overcomes the limitation on the maximum <i>b</i>-value of the latter. Kurtosis and diffusivity can now be simply computed as functions of the sub-diffusion model parameters. Second, we propose a new fast and robust fitting procedure to estimate the sub-diffusion model parameters using two diffusion times without increasing acquisition time as for the conventional DKI. Third, our sub-diffusion-based kurtosis mapping method is evaluated using both simulations and the Connectome 1.0 human brain data. Exquisite tissue contrast is achieved even when the diffusion encoded data is collected in only minutes. In summary, our findings suggest robust, fast, and accurate estimation of mean kurtosis can be realised within a clinically feasible diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging data acquisition time.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95992">Activation of polycystin-1 signaling by binding of stalk-derived peptide agonists</a></h4>

              
                Polycystin-1 (PC1) is the protein product of the <i>PKD1</i> gene whose mutation causes autosomal dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD). PC1 is an atypical G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) with an autocatalytic GAIN domain that cleaves PC1 into extracellular N-terminal and membrane-embedded C-terminal (CTF) fragments. Recently, activation of PC1 CTF signaling was shown to be regulated by a stalk tethered agonist (TA), resembling the mechanism observed for adhesion GPCRs. Here, synthetic peptides of the first 9- (p9), 17- (p17), and 21-residues (p21) of the PC1 stalk TA were shown to re-activate signaling by a stalkless CTF mutant in human cell culture assays. Novel Peptide Gaussian accelerated molecular dynamics (Pep-GaMD) simulations elucidated binding conformations of p9, p17, and p21 and revealed multiple specific binding regions to the stalkless CTF. Peptide agonists binding to the TOP domain of PC1 induced close TOP-putative pore loop interactions, a characteristic feature of stalk TA-mediated PC1 CTF activation. Additional sequence coevolution analyses showed the peptide binding regions were consistent with covarying residue pairs identified between the TOP domain and the stalk TA. These insights into the structural dynamic mechanism of PC1 activation by TA peptide agonists provide an in-depth understanding that will facilitate the development of therapeutics targeting PC1 for ADPKD treatment.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91313">BMP2 and BMP7 cooperate with H3.3K27M to promote quiescence and invasiveness in pediatric diffuse midline gliomas</a></h4>

              
                Pediatric diffuse midline gliomas (pDMG) are an aggressive type of childhood cancer with a fatal outcome. Their major epigenetic determinism has become clear, notably with the identification of K27M mutations in histone H3. However, the synergistic oncogenic mechanisms that induce and maintain tumor cell phenotype have yet to be deciphered. In 20 to 30% of cases, these tumors have an altered BMP signaling pathway with an oncogenic mutation on the BMP type I receptor ALK2, encoded by <i>ACVR1</i>. However, the potential impact of the BMP pathway in tumors non-mutated for <i>ACVR1</i> is less clear. By integrating bulk, single-cell, and spatial transcriptomic data, we show here that the BMP signaling pathway is activated at similar levels between <i>ACVR1</i> wild-type and mutant tumors and identify BMP2 and BMP7 as putative activators of the pathway in a specific subpopulation of cells. By using both pediatric isogenic glioma lines genetically modified to overexpress H3.3K27M and patients-derived DIPG cell lines, we demonstrate that BMP2/7 synergizes with H3.3K27M to induce a transcriptomic rewiring associated with a quiescent but invasive cell state. These data suggest a generic oncogenic role for the BMP pathway in gliomagenesis of pDMG and pave the way for specific targeting of downstream effectors mediating the K27M/BMP crosstalk.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92994">Peptidoglycan-Chi3l1 interaction shapes gut microbiota in intestinal mucus layer</a></h4>

              
                The balanced gut microbiota in intestinal mucus layer plays an instrumental role in the health of the host. However, the mechanisms by which the host regulates microbial communities in the mucus layer remain largely unknown. Here, we discovered that the host regulates bacterial colonization in the gut mucus layer by producing a protein called Chitinase 3-like protein 1 (Chi3l1). Intestinal epithelial cells are stimulated by the gut microbiota to express Chi3l1. Once expressed, Chi3l1 is secreted into the mucus layer where it interacts with the gut microbiota, specifically through a component of bacterial cell walls called peptidoglycan. This interaction between Chi3l1 and bacteria is beneficial for the colonization of bacteria in the mucus, particularly for Gram-positive bacteria like <i>Lactobacillus</i>. Moreover, a deficiency of Chi3l1 leads to an imbalance in the gut microbiota, which exacerbates colitis induced by dextran sodium sulfate. By performing fecal microbiota transplantation from Villin-cre mice or replenishing <i>Lactobacillus</i> in IEC<sup>∆<i>Chil1</i></sup> mice, we were able to restore their colitis to the same level as that of Villin-cre mice. In summary, this study shows a ‘scaffold model’ for microbiota homeostasis by interaction between intestinal Chi3l1 and bacteria cell wall interaction, and it also highlights that an unbalanced gut microbiota in the intestinal mucus contributes to the development of colitis.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99052">Single turnover transient state kinetics reveals processive protein unfolding catalyzed by Escherichia coli ClpB</a></h4>

              
                <i>Escherichia coli</i> ClpB and <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> Hsp104 are AAA+ motor proteins essential for proteome maintenance and thermal tolerance. ClpB and Hsp104 have been proposed to extract a polypeptide from an aggregate and processively translocate the chain through the axial channel of its hexameric ring structure. However, the mechanism of translocation and if this reaction is processive remains disputed. We reported that Hsp104 and ClpB are non-processive on unfolded model substrates. Others have reported that ClpB is able to processively translocate a mechanically unfolded polypeptide chain at rates over 240 amino acids (aa) per second. Here, we report the development of a single turnover stopped-flow fluorescence strategy that reports on processive protein unfolding catalyzed by ClpB. We show that when translocation catalyzed by ClpB is challenged by stably folded protein structure, the motor enzymatically unfolds the substrate at a rate of ~0.9 aa s<sup>−1</sup> with a kinetic step-size of ~60 amino acids at sub-saturating [ATP]. We reconcile the apparent controversy by defining enzyme catalyzed protein unfolding and translocation as two distinct reactions with different mechanisms of action. We propose a model where slow unfolding followed by fast translocation represents an important mechanistic feature that allows the motor to rapidly translocate up to the next folded region or rapidly dissociate if no additional fold is encountered.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99338">Dynamic basis of lipopolysaccharide export by LptB2FGC</a></h4>

              
                Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) confer resistance against harsh conditions, including antibiotics, in Gram-negative bacteria. The lipopolysaccharide transport (Lpt) complex, consisting of seven proteins (A-G), exports LPS across the cellular envelope. LptB<sub>2</sub>FG forms an ATP-binding cassette transporter that transfers LPS to LptC. How LptB<sub>2</sub>FG couples ATP binding and hydrolysis with LPS transport to LptC remains unclear. We observed the conformational heterogeneity of LptB<sub>2</sub>FG and LptB<sub>2</sub>FGC in micelles and/or proteoliposomes using pulsed dipolar electron spin resonance spectroscopy. Additionally, we monitored LPS binding and release using laser-induced liquid bead ion desorption mass spectrometry. The β-jellyroll domain of LptF stably interacts with the LptG and LptC β-jellyrolls in both the apo and vanadate-trapped states. ATP binding at the cytoplasmic side is allosterically coupled to the selective opening of the periplasmic LptF β-jellyroll domain. In LptB<sub>2</sub>FG, ATP binding closes the nucleotide binding domains, causing a collapse of the first lateral gate as observed in structures. However, the second lateral gate, which forms the putative entry site for LPS, exhibits a heterogeneous conformation. LptC binding limits the flexibility of this gate to two conformations, likely representing the helix of LptC as either released from or inserted into the transmembrane domains. Our results reveal the regulation of the LPS entry gate through the dynamic behavior of the LptC transmembrane helix, while its β-jellyroll domain is anchored in the periplasm. This, combined with long-range ATP-dependent allosteric gating of the LptF β-jellyroll domain, may ensure efficient and unidirectional transport of LPS across the periplasm.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96445">Super-enhancer-driven ZFP36L1 promotes PD-L1 expression in infiltrative gastric cancer</a></h4>

              
                Gastric cancer (GC) is a major cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Despite the widespread recognition of tumor immunotherapy in treating unresectable GC, challenges, including ineffective immunotherapy and drug resistance, persist. Therefore, understanding the regulatory mechanisms of PD-L1, particularly in the context of super-enhancers (SEs) and zinc finger protein 36 ring finger protein-like 1 (ZFP36L1) RNA-binding protein, is crucial. In this study, we performed H3K27ac Cleavage Under Targets and Tagmentation (CUT&amp;Tag) sequencing, investigated the heterogeneity of SEs between two GC subtypes with differential growth patterns, and revealed the immune escape signatures driven by ZFP36L1-SE in infiltrative GC through SEs inhibitors treatment. The regulation of ZFP36L1 to PD-L1 was evaluated by quantitative PCR, western blot, flow cytometry, and immunohistochemistry. Furthermore, we explored its regulatory mechanisms using a combination of molecular biology techniques, including luciferase reporter assay, GST/RNA pull-down, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)/RIP experiments, and in vivo functional assays. We demonstrated that ZFP36L1, driven by an SE, enhances IFN-γ-induced PD-L1 expression, with SPI1 identified as the specific transcription factor binding to ZFP36L1-SE. Mechanistically, ZFP36L1 binds to the adenylate uridylate-rich element in the 3ʹ untranslated region (3ʹUTR) of <i>HDAC3</i> mRNA, exacerbating its mRNA decay, and thereby facilitating PD-L1 abnormal transcriptional activation. Collectively, our findings provide mechanistic insights into the role of the SPI1-ZFP36L1-HDAC3-PD-L1 signaling axis in orchestrating immune escape mechanisms in GC, thereby offering valuable insights into the potential targets for immune checkpoint therapy in GC management.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93534">Interchromosomal segmental duplication drives translocation and loss of P. falciparum histidine-rich protein 3</a></h4>

              
                Most malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) detect <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> histidine-rich protein 2 (PfHRP2) and PfHRP3, but deletions of <i>pfhrp2</i> and <i>phfrp3</i> genes make parasites undetectable by RDTs. We analyzed 19,313 public whole-genome-sequenced <i>P. falciparum</i> field samples to understand these deletions better. <i>Pfhrp2</i> deletion only occurred by chromosomal breakage with subsequent telomere healing. <i>Pfhrp3</i> deletions involved loss from <i>pfhrp3</i> to the telomere and showed three patterns: no other associated rearrangement with evidence of telomere healing at breakpoint (Asia; Pattern 13<sup>-</sup>TARE1); associated with duplication of a chromosome 5 segment containing multidrug-resistant-1 gene (Asia; Pattern 13<sup>-</sup>5<sup>++</sup>); and most commonly, associated with duplication of a chromosome 11 segment (Americas/Africa; Pattern 13<sup>-</sup>11<sup>++</sup>). We confirmed a 13–11 hybrid chromosome with long-read sequencing, consistent with a translocation product arising from recombination between large interchromosomal ribosome-containing segmental duplications. Within most 13<sup>-</sup>11<sup>++</sup> parasites, the duplicated chromosome 11 segments were identical. Across parasites, multiple distinct haplotype groupings were consistent with emergence due to clonal expansion of progeny from intrastrain meiotic recombination. Together, these observations suggest negative selection normally removes 13<sup>-</sup>11<sup>++</sup><i>pfhrp3 deletions</i>, and specific conditions are needed for their emergence and spread including low transmission, findings that can help refine surveillance strategies.

">Electrical diversity of neurons in sensory cortices</a></h4>

              
                The classification of neuronal types is a complex task with numerous molecular, anatomical, and functional (electrical) features have been identified as informative in discriminating neuronal populations. The functional characterization of neurons has traditionally been carried out with predefined sets of parameters such as firing rate and action potential generation threshold. Here we provide an objective method to choose what parameters are most informative about the functional cell type of a neuron. Using this method we show that despite the significant molecular and anatomical variability across neurons, functional characterization of neuronal activity identifies 9 and 11 distinct neuronal subpopulations in the upper layers of the somatosensory and visual cortices respectively. This novel classification method will help to unravel the functional (electrophysiological) diversity of cellular classes throughout the nervous system. Further, the thorough comparison between the different classes of cells will provide a solid building block for the study of the sensory cortices.

">Striatal cell-type-specific molecular signatures reveal therapeutic targets in a model of dystonia</a></h4>

              
                Striatal dysfunction is implicated in many forms of dystonia, including idiopathic, inherited and iatrogenic dystonias. The striatum is comprised largely of GABAergic spiny projection neurons (SPNs) that are defined by their long-range efferents. Direct SPNs (dSPNs) project to the internal globus pallidus/substantia nigra reticulata whereas indirect pathway SPNs (iSPNs) project to the external pallidum; the concerted activity of both SPN subtypes modulates movement. Convergent results from genetic, imaging and physiological studies in patients suggest that abnormalities of both dSPNs and iSPNs contribute to the expression of dystonia, but the molecular adaptations underlying these abnormalities are not known. Here we provide a comprehensive analysis of SPN cell-type specific molecular signatures in a model of DOPA-responsive dystonia (DRD mice), which is caused by gene defects that reduce dopamine neurotransmission, resulting in dystonia that is specifically associated with striatal dysfunction. Individually profiling the translatome of dSPNs and iSPNs using translating ribosome affinity purification with RNA-seq revealed hundreds of differentially translating mRNAs in each SPN subtype in DRD mice, yet there was little overlap between the dysregulated genes in dSPNs and iSPNs. Despite the paucity of shared adaptations, a disruption in glutamatergic signaling was predicted for both dSPNs and iSPNs. Indeed, we found that both AMPA and NMDA receptor-mediated currents were enhanced in dSPNs but diminished in iSPNs in DRD mice. The pattern of mRNA dysregulation was specific to dystonia as the adaptations in DRD mice were distinct from those in parkinsonian mice where the dopamine deficit occurs in adults, suggesting that the phenotypic outcome is dependent on both the timing of the dopaminergic deficit and the SPN-specific adaptions. We leveraged the unique molecular signatures of dSPNs and iSPNs in DRD mice to identify biochemical mechanisms that may be targets for therapeutics, including LRRK2 inhibition. Administration of the LRRK2 inhibitor MLi-2 ameliorated the dystonia in DRD mice suggesting a novel target for therapeutics and demonstrating that the delineation of cell-type specific molecular signatures provides a powerful approach to revealing both CNS dysfunction and therapeutic targets in dystonia.

                Apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) is the leading genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. While most studies examine the role of APOE4 in aging, imaging, and cognitive assessments reveal that APOE4 influences brain structure and function as early as infancy. Here, we examined human-relevant cellular phenotypes across neurodevelopment using induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) derived cortical and ganglionic eminence organoids (COs and GEOs). In COs, we showed that APOE4 decreased BRN2+ and SATB2+ cortical neurons, increased astrocytes and outer radial glia, and was associated with increased cell death and dysregulated GABA-related gene expression. In GEOs, APOE4 accelerated maturation of neural progenitors and neurons. Multi-electrode array recordings in assembloids revealed that APOE4 disrupted network formation and altered response to GABA, resulting in heightened excitability and synchronicity. Together, our data provides new insights into how APOE4 may influence cortical neurodevelopmental processes and network formation in the human brain.

">Reward and punishment contingency shifting reveals distinct roles for VTA dopamine and GABA neurons in behavioral flexibility</a></h4>

              
                In dynamic environments where stimuli predicting rewarding or aversive outcomes unexpectedly change, it is critical to flexibly update behavior while preserving recollection of previous associations. Dopamine and GABA neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) are implicated in reward and punishment learning, yet little is known about how each population adapts when the predicted outcome valence changes. We measured VTA dopamine and GABA population activity while male and female rats learned to associate three discrete auditory cues to three distinct outcomes: reward, punishment, or no outcome within the same session. After learning, the reward and punishment cue-outcome contingencies were reversed, and subsequently re-reversed. As expected, the dopamine population rapidly adapted to learning and contingency reversals by increasing the response to appetitive stimuli and decreasing the response to aversive stimuli. In contrast, the GABA population increased activity to all sensory events regardless of valence, including the neutral cue. Reversing learned contingencies selectively influenced GABA responses to the reward-predictive cue, prolonging increased activity within and across sessions. The observed valence-specific dissociations in the directionality and temporal progression of VTA dopamine and GABA calcium activity indicates that these populations are independently recruited and serve distinct roles during appetitive and aversive associative learning and contingency reversal.

">Spatiotemporal characterisation of information coding and exchange in the multiple demand network</a></h4>

              
                The multiple-demand network (MDN), a brain-wide system with nodes near sensory and higher-order cognitive regions, has been suggested to integrate and exchange task-related information across the brain, supporting cognitive task performance. However, the profile of information coding and the role of each node within this network in information exchange remain unclear. To address this, we combined fMRI and MEG data in a challenging stimulus-response mapping task. Using multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA), we decoded various forms of task information, including coarse and fine stimulus details, motor responses, and stimulus-response mapping rules, across the MDN and visual regions. Early in the task, visual regions responded to large physical differences in stimuli, while later on, fine stimulus information and rules were encoded across the MDN. To assess information exchange between regions, we developed Fusion-RCA, a novel connectivity analysis method based on fMRI-MEG fusion profiles. Our findings revealed significant transfer of fine stimulus information, rules, and responses, but little evidence for the transfer of coarse stimulus information. These results highlight distinct information encoding patterns within MDN nodes and suggest that the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) plays a key role in distributing task-relevant information. This study offers new insights into the dynamic function of the MDN and introduces Fusion-RCA as a powerful tool for exploring brain-wide information transfer.

">Neural mechanisms of the transition from planning to execution in speech production</a></h4>

              
                The neural basis of speech production involves the rapid transition from abstract planning of speech units such as syllables and phonemes, to the motor execution of speech sounds. Although a distributed network of brain regions has been implicated in speech production overall, it is unclear how the brain transitions from planning to execution for speech production. Leveraging the high spatio-temporal resolution of intracranial recordings, we find evidence for neural mechanisms that operate in space and time across the prefrontal and premotor cortices to facilitate the transition from planning to execution. During this execution, we show evidence for motor sequencing from neural activity that tracks both phonological units as well as the transition between them, suggesting both discrete elements from planning as well as continuous motor transitions. We demonstrate temporally-resolved neural mechanisms for the transition between planning and execution to facilitate speech production.

">Local cortical inhibitory subnetworks are shaped by pyramidal neuron progenitor type</a></h4>

              
                The degree to which cortical neurons share inhibitory synaptic input determines their co-activity within a network. However, the principles by which inhibition is shared between neurons are not known. Here we combine in utero labeling with in vivo two-photon targeted patch-clamp recordings in mature cortex to reveal that a layer 2/3 (L2/3) pyramidal neuron's local inhibitory input reflects the embryonic progenitor type from which the neuron is born. In contrast to neighboring neurons, pyramidal neurons derived from intermediate progenitors receive synaptic inhibition that is weakly coupled to local network activity. The underlying mechanisms do not depend upon the amount of inhibitory input received from different interneuron subclasses. Rather, progenitor type defines how much inhibitory input a neuron shares with its neighbors, which is reflected in how individual interneurons target pyramidal neurons according to progenitor type. These findings reveal new significance for progenitor diversity and identify ontogenetic origins of fine-scale inhibitory cortical subnetworks.

">TAOK2 Drives Opposing Cilia Length Deficits in 16p11.2 Deletion and Duplication Carriers</a></h4>

              
                Copy number variation (CNV) in the 16p11.2 (BP4-BP5) genomic locus is strongly associated with autism. Carriers of 16p11.2 deletion and duplication exhibit several common behavioral and social impairments, yet, show opposing brain structural changes and body mass index. To determine cellular mechanisms that might contribute to these opposing phenotypes, we performed quantitative tandem mass tag (TMT) proteomics on human dorsal forebrain neural progenitor cells (NPCs) differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) derived from 16p11.2 CNV carriers. Differentially phosphorylated proteins between unaffected individuals and 16p11.2 CNV carriers were significantly enriched for centrosomal and cilia proteins. Deletion patient-derived NPCs show increased primary cilium length compared to unaffected individuals, while stunted cilium growth was observed in 16p11.2 duplication NPCs. Through cellular shRNA and overexpression screens in human iPSC derived NPCs, we determined the contribution of genes within the 16p11.2 locus to cilium length. TAOK2, a serine threonine protein kinase, and PPP4C, a protein phosphatase, were found to regulate primary cilia length in a gene dosage-dependent manner. We found TAOK2 was localized at centrosomes and the base of the primary cilium, and NPCs differentiated from TAOK2 knockout iPSCs had longer cilia. In absence of TAOK2, there was increased pericentrin at the basal body, and aberrant accumulation of IFT88 at the ciliary distal tip. Further, pharmacological inhibition of TAO kinase activity led to increased ciliary length, indicating that TAOK2 negatively controls primary cilium length through its catalytic activity. These results implicate aberrant cilia length in the pathophysiology of 16p11.2 CNV, and establish the role of TAOK2 kinase as a regulator of primary cilium length.

">Oxytocin Gαi signaling-induced amygdala astrocytes processes retraction shapes behavioral stress response</a></h4>

              
                Anticipated reactions to stressful situations are vital for the survival and well-being of organisms, and abnormal reactions are involved in stress-related disorders. The neuropeptide oxytocin is a key modulator ensuring well-adapted stress responses. Oxytocin acts on both neurons and astrocytes, but the molecular and cellular mechanisms mediating stress response remain poorly understood. Here, we focus on the amygdala, a crucial hub that integrates and processes sensory information through oxytocin-dependent mechanisms. Using an acute stress paradigm in mice, genetic and pharmacological manipulations combined with proteomic, morphological, electrophysiological and behavioral approaches, we reveal that oxytocinergic modulation of the freezing response to stress is mediated by transient Gi-dependent retraction of astrocytic processes, followed by enhanced neuronal sensitivity to extracellular potassium in the amygdala. Our findings elucidate a pivotal role for astrocytes morphology-dependent modulation of brain circuits that is required for proper anticipated behavioral response to stressful situations.

">Molecular states underlying neuronal cell type development and plasticity in the whisker cortex</a></h4>

              
                Mouse whisker somatosensory cortex (wS1) is a major model system to study the experience-dependent plasticity of cortical neuron physiology, morphology, and sensory coding. However, the role of sensory experience in regulating neuronal cell type development and gene expression in wS1 remains poorly understood. We assembled and annotated a transcriptomic atlas of wS1 during postnatal development comprising 45 molecularly distinct neuronal types that can be grouped into eight excitatory and four inhibitory neuron subclasses. Using this atlas, we examined the influence of whisker experience from postnatal day (P) 12, the onset of active whisking, to P22, on the maturation of molecularly distinct cell types. During this developmental period, when whisker experience was normal, ~250 genes were regulated in a neuronal subclass-specific fashion. At the resolution of neuronal types, we found that only the composition of layer (L) 2/3 glutamatergic neuronal types, but not other neuronal types, changed substantially between P12 and P22. These compositional changes resemble those observed previously in the primary visual cortex (V1), and the temporal gene expression changes were also highly conserved between the two regions. In contrast to V1, however, cell type maturation in wS1 is not substantially dependent on sensory experience, as 10-day full-face whisker deprivation did not influence the transcriptomic identity and composition of L2/3 neuronal types. A one-day competitive whisker deprivation protocol also did not affect cell type identity but induced moderate changes in plasticity-related gene expression. Thus, developmental maturation of cell types is similar in V1 and wS1, but sensory deprivation minimally affects cell type development in wS1.

">Hippocampal ripples during offline periods predict human motor sequence learning</a></h4>

              
                High-frequency bursts in the hippocampus, known as ripples (80-120 Hz in humans), have been shown to support episodic memory processes. However, converging recent evidence in rodent models as well as human neuroimaging suggests that the hippocampus may be involved in a wider range of memory domains, including motor sequence learning (MSL). Nevertheless, no direct link between hippocampal ripples and MSL has yet been established. Here, we recorded intracranial electroencephalography from the hippocampus in 20 epilepsy patients during a MSL task in which participants showed steady improvement across nine 30-second training blocks interspersed with 30-second rest (offline) periods. We first demonstrate that ripple rates strongly increase during rest periods relative to training blocks. Importantly, ripple rates during rest periods tracked learning behaviour, both across blocks and across participants. These results suggest that hippocampal ripples during offline periods play a functional role in motor sequence learning and that the hippocampus may be involved in offline learning beyond episodic memory.

">Contrastive functional connectivity defines neurophysiology-informed symptom dimensions in major depression</a></h4>

              
                Background: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a prevalent psychiatric disorder characterized by substantial clinical and neurobiological heterogeneity. Conventional studies that solely focus on clinical symptoms or neuroimaging metrics often fail to capture the intricate relationship between these modalities, limiting their ability to disentangle the complexity in MDD. Moreover, patient neuroimaging data typically contains normal sources of variance shared with healthy controls, which can obscure disorder-specific variance and complicate the delineation of disease heterogeneity. Methods: We employed contrastive principal component analysis to extract disorder-specific variations in fMRI-based resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) by contrasting MDD patients (N=233) with age-matched healthy controls (N=285). We then applied sparse canonical correlation analysis to identify latent dimensions in the disorder variations by linking the extracted contrastive connectivity features to clinical symptoms in MDD patients. Results: Two significant and generalizable dimensions linking distinct brain circuits and clinical profiles were discovered. The first dimension, associated with an apparent internalizing-externalizing symptom dimension, was characterized by self-connections within the visual network and also associated with choice reaction times of cognitive tasks. The second dimension, associated with personality facets such as extraversion and conscientiousness typically inversely associated with depression symptoms, is primarily driven by self-connections within the dorsal attention network. This depression-protective personality dimension is also associated with multiple cognitive task performances related to psychomotor slowing and cognitive control. Conclusions: Our contrastive RSFC-based dimensional approach offers a new avenue to dissect clinical heterogeneity underlying MDD. By identifying two stable, neurophysiology-informed symptom dimensions in MDD patients, our findings may enhance disease mechanism insights and facilitate precision phenotyping, thus advancing the development of targeted therapeutics for precision mental health.

                Introduction: Abnormalities in goal-directed behavior, mediated by mesocorticolimbic reward function and structure, contribute to worse clinical outcomes including higher risk of treatment dropout and drug relapse in opioid users (OU). Material and Method: In a sham-controlled randomized study design, we measured whether robot-assisted 10Hz transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) applied to the prefrontal cortex was able to modulate anterior midcingulate cortex (MCC) electrophysiological response to rewards, in OU and matched healthy controls. Results: We show that OU exhibit a blunted anterior MCC reward response, compared to healthy controls (t(39) = 2.62, p = 0.01, d = 0.84), and that this is normalized following 10-Hz excitatory TMS (t(36) = .82, p = 0.42, d = 0.17). Conclusions: Excitatory TMS modulated the putative reward function of the MCC in OU. Further work with increased sample sizes and TMS sessions is required to determine whether restoring MCC reward function increases reward-directed behaviors, which may enhance treatment success through the maintenance of treatment goals.

">Neural correlates differ between crystallized and fluid intelligence in adolescents</a></h4>

              
                Fluid and crystallized intelligence are acknowledged as distinct facets of cognitive ability during brain development, but the specific neural substrates and molecular mechanisms underlying them remain unclear. This study used a sample comprising 7471 young adolescents (mean age 9.87 years, SD = 0.62) from the ABCD cohort to elucidate the differential neural correlates of fluid and crystallized intelligence. Our findings indicated that micro-level brain MRI phenotypes such as water diffusivity were closely associated with fluid intelligence, whereas macro-level brain MRI phenotypes such as gray matter cortical thickness were indicative of crystallized intelligence. We further investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying fluid and crystallized intelligence by correlating the characteristic MRI markers with spatial transcriptome profiles and PET imaging. Results showed that fluid intelligence had significant associations with serotonin and glutamate system, while crystallized intelligence was related to serotonin, dopamine and acetylcholine system. Furthermore, we examined the impacts of lifestyle factors on these two forms of intelligence and how the molecular pathways mediated these impacts. Our investigation suggested that physical activities, screen use and sleep duration influenced fluid intelligence mainly through mGlu5 receptors and crystallized intelligence through 5HT1a and D2 receptors. In conclusion, these findings illustrated a distinct neural basis between fluid and crystallized intelligence from the perspectives of neuroimaging, neurotransmitters, and lifestyles in young adolescents.

">Ketamine reverses chronic stress-induced behavioral changes via the expression of Ca2+-permeable AMPA receptors in mice</a></h4>

              
                Chronic stress affects brain functions leading to the development of mental disorders like anxiety and depression, as well as cognitive decline and social dysfunction. Among many biological changes in chronically stressed brains, disruptions in AMPA Receptor (AMPAR)-mediated synaptic transmission in the hippocampus are associated with stress responses. We have revealed that low-dose ketamine rapidly induces the expression of GluA1-containing, GluA2-lacking Ca2+-Permeable AMPARs (CP-AMPARs), which enhances glutamatergic synaptic strength in hippocampal neurons. Additionally, subanesthetic low-dose ketamine decreases anxiety- and depression-like behaviors in naive animals. In addition to reducing depression, some research indicates that ketamine may have protective effects against chronic stress in both humans and animals. However, the role of CP-AMPARs in the actions of ketamine's antistress effects is largely unknown. Here, we use whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from CA1 pyramidal neurons in female and male hippocampal slices to affirm that subanesthetic low-dose ketamine treatment induces CP-AMPAR expression in these cells. Using multiple behavioral assays including reciprocal social interaction, contextual fear conditioning, and tail suspension test, we demonstrate that low-dose ketamine treatment reverses chronic restraint stress (CRS)-induced social dysfunction, hippocampus-dependent fear memory loss, and depression-like behavior in both female and male mice. Furthermore, we show that the ketamine-induced antistress effects on these behaviors are dependent on CP-AMPAR expression. From this, our findings suggest that subanesthetic low-dose ketamine rapidly triggers the expression of CP-AMPARs in the hippocampus, which in turn enhances synaptic strength to induce antidepressant and antistress effects.

">Suppressive interactions between nearby stimuli in visual cortex reflect crowding</a></h4>

              
                Crowding is a phenomenon in which visual object identification is impaired by the close proximity of other stimuli. The neural processes leading to object recognition and its breakdown as seen in crowding are still debated. To assess how crowding affects the processing of stimuli in the visual cortex, we recorded steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) elicited by flickering target and flanker stimuli while manipulating the spacing of these stimuli (Experiment 1) as well as target similarity (Experiment 2). Participants performed an orientation discrimination task while accuracy and speed of behavioural responses, along with frequency-tagged SSVEPs elicited by target and flanker stimuli, were recorded. Decreasing target-flanker distance reduced both behavioural performance and target-elicited SSVEP amplitudes. Estimates of the critical spacing, a measure of the spatial extent of crowding, from both behavioural data and SSVEP amplitudes were similar. Additionally, manipulating target similarity affected both measures in the same way. These findings establish a clear connection between the suppression of stimulus processing by nearby flankers in the visual cortex and crowding, and demonstrate the usefulness of SSVEPs in studying the cortical mechanisms of visual crowding.

">Presynaptic filopodia form kinapses and modulate membrane mechanics for synchronous neurotransmission and seizure generation.</a></h4>

              
                The structural stability of synapses directly contrasts with their functional plasticity. This conceptual dichotomy is explained by the assumption that all synaptic plasticity is generated via either electrical and/or biochemical signaling. Here, we challenge this dogma by revealing an activity-dependent presynaptic response that is physical in nature. We show that dynamic filopodia emerge during action potential discharge and transiently deform synaptic boutons to enhance connectivity. Filopodia generation requires neuronal activity, calcium and actin, and occurs in intact brain circuits and human brain. Mechanistically, their extension preserves synchronous neurotransmitter release by increasing presynaptic membrane tension. However, filopodia generation becomes maladaptive during dysregulated brain activity, exacerbating seizures in vivo. Therefore, we provide direct evidence that presynaptic mechanical forces determine the extent and timing of synaptic signals.

">Regional deficits in endogenous regeneration of mouse olfactory sensory neuron axons</a></h4>

              
                Postnatal neurogenesis occurs in only a few regions of the mammalian nervous system. Hence, neurons that are lost due to neurodegenerative disease, stroke, traumatic brain injury or peripheral neuropathy cannot be replaced. Transplantation of stem cell-derived neurons provides a potential replacement strategy, but how these neurons can be encouraged to functionally integrate into circuits remains a significant challenge. In the mammalian olfactory epithelium (OE), olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) continue to be generated throughout life from basal stem cells and can be repopulated even after complete ablation. However, the specialized population of navigator OSNs that ensures accurate odorant receptor-specific targeting of OSN axons to glomeruli in the olfactory bulb (OB) is only present perinatally. Despite this, some studies have reported complete regeneration of specific glomeruli, while others have found various degrees of recovery, following OSN cell death. Variability in the extent of both initial OSN ablation and subsequent repopulation of the OE, and the focus on anatomical recovery, leave the extent to which newly generated OSNs can reinnervate the OB unclear. Here, we employed the olfactotoxic drug methimazole to selectively ablate OSNs without damaging the basal stem cells that generate them, enabling us to assess the extent of functional recovery of OSN input to the OB in the context of complete OSN repopulation. We found profound deficits in the recovery of odor-evoked responses in OSN axons in the glomerular layer of the dorsal OB five weeks after OSN ablation, a time point at which OSNs are known to have repopulated the OE. Histological analysis of mature OSN axons in the OB at 10 and 20 weeks post-methimazole showed a persistent region-specific deficit in OSN axon reinnervation of the dorsal OB, with the dorsomedial region being particularly adversely affected. In contrast, reinnervation of the ventral, lateral and medial regions of the OB was almost complete by 10 weeks post-MMZ. Hence, we have identified a region-specific deficit in OSN reinnervation of the mouse OB, which sets the stage to identify the mechanisms that mediate successful vs. unsuccessful axonal regeneration in an endogenous population of stem cell-derived neurons.

">Investigating Mechanically Activated Currents from Trigeminal Neurons of Non-Human Primates</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Pain sensation has predominantly mechanical modalities in many pain conditions. Mechanically activated (MA) ion channels on sensory neurons underly responsiveness to mechanical stimuli. The study aimed to address gaps in knowledge regarding MA current properties in higher order species such as non-human primates (NHP; common marmosets), and characterization of MA currents in trigeminal (TG) neuronal subtypes. Methods: We employed patch clamp electrophysiology and immunohistochemistry (IHC) to associate MA current types to different marmoset TG neuronal groups. TG neurons were grouped according to presumed marker expression, action potential (AP) width, characteristic AP features, after-hyperpolarization parameters, presence/absence of AP trains and transient outward currents, and responses to mechanical stimuli. Results: Marmoset TG were clustered into 5 C-fiber and 5 A-fiber neuronal groups. The C1 group likely represent non-peptidergic C-nociceptors, the C2-C4 groups resembles peptidergic C-nociceptors, while the C5 group could be either cold-nociceptors or C-low-threshold-mechanoreceptors (C-LTMR). Among C-fiber neurons only C4 were mechanically responsive. The A1 and A2 groups are likely A-nociceptors, while the A3-A5 groups probably denote different subtypes of A-low-threshold-mechanoreceptors (A-LTMRs). Among A-fiber neurons only A1 was mechanically unresponsive. IHC data was correlated with electrophysiology results and estimates that NHP TG has ~25% peptidergic C-nociceptors, ~20% non-peptidergic C-nociceptors, ~30% A-nociceptors, ~5% C-LTMR, and ~20% A-LTMR. Conclusion: Overall, marmoset TG neuronal subtypes and their associated MA currents have common and unique properties compared to previously reported data. Findings from this study could be the basis for investigation on MA current sensitizations and mechanical hypersensitivity during head and neck pain conditions.

">Multiple context discrimination in adult rats: sex variability and dynamics of time-dependent generalization of an aversive memory</a></h4>

              
                Memory generalization can be defined as the transference of a conditioned fear response to novel contexts. It can be attained rapidly, by manipulating distinct hormonal and neurotransmitter systems, but, more importantly, in a time-dependent manner the interval between training and test sessions affects the quality of retrieved memory, due to a rearrangement in the recruitment of brain regions, as is the case in Systems Consolidation. However, less is known about how female and male subjects retrieve contextual memories over time. In this work, we aimed to investigate how rats of both sexes discriminate among multiple contexts gradually differentiated in similarity to the conditioning one, two days after training. In the pilot study, despite not obtaining, at first, a stepwise series of freezing responses, we found that, strangely, males displayed their higher levels of freezing to the least similar context, while females systematically displayed lower freezing levels compared to males as if they were better discriminators when tested in exact same contexts. With a second set of contexts, sorted according to other criteria, only males, at the 2 days interval, attained a staircase-like response to the successive contexts, while females displayed a completely different freezing pattern; in remote tests, 28 and 45 days later, freezings grouped into two levels, suggesting a partial time-dependent generalization for some of the contexts. Females and males, in discriminating between multiple, dissimilar aversive contexts, seem to deal with threat signals in distinct ways, through different sensory modalities, a clear demonstration of behavioural dimorphism.

">Separate timescales for spatial and anatomical information processing during action observation</a></h4>

              
                Abstract Introduction: Observing actions primes us to perform similar movements. Prior work indicates this effect is influenced by factors such as spatial congruence, perspective, and presenting biological/non-biological stimuli. We hypothesized that the influence of these factors would vary depending on the amount of time that participants had to process visual stimuli. Method: Experiment 1 was a reaction time task (n=29) with stimuli varying in spatial congruence (congruent, incongruent, neutral), perspective (first- or third-person) and stimulus type (biological or non-biological). Experiment 2 (n=50) used the same stimuli in a Forced Response paradigm, which controlled the time participants had to prepare a response. This allowed us to assess responses as a function of preparation time. Results: Experiment 1 showed effects of spatial congruence, with longer reaction times and more errors for spatially incongruent stimuli. This effect was greater for biological stimuli. Experiment 2 showed that spatial information was processed faster than anatomical information, inducing incorrect responses at short preparation times for spatially incongruent biological stimuli. There was little-to-no corresponding effect for non-biological stimuli. Both experiments also showed weak-to-no effects of perspective, which appear to have been driven by spatial congruence. Discussion: Our results indicate that spatial information is processed faster than anatomical information during action observation. These data are consistent with the dual visual streams hypothesis, whereby spatial information would be processed rapidly via the dorsal stream, while anatomical processing would occur later via the ventral stream. These data also indicate differences in processing between biological and non-biological stimuli.

">Neuropeptide-dependent spike time precision and plasticity in circadian output neurons</a></h4>

              
                Circadian rhythms influence various physiological and behavioral processes such as sleep-wake cycles, hormone secretion, and metabolism. Circadian output neurons are a group of neurons that receive input from the central circadian clock located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the mammalian brain and transmit timing information to different regions of the brain and body, coordinating the circadian rhythms of various physiological processes. In Drosophila, an important set of circadian output neurons are called pars intercerebralis (PI) neurons, which receive input from specific clock neurons called DN1. These neurons can further be subdivided into functionally and anatomically distinctive anterior (DN1a) and posterior (DN1p) clusters. The neuropeptide diuretic hormones 31 (Dh31) and 44 (Dh44) are the insect neuropeptides known to activate PI neurons to control activity rhythms. However, the neurophysiological basis of how Dh31 and Dh44 affect circadian clock neural coding mechanisms underlying sleep in Drosophila is not well understood. Here, we identify Dh31/Dh44-dependent spike time precision and plasticity in PI neurons. We find that the application of synthesized Dh31 and Dh44 affects membrane potential dynamics of PI neurons in the precise timing of the neuronal firing through their synergistic interaction, possibly mediated by calcium-activated potassium channel conductance. Further, we characterize that Dh31/Dh44 enhances postsynaptic potentials in PI neurons. Together, these results suggest multiplexed neuropeptide-dependent spike time precision and plasticity as circadian clock neural coding mechanisms underlying sleep in Drosophila.

">Reconcile sensory attenuation and enhancement: The temporal dynamics of self-generated sensory feedback</a></h4>

              
                Self-generated touches are often perceived as weaker than externally generated ones, a phenomenon known as sensory attenuation. However, recent studies have challenged this view by providing evidences that actions could also enhance predicted touch. To investigate this paradox, we examined the temporal dynamics of perceptual processing using steady-state somatosensory evoked potentials (SSSEP) and sliding time window analysis. Results showed that SSSEP in the very early window was smaller in the no-delay and active conditions compared to the delayed and passive condition, respectively, consistent with sensory attenuation. However, this attenuation soon disappeared and reversed in the later windows and onward, indicating an early attenuation followed by a later enhancement. This study resolves the paradox of sensory attenuation and enhancement in self-generated sensory signals by demonstrating that these processes occur at different phases of sensory processing. The findings reveal a sophisticated dynamic balance in sensory processing, facilitating optimal interaction with the environment.

">Local cytokine changes in response to mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles-based therapy in rat spinal cord injury</a></h4>

              
                Aim: To investigate the effects of mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs), encapsulated in a fibrin matrix (FM), on pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokine levels in a rat model of spinal cord injury (SCI) 60 days post-injury. Methods: MSCs were isolated from rat adipose tissue and cultured to obtain MSC-EVs using cytochalasin B. MSC-EVs encapsulated in the FM were applied to the injury site at doses of 5 and 10 ug. Four experimental groups included SCI without treatment, SCI with FM application, and SCI with FM+EVs at 5 and 10 ug doses. A multiplex assay was conducted to measure 23 cytokines in spinal cord tissue homogenates. Results: FM application to the injury site exhibited both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine shifts, with the most pronounced effect for G-CSF (2.8-fold) potentially due to the hemostatic properties of the FM. MSC-EVs led to significant modulation of cytokine levels. In the SCI FM+EVs10 group, concentrations of IL-10, IL-1b, IL-5, and IL-17A were significantly lower compared to the SCI and SCI FM groups. Here the most pronounced change was observed for IL-10, which decreased by 2.4-fold. Conclusion: Combined treatment with MSC-EVs and FM significantly influenced pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine levels, demonstrating a dose-dependent effect. These findings highlight the potential of EVs to modulate inflammatory responses and promote regeneration in the chronic phase of spinal cord injury.

">Continuous lesion images drive more accurate predictions of outcomes after stroke than binary lesion images</a></h4>

              
                Current medicine cannot confidently predict who will recover from post-stroke impairments. Researchers have sought to bridge this gap by treating the post-stroke prognostic problem as a machine learning problem. Consistent with the observation that these impairments are caused by the brain damage that stroke survivors suffer, information concerning where and how much lesion damage they have suffered conveys useful prognostic information for these models. Much recent research has considered how best to encode this lesion information, to maximise its prognostic value. Here, we consider an encoding that, while not novel, has never before been formally examined in this context: 'continuous lesion images', which encode continuous evidence for the presence of a lesion, both within and beyond what might otherwise be considered the boundary of a binary lesion image. Current state of the art models employ information derived from binary lesion images. Here, we show that those models are significantly improved (i.e., with smaller Mean Squared Error between predicted and empirical outcome scores) when using continuous lesion images to predict a wide range of cognitive and language outcomes from a very large sample of stroke patients. We use further model comparisons to locate the predictive advantage to the provision of continuous lesion evidence beyond the boundary of binary lesion images. The continuous lesion images thus provide a straightforward way to incorporate details of both lesioned and non-lesioned tissue when predicting outcomes after stroke.

	<p>Background/Objectives: This study addresses the gap in methodological guidelines for neuroergonomic attention assessment in safety-critical tasks, focusing on validating EEG indices, including the engagement index (EI) and beta/alpha ratio, alongside subjective ratings. Methods: A novel task-embedded reaction time paradigm was developed to evaluate the sensitivity of these metrics to dynamic attentional demands in a more naturalistic multitasking context. By manipulating attention levels through varying secondary tasks in the NASA MATB-II task while maintaining a consistent primary reaction-time task, this study successfully demonstrated the effectiveness of the paradigm. Results: Results indicate that both the beta/alpha ratio and EI are sensitive to changes in attentional demands, with beta/alpha being more responsive to dynamic variations in attention, and EI reflecting more the overall effort required to sustain performance, especially in conditions where maintaining attention is challenging. Conclusions: The potential for predicting the attention lapses through integration of performance metrics, EEG measures, and subjective assessments was demonstrated, providing a more nuanced understanding of dynamic fluctuations of attention in multitasking scenarios, mimicking those in real-world safety-critical tasks. These findings provide a foundation for advancing methods to monitor attention fluctuations accurately and mitigate risks in critical scenarios, such as train-driving or automated vehicle operation, where maintaining a high attention level is crucial.</p>

	<p>Background: Traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) are a common consequence of experiencing intimate partner violence (IPV). IPV-related TBI contributes to adverse health outcomes among women, but it is unknown whether a history of IPV-related TBI negatively impacts safety outcomes following healthcare-based interventions for IPV. Methods: Using data from a larger randomized clinical trial, we explored the impact of IPV-related TBI status on safety-related outcomes in two healthcare-based IPV interventions. At baseline, 35% (n = 21) of the sample screened positive for IPV-related TBI history. We used repeated measures ANOVAs to examine differences in safety outcomes at post-treatment and 1-month follow-up based on treatment condition and IPV-related TBI status. Results: Significant interaction effects were found for safety outcomes, such that women with IPV-related TBI history experienced larger reductions in the frequency of physical IPV and similar reductions in sexual IPV across both treatment conditions compared to women without IPV-TBI (F(2, 102) = 10.88, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001; F(2, 98) = 3.93, p = 0.036). Conclusions: Findings suggest that brief healthcare-based IPV interventions may result in improvements in safety outcomes for women with a history of IPV-TBI. This highlights the continued need for implementation of promising IPV-focused interventions to promote safety and protect women from experiencing further IPV.</p>

	<p>We used numerical methods to define the normative structure of the different stages of sleep and wake (W) in a pilot study of 19 participants without pathology (18&amp;amp;ndash;64 years old) using a double-banana bipolar montage. Artefact-free 120&amp;amp;ndash;240 s epoch lengths were visually identified and divided into 1 s windows with a 10% overlap. Differential channels were grouped into frontal, parieto-occipital, and temporal lobes. For every channel, the power spectrum (PS) was calculated via fast Fourier transform and used to compute the areas for the delta (0&amp;amp;ndash;4 Hz), theta (4&amp;amp;ndash;8 Hz), alpha (8&amp;amp;ndash;13 Hz), and beta (13&amp;amp;ndash;30 Hz) bands, which were log-transformed. Furthermore, Pearson&amp;amp;rsquo;s correlation coefficient and coherence by bands were computed. Differences in logPS and synchronization from the whole scalp were observed between the sexes for specific stages. However, these differences vanished when specific lobes were considered. Considering the location and stages, the logPS and synchronization vary highly and specifically in a complex manner. Furthermore, the average spectra for every channel and stage were very well defined, with phase-specific features (e.g., the sigma band during N2 and N3, or the occipital alpha component during wakefulness), although the slow alpha component (8.0&amp;amp;ndash;8.5 Hz) persisted during NREM and REM sleep. The average spectra were symmetric between hemispheres. The properties of K-complexes and the sigma band (mainly due to sleep spindles&amp;amp;mdash;SSs) were deeply analyzed during the NREM N2 stage. The properties of the sigma band are directly related to the density of SSs. The average frequency of SSs in the frontal lobe was lower than that in the occipital lobe. In approximately 30% of the participants, SSs showed bimodal components in the anterior regions. qEEG can be easily and reliably used to study sleep in healthy participants and patients.</p>

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Topographical projection patterns from the entorhinal cortex to area CA1 of the hippocampus have led to a hypothesis that proximal CA1 (pCA1, closer to CA2) is spatially more selective than distal CA1 (dCA1, closer to the subiculum). While earlier studies have shown evidence supporting this hypothesis, we recently showed that this difference does not hold true under all experimental conditions. In a complex environment with distinct local texture cues on a circular track and global visual cues, pCA1 and dCA1 display comparable spatial selectivity. Correlated with the spatial selectivity differences, the earlier studies also showed differences in theta phase coding dynamics between pCA1 and dCA1 neurons. Here we show that there are no differences in theta phase coding dynamics between neurons in these two regions under the experimental conditions where pCA1 and dCA1 neurons are equally spatially selective. These findings challenge the established notion of dCA1 being inherently less spatially selective and theta modulated than pCA1 and suggest further experiments to understand theta-mediated activation of the CA1 sub-networks to represent space.</p>

<p>Treatment-resistant depression was particularly associated with the functional dysconnectivity of the thalamus with the insula and superior temporal cortex, as well as the anterior paracingulate cortex and cerebellum crus II.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Thalamocortical connectivity is associated with cognitive and affective processing. The role of thalamocortical connectivity in the pathomechanism of treatment-resistant depression (TRD) remains unclear. This study included 48 patients with TRD and 48 healthy individuals. We investigated thalamocortical connectivity by performing resting-state functional MRI with the bilateral thalamus as the seed. In addition, patients with TRD were evaluated using the Montgomery–Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Compared with the healthy individuals, the patients with TRD exhibited increased functional connectivity (FC) of the thalamus with the insula and superior temporal cortex and reduced the FC of the thalamus with the anterior paracingulate cortex and cerebellum crus II. Our study may support the crucial role of thalamocortical dysconnectivity in the TRD pathomechanism. However, the small sample size may limit the statistical power. A future study with a large sample size of patients with TRD would be required to validate our findings.</p>

                Using a targeted CRISPR-Cas9 survival screen, Palakurty et al. identify the very-low-density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR) as a receptor for Western equine encephalitis virus (WEEV) and other related viruses in its antigenic complex.

	<p>Background: Chiari malformation type 1 (CM1) remains a complex neurosurgical condition with ongoing debate regarding its optimal management. Methods: This narrative review examines key controversies surrounding the pathophysiology, surgical indications, and treatment strategies for CM1. Results: We highlight the challenges posed by the wide spectrum of CM variants and the evolving understanding of its association with syringomyelia, basilar invagination, and craniovertebral instability. Emerging surgical techniques, including minimally invasive approaches and the use of new technologies such as endoscopes and exoscopes, are evaluated for their potential to improve outcomes. Recent consensus guidelines are also discussed. Conclusions: The need for individualized treatment plans for CM1 is emphasized, with special focus put on the connection between novel pathophysiological insights, technological advancements and opportunities for a more nuanced surgical management. Further research is necessary to establish solid foundations for more individualized treatments.</p>

                <p>Ischemic stroke (IS) poses a serious threat to patient survival. The inhibition of ferroptosis can effectively alleviate ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury, suggesting potential targets in the ferroptosis pathway for the treatment of IS. In this study, MCAO/R mice and OGD/R-induced HT22 cell were constructed. It was found that baicalein decreased ROS, MDA, and Fe<sup>2+</sup> levels, upregulated GSH levels, and enhanced the expression of ferroptosis-related proteins (GPX4 and SLC7A11), downregulated the expression of proapoptotic proteins (Bax, cytochrome <I>c</I>, and cleaved caspase-3), and upregulated the expression of an antiapoptotic protein (Bcl-2), ameliorating cerebral I/R injury. In animal and cell models, Sirtuin6 (SIRT6) is downregulated, and Forkhead boxA2 (FOXA2) expression and acetylation levels are abnormally upregulated. SIRT6 inhibited FOXA2 expression and acetylation. Baicalein promoted FOXA2 deacetylation by upregulating SIRT6 expression. FOXA2 transcriptionally inhibits SLC7A11 expression. In conclusion, baicalein inhibited apoptosis and partially suppressed the role of ferroptosis to alleviate cerebral I/R injury via SIRT6-mediated FOXA2 deacetylation to promote SLC7A11 expression.</p>

                <p>This article allows readers to assess their ability to detect errors in thinking in seven case histories of psychologists&rsquo; thoughts about cognitive science. It explains the nature of the errors and shows that some of them reflect faulty reasoning. It presents a "model method" to improve reasoning. It is based on the theory of mental models, which gives a general account of how individuals think, both deductively and indicatively, and which postulates that individuals construct mental models of possibilities in the world. The model method enhances both the accuracy and speed of reasoning. The article concludes with some general reflections on the role of knowledge of meanings, the world, and context in thinking.</p>

                Background Health technology assessment (HTA) reports are based on comprehensive information retrieval. Current standards discourage the use of search restrictions, such as publication date and language. Given limited resources, it was unclear whether the effort invested in screening and translating studies published in languages other than English provided relevant additional information compared with the inclusion of English-language publications alone. We therefore analysed the impact of non-English publications on the conclusions of HTA reports produced by the German HTA agency, the Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care (IQWiG). Methods We determined whether non-English publications were included in all HTA reports on non-drug interventions and on selected drug interventions (search period: 01/2011 to 08/2018). If at least one non-English publication was included, we assessed for each endpoint whether or not the exclusion of non-English publications changed the conclusion. If a non-English publication did not contain information relevant to the HTA report, we classified the publication as “not relevant”. Results Of 70 HTA reports, 38 (54%) included 128 non-English publications. In 4 reports (6%) with 50 endpoints investigated in 39 PICO questions, the exclusion of a total of 10 non-English publications led to a change in the conclusions for 13 endpoints (8 PICO questions). This was largely due to the fact that in many cases, non-English publications were the predominant or only literature available, resulting in a lack of analysable data after their exclusion. Conclusions In general, studies published in non-English languages have little influence on the conclusions of HTA reports. For the vast majority of topics, a language restriction to English seems justified. Studies published in non-English languages may be useful in exceptional cases, for example when an intervention is only available in certain countries.

                Background Fluoride-releasing adhesives in orthodontics help protect enamel. The study compared the fluoride release, recharge, and re-release properties of three light-cure orthodontic bonding adhesives: Group A: TransbondTM Plus Color Change, Group B: Waldent Orthobond LC, and Group C: Koden EZ Bond. Methods The study conducted an in-vitro investigation using 24 maxillary first premolar teeth bonded with one of three fluoride-releasing adhesives after etching. Each sample was placed in artificial saliva, and fluoride release was measured over 60 days using a fluoride electrode. After initial release measurement, specimens were soaked in 1000 ppm fluoride solution for 5 minutes, rinsed, and placed in new containers with distilled water before re-release measurements. Statistical Analysis: One-way ANOVA and Repeated Measures ANOVA tests were used to determine significance, with the Bonferroni posthoc test for further analysis. Results The fluoride release rate decreased gradually over time for all three groups. The highest fluoride release occurred on Day 1 for all three bonding agents, with a significantly reduced fluoride release by Day 2. Group A exhibited consistent and highest overall fluoride release throughout the 60 days. Group B gradually declined to release fluoride until Day 7, releasing the least fluoride throughout the study. Group C had a higher fluoride release on Day 1 and Day 2 but slowly declined until Day 14. Group B and Group C sharply declined fluoride release by Day 30 and almost negligible amounts on Day 60. All three agents noted enhanced fluoride release post-recharge, with continuous release until day 14. Greater release on days 7 and 14 compared to the initial release in all three groups. Conclusion Transbond Plus Color Change: Consistent high fluoride was released initially and post-recharge. Waldent Orthobond LC: Lower release throughout the study. Koden EZ Bond: High initial release and post-recharge but continuing to decrease until Day 14.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-601/v2?src=rss">A Case Study on Assessing AI Assistant Competence in Narrative Interviews [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Abstract* Background Researchers are leading the development of AI designed to conduct interviews. These developments imply that AI's role is expanding from mere data analysis to becoming a tool for social researchers to interact with and comprehend their subjects. Yet, academic discussions have not addressed the potential impacts of AI on narrative interviews. In narrative interviews, the method of collecting data is a collaborative effort. The interviewer also contributes to exploring and shaping the interviewee's story. A compelling narrative interviewer has to display critical skills, such as maintaining a specific questioning order, showing empathy, and helping participants delve into and build their own stories. Methods This case study configured an OpenAI Assistant on WhatsApp to conduct narrative interviews with a human participant. The participant shared the same story in two distinct conversations: first, following a standard cycle and answering questions earnestly, and second, deliberately sidetracking the assistant from the main interview path as instructed by the researcher, to test how well the metrics could reflect the deliberate differences between different conversations. The AI's performance was evaluated through conversation analysis and specific narrative indicators, focusing on its adherence to the interview structure, empathy, narrative coherence, complexity, and support for human participant agency. The study sought to answer these questions: 1) How can the proposed metrics help us, as social researchers without a technical background, understand the quality of the AI-driven interviews in this study? 2) What do these findings contribute to our discussion on using AI in narrative interviews for social research? 3) What further research could these results inspire? Results The findings show to what extent the AI maintained structure and adaptability in conversations, illustrating its potential to support personalized, flexible narrative interviews based on specific needs. Conclusions These results suggest that social researchers without a technical background can use observation-based metrics to gauge how well an AI assistant conducts narrative interviews. They also prompt reflection on AI's role in narrative interviews and spark further research.

                Background The intensity and frequency of climate extremes are exacerbating agricultural droughts, particularly impacting smallholder farming. This study assessing daily precipitation and temperature extremes in the context of climate change is crucial for local-scale climate change adaptation. Spatial changes of climate indices from 1981 to 2018 in three different agroecologies in the Hamassa watershed, Ethiopia, were examined based on the World Meteorological Organization’s (WMO) Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices (ETCCDI). Methods We obtained Daily temperature and precipitation data from the Ethiopia National Meteorological Agency (NMA). Additionally, I used data from focus group discussions (FGDs) and key informant interviews (KIIs) to corroborate the findings. We conducted the Mann- Kendall test and Sen’s slope estimation to assess the significance and magnitude of rainfall and extreme temperature changes in the watershed between 1981 and 2018. Furthermore, I examined the correlation between crop and standardized precipitation-evapotranspiration index (SPEI). Results The temperature data indicated that the warming condition is increasing overall agroecologies. However, the extreme indices from rainfall data indicate insignificant positive and negative trends in all agroecological zones (AEZs). The warmest day (Txx) is significantly increasing overall AEZs having magnitude values close to each other, 0.0420c, 0.03960c, and 0.03850c in the highland, midland, and lowland, respectively. The coldest day (Txn) also showed an increasing insignificant and significant trend in the highland, midland, and lowland, respectively. Results of cool days (TX10p) indicate a significant decreasing trend over all three AEZs. The magnitude of the decreasing trend is about -0.040c, -0.0450c, and -0.0360c in highland, midland, and lowland, respectively. Furthermore, the correlation result indicated a strong and significant relationship between crop production and climate variables (SPEI-), which varied degrees across Conclusions Results differ in different agroecologies demanding technical, institutional, and policy responses respective of Agroecologies.

                Background Energy shortages and global warming have been significant issues throughout history. Therefore, the search for environmentally friendly renewable energy sources is crucial for achieving sustainability. Biomass energy is gaining global attention as a renewable energy option, particularly through the process of hydrothermal liquefaction, which converts biomass into bio-crude oil. Methods Hydrothermal liquefaction is a complex process that is challenging to explain, leading to research on machine learning models for this process. These models aim to predict values and investigate the impact of variables on the hydrothermal liquefaction process. However, the development of machine learning in hydrothermal liquefaction is still limited due to its novelty and the time required for comprehensive study. Thus, the objective of this study was to analyze relevant publications in the Scopus database, focusing on indexed ML and HTL keywords, to understand keyword associations and co-citations. Results The results reveal an increasing trend in the study of ML in the HTL process, with a growing interest from various countries. Conclusion Notably, China currently holds the largest share of ML research in HTL processes, with most published works falling within the field of engineering. The keyword “liquefaction” emerges as the most popular term in these publications.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002826">Reviving collapsed plant–pollinator networks from a single species</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Gaurav Baruah, Meike Wittmann</p>

Mutualistic ecological networks can suddenly transition to undesirable states due to small changes in environmental conditions. Recovering from such a collapse can be difficult as restoring the original environmental conditions may be infeasible. Additionally, such networks can also exhibit a phenomenon known as hysteresis, whereby the system could exhibit multiple states under the same environmental conditions, implying that ecological networks may not recover. Here, we attempted to revive collapsed mutualistic networks to a high-functioning state from a single species, using concepts from signal propagation theory and an eco-evolutionary model based on network structures of 115 empirical plant–pollinator networks. We found that restoring the environmental conditions rarely aided in recovery of collapsed networks, but a positive relationship between recovering pollinator density and network nestedness emerged, which was qualitatively supported by empirical plant–pollinator restoration data. In contrast, network resurrection from a collapsed state in undesirable environmental conditions where restoration has minimal impacts could be readily achieved by perturbing a single species or a few species that controls the response of the dynamical networks. Additionally, nestedness in networks and a moderate amount of trait variation could aid in the revival of networks even in undesirable environmental conditions. Our work suggests that focus should be applied to a few species whose dynamics could be steered to resurrect entire networks from a collapsed state and that network architecture could play a crucial role in reviving collapsed plant–pollinator networks.

                Invasive plant species pose ecological threats to native ecosystems, particularly in areas adjacent to roadways, considering that roadways represent lengthy corridors through which invasive species can propagate. Traditional manual survey methods for monitoring invasive plants are labor-intensive and limited in coverage. This paper introduces a high-speed camera system, named CamAlien, designed to be mounted on vehicles for efficient invasive plant species monitoring along roadways. The camera system captures high-quality images at rapid intervals, to monitor the full roadside when following traffic speed. The system utilizes a global shutter sensor to reduce distortion and geotagging for precise localistion. The camera system makes it possible to collect extensive data sets, which can be used for a digital library of the invasive species and their locations, but also subsequent training of machine learning algorithms for automated species recognition.

                Yeasts are widely known for their application in food production, but also because of their clinical significance. As human pathogens, several species of yeasts, mainly of the genus Candida and other closely related genera, are responsible for a great number of life-threatening infections. The occurrence of yeasts in cheeses, including pathogenic species, has been largely studied, yet the antifungal susceptibility of these microorganisms is rarely reported. Here, we identified the species and determined the antifungal susceptibility profile of 45 yeast Candida isolates recovered from artisanal cheeses from 20 cities in Boyacá, Colombia. Among the species, Pichia fermentans (28.9%) prevailed, followed by Pichia kudriavzevii (24.4%), Kluyveromyces marxianus (22.2%), Clavispora lusitaniae (11.1%), Candida inconspicua (6.7%) Candida parapsilosis (4.4%) and Meyerozyma guillermondii (2.2%). Notably, all seven species have been globally reported, to a greater or lesser extent, to cause fungemia and other invasive infections with high mortality rates. Remarkably, together with the intrinsically resistant P. kudriavzevii, most isolates of P. fermentans, C. inconspicua and C. parapsilosis were resistant to fluconazole, one of the most common drugs to treat candidiasis. Our findings highlight the importance of exploring the ecological niches of pathogenic yeasts, together with their antifungal susceptibility, considering that the emergence of resistance in non-commensal opportunistic pathogens poses a serious threat to public health.

                Introduction and Importance Cornual pregnancy (CP) is a rare and dangerous type of ectopic pregnancy, occurring in 2% to 4% of cases. Due to its atypical location in the uterine horn, it poses a high risk for severe complications, such as rupture of the uterus, and life-threatening bleeding, particularly when diagnosis is delayed. Case Presentation We report the case of a 35-year-old female patient presenting with severe pelvic pain and vaginal bleeding, with 12 weeks of amenorrhea. Clinical evaluation revealed elevated β-HCG levels and transvaginal ultrasound showed a 7-week unruptured right cornual pregnancy. Surgical management involved a mini-laparotomy, which confirmed the diagnosis and a cornuostomy along with a right salpingectomy was performed. The patient’s postoperative course was uneventful, and follow-up confirmed complete recovery. Clinical Discussion Cornual pregnancies, though rare, carry a significant risk of serious complications and maternal death due to delayed diagnosis. Risk factors encompass a history of miscarriage, elective abortion, sexually transmitted infections, and smoking, all contributing to abnormal implantation. Early diagnosis is challenging but crucial, with ultrasound being key for detection. Management depends on gestational age, patient stability, and future reproductive plans, with methotrexate or surgical intervention being standard options. Conclusion Cornual pregnancy, despite its rarity, demands prompt and accurate diagnosis to prevent catastrophic outcomes. This case underscores the need for individualized treatment strategies and highlights the importance of early intervention. Ongoing research is vital to improving diagnostic approaches and therapeutic outcomes.

                Background Free radical attacks have been implicated in the aetiology of many diseases and several plants are used traditionally for the management of many oxidative-stress related diseases. Khaya senegalensis is used traditionally for the management diseases such as diabetes and for the treatment of infections. However, mechanisms underlying actions of K. senegalensis are poorly understood. Purpose This study aimed at the preliminary determination of the phytochemical constituents and investigation of the antioxidative and hepatoprotective actions of K. senegalensis in acetaminophen-treated rats. Method Aqueous extracts of K. senegalensis were screened for the presence of key phytochemicals. Total flavonoid and phenolic contents were quantified. Wistar albino rats were pre-treated with saline (control) or graded concentrations of K. senegalensis (50 – 200mg/kgbw) for 10 days prior to acetaminophen (2g/kg body weight) administration. Serum levels of vitamin C, thiobarbituric reactive substances, catalase activities, enzyme markers of liver function were assessed. Cholesterol-phospholipid ratio in treated-rats were determined. Results K. senegalensis extract showed the presence of saponins, tannins, cardiac glycosides, alkaloids, flavonoids and phenolic compounds. Total phenolic and total flavonoid contents were determined as 57.14±0.85mgQE/g and 51.72±0.77mgGE/g. Acetaminophen (2g/kg bw) raised serum TBARS (4.7-fold, P<0.001), H2O2 levels (2.3-fold, P<0.001), AST (5.9-fold, P<0.001), ALT (6.6-fold, P<0.001) and ALP (4.2-fold, P<0.001) and reduced serum levels of vitamin C (54%, P<0.001) and catalase activity (74.6%, P<0.001). Treatment of K. senegalensis extracts inhibited effects of acetaminophen on TBARS (18.2% - 46.4%, P<0.05 – 0.001), vitamin C (1.4 – 1.8-fold, P<0.001 – 0.05), H2O2 levels (19.1 – 50.1%, P<0.001-0.05), catalase activities (1.4 – 3.1-fold, P<0.001 – 0.05), AST (27.7 – 62.8%, P<0.001 – 0.05), ALT (35.6 – 57.5%, P<0.001 – 0.05) and ALP (15.9 – 46.2%, P<0.01 – 0.05). The extract reduced cholesterol-phospholipid ratio (21 – 31%, P<0.05). Conclusion These results motivate further development of the therapeutic potential of K. senegalensis

[version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Immune-mediated inflammatory diseases like rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have been successfully treated using biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. These medications are not utilized as first-line treatment, in part because of their high cost, but they are frequently seen to be cost-effective for RA patient populations that do not respond adequately to conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. Moreover, not all RA patients who meet clinical eligibility criteria can access biologics, not even as second-line therapy. Recently, there has been an increasing interest in biosimilars that are highly comparable to their originator biologics in terms of efficacy and safety but generally come at a lower price. This review summarizes the potential role of biosimilars in reducing RA expenditure and increasing RA patient access to biologic therapies. As the global landscape for biosimilars continues to evolve, it is essential to consider the unique challenges and opportunities in different healthcare systems. By leveraging the potential of biosimilars, healthcare systems can improve RA management, ease its economic burden and ensure that patients have access to effective and affordable treatments. The future of RA treatment lies in the integration of biosimilars into clinical practice, offering hope for more sustainable and equitable healthcare systems.

<p>We generated Na<sub>V</sub>1.7–ChR2, Na<sub>V</sub>1.8–ChR2, and Na<sub>V</sub>1.9–ChR2 mice that exhibited nocifensive behavior to blue light exposure. All Na<sub>V</sub>1.x–ChR2 mice showed no behavioral differences in response to mechanical and thermal stimuli compared to wild-type mice. Blue light exposure caused paw withdrawal in Na<sub>V</sub>1.x–ChR2 mice, and time spent in a room with a blue LED floor was shorter in Na<sub>V</sub>1.x–ChR2 mice compared to wild-type mice.</p>

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Voltage-gated sodium channels, including Na<sub>V</sub>1.7, Na<sub>V</sub>1.8, and Na<sub>V</sub>1.9, play important roles in pain transmission and chronic pain development. However, the specific mechanisms of their action remain unclear, highlighting the need for in vivo stimulation studies of these channels. Optogenetics, a novel technique for targeting the activation or inhibition of specific neural circuits using light, offers a promising solution. In our previous study, we used optogenetics to selectively excite Na<sub>V</sub>1.7-expressing neurons in the dorsal root ganglion of mice to induce nocifensive behavior. Here, we further characterize the impact of nocifensive behavior by activation of Na<sub>V</sub>1.7, Na<sub>V</sub>1.8, or Na<sub>V</sub>1.9-expressing neurons. Using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated homologous recombination, Na<sub>V</sub>1.7–iCre, Na<sub>V</sub>1.8–iCre, or Na<sub>V</sub>1.9–iCre mice expressing iCre recombinase under the control of the endogenous Na<sub>V</sub>1.7, Na<sub>V</sub>1.8, or Na<sub>V</sub>1.9 gene promoter were produced. These mice were then bred with channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) Cre–reporter Ai32 mice to obtain Na<sub>V</sub>1.7–ChR2, Na<sub>V</sub>1.8–ChR2, or Na<sub>V</sub>1.9–ChR2 mice. Blue light exposure triggered paw withdrawal in all mice, with the strongest response in Na<sub>V</sub>1.8–ChR2 mice. These light sensitivity differences observed across Na<sub>V</sub>1.x–ChR2 mice may be dependent on ChR2 expression or reflect the inherent disparities in their pain transmission roles. In conclusion, we have generated noninvasive pain models, with optically activated peripheral nociceptors. We believe that studies using optogenetics will further elucidate the role of sodium channel subtypes in pain transmission.</p>

                The Neuroscientist, Ahead of Print. <br/>Empathy is usually regarded as the ability to perceive the emotional state of others, which is an altruistic motivation to promote prosocial behavior and thus plays a key role in human life and social development. Empathic pain—the capacity to feel and understand the pain of others—constitutes a significant aspect in the study of empathy behaviors. For an extended duration, investigations into empathic pain have predominantly centered on human neuroimaging studies. Fortunately, recent advancements have witnessed the utilization of animal models in the exploration of the fundamental neural underpinnings of empathic pain. There is substantial evidence implicating multiple brain regions and neural networks in the generation and maintenance of empathic pain. Nevertheless, further elucidation of the neural mechanisms underlying empathic pain is warranted. This review provides a concise overview of prior studies on the neural mechanisms of empathic pain, outlining the pertinent brain regions, neural pathways, synaptic mechanisms, and associated molecules while also delving into future prospects.

                The Neuroscientist, Ahead of Print. <br/>The mammalian brain comprises two structurally and functionally distinct compartments: the gray matter (GM) and the white matter (WM). In humans, the WM constitutes approximately half of the brain volume, yet it remains significantly less investigated than the GM. The major cellular elements of the WM are neuronal axons and glial cells. However, the WM also contains cell bodies of the interstitial neurons, estimated to number 10 to 28 million in the adult bat brain, 67 million in Lar gibbon brain, and 450 to 670 million in the adult human brain, representing as much as 1.3%, 2.25%, and 3.5% of all neurons in the cerebral cortex, respectively. Many studies investigated the interstitial WM neurons (IWMNs) using immunohistochemistry, and some information is available regarding their electrophysiological properties. However, the functional role of IWMNs in physiologic and pathologic conditions largely remains unknown. This review aims to provide a concise update regarding the distribution and properties of interstitial WM neurons, highlight possible functions of these cells as debated in the literature, and speculate about other possible functions of the IWMNs and their interactions with glial cells. We hope that our review will inspire new research on IWMNs, which represent an intriguing cell population in the brain.

                The monoaminergic nuclei are thought to be some of the earliest sites of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology in the brain, with tau-containing pretangles appearing in these nuclei decades before the onset of clinical impairments. It has increasingly been recognized that monoamine systems represent a critical target of investigation towards understanding the progression of AD and designing early detection and treatment approaches. This review synthesizes evidence across animal studies, human neuropathology, and state-of-the-art neuroimaging and daily life assessment methods in humans, which demonstrate robust relationships between monoamine systems and AD pathophysiology and behavior. Further, the review highlights the promise of multimethod, multisystem approaches to studying monoaminergic mechanisms of resilience to AD pathology.

                The <i>O</i>-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) is an essential enzyme that mediates protein <i>O</i>-GlcNAcylation, a unique form of posttranslational modification of many nuclear and cytosolic proteins. Recent studies observed increased OGT and <i>O</i>-GlcNAcylation levels in a broad range of human cancer tissues compared to adjacent normal tissues, indicating a universal effect of OGT in promoting tumorigenesis. Here, we show that OGT is essential for tumor growth in immunocompetent mice by repressing the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)-dependent DNA sensing pathway. We found that deletion of OGT (<i>Ogt<sup>−/−</sup></i>) caused a marked reduction in tumor growth in both syngeneic mice tumor models and a genetic mice colorectal cancer (CRC) model induced by mutation of the <i>Apc</i> gene (<i>Apc<sup>min</sup></i>). Pharmacological inhibition or genetic deletion of OGT induced a robust genomic instability (GIN), leading to cGAS-dependent production of the type I interferon (IFN-I) and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). As a result, deletion of <i>Cgas</i> or <i>Sting</i> from <i>Ogt<sup>−/−</sup></i> cancer cells restored tumor growth, and this correlated with impaired CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell-mediated antitumor immunity. Mechanistically, we found that OGT-dependent cleavage of host cell factor C1 (HCF-1) is required for the avoidance of GIN and IFN-I production in tumors. In summary, our results identify OGT-mediated genomic stability and activate cGAS-STING pathway as an important tumor-cell-intrinsic mechanism to repress antitumor immunity.

                Artificially sweetened beverages containing noncaloric monosaccharides were suggested as healthier alternatives to sugar-sweetened beverages. Nevertheless, the potential detrimental effects of these noncaloric monosaccharides on blood vessel function remain inadequately understood. We have established a zebrafish model that exhibits significant excessive angiogenesis induced by high glucose, resembling the hyperangiogenic characteristics observed in proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). Utilizing this model, we observed that glucose and noncaloric monosaccharides could induce excessive formation of blood vessels, especially intersegmental vessels (ISVs). The excessively branched vessels were observed to be formed by ectopic activation of quiescent endothelial cells (ECs) into tip cells. Single-cell transcriptomic sequencing analysis of the ECs in the embryos exposed to high glucose revealed an augmented ratio of capillary ECs, proliferating ECs, and a series of upregulated proangiogenic genes. Further analysis and experiments validated that reduced <i>foxo1a</i> mediated the excessive angiogenesis induced by monosaccharides via upregulating the expression of <i>marcksl1a</i>. This study has provided new evidence showing the negative effects of noncaloric monosaccharides on the vascular system and the underlying mechanisms.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91634">The role of Imp and Syp RNA-binding proteins in precise neuronal elimination by apoptosis through the regulation of transcription factors</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal stem cells generate a limited and consistent number of neuronal progenies, each possessing distinct morphologies and functions, which are crucial for optimal brain function. Our study focused on a neuroblast (NB) lineage in <i>Drosophila</i> known as Lin A/15, which generates motoneurons (MNs) and glia. Intriguingly, Lin A/15 NB dedicates 40% of its time to producing immature MNs (iMNs) that are subsequently eliminated through apoptosis. Two RNA-binding proteins, Imp and Syp, play crucial roles in this process. Imp+ MNs survive, while Imp−, Syp+ MNs undergo apoptosis. Genetic experiments show that Imp promotes survival, whereas Syp promotes cell death in iMNs. Late-born MNs, which fail to express a functional code of transcription factors (mTFs) that control their morphological fate, are subject to elimination. Manipulating the expression of Imp and Syp in Lin A/15 NB and progeny leads to a shift of TF code in late-born MNs toward that of early-born MNs, and their survival. Additionally, introducing the TF code of early-born MNs into late-born MNs also promoted their survival. These findings demonstrate that the differential expression of Imp and Syp in iMNs links precise neuronal generation and distinct identities through the regulation of mTFs. Both Imp and Syp are conserved in vertebrates, suggesting that they play a fundamental role in precise neurogenesis across species.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/86860">A chromatic feature detector in the retina signals visual context changes</a></h4>

              
                The retina transforms patterns of light into visual feature representations supporting behaviour. These representations are distributed across various types of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), whose spatial and temporal tuning properties have been studied extensively in many model organisms, including the mouse. However, it has been difficult to link the potentially nonlinear retinal transformations of natural visual inputs to specific ethological purposes. Here, we discover a nonlinear selectivity to chromatic contrast in an RGC type that allows the detection of changes in visual context. We trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) model on large-scale functional recordings of RGC responses to natural mouse movies, and then used this model to search in silico for stimuli that maximally excite distinct types of RGCs. This procedure predicted centre colour opponency in transient suppressed-by-contrast (tSbC) RGCs, a cell type whose function is being debated. We confirmed experimentally that these cells indeed responded very selectively to Green-OFF, UV-ON contrasts. This type of chromatic contrast was characteristic of transitions from ground to sky in the visual scene, as might be elicited by head or eye movements across the horizon. Because tSbC cells performed best among all RGC types at reliably detecting these transitions, we suggest a role for this RGC type in providing contextual information (i.e. sky or ground) necessary for the selection of appropriate behavioural responses to other stimuli, such as looming objects. Our work showcases how a combination of experiments with natural stimuli and computational modelling allows discovering novel types of stimulus selectivity and identifying their potential ethological relevance.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/87928">Whole genomes from the extinct Xerces Blue butterfly can help identify declining insect species</a></h4>

              
                The Xerces Blue (<i>Glaucopsyche xerces</i>) is considered to be the first butterfly to become extinct in historical times. It was notable for its chalky lavender wings with conspicuous white spots on the ventral wings. The last individuals were collected in their restricted habitat, in the dunes near the Presidio military base in San Francisco, in 1941. We sequenced the genomes of four 80- to 100-year-old Xerces Blue, and seven historical and one modern specimens of its closest relative, the Silvery Blue (<i>Glaucopsyche lygdamus</i>). We compared these to a novel annotated genome of the Green-Underside Blue (<i>Glaucopsyche alexis</i>). Phylogenetic relationships inferred from complete mitochondrial genomes indicate that Xerces Blue was a distinct species that diverged from the Silvery Blue lineage at least 850,000 years ago. Using nuclear genomes, both species experienced population growth during the Eemian interglacial period, but the Xerces Blue decreased to a very low effective population size subsequently, a trend opposite to that observed in the Silvery Blue. Runs of homozygosity and deleterious load in the former were significantly greater than in the later, suggesting a higher incidence of inbreeding. These signals of population decline observed in Xerces Blue could be used to identify and monitor other insects threatened by human activities, whose extinction patterns are still not well known.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99194">Cyclic di-GMP as an antitoxin regulates bacterial genome stability and antibiotic persistence in biofilms</a></h4>

              
                Biofilms are complex bacterial communities characterized by a high persister prevalence, which contributes to chronic and relapsing infections. Historically, persister formation in biofilms has been linked to constraints imposed by their dense structures. However, we observed an elevated persister frequency accompanying the stage of cell adhesion, marking the onset of biofilm development. Subsequent mechanistic studies uncovered a comparable type of toxin-antitoxin (TA) module (TA-like system) triggered by cell adhesion, which is responsible for this elevation. In this module, the toxin HipH acts as a genotoxic deoxyribonuclease, inducing DNA double strand breaks and genome instability. While the second messenger c-di-GMP functions as the antitoxin, exerting control over HipH expression and activity. The dynamic interplay between c-di-GMP and HipH levels emerges as a crucial determinant governing genome stability and persister generation within biofilms. These findings unveil a unique TA system, where small molecules act as the antitoxin, outlining a biofilm-specific molecular mechanism influencing genome stability and antibiotic persistence, with potential implications for treating biofilm infections.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/86827">A MSTNDel73C mutation with FGF5 knockout sheep by CRISPR/Cas9 promotes skeletal muscle myofiber hyperplasia</a></h4>

              
                Mutations in the well-known Myostatin (<i>MSTN</i>) produce a ‘double-muscle’ phenotype, which makes it commercially invaluable for improving livestock meat production and providing high-quality protein for humans. However, mutations at different loci of the <i>MSTN</i> often produce a variety of different phenotypes. In the current study, we increased the delivery ratio of Cas9 mRNA to sgRNA from the traditional 1:2 to 1:10, which improves the efficiency of the homozygous mutation of biallelic gene. Here, a <i>MSTN</i><sup>Del73C</sup> mutation with <i>FGF5</i> knockout sheep, in which the <i>MSTN</i> and <i>FGF5</i> dual-gene biallelic homozygous mutations were produced via the deletion of 3-base pairs of AGC in the third exon of <i>MSTN</i>, resulting in cysteine-depleted at amino acid position 73, and the <i>FGF5</i> double allele mutation led to inactivation of <i>FGF5</i> gene. The <i>MSTN</i><sup>Del73C</sup> mutation with <i>FGF5</i> knockout sheep highlights a dominant ‘double-muscle’ phenotype, which can be stably inherited. Both F0 and F1 generation mutants highlight the excellent trait of high-yield meat with a smaller cross-sectional area and higher number of muscle fibers per unit area. Mechanistically, the <i>MSTN</i><sup>Del73C</sup> mutation with <i>FGF5</i> knockout mediated the activation of <i>FOSL1</i> via the MEK-ERK-FOSL1 axis. The activated <i>FOSL1</i> promotes skeletal muscle satellite cell proliferation and inhibits myogenic differentiation by inhibiting the expression of MyoD1, and resulting in smaller myotubes. In addition, activated ERK1/2 may inhibit the secondary fusion of myotubes by Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent CaMKII activation pathway, leading to myoblasts fusion to form smaller myotubes.

	<p>Background: Moral evaluation is identified as the first stage in the theory of moral judgment, and academics believe that it may align with the social intuitionist model. This study aims to prove that the model&amp;amp;rsquo;s emotional dominance hypothesis applies to moral evaluation by presenting a computational decision-making model that mathematically formalizes this emotional dominance decision-making process. We also compared different types of valence evaluation tasks to test the emotional priority hypothesis. Methods: We used a convenience sampling method to randomly recruit 30 enrolled college students. The drift-diffusion model was employed to analyze reaction times for words with various emotional and moral valences Additionally, we designed different valence evaluation tasks based on the response relevance hypothesis and evaluated the processing order through reaction time comparisons. Results: The analysis revealed that the emotional mechanism of immoral evaluation differs from moral evaluation. An increase in emotional valence accelerates the speed of evidence accumulation (v) for moral evaluation (M = 1.21, 0.2% &amp;amp;lt; 0 &amp;amp;lt; 99.8%) but lowers decision caution (a) in immoral evaluation (M = &amp;amp;minus;0.64, 96.1% &amp;amp;lt; 0 &amp;amp;lt; 3.9%). In contrast, moral valence does not have a significant influence on evaluation processes (v, M = &amp;amp;minus;0.28, 72.1% &amp;amp;lt; 0 &amp;amp;lt; 27.9%; a, M = &amp;amp;minus;0.32, 79.3% &amp;amp;lt; 0 &amp;amp;lt; 20.7%). Furthermore, We found no significant difference in reaction times between moral and immoral words in the emotional evaluation task (F(1,29) = 0.55, p = 0.464, partial &amp;amp;eta;2 = 0.02), but a significant difference existed in the moral evaluation task (F(1,29) = 17.99, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001, partial &amp;amp;eta;2 = 0.38), indicating that the tendency of relatively fast immoral evaluation in emotional evaluation tasks may be caused by emotional priority. Conclusions: Our findings support the intuitive model&amp;amp;rsquo;s emotional dominance hypothesis and introduce a new emotional mechanism into moral evaluation. This study clarifies the distinct emotional processes in moral and immoral evaluations, fills a gap in the research on moral evaluation, and offers insights into human decision-making in moral contexts.</p>

                <p>Despite decades of preclinical investigation, there remains limited understanding of the etiology and biological underpinnings of anxiety disorders. Sensitivity to potential threat is characteristic of anxiety-like behavior in humans and rodents, but traditional rodent behavioral tasks aimed to assess threat responsiveness lack translational value, especially with regard to emotionally valenced stimuli. Therefore, development of novel preclinical approaches to serve as analogues to patient assessments is needed. In humans, the fearful face task is widely used to test responsiveness to socially communicated threat signals. In rats, ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) are analogous social cues associated with positive or negative affective states that can elicit behavioral changes in the receiver. It is therefore likely that when rats hear aversive alarm call USVs (22&nbsp;kHz), they evoke translatable changes in brain activity comparable with the fearful face task. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging in male and female rats to assess changes in BOLD activity induced by exposure to aversive 22&nbsp;kHz alarm calls emitted in response to threatening stimuli, prosocial (55&nbsp;kHz) USVs emitted in response to appetitive stimuli, or a computer-generated 22&nbsp;kHz tone. Results show patterns of regional activation that are specific to each USV stimulus. Notably, limbic regions clinically relevant to psychiatric disorders (e.g., amygdala, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis) are preferentially activated by either aversive 22&nbsp;kHz or appetitive 55&nbsp;kHz USVs. These results support the use of USV playback as a promising translational tool to investigate affective processing under conditions of distal threat in preclinical rat models.</p>

                <p>Human and mouse dorsal root ganglia (hDRG and mDRG) neurons are important tools in understanding the molecular and electrophysiological mechanisms that underlie nociception and drive pain behaviors. One of the simplest differences in firing phenotypes is that neurons are single-firing (exhibit only one action potential) or multi-firing (exhibit 2 or more action potentials). To determine if single- and multi-firing hDRG neurons exhibit differences in intrinsic properties, firing phenotypes, and AP waveform properties, and if these properties could be used to predict multi-firing, we measured 22 electrophysiological properties by whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology of 94 hDRG neurons from six male and four female donors. We then analyzed the data using several machine learning models to determine if these properties could be used to predict multi-firing. We used 1,000 iterations of Monte Carlo cross-validation to split the data into different train and test sets and tested the logistic regression, <I>k</I>-nearest neighbors, random forest, support vector classifier, and XGBoost machine learning models. All models tested had a &gt;80% accuracy on average, with support vector classifier, and XGBoost performing the best. We found that several properties correlated with multi-firing hDRG neurons and together could be used to predict multi-firing neurons in hDRG including a long decay time, a low rheobase, and long first spike latency. We also found that the hDRG models were able to predict multi-firing with 90% accuracy in mDRG neurons. Understanding these properties could be beneficial in the elucidation of targets on peripheral sensory neurons related to pain.</p>

                This case report presents a case of infected corneal laceration with traumatic endophthalmitis in a pediatric patient. A boy in his middle childhood sustained an ocular injury with scissors, resulting in a full-thickness corneal laceration and infection. Despite the delay in seeking treatment, the patient underwent successful surgical interventions, including corneal scraping, pars plana lensectomy, vitrectomy, and secondary intraocular lens implantation (IOL). The infection was managed with targeted antibiotics, and Staphylococcus aureus was confirmed as the causative organism. Remarkably, these efforts led to a satisfactory improvement in the patient’s vision to 20/50. This case underscores the importance of early intervention and a multidisciplinary approach in the management of pediatric ocular trauma to optimize outcomes.

                Background This study investigated the determinants of community preventive behavior in complying with the Indonesian regulations to prevent COVID-19 local transmission. Methods A cross-sectional study used to collect the data via an online cross using a form created from a google questionnaire forms. A total of 1,802 respondents were gathered at a single point in time. The authors used the Health Belief Model (HBM) approach to measure and create a model for the prevention of local transmission of COVID-19. Results This study found that more than half of the respondents still had low perceived susceptibility (16%) and severity (43%). There were only 3% respondents with perceived barriers and 19% with strong self-efficacy. The findings showed that self-efficacy and perceived barriers had statistically significant relationships with preventive behavior (p-value <0.05). The goodness of fit index showed that the proposed model was not fit for the data (RMSE<0.080, GFI>0.950, AGFI>0.950, SRMR<0.100), which means that it was not fit to describe the empirical phenomenon under study. Conclusions This study found that more than half of the respondents still had low perceived susceptibility (84%) and severity (67%), but more than half had high perceived benefits (54%). Only a few respondents had significant barriers to implementing COVID-19 transmission prevention behaviours (3%). Still, most respondents had low perceived self-efficacy (81%), and only 60% had good behaviours related to COVID-19 prevention. In the context of COVID-19 preventive behaviour, we recommended to improve perceived susceptibility and severity by providing the correct information (which contain information about how people susceptible to the virus and the impact of infected by the virus) with the local cultural context.

                Abstract* Background A positive exercise stress test (EST) is common among pilots, and it may indicate a greater risk of coronary artery disease (CAD). This study aimed to determine the incidence of recurrently positive EST and their predictors among civilian pilots in Indonesia. Methods This was a retrospective cohort study among civilian pilots who had the first positive EST test between January 2019 and June 2020 at the Aviation Medical Center, Jakarta. The data were retrieved from medical records. Subjects were included if there were data on subsequent ESTs at 6 and 12 months. Risk factors included total flight hours (TFH) in the last 6 months, license type, aircraft cabin pressurization system, flying limitation such as multicrew, cardiac intervention, age, smoking habit, family history of coronary artery disease, body mass index, blood pressure levels, lipid profile, and fasting blood glucose. Results Eighty-seven pilots were included; 54 of them (62.1%) had recurrent positive ESTs. All subjects were men, and the median age was 51 (range 40-64) years. Independent predictors of recurrent positive ESTs were age 60-65 years (adjusted odds ratio [ORadj]: 5.1, 95% CI: 1.12–23.16, p= 0.035), a TFH of > 275 hours (ORadj 5.1, 95% CI: 1.28–20.65, p= 0.021), and dyslipidemia (ORadj: 4.2 95% CI: 1.468–12.275, p=0.015). Having these three risk factors increased the probability of a recurrent positive EST up to 100%. Conclusion The incidence of recurrently positive ESTs among civilian pilots in Indonesia was high. Airlines may want to implement a more aggressive health policy for the prevention of cardiovascular diseases among their pilots.

                Introduction Spontaneous tendon ruptures in end stage kidney disease patients have the potential to cause long- term morbidity, and timely intervention is required to prevent complications that can severely affect the functional status of the patient Case presentation A series of six tendons (two triceps tendons and two bilateral quadriceps tendons) in three patients with ESKD undergoing hemodialysis is discussed in this case series. Patients were aged 61, 44 and 26 years, and on hemodialysis for 5, 5 and 10 years, respectively. Conclusion End -stage kidney disease is associated with a multitude of physiological changes, and the musculoskeletal system is no exception to this. Spontaneous tendon rupture is a multifactorial complication of ESKD, with serious implications for mobility and quality of life. As a result, these patients require a multifaceted approach to ensure optimum results and an early return to activity. We report a series of 6 spontaneous tendon ruptures in 3 patients with ESKD at our institution. We would like to outline the methods of repair for each case and further attempt to assess biochemical parameters that may have contributed to the disease process.

                Purpose Detailed reports of the assessments used in rehabilitation wards are lacking. This study aimed to examine the common evaluations used in rehabilitation wards and discuss the necessary assessments for treatment plans and patient management. Methods We conducted a comprehensive literature search of PubMed, Web of Science, MEDLINE, and Ichushi Web for articles published between June 2013 and June 2023. The study was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines and registered with PROSPERO. Data extraction and blind selection were performed, and a consensus was reached among experts in case of conflicts. Results We identified 220 studies, 31 meeting the inclusion criteria post-screening. The Functional Independence Measure was the most used assessment (96.8%), followed by grip strength (32.3%) and the 10-m walk test (9.7%). Other assessments included the Stroke Impairment Assessment Set, Short Physical Performance Battery, and Timed Up and Go Test. Although fall-related incidents are frequent, significantly affecting patient outcomes in rehabilitation units, balance assessments were underutilized. Conclusions Although the FIM is an extensively used assessment in rehabilitation wards, balance assessments critical for fall prevention are significantly underused. Therefore, these assessment tools should be evaluated in future research and clinical practice.

                <p>by Chenxi Liao, Masataka Sawayama, Bei Xiao</p>

We can visually discriminate and recognize a wide range of materials. Meanwhile, we use language to describe what we see and communicate relevant information about the materials. Here, we investigate the relationship between visual judgment and language expression to understand how visual features relate to semantic representations in human cognition. We use deep generative models to generate images of realistic materials. Interpolating between the generative models enables us to systematically create material appearances in both well-defined and ambiguous categories. Using these stimuli, we compared the representations of materials from two behavioral tasks: visual material similarity judgments and free-form verbal descriptions. Our findings reveal a moderate but significant correlation between vision and language on a categorical level. However, analyzing the representations with an unsupervised alignment method, we discover structural differences that arise at the image-to-image level, especially among ambiguous materials morphed between known categories. Moreover, visual judgments exhibit more individual differences compared to verbal descriptions. Our results show that while verbal descriptions capture material qualities on the coarse level, they may not fully convey the visual nuances of material appearances. Analyzing the image representation of materials obtained from various pre-trained deep neural networks, we find that similarity structures in human visual judgments align more closely with those of the vision-language models than purely vision-based models. Our work illustrates the need to consider the vision-language relationship in building a comprehensive model for material perception. Moreover, we propose a novel framework for evaluating the alignment and misalignment between representations from different modalities, leveraging information from human behaviors and computational models.

                <p>by Fuyin Yang, Hao Zhu, Xinyi Cao, Hui Li, Xinyu Fang, Lingfang Yu, Siqi Li, Zenan Wu, Chunbo Li, Chen Zhang, Xing Tian</p>

Distinguishing reality from hallucinations requires efficient monitoring of agency. It has been hypothesized that a copy of motor signals, termed <i>efference copy (EC)</i> or <i>corollary discharge (CD)</i>, suppresses sensory responses to yield a sense of agency; impairment of the inhibitory function leads to hallucinations. However, how can the sole absence of inhibition yield positive symptoms of hallucinations? We hypothesize that selective impairments in functionally distinct signals of <i>CD</i> and <i>EC</i> during motor-to-sensory transformation cause the positive symptoms of hallucinations. In an electroencephalography (EEG) experiment with a delayed articulation paradigm in schizophrenic patients with (AVHs) and without auditory verbal hallucinations (non-AVHs), we found that preparing to speak without knowing the contents (general preparation) did not suppress auditory responses in both patient groups, suggesting the absent of inhibitory function of <i>CD</i>. Whereas, preparing to speak a syllable (specific preparation) enhanced the auditory responses to the prepared syllable in non-AVHs, whereas AVHs showed enhancement in responses to unprepared syllables, opposite to the observations in the normal population, suggesting that the enhancement function of <i>EC</i> is not precise in AVHs. A computational model with a virtual lesion of an inhibitory inter-neuron and disproportional sensitization of auditory cortices fitted the empirical data and further quantified the distinct impairments in motor-to-sensory transformation in AVHs. These results suggest that “broken” <i>CD</i> plus “noisy” <i>EC</i> causes erroneous monitoring of the imprecise generation of internal auditory representation and yields auditory hallucinations. Specific impairments in functional granularity of motor-to-sensory transformation mediate positivity symptoms of agency abnormality in mental disorders.

                <p>by Suresha G. Prabhu, Vineeta N. Pillai, Lizna Mohamed Ali, Valérie Vivet-Boudou, Akhil Chameettachal, Serena Bernacchi, Farah Mustafa, Roland Marquet, Tahir A. Rizvi</p>

The packaging of genomic RNA (gRNA) into retroviral particles relies on the specific recognition by the Gag precursor of packaging signals (<i>Psi</i>), which maintain a complex secondary structure through long-range interactions (LRIs). However, it remains unclear whether the binding of Gag to <i>Psi</i> alone is enough to promote RNA packaging and what role LRIs play in this process. Using mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV), we investigated the effects of mutations in 4 proposed LRIs on gRNA structure and function. Our findings revealed the presence of an unsuspected extended LRI, and hSHAPE revealed that maintaining a wild-type–like <i>Psi</i> structure is crucial for efficient packaging. Surprisingly, filter-binding assays demonstrated that most mutants, regardless of their packaging capability, exhibited significant binding to Pr77<sup>Gag</sup>, suggesting that Gag binding to <i>Psi</i> is insufficient for efficient packaging. Footprinting experiments indicated that efficient RNA packaging is promoted when Pr77<sup>Gag</sup> binds to 2 specific sites within <i>Psi</i>, whereas binding elsewhere in <i>Psi</i> does not lead to efficient packaging. Taken together, our results suggest that the 3D structure of the <i>Ps</i>i/Pr77<sup>Gag</sup> complex regulates the assembly of viral particles around gRNA, enabling effective discrimination against other viral and cellular RNAs that may also bind Gag efficiently.

                This article provides a comprehensive analysis of knee strengthening post-surgery, focusing on key performance indicators (KPIs) essential for recovery and performance enhancement. The study delves into the importance of range of motion (ROM), load management through repetitions maximum (RM) and velocity-based training (VBT), speed variations, repetition schemes for hypertrophy and strength, and the assessment of pain, inflammation, and effusion. Emphasis is placed on dynamic alignment, muscle activation, and rate of perceived exertion (RPE) to tailor individualized rehabilitation programs. The integration of these KPIs ensures a balanced approach, enhancing muscle strength and joint integrity while minimizing injury risk. Regular monitoring and adjustments based on these indicators are recommended to optimize outcomes and ensure sustained progress in knee function and overall mobility.

                Background Despite the success of titanium (Ti) implants in dental rehabilitation, emerging evidence implicates the release of titanium oxide nanoparticles (TiO2NPs) from the implant surface as a potential contributor to the initiation of the pathogenic process leading to peri-implantitis and ultimately failure of the implants. However, a comprehensive investigation to elucidate the dose-dependent effects of TiO2NPs on cytotoxicity and inflammatory responses is lacking. The present study was undertaken to evaluate the effect of different concentrations of TiO2NPs on the cytotoxicity and inflammatory cytokine expression in Human Gingival Fibroblasts (HGFs). Methods HGFs were isolated from gingival tissue samples obtained from periodontally and systemically healthy subjects. Ti standard solution for ICP was diluted to create concentrations of (0.001 ppm, 0.01 ppm, 0.1 ppm, 1 ppm, 10 ppm, and 100 ppm) for cell culture media containing titanium. HGFs were then cultured in these varying concentrations for specific time periods (days 1, 3, 5, and 7) to assess cell viability. A cytotoxicity assay was performed to determine the levels and expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α) and anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10, IL-12, TGF-β) using qRT-PCR and ELISA techniques. Results Our findings demonstrate a concentration and duration-dependent decrease in HGF viability upon exposure to titanium nanoparticles. Notably, a 50% reduction in cell viability was observed at the highest concentration (100 ppm). qRT-PCR analysis revealed a significant upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, particularly IL-1β and IL-6, in HGFs exposed to titanium. Interestingly, the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10, IL-12, and TGF-β) remained comparable or even equivalent compared to controls across different titanium concentrations. Conclusions The study revealed a concentration and duration-dependent influence on HGF viability and cytokine profile, suggesting potential cytotoxicity and modulation of the inflammatory response mediated by TiO2NPs. Further research is necessary to elucidate the underlying mechanisms and their implications for dental implant biocompatibility.

                Background Dental caries is a common chronic oral disease, posing a serious public health issue. By analyzing large datasets, machine learning shows potential in addressing this problem. This study employs bibliometric analysis to explore emerging topics, collaborations, key authors, and research trends in Southeast Asia related to the application of machine learning in dental caries management. Methods A comprehensive selection using the Scopus database to obtain relevant research, covering publications from inception to July 2024 was done. We employed the Bibliometric approaches, including co-authorship networks, yearly publishing trends, institutional and national partnerships, keyword co-occurrence analysis, and citation analysis, for the collected data. To explore the visualization and network analysis, we employed the tools such as VOSviewer and Bibliometrix in R package. Results The final bibliometric analysis included 246 papers. We found that Malaysia became the top contributor with 59 publications, followed by Indonesia (37) and Thailand (29). Malaysia had the highest Multiple Country Publications (MCP) ratio at 0.407. Top institutions including the Universiti Sains Malaysia led with 39 articles, followed by Chiang Mai University (36) and the National University of Singapore (30) became the leader. Co-authorship analysis using VOSviewer revealed six distinct clusters. A total of 1220 scholars contributed to these publications. The top 10 keywords, including ‘human’ and ‘dental caries,’ indicated research hotspots. Conclusion We found growing evidence of machine learning applications to address dental caries in Southeast Asia. The bibliometric analysis highlights key authors, collaborative networks, and emerging topics, revealing research trends since 2014. This study underscores the importance of bibliometric analysis in tackling this public health issue.
