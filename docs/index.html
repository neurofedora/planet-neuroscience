     alt="Estrogen receptors observed at extranuclear neuronal sites and in glia in the nucleus accumbens core and shell of the female rat: Evidence for localization to catecholaminergic and GABAergic neurons"/>
<p>This study used electron microscopy to examine the distribution ERα, ERβ, and GPER1 in the nucleus accumbens (Nac) core and shell. These receptors are localized, almost exclusively, to extranuclear sites in the NAc. They are observed in all neuronal profiles and in glia, but are most prevalent in presynaptic profiles. A small proportion of ERα and GPER1 are localized to catecholaminergic neurons, and a larger proportion are localized to GABAergic neurons. These results provide a mechanism for the rapid effects of estrogens on dopaminergic transmission in the NAc.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Estrogens affect dopamine-dependent diseases/behavior and have rapid effects on dopamine release and receptor availability in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Low levels of nuclear estrogen receptor (ER) α and ERβ are seen in the NAc, which cannot account for the rapid effects of estrogens in this region. G-protein coupled ER 1 (GPER1) is observed at low levels in the NAc shell, which also likely does not account for the array of estrogens’ effects in this region. Prior studies demonstrated membrane-associated ERs in the dorsal striatum; these experiments extend those findings to the NAc core and shell. Single- and dual-immunolabeling electron microscopy determined whether ERα, ERβ, and GPER1 are at extranuclear sites in the NAc core and shell and whether ERα and GPER1 were localized to catecholaminergic or γ-aminobutyric acid-ergic (GABAergic) neurons. All three ERs are observed, almost exclusively, at extranuclear sites in the NAc, and similarly distributed in the core and shell. ERα, ERβ, and GPER1 are primarily in axons and axon terminals suggesting that estrogens affect transmission in the NAc via presynaptic mechanisms. About 10% of these receptors are found on glia. A small proportion of ERα and GPER1 are localized to catecholaminergic terminals, suggesting that binding at these ERs alters release of catecholamines, including dopamine. A larger proportion of ERα and GPER1 are localized to GABAergic dendrites and terminals, suggesting that estrogens alter GABAergic transmission to indirectly affect dopamine transmission in the NAc. Thus, the localization of ERs could account for the rapid effects of estrogen in the NAc.</p>

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The hippocampus has become a significant target of stress research in recent years because of its role in cognitive functioning, neuropathology, and regulation of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis. Despite the pervasive impact of stress on psychiatric and neurological disease, many of the circuit- and cell-dependent mechanisms giving rise to the limbic regulation of the stress response remain unknown. Hippocampal excitatory neurons generally express high levels of glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) and are therefore positioned to respond directly to serum glucocorticoids. These neurons are, in turn, regulated by neighboring interneurons, subtypes of which have been shown to respond to stress exposure. However, GR expression among hippocampal interneurons is not well characterized. To determine whether key interneuron populations are direct targets for glucocorticoid action, we used two transgenic mouse lines to label parvalbumin-positive (PV+) and somatostatin-positive (SST+) interneurons. GR immunostaining of labeled interneurons was characterized within the dorsal and ventral dentate hilus, dentate cell body layer, and CA1 and CA3 stratum oriens and stratum pyramidale. While nearly all hippocampal SST+ interneurons expressed GR across all regions, GR labeling of PV+ interneurons showed considerable subregion variability. The percentage of PV+, GR+ cells was highest in the CA3 stratum pyramidale and lowest in the CA1 stratum oriens, with other regions showing intermediate levels of expression. Together, these findings indicate that, under baseline conditions, hippocampal SST+ interneurons are a ubiquitous glucocorticoid target, while only distinct populations of PV+ interneurons are direct targets. This anatomical diversity suggests functional differences in the regulation of stress-dependent hippocampal responses.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10969861/most-recent">Integrated age‐related immunohistological changes occur in human olfactory epithelium and olfactory bulb</a></h4>

              
                <img src="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/89fc0979-3673-455e-a951-3bce4589e098/cne25325-gra-0001-m.png"
     alt="Integrated age-related immunohistological changes occur in human olfactory epithelium and olfactory bulb"/>
<p>During human development a complete uninterrupted sheet of neuronal competent mucosa with well demarcated borders comprises the olfactory epithelium (OE) within the superior aspect of the nasal cavity along the septum and lateral wall. The axons of olfactory neurons within the epithelium target glomeruli along the peripheral edges of the olfactory bulb (OB). With advancing age, regions of the OE are disrupted and replaced with respiratory or aneuronal epithelium while the border becomes less defined. A decreasing area of OE occurs with a shift of neuronal density in a more posterior-dorsal direction. Intraepithelial neuromas and subepithelial cysts develop along with a decrease in olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs). Proximally, distortions in olfactory targeting occur within the OB with an overall reduction in synapses in the ventral portion.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Olfactory epithelium (OE) is capable of lifelong regeneration due to presence of basal progenitor cells that respond to injury or neuronal loss with increased activity. However, this capability diminishes with advancing age and a decrease in odor perception in older individuals is well established. To characterize changes associated with age in the peripheral olfactory system, an in-depth analysis of the OE and its neuronal projections onto the olfactory bulb (OB) as a function of age was performed. Human olfactory tissue autopsy samples from 36 subjects with an average age of 74.1 years were analyzed. Established cell type-specific antibodies were used to identify OE component cells in whole mucosal sheets and epithelial sections as well as glomeruli and periglomerular structures in OB sections. With age, a reduction in OE area occurs across the mucosa progressing in a posterior-dorsal direction. Deterioration of the olfactory system is accompanied with diminution of neuron-containing OE, mature olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) and OB innervation. On an individual level, the neuronal density within the epithelium appears to predict synapse density within the OB. The innervation of the OB is uneven with higher density at the ventral half that decreases with age as opposed to stable innervation at the dorsal half. Respiratory metaplasia, submucosal cysts, and neuromata, were commonly identified in aged OE. The finding of respiratory metaplasia and aneuronal epithelium with reduction in global basal cells suggests a progression of stem cell quiescence as an underlying pathophysiology of age-related smell loss in humans.</p>
<h2>Key points</h2>
<p>
<p>A gradual loss of olfactory sensory neurons with age in human olfactory epithelium is also reflected in a reduction in glomeruli within the olfactory bulb.</p>
<p>This gradual loss of neurons and synaptic connections with age occurs in a specific, spatially inhomogeneous manner.</p>
<p>Decreasing mitotically active olfactory epithelium basal cells may contribute to age-related neuronal decline and smell loss in humans.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=10974547&type=etoc&feed=rss">Role of the non‐invasive imaging techniques in monitoring and understanding the evolution of brain edema</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Human brain injury elicits accumulation of water within the brain due to a variety of pathophysiological processes. As our understanding of edema emerged two temporally (and cellular) distinct processes were identified, cytotoxic and vasogenic edema. The emergence of both types of edema is reflected by the temporal evolution and is influenced by the underlying pathology (type and extent). However, this two-edema compartment model does not adequately describe the transition between cytotoxic and vasogenic edema. Hence, a third category has been proposed, termed ionic edema, that is observed in the transition between cytotoxic and vasogenic edema. Magnetic resonance neuroimaging of edema today primarily utilizes T2-weighted (T2WI) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). Clinical diagnostics and translational science studies have clearly demonstrated the temporal ability of both T2WI and DWI to monitor edema content and evolution. DWI measures water mobility within the brain reflecting cytotoxic edema. T2WI at later time points when vasogenic edema develops visualizes increased water content in the brain. Clinically relevant imaging modalities, including ultrasound and positron emission tomography, are not typically used to assess edema. In sum, edema imaging is an important cornerstone of clinical diagnostics and translational studies and can guide effective therapeutics manage edema and improve patient outcomes.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) are common with an estimated 27.1 million cases per year. Approximately 80% of TBIs are categorized as mild TBI (mTBI) based on initial symptom presentation. While in most individuals, symptoms resolve within days to weeks, in some, symptoms become chronic. Advanced neuroimaging has the potential to characterize brain morphometric, microstructural, biochemical, and metabolic abnormalities following mTBI. However, translational studies are needed for the interpretation of neuroimaging findings in humans with respect to the underlying pathophysiological processes, and, ultimately, for developing novel and more targeted treatment options. In this review, we introduce the most commonly used animal models for the study of mTBI. We then summarize the neuroimaging findings in humans and animals after mTBI and, wherever applicable, the translational aspects of studies available today. Finally, we highlight the importance of translational approaches and outline future perspectives in the field of translational neuroimaging in mTBI.</p>

<p>Food intake and sucrose tasting can affect functional network organization, as measured with resting-state functional MRI in satiated and food-restricted rats.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Eating disorders and obesity form a major health problem in Western Society. To be able to provide adequate treatment and prevention, it is necessary to understand the neural mechanisms underlying the development of eating disorders and obesity. Specific brain networks have been shown to be involved in feeding behavior. We therefore hypothesized that functional connectivity in neural networks involved in feeding behavior is dependent on the status of homeostatic energy balance, thus on being hungry or satiated. To test our hypothesis, we measured functional connectivity and amplitudes of neural signals within neural networks in relation to food intake and sucrose tasting in rats. Therefore, 16 male Wistar rats, of which eight were food-restricted and eight were satiated, underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) at 9.4 T. Subsequently, half of these animals underwent a sucrose tasting procedure followed by a second rs-fMRI scan. Functional connectivity and amplitude of low-frequency signal fluctuations were statistically analyzed in a linear mixed model. Although we did not detect a significant effect of food intake on functional connectivity before sucrose tasting, there was a trend toward interaction between group (satiated vs. hungry) and treatment (sucrose tasting). Functional connectivity between feeding-related regions tended to decrease stronger upon sucrose tasting in satiated rats as compared to food-restricted rats. Furthermore, rs-fMRI signal amplitudes decreased stronger upon sucrose tasting in satiated rats, as compared to food-restricted rats. These findings indicate that food intake and sucrose tasting can affect functional network organization, which may explain the specific patterns in feeding behavior.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=10974547&type=etoc&feed=rss">The new insights into human brain imaging after stroke</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Over the last two decades, developments of human brain stroke imaging have raised several questions about the place of new MRI biomarkers in the acute management of stroke and the prediction of poststroke outcome. Recent studies have demonstrated the main role of perfusion-weighted imaging in the identification of the best cerebral perfusion profile for a better response after reperfusion therapies in acute ischemic stroke. A major issue remains the early prediction of stroke outcome. While voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping emphasized the influence of stroke location, the analysis of the brain parenchyma underpinning the stroke lesion showed the relevance of prestroke cerebral status, including cortical atrophy, white matter integrity, or presence of chronic cortical cerebral microinfarcts. Moreover, besides the evaluation of the visually abnormal brain tissue, the analysis of normal-appearing brain parenchyma using diffusion tensor imaging and magnetization transfer imaging or spectroscopy offered new biomarkers to improve the prediction of the prognosis and new targets to follow in therapeutic trials. The aim of this review was to depict the main new radiological biomarkers reported in the last two decades that will provide a more thorough prediction of functional, motor, and neuropsychological outcome following the stroke. These new developments in neuroimaging might be a cornerstone in the emerging personalized medicine for stroke patients.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=10974547&type=etoc&feed=rss">Combining non‐invasive brain stimulation with functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the neural substrates of cognitive aging</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>As aging population is increasing, new methodologies to apprehend and enhance the mechanisms related to optimal brain function in advancing age become urgent. This review describes how the combined use of non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) provides novel experimental data on the putative neurophysiological mechanisms underlying inter-individual differences in cognitive status among older adults, also further illuminating our understanding of theoretical models proposed within the cognitive neuroscience of aging literature. In addition, it explores published evidence of how this combined procedure entails the capacity to modify the activity and connectivity of specific brain networks in older adults, potentially leading to improvements in cognitive function and other measures reflecting mental health status. Although additional research is needed, combining NIBS with fMRI might provide innovative understanding of how fundamental brain plasticity mechanisms operate in advancing age, a knowledge that may be eventually used to refine more individually tailored approaches to promote brain health in aged populations.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=10974547&type=etoc&feed=rss">Diffusion MR imaging acquisition and analytics for microstructural delineation in pre‐clinical models of TBI</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Significant progress has been made toward improving both the acquisition of clinical diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) data and its analysis in the uninjured brain, through various techniques including a large number of model-based solutions that have been proposed to fit for multiple tissue compartments, and multiple fibers per voxel. While some of these techniques have been applied to clinical traumatic brain injury (TBI) research, the majority of these technological enhancements have yet to be fully implemented in the preclinical arena of TBI animal model-based research. In this review, we describe the requirement for preclinical, MRI-based efforts to provide systematic confirmation of the applicability of some of these models as indicators of tissue pathology within the injured brain. We review how current DWI techniques are currently being used in animal TBI models, and describe how both acquisition and analytic techniques could be extended to leverage the progress made in clinical work. Finally, we highlight remaining gaps in the preclinical pipeline from data acquisition to final analysis that currently have no real, preclinical-based correlate.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=10974547&type=etoc&feed=rss">Neuroimaging in alcohol use disorder: From mouse to man</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>This article provides an overview of recent advances in understanding the effects of alcohol use disorders (AUD) on the brain from the perspective of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) research in preclinical models and clinical studies. As a noninvasive investigational tool permitting assessment of morphological, metabolic, and hemodynamic changes over time, MRI offers insight into the dynamic course of alcoholism beginning with initial exposure through periods of binge drinking and escalation, sobriety, and relapse and has been useful in differential diagnosis of neurological diseases associated with AUD. Structural MRI has revealed acute and chronic effects of alcohol on both white and gray matter volumes. MR Spectroscopy, able to quantify brain metabolites in vivo, has shed light on biochemical alterations associated with alcoholism. Diffusion tensor imaging permits microstructural characterization of white matter fiber tracts. Functional MRI has allowed for elucidation of hemodynamic responses at rest and during task engagement. Positron emission tomography, a non-MRI imaging tool, has led to a deeper understanding of alcohol-induced receptor and neurotransmitter changes during various stages of drinking and abstinence. Together, such in vivo imaging tools have expanded our understanding of the dynamic course of alcoholism including evidence for regional specificity of the effects of AUD, hints at mechanisms underlying the shift from casual to compulsive use of alcohol, and profound recovery with sustained abstinence.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Sleep is a universal and evolutionarily conserved behavior among many animal species, yet we do not have a fundamental understanding of why animals need to sleep. What we do know, however, is that sleep is critical for behavioral performance during the waking period and for long-term brain health. Here we provide an overview of some putative mechanisms that mediate the restorative effects of sleep, namely metabolic biosynthesis, fluid perfusion, and synaptic homeostasis. We then review recent experimental findings that advance the possibility of inducing sleep-like slow-wave activity (SWA) during wakefulness or enhance SWA during sleep in a top-down manner using noninvasive brain stimulation. SWA induction and SWA enhancement are believed to recapitulate the beneficial effects of sleep independent of the actual state of the subjects. If confirmed, these observations will change the way in which we investigate the neural correlates of sleep, thus paving the way for comprehending and actively controlling its restorative function.</p>

<p>By quantitatively measuring the brain coupling signature between functional activity and structural connectome using graph frequency analysis, we found a unique signature of brain structural-functional reorganization in multiple sclerosis.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The brain activities and the underlying wiring diagrams are vulnerable in multiple sclerosis (MS). Also, it remains unknown whether the complex coupling between these functional and structural brain properties would be affected. To address this issue, we adopted graph frequency analysis to quantify the high-order structural-functional interactions based on a combination of brain diffusion and functional MRI data. The structural-functional decoupling index was proposed to measure how much brain regional functional activity with different graph frequency was organized atop the underlying wiring diagram in MS. The identified patterns in MS included (1) disruption of inherent structural-functional coupling in the somatomotor network (<i>β</i> = 0.05, <i>p</i> = 0.03), and (2) excessive decrease of decoupling in the subcortical (<i>β</i> = −0.10, <i>p</i> = 0.02), visual (<i>β</i> = −0.04, <i>p</i> = 0.01), and dorsal attention networks (<i>β</i> = −0.12, <i>p</i> = 0.03). Besides, this structural-functional coupling signature in the somatomotor network was associated with cognitive worsening of MS patients (<i>β</i> = −24.31, <i>p</i> = 0.006). Overall, our study unveiled a unique signature of brain structural-functional reorganization in MS.</p>

<p>Adolescent chronic unpredictable stress altered levels of GRα isoforms, especially those with lower molecular weight, along with expression of GR-responsive genes of the hippocampus and the PFC, contributing to anxiety and depressive-like behavior in adult mice.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Adolescent stress predisposes individuals to increased risk for anxiety and depression in adulthood. The stress response is mediated by the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) via regulation of GR-responsive genes involved in brain reaction to stress. Although dysregulation of GR in depression is well documented, this is the first study investigating the role of GRα isoforms in pathogenesis of depression. We exposed adolescent male and female C57BL/6J mice to chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) for 12 days starting at postnatal day 28 (PND28). Tests evaluating anxiety and depressive-like behaviors were performed at PND70. We analyzed corticosterone concentrations in serum, levels of GRα isoforms (95, 67, 50, 40, and 25 kDa), and mRNA levels of GR-responsive genes (GR, FKBP5, BDNF, and IL-1β) in the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex (PFC). CUS increased anxiety and depressive-like behavior in adult animals of both sexes, but did not affect corticosterone serum levels, 95 and 67 kDa GR isoforms. However, the levels of shorter GRα isoforms (50, 40, and 25 kDa) were altered in adult mice underwent CUS, in sex- and brain structure–specific way. Changes in gene expression revealed that female depressive-like behavior could be related to increased levels of IL-1β in hippocampus and reduced BDNF levels in both hippocampus and PFC. However, in males, adolescent CUS increased expression of GR in adult hippocampus and BDNF in PFC. These findings suggest that adolescent stress altered levels of GRα isoforms, especially those with lower molecular weight, in sex- and tissue-specific ways, contributing to anxiety and depression in adult mice.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">From mechanisms to functions: The role of theta and gamma coherence in the intrahippocampal circuits</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Brain rhythms are essential for information processing in neuronal networks. Oscillations recorded in different brain regions can be synchronized and have a constant phase difference, that is, they can be coherent. Coherence between local field potential (LFP) signals from different brain regions may be correlated with the performance of cognitive tasks, indicating that these regions of the brain are jointly involved in the information processing. Why does coherence occur and how is it related to the information transfer between different regions of the hippocampal formation? In this article, we discuss possible mechanisms of theta and gamma coherence and its role in the hippocampus-dependent attention and memory processes, since theta and gamma rhythms are most pronounced in these processes. We review in vivo studies of interactions between different regions of the hippocampal formation in theta and gamma frequency bands. The key propositions of the review are as follows: (1) coherence emerges from synchronous postsynaptic currents in principal neurons as a result of synchronization of neuronal spike activity; (2) the synchronization of neuronal spike patterns in two regions of the hippocampal formation can be realized through induction or resonance; (3) coherence at a specific time point reflects the transfer of information between the regions of the hippocampal formation; (4) the physiological roles of theta and gamma coherence are different due to their different functions and mechanisms of generation. All hippocampal neurons are involved in theta activity, and theta coherence arranges the firing order of principal neurons throughout the hippocampal formation. In contrast, gamma coherence reflects the coupling of active neuronal ensembles. Overall, the coherence of LFPs between different areas of the brain is an important physiological process based on the synchronized neuronal firing, and it is essential for cooperative information processing.</p>

<p>Neurons in the hippocampus fire in consistent sequence over the timescale of seconds during the delay period of some memory experiments. For longer timescales, the firing of hippocampal neurons also changes slowly over minutes within experimental sessions. It was thought that these slow dynamics are caused by stochastic drift or a continuous change in the representation of the episode, rather than consistent sequences unfolding over minutes. This paper studies the consistency of contextual drift in three chronic calcium imaging recordings from the hippocampus CA1 region in mice. Computational measures of consistency show reliable sequences within experimental trials at the scale of seconds as one would expect from time cells or place cells during the trial, as well as across experimental trials on the scale of minutes within a recording session. Consistent sequences in the hippocampus are observed over a wide range of time scales, from seconds to minutes. The hippocampal activity could reflect a scale-invariant spatiotemporal context as suggested by theories of memory from cognitive psychology.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Properties and hemispheric differences of theta oscillations in the human hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The left and right primate hippocampi (LH and RH) are thought to support distinct functions, but little is known about differences between the hemispheres at the neuronal level. We recorded single-neuron and local field potentials from the human hippocampus in epilepsy patients implanted with depth electrodes. We detected theta-frequency bouts of oscillatory activity while patients performed a visual recognition memory task. Theta appeared in bouts of 3.16 cycles, with sawtooth-shaped oscillations that had a prolonged downswing period. Outside the seizure onset zone, the average frequency of theta bouts was higher in the RH compared to the LH (6.0 vs. 5.3 Hz). LH theta bouts had lower amplitudes and a higher prevalence compared to the RH (26% vs. 21% of total time). Additionally, the RH contained a population of thin spiking visually tuned neurons that were not present in the LH. These data show that human theta appears in short oscillatory bouts whose properties vary between hemispheres, thereby revealing neurophysiological properties of the hippocampus that differ between the hemispheres.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Temporal pole volume is associated with episodic autobiographical memory in healthy older adults</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Recollection of personal past events differs across the lifespan. Older individuals recall fewer episodic details and convey more semantic information than young. Here we examine how gray matter volumes in temporal lobe regions integral to episodic and semantic memory (hippocampus and temporal poles, respectively) are related to age differences in autobiographical recollection. Gray matter volumes were obtained in healthy young (<i>n</i> = 158) and old (<i>n</i> = 105) adults. The temporal pole was demarcated and hippocampus segmented into anterior and posterior regions to test for volume differences between age groups. The Autobiographical Interview was administered to measure episodic and semantic autobiographical memory. Volume associations with episodic and semantic autobiographical memory were then assessed. Brain volumes were smaller for older adults in the posterior hippocampus. Autobiographical memory was less episodic and more semanticized for older versus younger adults. Older adults also showed positive associations between temporal pole volumes and episodic autobiographical recall; in the young, temporal pole volume was positively associated with performance on standard laboratory measures of semantic memory. Exploratory analyses revealed that age-related episodic autobiographical memory associations with anterior hippocampal volumes depended on sex. These findings suggest that age differences in brain structures implicated in episodic and semantic memory may portend reorganization of neural circuits to support autobiographical memory in later life.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">A meta‐analysis of the relation between hippocampal volume and memory ability in typically developing children and adolescents</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Memory is supported by a network of brain regions, with the hippocampus serving a critical role in this cognitive process. Previous meta-analyses on the association between hippocampal structure and memory have largely focused on adults. Multiple studies have since suggested that hippocampal volume is related to memory performance in children and adolescents; however, the strength and direction of this relation varies across reports, and thus, remains unclear. To further understand this brain–behavior relation, we conducted a meta-analysis to investigate the association between hippocampal volume (assessed as total volume) and memory during typical development. Across 25 studies and 61 memory outcomes with 1357 participants, results showed a small, but significant, positive association between total hippocampal volume and memory performance. Estimates of the variability across studies in the relation between total volume and memory were not explained by differences in memory task type (delayed vs. immediate; relational vs. nonrelational), participant age range, or the method of normalization of hippocampal volumes. Overall, findings suggest that larger total hippocampal volume relates to better memory performance in children and adolescents and that this relation is similar across the memory types and age ranges assessed. To facilitate enhanced generalization across studies in the future, we discuss considerations for the field moving forward.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Activin A regulates the excitability of hippocampal mossy cells</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Mossy cells (MCs) in the hilus of the dentate gyrus (DG) receive increasing attention as a major player controlling information processing in the DG network. Furthermore, disturbed MC activity has been implicated in widespread neuropsychiatric disorders such as epilepsy and major depression. Using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from MCs in acute hippocampal slices from wild type and transgenic mice, we demonstrate that activin, a member of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) family, has a strong neuromodulatory effect on MC activity. Disruption of activin receptor signaling reduced MC firing, dampened their excitatory input and augmented their inhibitory input. By contrast, acute application of recombinant activin A strongly increased MC activity and promoted excitatory synaptic drive. Notably, similar changes of MC activity have been observed in a rodent model of depression and after antidepressant drug therapy, respectively. Given that a rise in activin signaling particularly in the DG has been proposed as a mechanism of antidepressant action, our data suggest that the effect of activin on MC excitability might make a considerable contribution in this regard.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Intrathecal Immunoglobulin M synthesis (IgM<sub>Intrathecal Fraction (IF)</sub>
<sup>+</sup>) and spinal MRI lesions are both strong independent predictors of higher disease activity and severity in multiple sclerosis (MS). We investigated whether IgM<sub>IF</sub>
<sup>+</sup> is associated with spinal cord manifestation and higher neuroaxonal damage in early MS.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In 122 patients with a first demyelinating event associations between (1) spinal versus (vs) non-spinal clinical syndrome (2) spinal vs cerebral T2-weighted (T2w) and (3) contrast-enhancing (CE) lesion counts with IgG<sub>IF</sub>
<sup>+</sup> (vs IgG<sub>IF</sub>
<sup>−</sup>) or IgM<sub>IF</sub>
<sup>+</sup> (vs IgM<sub>IF</sub>
<sup>−</sup>) were investigated by logistic regression adjusted for age and sex, respectively. For serum neurofilament light chain (sNfL) analysis patients were categorized for presence or absence of oligoclonal IgG bands (OCGB), IgG<sub>IF</sub> and IgM<sub>IF</sub> (&gt;0% vs 0%, respectively): (1) OCGB<sup>−</sup>/IgG<sub>IF</sub>
<sup>−</sup>/IgM<sub>IF</sub>
<sup>−</sup>; (2) OCGB<sup>+</sup>/IgG<sub>IF</sub>
<sup>−</sup>/IgM<sub>IF</sub>
<sup>−</sup>; (3) OCGB<sup>+</sup>/IgG<sub>IF</sub>
<sup>+</sup>/IgM<sub>IF</sub>
<sup>−</sup>; and (4) OCGB<sup>+</sup>/IgG<sub>IF</sub>
<sup>+</sup>/IgM<sub>IF</sub>
<sup>+</sup>. Associations between categories 2 to 4 vs category 1 with sNfL concentrations were analyzed by robust linear regression, adjusted for sex and MRI parameters.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Patients with a spinal syndrome had a 8.36-fold higher odds of IgM<sub>IF</sub>
<sup>+</sup> (95%CI 3.03–23.03; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01). Each spinal T2w lesion (odds Ratio 1.39; 1.02–1.90; <i>p</i> = 0.037) and CE lesion (OR 2.73; 1.22–6.09; <i>p</i> = 0.014) was associated with an increased risk of IgM<sub>IF</sub>
<sup>+</sup> (but not of IgG<sub>IF</sub>
<sup>+</sup>); this was not the case for cerebral lesions. OCGB<sup>+</sup>/IgG<sub>IF</sub>
<sup>+</sup>/IgM<sub>IF</sub>
<sup>+</sup> category patients showed highest sNfL levels (estimate:1.80; 0.55–3.06; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Intrathecal IgM synthesis is strongly associated with spinal manifestation and independently more pronounced neuroaxonal injury in early MS, suggesting a distinct clinical phenotype and pathophysiology. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Hemispheric Asymmetries of Individual Differences in Functional Connectivity</a></h4>

              
                Resting-state fMRI studies have revealed that individuals exhibit stable, functionally meaningful divergences in large-scale network organization. The strongest deviations (called network "variants") have a characteristic spatial distribution, with qualitative evidence from prior reports suggesting that this distribution differs across hemispheres. Hemispheric asymmetries can inform us on the developmental constraints of idiosyncratic regions. Here, we used data from the Human Connectome Project to systematically investigate hemispheric differences in network variants. Variants were significantly larger in the right hemisphere, particularly along the frontal operculum and medial frontal cortex. Variants in the left hemisphere were smaller but slightly more numerous, appearing most commonly around the temporoparietal junction. We investigated how variant asymmetries vary by functional network and how they compare with typical network distributions. For some networks, variants seemingly increase group-average network asymmetries (e.g., the language network is slightly bigger in the left hemisphere and variants appeared more frequently in the ipsilateral hemisphere). For other networks, variants counter the group-average network asymmetries (e.g., the default mode network is slightly bigger in the left hemisphere, but variants were more frequent in the right hemisphere). Intriguingly, left- and right-handers differed in their network variant asymmetries for the cinguloopercular and frontoparietal networks, suggesting that variant asymmetries are relevant to lateralized traits. These findings demonstrate that idiosyncratic aspects of brain organization differ systematically across the hemispheres. We discuss how these asymmetries in brain organization may inform us on developmental constraints of network variants, and how they may relate to functions differentially linked to the two hemispheres.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cataloging the potential functional diversity of Cacna1e splice variants using long-read sequencing</a></h4>

              
                Voltage gated calcium channels (VGCCs) regulate the influx of calcium ions in many cell types, but our lack of knowledge about the plethora of VGCC splice variants remains a gap in our understanding of calcium channel function. A recent advance in profiling gene splice variation is to use long-read RNA-sequencing technology. We sequenced Cacna1e transcripts from the rat thalamus using Oxford Nanopore sequencing, yielding the full structure of 2,110 Cacna1e splice variants. However, we observed that only 154 Cacna1e splice variants were likely to encode for a functional VGCC based on predicted amino acid sequences. We then computationally prioritized these 154 splice variants using expression and evolutionary conservation and found that four splice variants are candidate functionally distinct splice isoforms. Our work not only provides long-read sequencing of Cacna1e for the first time, but also the first computational evaluation of which Cacna1e splice variants are the best candidates for future follow-up. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Voltage gated calcium channels (Cacna1x genes) are implicated in many neurological disorders and their encoding genes are predicted to have complex patterns of alternative splicing. Previous approaches relied on short-read RNA-seq to characterize calcium channel splice variants. Here, we use long-read nanopore sequencing to establish a set of Cacna1e transcripts in the rat thalamus and use computational methods to prioritize four transcripts as functionally distinct splice isoforms. Our work to provide the field with prioritized transcripts will not only improve our understanding of Cacna1e function but its role in disease as well.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Ketamine and its metabolite 2R,6R-hydroxynorketamine promote ocular dominance plasticity and release TRKB from inhibitory control without changing perineuronal nets enwrapping parvalbumin interneurons</a></h4>

              
                Ketamine has been described as a fast-acting antidepressant, exerting effects in depressed patients and in preclinical models with a rapid onset of action. The typical antidepressant fluoxetine is known to induce plasticity in the adult rodent visual cortex, as assessed by a shift in ocular dominance, a classical model of brain plasticity, and a similar effect has been described for ketamine and its metabolite 2R,6R-hydroxynorketamine (R,R-HNK). Here, we demonstrate that ketamine (at 3 or 20 mg/kg) and R,R-HNK facilitated the shift in ocular dominance in monocularly deprived mice, after 3 injections, throughout the 8-days regimen. Notably, the comparison between the treatments indicates a higher effect size of R,R-HNK compared to ketamine. Treatment with ketamine or R,R-HNK failed to influence the levels of perineuronal nets (PNNs) surrounding parvalbumin-positive interneurons. However, we observed in vitro that both ketamine and R,R-HNK are able to disrupt the tropomyosin-related kinase B (TRKB) interaction with the protein tyrosine phosphatase sigma (PTP{sigma}), which upon binding to PNNs dephosphorylates TRKB. These results support a model where diverse drugs promote the reinstatement of juvenile-like plasticity by directly binding TRKB and releasing it from PTP{sigma} regulation, without necessarily affecting PNNs deposits.

                Accurate parcellation of cortical regions is crucial for distinguishing morphometric changes in aged brains, particularly in degenerative brain diseases. Normal aging and neurodegeneration precipitate brain structural changes, leading to distinct tissue contrast and shape in people aged > 60 years. Manual parcellation by trained radiologists can yield a highly accurate outline of the brain; however, analyzing large datasets is laborious and expensive. Alternatively, newly-developed computational models can quickly and accurately conduct brain parcellation, although thus far only for the brains of Caucasian individuals. DeepParcellation, our novel deep learning model for 3D magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) parcellation, was trained on 5,035 brains of older East Asians (Gwangju Alzheimer's & Related Dementia) and 2,535 brains of Caucasians. We trained full 3D models for N-way individual regions of interest using memory reduction techniques. Our method showed the highest similarity and robust reliability among age-ethnicity groups, especially when parcellating the brains of older East Asians.

                Direct reprogramming of retinal Muller glia is a promising avenue for replacing photoreceptors and retinal ganglion cells lost to retinal dystrophies. However, questions have recently been raised about the accuracy of studies claiming efficient glia-to-neuron reprogramming in retina that were conducted using GFAP mini promoter-driven adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors. In this study, we have addressed these questions using GFAP mini promoter-driven AAV constructs to simultaneously overexpress the mCherry reporter and candidate transcription factors predicted to induce glia-to-neuron conversion, in combination with prospective genetic labeling of retinal Muller glia using inducible Cre-dependent GFP reporters. We find that, while control GFAP-mCherry constructs express faithfully in Muller glia, 5 out of 7 transcription factor overexpression constructs tested are predominantly expressed in amacrine and retinal ganglion cells. However, genetic cell lineage analysis shows no evidence for glia-to-neuron conversion. These findings demonstrate strong insert-dependent effects on AAV-based GFAP mini promoter specificity that preclude its use in inferring cell lineage relationships when studying glia-to-neuron conversion in retina.

                Hippocampal neurons generate either single spikes or stereotyped bursts of spikes known as complex spikes. Although single and complex spikes co-occur in the same neuron, their contribution to information processing remains unclear. We analyzed hippocampal CA1 neurons in awake mice and in behaving rats, combining cellular membrane voltage imaging with optogenetics and extracellular recordings. We found that network-driven subthreshold membrane rhythms in the theta versus gamma frequencies preferably entrained complex versus single spikes in individual neurons. Optogenetic membrane perturbation revealed a causal link between subthreshold theta and gamma power and the initiation of complex versus single spikes. Further, single and complex spikes exhibited different place field properties and frequency-dependent coding during spatial navigation. Thus, individual hippocampal neurons do not integrate theta and gamma rhythms into a combined spike timing code, but instead, transmit frequency-specific information as distinct output modes of single versus complex spikes during spatial cognition.

                Corticospinal neurons (CSN) are centrally required for skilled voluntary movement, which necessitates that they establish precise subcerebral connectivity with the brainstem and spinal cord. However, molecular controls regulating specificity of this projection targeting remain largely unknown. We previously identified that developing CSN subpopulations exhibit striking axon targeting specificity in the spinal white matter. These CSN subpopulations with segmentally distinct spinal projections are also molecularly distinct; a subset of differentially expressed genes between these distinct CSN subpopulations function as molecular controls regulating differential axon projection targeting. Rostrolateral CSN extend axons exclusively to bulbar-cervical segments (CSNBC-lat), while caudomedial CSN (CSNmedial) are more heterogeneous, with distinct, intermingled subpopulations extending axons to either bulbar-cervical or thoraco lumbar segments. Here, we report that Cerebellin 1 (Cbln1) is expressed specifically by CSN in medial, but not lateral, sensorimotor cortex. Cbln1 shows highly dynamic temporal expression, with Cbln1 levels in CSN highest during the period of peak axon extension toward thoraco lumbar segments. Using gain-of-function experiments, we identify that Cbln1 is sufficient to direct thoraco-lumbar axon extension by CSN. Mis-expression of Cbln1 in CSNBC lat either by in utero electroporation, or in postmitotic CSNBC-lat by AAV-mediated gene delivery, re-directs these axons past their normal bulbar-cervical targets toward thoracic segments. Further, Cbln1 overexpression in postmitotic CSNmedial increases the number of CSNmedial axons that extend past cervical segments into the thoracic cord. Collectively, these results identify that Cbln1 functions as a potent molecular control over thoraco lumbar CSN axon extension, part of an integrated network of controls over segmentally-specific CSN axon projection targeting.

                The lack of understanding as to the cellular and molecular basis of clinical and genetic heterogeneity in progressive multiple sclerosis (MS) has hindered the search for new effective therapies and biomarkers. Here, to address this gap, we analysed 740,000 single nuclei RNAseq profiles of 165 samples of white matter (WM) lesions, normal appearing WM, grey matter (GM) lesions and normal appearing GM from 55 MS patients and 28 controls. We find that gene expression changes in response to MS are highly cell-type specific in WM and GM lesions but are largely shared within an individual cell-type across lesions, following a continuum rather than discrete lesion-specific molecular programs. The major biological determinants of variability in gene expression in MS samples relate to individual patient effects, rather than to lesion types or other metadata. Using multi-omics factor analysis (MOFA+), we identify three subgroups of MS patients with distinct oligodendrocyte composition and WM glial gene expression signatures, suggestive of engagement of different pathological/regenerative processes. The discovery of these three patterns significantly advances our mechanistic understanding of progressive MS, provides a framework to use molecular biomarkers to stratify patients for best therapeutic approaches for progressive MS, and highlights the need for precision-medicine approaches to address heterogeneity among MS patients.

                The mediodorsal thalamus is a higher-order thalamic nucleus involved in a variety of cognitive behaviors, including olfactory attention, odor discrimination, and the hedonic perception of flavors. Although it forms connections with principal regions of the olfactory and gustatory networks, its role in processing olfactory and gustatory signals originating from the mouth remains unclear. Here, we recorded single-unit activity in the mediodorsal thalamus of behaving rats during the intraoral delivery of individual odors, individual tastes, and odor-taste mixtures. Our results are the first to demonstrate that neurons in the mediodorsal thalamus dynamically encode chemosensory signals originating from the mouth. This chemoselective population is broadly tuned, responds with excitation and suppression, and represents odor-taste mixtures differently than their odor and taste components. Furthermore, a subset of chemoselective neurons encoded taste palatability. Our results further demonstrate the multidimensionality of the mediodorsal thalamus and provides additional evidence of its involvement in processing chemosensory information important for consummatory behaviors.

                Taste buds are receptor organs for gustation. Two types of taste receptor cells have been identified in taste buds: Type II and Type III cells. Type III cells connect with afferent fibers through conventional chemical synapses. In the present study on taste buds, we used immunocytochemistry to examine the distribution pattern of Bassoon, a scaffolding protein of the cytomatrix at the active zones of conventional synapses. Bassoon was predominantly detected as small puncta in Type III cells. Bassoon-immunoreactive puncta were observed in proximity to or partially overlapping with intragemmal nerve fibers. Immunoelectron microscopy showed Bassoon at the active zones of the conventional synapses of Type III cells. The present results demonstrated that Bassoon is a marker for synapses between Type III cells and afferent fibers in taste buds.

                Mutually exclusive behaviors in animals are often driven by independent motor subcircuits that directly or indirectly inhibit each other. For example, in the nematode C. elegans, motor circuits for forward and backward locomotion are gated by premotor interneurons AVB and AVA respectively, which are thought to be connected via reciprocal inhibition. In this study, we dissect the interactions between forward and motor subcircuits in C. elegans by genetic manipulation of AVA's activity via cell-specific characterization of a two-pore potassium channel (TWK-40). AVA has an unusually depolarized resting membrane potential (RMP). Perturbations to its RMP through AVA-specific TWK-40 loss-of-function and AVA-specific TWK-40 gain-of-function, led to dramatic changes in both forward and backward motor activity. AVA, thus regulated both backward and forward locomotion in C. elegans, functioning as a master neuron for overall locomotion. These effects required chemical transmission from AVA and were dependent on AVB neurons. We were able to reconcile results of genetic perturbation with optogenetic manipulation by carefully designed stimulation protocols. Finding that phasic optogenetic activation of AVA leads to backward locomotion, while tonic optogenetic activation potentiates forward locomotion. These results propose that a single neuron can regulate the activity of motor circuits generating two mutually exclusive behaviors.

                The consequences of perinatal brain injury can be devastating but currently there are few effective treatments. We sought to determine if tactile stimulation (TS) or exogenous application of fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) following injury could reverse the behavioral loss. Infant rats received frontal cortex removals on postnatal day 4 (P4) or a sham surgery. The TS animals received thrice-daily 15-minute bouts of stimulation (Experiment 1) on the day following surgery until weaning. In Experiment 2, treated animals received subcutaneous injections of FGF-2 once daily for one week, postsurgery. Behavioral testing began on postnatal day 60. Brains were later processed for Golgi analysis. We show in Experiment 1, that tactilely stimulating infant rats with perinatal cortical injury stimulates functional recovery and reverses injury-related changes in neuronal morphology in the cerebral cortex. The TS induction of recovery is associated with changes in expression of FGF-2 in both the skin and brain. Direct administration of FGF-2 (Experiment 2) is also effective in facilitating recovery, although not as completely as TS. These results suggest that early behavioral intervention after perinatal cortical injury can stimulate plastic neuronal changes that can underlie functional recovery and that these changes are mediated, in part, through an upregulation of FGF-2.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Restoration of high-sensitivity patterned vision in motion with an engineered light-gated G protein-coupled receptor</a></h4>

              
                Inherited retinal degenerations (IRDs) result in blindness due to apoptotic cell death of rods and cones, but spare other retinal neurons, providing a potential that delivery of a light-activated signaling protein to surviving neurons may restore vision. We previously demonstrated that aspects of vision could be restored by introduction into surviving cells of a G protein-coupled receptor for glutamate (mGluR) bearing a tethered photoswitchable agonist. However, this system, containing one photoswitchable agonist per glutamate binding site, yielded low sensitivity, responding only to visual stimuli at the intensity of bright outdoor light, similar to channelrhodopsins. To increase sensitivity, we designed a multi-branched photoswitch, bearing four light-activatable glutamates for each glutamate binding site. When tethered to a modified mGluR2 expressed in retinal ganglion cells via intravitreal AAV gene delivery, this photoswitch boosted sensitivity by ~100-fold compared to the unbranched (single photo-ligand) photoswitch. This improvement in sensitivity enabled an IRD mouse model (rd1) to perform visually-guided object recognition under incidental room light and pattern recognition using standard LCD computer displays. The restored line pattern differentiation approached the acuity reported for normal mouse vision. Pattern recognition functioned as well as wildtype vision with line patterns moving at speeds of up to 36{degrees}/s. In summary, this two-component chemical-optogenetic approach combines high sensitivity and high acuity with superior motion vision, and, unlike optogenetic gene therapy, can be adjusted for dose, upgraded, as new photoswitches are developed, and discontinued at will.

	<p>An increasing amount of research has examined the effects of bilingualism on performance in theory of mind (ToM) tasks. Bilinguals outperform monolinguals in ToM when comparing groups. However, it is unclear what aspects of the bilingual experience contribute to this effect in a dynamic construct like ToM. To date, bilingualism has been conceptualized as a dichotic skill that is distinct from monolingualism, obscuring nuances in the degree that different bilingual experience affects cognition. The current study used a combination of network science, cognitive, and linguistic behavioral measurements to explore the factors that influence perspective-taking ToM based on participants&amp;amp;rsquo; current and previous experience with language, as well as their family networks&amp;amp;rsquo; experience with language. The results suggest that some aspects of the bilingual experience predict task performance, but not others, and these predictors align with the two-system theory of ToM. Overall, the findings provide evidence for the extent to which individual differences in bilingualism are related to different cognitive outcomes.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Blind demixing methods for recovering dense neuronal morphology from barcode imaging data</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Shuonan Chen, Jackson Loper, Pengcheng Zhou, Liam Paninski</p>

Cellular barcoding methods offer the exciting possibility of ‘infinite-pseudocolor’ anatomical reconstruction—i.e., assigning each neuron its own random unique barcoded ‘pseudocolor,’ and then using these pseudocolors to trace the microanatomy of each neuron. Here we use simulations, based on densely-reconstructed electron microscopy microanatomy, with signal structure matched to real barcoding data, to quantify the feasibility of this procedure. We develop a new blind demixing approach to recover the barcodes that label each neuron, and validate this method on real data with known barcodes. We also develop a neural network which uses the recovered barcodes to reconstruct the neuronal morphology from the observed fluorescence imaging data, ‘connecting the dots’ between discontiguous barcode amplicon signals. We find that accurate recovery should be feasible, provided that the barcode signal density is sufficiently high. This study suggests the possibility of mapping the morphology and projection pattern of many individual neurons simultaneously, at high resolution and at large scale, via conventional light microscopy.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Using topic modeling to detect cellular crosstalk in scRNA-seq</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Alexandrina Pancheva, Helen Wheadon, Simon Rogers, Thomas D. Otto</p>

Cell-cell interactions are vital for numerous biological processes including development, differentiation, and response to inflammation. Currently, most methods for studying interactions on scRNA-seq level are based on curated databases of ligands and receptors. While those methods are useful, they are limited to our current biological knowledge. Recent advances in single cell protocols have allowed for physically interacting cells to be captured, and as such we have the potential to study interactions in a complimentary way without relying on prior knowledge. We introduce a new method based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for detecting genes that change as a result of interaction. We apply our method to synthetic datasets to demonstrate its ability to detect genes that change in an interacting population compared to a reference population. Next, we apply our approach to two datasets of physically interacting cells to identify the genes that change as a result of interaction, examples include adhesion and co-stimulatory molecules which confirm physical interaction between cells. For each dataset we produce a ranking of genes that are changing in subpopulations of the interacting cells. In addition to the genes discussed in the original publications, we highlight further candidates for interaction in the top 100 and 300 ranked genes. Lastly, we apply our method to a dataset generated by a standard droplet-based protocol not designed to capture interacting cells, and discuss its suitability for analysing interactions. We present a method that streamlines detection of interactions and does not require prior clustering and generation of synthetic reference profiles to detect changes in expression.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Deep learning for robust and flexible tracking in behavioral studies for C. elegans</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Kathleen Bates, Kim Le, Hang Lu</p>

Robust and accurate behavioral tracking is essential for ethological studies. Common methods for tracking and extracting behavior rely on user adjusted heuristics that can significantly vary across different individuals, environments, and experimental conditions. As a result, they are difficult to implement in large-scale behavioral studies with complex, heterogenous environmental conditions. Recently developed deep-learning methods for object recognition such as Faster R-CNN have advantages in their speed, accuracy, and robustness. Here, we show that Faster R-CNN can be employed for identification and detection of <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> in a variety of life stages in complex environments. We applied the algorithm to track animal speeds during development, fecundity rates and spatial distribution in reproductive adults, and behavioral decline in aging populations. By doing so, we demonstrate the flexibility, speed, and scalability of Faster R-CNN across a variety of experimental conditions, illustrating its generalized use for future large-scale behavioral studies.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A particle-based computational model to analyse remodelling of the red blood cell cytoskeleton during malaria infections</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Julia Jäger, Pintu Patra, Cecilia P. Sanchez, Michael Lanzer, Ulrich S. Schwarz</p>

Red blood cells can withstand the harsh mechanical conditions in the vasculature only because the bending rigidity of their plasma membrane is complemented by the shear elasticity of the underlying spectrin-actin network. During an infection by the malaria parasite <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i>, the parasite mines host actin from the junctional complexes and establishes a system of adhesive knobs, whose main structural component is the knob-associated histidine rich protein (KAHRP) secreted by the parasite. Here we aim at a mechanistic understanding of this dramatic transformation process. We have developed a particle-based computational model for the cytoskeleton of red blood cells and simulated it with Brownian dynamics to predict the mechanical changes resulting from actin mining and KAHRP-clustering. Our simulations include the three-dimensional conformations of the semi-flexible spectrin chains, the capping of the actin protofilaments and several established binding sites for KAHRP. For the healthy red blood cell, we find that incorporation of actin protofilaments leads to two regimes in the shear response. Actin mining decreases the shear modulus, but knob formation increases it. We show that dynamical changes in KAHRP binding affinities can explain the experimentally observed relocalization of KAHRP from ankyrin to actin complexes and demonstrate good qualitative agreement with experiments by measuring pair cross-correlations both in the computer simulations and in super-resolution imaging experiments.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Effective population size for culturally evolving traits</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Dominik Deffner, Anne Kandler, Laurel Fogarty</p>

Population size has long been considered an important driver of cultural diversity and complexity. Results from population genetics, however, demonstrate that in populations with complex demographic structure or mode of inheritance, it is not the census population size, <i>N</i>, but the effective size of a population, <i>N</i><sub>e</sub>, that determines important evolutionary parameters. Here, we examine the concept of effective population size for traits that evolve culturally, through processes of innovation and social learning. We use mathematical and computational modeling approaches to investigate how cultural <i>N</i><sub>e</sub> and levels of diversity depend on (1) the way traits are learned, (2) population connectedness, and (3) social network structure. We show that one-to-many and frequency-dependent transmission can temporally or permanently lower effective population size compared to census numbers. We caution that migration and cultural exchange can have counter-intuitive effects on <i>N</i><sub>e</sub>. Network density in random networks leaves <i>N</i><sub>e</sub> unchanged, scale-free networks tend to decrease and small-world networks tend to increase <i>N</i><sub>e</sub> compared to census numbers. For one-to-many transmission and different network structures, larger effective sizes are closely associated with higher cultural diversity. For connectedness, however, even small amounts of migration and cultural exchange result in high diversity independently of <i>N</i><sub>e</sub>. Extending previous work, our results highlight the importance of carefully defining effective population size for cultural systems and show that inferring <i>N</i><sub>e</sub> requires detailed knowledge about underlying cultural and demographic processes.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>This study aimed to determine the pattern of <sup>18</sup>F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) related to postmortem Lewy body disease (LBD) pathology in clinical Alzheimer disease (AD).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>FDG-PET scans were analyzed in 62 autopsy-confirmed patients and 110 controls in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. Based on neuropathologic evaluations on Braak stage for neurofibrillary tangle, Consortium to Establish a Registry for AD score for neuritic plaque, and Lewy-related pathology, subjects were classified into AD(−)/LBD(−), AD(−)/LBD(+), AD(+)/LBD(−), and AD(+)/LBD(+) groups. The association between postmortem LBD and AD pathologies and antemortem brain metabolism was evaluated.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>AD and LBD pathologies had significant interaction effects to decrease metabolism in the cerebellar vermis, bilateral caudate, putamen, basal frontal cortex, and anterior cingulate cortex in addition to the left side of the entorhinal cortex and amygdala, and significant interaction effects to increase metabolism in the bilateral parietal and occipital cortices. LBD pathology was associated with hypermetabolism in the cerebellar vermis, bilateral putamen, anterior cingulate cortex, and basal frontal cortex, corresponding to the Lewy body-related hypermetabolic patterns. AD pathology was associated with hypometabolism in the bilateral hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and posterior cingulate cortex regardless of LBD pathology, whereas LBD pathology was associated with hypermetabolism in the bilateral putamen and anterior cingulate cortex regardless of AD pathology.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Postmortem LBD and AD pathologies had significant interaction effects on the antemortem brain metabolism in clinical AD patients. Specific metabolic patterns related to AD and LBD pathologies could be elucidated when simultaneously considering the two pathologies. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

     alt="Abnormal dynamic functional connectivity in first-episode, drug-naïve adolescents with major depressive disorder"/>
<p>This dynamic functional connectivity (FC) study suggests that adolescent depression is characterized by unstable network dynamic pattern, altered state transition metrics, and disrupted FC in a weakly connected state. Furthermore, mean dwell time in this weakly connected state is associated with disease severity.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Previous neuroimaging studies have identified disrupted large-scale functional brain networks in major depressive disorder (MDD); however, most of them focused on adult patients and were based on static functional connectivity (FC). Thus, we aimed to investigate the patterns of change in dynamic FC in depressed adolescents. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data were acquired from 60 first-episode, drug-naïve adolescents with MDD and 60 matched healthy controls (HCs). Then, the dynamic FC properties were analyzed using a sliding windows approach, <i>k</i>-means clustering, and graph theory methods. The intrinsic brain FC were clustered into two configuration states—a more frequent and relatively sparsely connected State 1 and a less frequent and more strongly interconnected State 2. Compared with HCs, depressed adolescents had higher reoccurrence fraction and dwell time in State 1, and lower reoccurrence fraction and dwell time in State 2, and higher total number of transitions between the two states. Depressed adolescents showed decreased FC within the default mode network (DMN) and between the DMN and other networks in State 1. Additionally, the MDD group showed higher variances in the global and local efficiency. Furthermore, the duration of illness was positively correlated with the number of state transitions, and the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score was positively correlated with the mean dwell time in State 1. This study demonstrated abnormal dynamic FC in depressed adolescents, which provided new insights into the pathophysiological mechanisms of adolescent-onset depression.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/neuron/inpress.rss">Prelimbic cortex drives discrimination of non-aversion via amygdala somatostatin interneurons</a></h4>

              
                Overgeneralization of fear to non-aversive stimuli is observed in several psychiatric disorders. Using a mouse model, Stujenske et al. identify the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex acting via somatostatin interneurons in the basolateral amygdala as the mechanism that desynchronizes sensory activation of the amygdala during non-aversive stimuli, thereby suppressing generalized fear responses.

                Zhang et al. report that SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant has an unusually high number of mutations in its spike (S), which requires a high level of host receptor ACE2 for efficient membrane fusion, thereby compromising its fusogenic capability. Mutations remodel the S antigenic structure, causing remarkable resistance to neutralizing antibodies.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/inpress.rss">Dynamic Ca2+ sensitivity stimulates the evolved SARS-CoV-2 spike strain-mediated membrane fusion for enhanced entry</a></h4>

              
                Singh et al. show that low pH and Ca2+ facilitate SARS-CoV-2 spike-driven membrane fusion. Ca2+ drives a pre- to post-fusion conformational change of the spike protein. SARS-CoV-2 spike variants of concern have evolved with enhanced dynamic calcium sensitivity, which increases fusion activity and cell entry.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Multi-omic rejuvenation of human cells by maturation phase transient reprogramming</a></h4>

              
                Ageing is the gradual decline in organismal fitness that occurs over time leading to tissue dysfunction and disease. At the cellular level, ageing is associated with reduced function, altered gene expression and a perturbed epigenome. Somatic cell reprogramming, the process of converting somatic cells to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), can reverse these age-associated changes. However, during iPSC reprogramming, somatic cell identity is lost, and can be difficult to reacquire as re-differentiated iPSCs often resemble foetal rather than mature adult cells. Recent work has demonstrated that the epigenome is already rejuvenated by the maturation phase of reprogramming, which suggests full iPSC reprogramming is not required to reverse ageing of somatic cells. Here we have developed the first 'maturation phase transient reprogramming' (MPTR) method, where reprogramming factors are expressed until this rejuvenation point followed by withdrawal of their induction. Using dermal fibroblasts from middle age donors, we found that cells temporarily lose and then reacquire their fibroblast identity during MPTR, possibly as a result of epigenetic memory at enhancers and/or persistent expression of some fibroblast genes. Excitingly, our method substantially rejuvenated multiple cellular attributes including the transcriptome, which was rejuvenated by around 30 years as measured by a novel transcriptome clock. The epigenome, including H3K9me3 histone methylation levels and the DNA methylation ageing clock, was rejuvenated to a similar extent. The magnitude of rejuvenation instigated by MTPR appears substantially greater than that achieved in previous transient reprogramming protocols. In addition, MPTR fibroblasts produced youthful levels of collagen proteins, and showed partial functional rejuvenation of their migration speed. Finally, our work suggests that more extensive reprogramming does not necessarily result in greater rejuvenation but instead that optimal time windows exist for rejuvenating the transcriptome and the epigenome. Overall, we demonstrate that it is possible to separate rejuvenation from complete pluripotency reprogramming, which should facilitate the discovery of novel anti-ageing genes and therapies.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Schema representations in distinct brain networks support narrative memory during encoding and retrieval</a></h4>

              
                Schematic prior knowledge can scaffold the construction of event memories during perception and also provide structured cues to guide memory search during retrieval. We measured the activation of story-specific and schematic representations using fMRI while participants were presented with 16 stories and then recalled each of the narratives, and related these activations to memory for specific story details. We predicted that schema representations in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) would be correlated with successful recall of story details. In keeping with this prediction, an anterior mPFC region showed a significant correlation between activation of schema representations at encoding and subsequent behavioral recall performance; however, this mPFC region was not implicated in schema representation during retrieval. More generally, our analyses revealed largely distinct brain networks at encoding and retrieval in which schema activation was related to successful recall. These results provide new insight into when and where event knowledge can support narrative memory.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Completion of neural crest cell production and emigration is regulated by retinoic-acid-dependent inhibition of BMP signaling</a></h4>

              
                Production and emigration of neural crest cells is a transient process followed by the emergence of the definitive roof plate. The mechanisms regulating the end of neural crest ontogeny are poorly understood. Whereas early crest development is stimulated by mesoderm-derived retinoic acid, we report that the end of the neural crest period is regulated by retinoic acid synthesized in the dorsal neural tube. Inhibition of retinoic acid signaling in the neural tube prevents the normal upregulation of BMP inhibitors in the nascent roof plate and prolongs the period of BMP responsiveness which otherwise ceases close to roof plate establishment. Consequently, neural crest production and emigration are extended well into the roof plate stage. In turn, extending the activity of neural crest-specific genes inhibits the onset of retinoic acid synthesis in roof plate suggesting a mutual repressive interaction between neural crest and roof plate traits. Although several roof plate-specific genes are normally expressed in the absence of retinoic acid signaling, roof plate and crest markers are co-expressed in single cells and this domain also contains dorsal interneurons. Hence, the cellular and molecular architecture of the roof plate is compromised. Collectively, our results demonstrate that neural tube-derived retinoic acid, via inhibition of BMP signaling, is an essential factor responsible for the end of neural crest generation and the proper segregation of dorsal neural lineages.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Endogenous Syngap1 alpha splice forms promote cognitive function and seizure protection</a></h4>

              
                Loss-of-function variants in <i>SYNGAP1</i> cause a developmental encephalopathy defined by cognitive impairment, autistic features, and epilepsy. <i>SYNGAP1</i> splicing leads to expression of distinct functional protein isoforms. Splicing imparts multiple cellular functions of SynGAP proteins through coding of distinct C-terminal motifs. However, it remains unknown how these different splice sequences function <i>in vivo</i> to regulate neuronal function and behavior. Reduced expression of SynGAP-a1/2 C-terminal splice variants in mice caused severe phenotypes, including reduced survival, impaired learning, and reduced seizure latency. In contrast, upregulation of a1/2 expression improved learning and increased seizure latency. Mice expressing a1-specific mutations, which disrupted SynGAP cellular functions without altering protein expression, promoted seizure, disrupted synapse plasticity, and impaired learning. These findings demonstrate that endogenous SynGAP isoforms with a1/2 spliced sequences promote cognitive function and impart seizure protection. Regulation of SynGAP-a expression or function may be a viable therapeutic strategy to broadly improve cognitive function and mitigate seizure.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Efficient differentiation of human primordial germ cells through geometric control reveals a key role for Nodal signaling</a></h4>

              
                Human primordial germ cells (hPGCs) form around the time of implantation and are the precursors of eggs and sperm. Many aspects of hPGC specification remain poorly understood because of the inaccessibility of the early postimplantation human embryo for study. Here we show that micropatterned human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) treated with BMP4 give rise to hPGC-like cells (hPGCLC) and use these as a quantitatively reproducible and simple <i>in vitro</i> model to interrogate this important developmental event. We characterize micropatterned hPSCs up to 96h and show that hPGCLC populations are stable and continue to mature. By perturbing signaling during hPGCLC differentiation, we identify a previously unappreciated role for Nodal signaling and find that the relative timing and duration of BMP and Nodal signaling are critical parameters controlling the number of hPGCLCs. We formulate a mathematical model for a network of cross-repressive fates driven by Nodal and BMP signaling which predicts the measured fate patterns after signaling perturbations. Finally, we show that hPSC colony size dictates the efficiency of hPGCLC specification, which led us to dramatically improve the efficiency of hPGCLC differentiation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Agl24 is an ancient archaeal homolog of the eukaryotic N-glycan chitobiose synthesis enzymes</a></h4>

              
                Protein N-glycosylation is a post-translational modification found in organisms of all domains of life. The crenarchaeal N-glycosylation begins with the synthesis of a lipid-linked chitobiose core structure, identical to that in Eukaryotes, although the enzyme catalyzing this reaction remains unknown. Here, we report the identification of a thermostable archaeal β-1,4-<i>N</i>-acetylglucosaminyltransferase, named <span class="underline">a</span>rchaeal <span class="underline">gl</span>ycosylation enzyme 24 (Agl24), responsible for the synthesis of the N-glycan chitobiose core. Biochemical characterization confirmed its function as an inverting β-D-GlcNAc-(1→4)-α-D-GlcNAc-diphosphodolichol glycosyltransferase. Substitution of a conserved histidine residue, found also in the eukaryotic and bacterial homologs, demonstrated its functional importance for Agl24. Furthermore, bioinformatics and structural modeling revealed similarities of Agl24 to the eukaryotic Alg14/13 and a distant relation to the bacterial MurG, which are catalyzing the same or a similar reaction, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis of Alg14/13 homologs indicates that they are ancient in Eukaryotes, either as a lateral transfer or inherited through eukaryogenesis.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The Neural Response at the Fundamental Frequency of Speech is Modulated by Word-level Acoustic and Linguistic Information</a></h4>

              
                Spoken language comprehension requires rapid and continuous integration of information, from lower-level acoustic to higher-level linguistic features. Much of this processing occurs in the cerebral cortex. Its neural activity exhibits, for instance, correlates of predictive processing, emerging at delays of a few hundred milliseconds. However, the auditory pathways are also characterized by extensive feedback loops from higher-level cortical areas to lower-level ones as well as to subcortical structures. Early neural activity can therefore be influenced by higher-level cognitive processes, but it remains unclear whether such feedback contributes to linguistic processing. Here, we investigated early speech-evoked neural activity that emerges at the fundamental frequency. We analyzed EEG recordings obtained when subjects listened to a story read by a single speaker. We identified a response tracking the speaker's fundamental frequency that occurred at a delay of 11 ms, while another response elicited by the high-frequency modulation of the envelope of higher harmonics exhibited a larger magnitude and longer latency of about 18 ms. Subsequently, we determined the magnitude of these early neural responses for each individual word in the story. We then quantified the context-independent frequency of each word and used a language model to compute context-dependent word surprisal and precision. The word surprisal represented how predictable a word is, given the previous context, and the word precision reflected the confidence about predicting the next word from the past context. We found that the word-level neural responses at the fundamental frequency were predominantly influenced by the acoustic features: the average fundamental frequency and its variability. Amongst the linguistic features, only context-independent word frequency showed a weak but significant modulation of the neural response to the high-frequency envelope modulation. Our results show that the early neural response at the fundamental frequency is already influenced by acoustic as well as linguistic information, suggesting top-down modulation of this neural response.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Learning and Expression of Dopaminergic Reward Prediction Error via Plastic Representations of Time</a></h4>

              
                Dopamine (DA) releasing neurons in the midbrain learn response patterns that represent reward prediction error (RPE). Typically, models proposing a mechanistic explanation for how dopamine neurons learn to exhibit RPE are based on temporal difference (TD) learning, a machine learning algorithm. However, mechanistic models motivated by TD learning face two significant hurdles. First, TD-based models typically require rather unrealistic components, such as long and robust temporal chains of feature-specific neurons that tile, a priori, each interval from a given stimulus to a given reward. Secondly, various predictions of TD clash with experimental observations of how RPE evolves over learning. Here, we present a biophysically plausible plastic network model of spiking neurons, that learns RPEs and can replicate results observed in multiple experiments. This model, coined FLEX (Flexibly Learned Errors in Expected Reward), learns feature-specific representations of time, allowing for neural representations of stimuli to adjust their timing and relation to rewards in an online manner. Following learning, model dopamine neurons in FLEX report a distribution of response types, as observed experimentally and as used in machine learning. Dopamine neuron firing in our model reflects an RPE before and after learning but not necessarily during learning, allowing the model to reconcile seemingly inconsistent experiments and make unique predictions that contrast those of TD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">ROStrace detects oxidative stress in vivo and predicts progression of Alzheimer's disease pathology in APP/PS1 mice.</a></h4>

              
                Purpose: Oxidative stress is implicated in the pathogenesis of the most common neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, tracking oxidative stress in the brain has proven difficult and impeded its use as a biomarker. Herein, we investigate the utility of a novel positron emission tomography (PET) tracer, [18F]ROStrace, as a biomarker of oxidative stress throughout the course of AD in the well-established APP/PS1 double mutant mouse model. Methods: PET imaging studies were conducted in wild-type (WT) and APP/PS1 mice at 3 different time points, representing early (5 mo.), middle (10 mo.), and advanced (16 mo.) life (n = 6-12, per sex). Semi-quantitation SUVRs of the plateau phase (40-60nmin post-injection; SUVR40-60) of ten brain subregions were designated by the Mirrione atlas and analyzed by Pmod. Statistical parametric mapping (SPM) was used to distinguish brain regions with elevated ROS in APP/PS1 relative to WT in both sexes. The PET studies were validated by ex vivo autoradiography and immunofluorescence with the parent compound, dihydroethidium. Results: [18F]ROStrace retention was increased in the APP/PS1 brain compared to age-matched controls by 10 mo. of age (p < 0.0001), and preceded the accumulation of oxidative damage in APP/PS1 neurons at 16mo. (p < 0.005). [18F]ROStrace retention and oxidative damages were higher and occurred earlier in female APP/PS1 mice as measured by PET (p < 0.001), autoradiography and immunohistochemistry (p < 0.05). [18F]ROStrace differences emerged mid-life, temporally and spatially correlating with increased A{beta} burden (r2 = 0.36; p = 0.0003), which was also greatest in the female brain (p < 0.001). Conclusions: [18F]ROStrace identifies increased oxidative stress and neuroinflammation in APP/PS1 female mice, concurrent with increased amyloid burden mid-life. Differences in oxidative stress during this crucial time may partially explain the sexual dimorphism in AD. [18F]ROStrace may provide a long-awaited tool to stratify at-risk patients who may benefit from antioxidant therapy prior to irreparable neurodegeneration.

                Fluorescent calcium indicators are an indispensable tools for monitoring the spiking activity of large neuronal populations in animal models. However, despite the plethora of algorithms developed over the last decades, accurate spike time inference methods for rates greater than 20 Hz are lacking. More importantly, little attention has been devoted to the quantification the statistical uncertainties in spike time estimation, which is essential for assigning a confidence in the inference for a particular recording. To address these challenges, we introduce an auto-regressive generative model that accounts for bursting neuronal activity and baseline fluorescence modulation, and it also applies recent sequential Monte Carlo approaches to obtain joint posterior distributions of static and dynamic model parameters. We show that our inference method is competitive with state-of-the-art algorithms by analysing the CASCADE benchmark datasets. We also show that spike time intervals as short as five milliseconds can be inferred from fluorescence transients recorded using a state-of-the-art genetically encoded indicator. Overall, our study describes a Bayesian inference method to detect neuronal spiking patterns and their uncertainty. The use of particle Gibbs samplers allows for unbiased estimates of all model parameters and it provides a statistical framework to test more specific models of calcium indicators.

                Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has revolutionized cognitive neuroscience, but methodological barriers limit the generalizability of findings from the lab to the real world. Here, we present Neuroscout, an end-to-end platform for analysis of naturalistic fMRI data designed to facilitate the adoption of robust and generalizable research practices. Neuroscout leverages state-of-the-art machine learning models to automatically annotate stimuli from dozens of naturalistic fMRI studies, allowing researchers to easily test neuroscientific hypotheses across multiple ecologically-valid datasets. In addition, Neuroscout builds on a robust ecosystem of open tools and standards to provide an easy-to-use analysis builder and a fully automated execution engine that reduce the burden of reproducible research. Through a series of meta-analytic case studies, we validate the automatic feature extraction approach and demonstrate its potential to support more robust fMRI research. Owing to its ease of use and a high degree of automation, Neuroscout makes it possible to overcome modeling challenges commonly arising in naturalistic analysis and to easily scale analyses within and across datasets, democratizing generalizable fMRI research.

                This paper describes a novel tool for closed-loop system identification of the activation dynamics of the neural target of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). The method operates in real time, selects ideal stimulus parameters, detects and processes the response, and estimates the input--output (IO) curve and the neural membrane time constant representing a first-order approximation of the activated neural target. First, the neural membrane response and depolarization factor, which leads to motor evoked potentials (MEPs) are analytically computed and discussed. Then, an integrated model is developed which combines the neural membrane time constant and the input--output curve in TMS. Identifiability of the proposed integrated model is discussed. A condition is derived, which assures SPE of the proposed integrated model. Finally, a real-time and sequential parameter estimation (SPE) formalism is described to identify the neural membrane time constant and IO curve parameters in closed-loop TMS, where TMS pulses are administered sequentially based on the automatic analysis of the electromyography (EMG) data in real time. Optimal sampling based on maximization of the Fisher information matrix (FIM) and more conventional and intuitive uniform sampling methods both are addressed in this paper. The effectiveness of the proposed parameter tuning method is evaluated via simulations. Without loss of generality, this paper focuses on a specific case of cTMS pulses. The method is directly applicable to other cTMS pulse shapes with no new point of principals. The Matlab code is available online on Github.

                Understanding the topological characteristics of the brain network across a population is central to understanding brain functions. The abstraction of human connectome as a graph has been pivotal in gaining insights on the topological features of the brain network. The development of group-level statistical inference procedures in brain graphs while accounting for the heterogeneity and randomness still remains a difficult task. In this study, we develop a robust statistical framework based on persistent homology using the order statistics for analyzing brain networks. The use of order statistics greatly simplifies the computation of the persistent barcodes. We validate the proposed methods using comprehensive simulation studies and subsequently apply to the resting-state functional magnetic resonance images. We conclude a statistically significant topological difference between the male and female brain networks.

                Speech production is an intricate process involving a large number of muscles and cognitive processes. The neural processes underlying speech production are not completely understood. As speech is a uniquely human ability, it can not be investigated in animal models. High-fidelity human data can only be obtained in clinical settings and is therefore not easily available to all researchers. Here, we provide a dataset of 10 participants reading out individual words while we measured intracranial EEG from a total of 1103 electrodes. The data, with its high temporal resolution and coverage of a large variety of cortical and sub-cortical brain regions, can help in understanding the speech production process better. Simultaneously, the data can be used to test speech decoding and synthesis approaches from neural data to develop speech Brain-Computer Interfaces and speech neuroprostheses.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cochlear Neurotrophin-3 overexpression at mid-life prevents age-related cochlear synaptopathy and slows age-related hearing loss</a></h4>

              
                Age-related hearing loss (ARHL) is the most prevalent sensory deficit in the elderly. This progressive pathology often has psychological and medical comorbidities, including social isolation, depression, and cognitive decline. Despite ARHL's enormous impact, no therapies to prevent or slow its progression exist. Loss of synapses between inner hair cells (IHCs) and spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs), a.k.a. cochlear synaptopathy, is an early event in ARHL, preceding neuronal and hair cell loss. To determine if age-related cochlear synaptopathy can be prevented, and if this impacts the time-course of ARHL, we tested the effects of cochlear overexpression of neurotrophin-3 (Ntf3) starting at middle-age. We chose Ntf3 because this neurotrophin regulates the formation of IHC-SGN synapses in the neonatal period. We now show that triggering Ntf3 overexpression by cochlear supporting cells starting in middle age rapidly increases the amplitude of sound-evoked neural potentials, indicating that Ntf3 improves cochlear function when pathology is minimal. Furthermore, near the end of their lifespan, Ntf3-overexpressing mice have milder ARHL, with enhanced cochlear neural function and reduced cochlear synaptopathy. Our results provide evidence that age-related decrease in cochlear Ntf3 expression contributes to ARHL. and Ntf3 supplementation could serve as a therapeutic for this prevalent disorder. Furthermore, these findings suggest that increased expression of factors that regulate synaptogenesis during development might prevent age-related synaptopathy, a process involved in several central nervous system degenerative disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Heat and humidity sensors that alert mosquitoes to nearby human hosts</a></h4>

              
                Mosquito-borne diseases sicken >500,000,000 people annually, killing >500,0001. Mosquito host-seeking is guided by multiple host-associated cues, which combine to drive blood feeding in a manner that remains poorly understood2,3. While heat is a powerful mosquito attractant, recent studies indicate that disruption of heat seeking has little impact on host detection by the malaria vector Anopheles gambiae4, suggesting other cues act alongside heat in the complex sensory environment of a human host. Here we show mosquitoes require Ir93a (an Ionotropic Receptor5) to maintain attraction to a human host and feed on warmed blood. Using Ir93a, we uncover the previously uncharacterized mosquito hygrosensory system, and show Ir93a is required for humidity detection by humidity sensors (hygrosensors) as well as temperature detection by thermosensors, and for attraction to each stimulus. These findings indicate that hygrosensation and thermosensation function in parallel, driving host proximity detection in response to the overlapping heat and humidity gradients humans produce6,7. These host cue sensors appear to have arisen by co-opting existing sensors of physical cues rather than de novo, as Ir93a-dependent thermo- and hygro-sensors support physiological homeostasis in non-blood-feeding insects8-11. While Ir93a is conserved among arthropods, reliance on heat and humidity evolved independently in multiple blood-feeding lineages, suggesting multiple, vector-specific implementations of this common host-seeking strategy.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A genetic variant of the Wnt receptor LRP6 accelerates synapse degeneration during ageing and in Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                Synapse loss strongly correlates with cognitive decline in Alzheimer's Disease (AD), but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Studies suggest that deficient Wnt signalling, a pathway required for neuronal connectivity, contributes to synapse dysfunction and loss in AD. Consistent with this idea, a variant of Lrp6, (Lrp6-val), which confers reduced Wnt signalling, has been linked to late onset AD. However, the impact of Lrp6-val on synapses in the healthy and AD brain has not been examined. Using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing, we generated a novel knock-in mouse model carrying this Lrp6 variant to study its role in synaptic integrity. Lrp6-val mice develop normally and do not exhibit morphological brain abnormalities. Hippocampal neurons from Lrp6-val mice do not respond to Wnt7a, a Wnt ligand that promotes synaptic assembly through the Frizzled-5 (Fz5) receptor. Activation of the Wnt pathway by Wnt ligands leads to the formation of a complex between LRP6 and Fz5. In contrast, LRP6-Val impairs the formation of the LRP6-Fz5 complex elicited by Wnt7a, as detected by proximity ligation assay (PLA). We demonstrate that Lrp6-val mice exhibit structural and functional synaptic defects that become more pronounced with age, consistent with decreased canonical Wnt signalling during ageing. To investigate the contribution of this variant to AD, Lrp6-val mice were crossed to hAPPNL-G-F/NL-G-F (NL-G-F), a knock-in AD mouse model. The presence of the Lrp6-val variant significantly exacerbates synapse loss around amyloid-{beta} plaques in NL-G-F mice. Our findings uncover a novel role for the Lrp6-val variant in synapse vulnerability during ageing and its contribution to synapse degeneration in AD.

                Dysregulated protein synthesis is a core pathogenic mechanism in Fragile X Syndrome (FX). The mGluR Theory of FX predicts that pathological synaptic changes arise from the excessive translation of mRNAs downstream of mGlu1/5 activation. Here, we use a combination of CA1 pyramidal neuron-specific TRAP-seq and proteomics to identify the overtranslating mRNAs supporting exaggerated mGlu1/5 -induced long-term synaptic depression (mGluR-LTD) in the FX mouse model (Fmr1-/y). Surprisingly, our results identify a robust translation of ribosomal proteins (RPs) upon mGlu1/5 stimulation that coincides with a reduced translation of long mRNAs encoding synaptic proteins. These changes are mimicked and occluded in Fmr1-/y neurons. Inhibiting RP translation significantly impairs mGluR-LTD and prevents the length-dependent shift in the translating population. Together, these results suggest that pathological changes in FX result from a length-dependent alteration in the translating population that is supported by excessive RP translation.

                Intracortical brain-computer interfaces (iBCIs) restore motor function to people with paralysis by translating brain activity into control signals for external devices. In current iBCIs, instabilities at the neural interface result in a degradation of decoding performance, which necessitates frequent supervised recalibration using new labeled data. One potential solution is to use the latent manifold structure that underlies neural population activity to facilitate a stable mapping between brain activity and behavior. Recent efforts using unsupervised approaches have improved iBCI stability using this principle; however, existing methods treat each time step as an independent sample and do not account for latent dynamics. Dynamics have been used to enable high performance prediction of movement intention, and may also help improve stabilization. Here, we present a platform for Nonlinear Manifold Alignment with Dynamics (NoMAD), which stabilizes iBCI decoding using recurrent neural network models of dynamics. NoMAD uses unsupervised distribution alignment to update the mapping of nonstationary neural data to a consistent set of neural dynamics, thereby providing stable input to the iBCI decoder. In applications to data from monkey motor cortex collected during motor tasks, NoMAD enables accurate behavioral decoding with unparalleled stability over weeks- to months-long timescales without any supervised recalibration.

                The emergence of neuronal wiring specificity requires stabilization of dynamic axonal branches at sites of selective synapse formation. Models that explain how axonal branching is coupled to synaptogenesis postulate molecular regulators acting in a spatiotemporally restricted fashion. We report that Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) activity is required in presynaptic axonal branches during two distinct temporal intervals to regulate circuit wiring in the developing Drosophila visual system. EGFR is required early to regulate primary axonal branching and independently again later to prevent autophagic degradation of the synaptic active zone protein Bruchpilot (Brp). The protection of synaptic material during this later interval of wiring ensures the stabilization of terminal branches, circuit connectivity and appropriate visual behavior. Phenotypes of EGFR inactivation were rescued by increasing Brp levels or downregulating autophagic genes. We identify a temporally restricted molecular mechanism required for coupling axonal branching and synaptic stabilization that contributes to the emergence of neuronal wiring specificity.

                The most common genetic risk factor for Parkinsons disease (PD) is heterozygous mutations in the GBA1 gene which encodes for the lysosomal enzyme, glucocerebrosidase (GCase). GCase impairments are associated with an accumulation of abnormal -synuclein (-syn) called Lewy pathology, which characterizes PD. PD patients heterozygous for the GBA1 L444P mutation (GBA1+/L444P) have a 5.6-fold increased risk of cognitive impairments. In this study, we used GBA1+/L444P mice to determine the effects of this severe GBA1 mutation on lipid metabolism, expression of synaptic proteins, behavior, and -syn inclusion formation. GBA1+/L444P mice showed reduced GCase activity in limbic brain regions and expressed lower levels of hippocampal vGLUT1 compared to wildtype (GBA1+/+) mice. GBA+/L444P mice also demonstrated impaired fear conditioning, but no motor deficits. We show, using mass spectrometry, that mutant GCase and age increased levels of glucosylsphingosine (GlcSph), but not glucosylceramide (GlcCer), in the brains and serum of GBA1+/L444P mice. Aged GBA1+/+ mice also showed increased levels of GlcSph, and decreased GlcCer. To model disease pathology, templated -syn pathology was used. -Syn inclusions were increased in the hippocampus of GBA1+/L444P mice compared to GBA1+/+ mice, but not in the cortex, or substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). Pathologic -syn did not cause a loss of dopamine neurons in the SNc. Treatment with a GlcCer synthase inhibitor prevented loss of cortical -syn inclusions, but not loss of dopamine neurons. Overall, these data suggest the critical importance to evaluate the contribution of hippocampal pathologic -syn and brain and serum glucosylsphingosine in synucleinopathies.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTSynucleinopathies, such as Parkinsons disease (PD) and Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), are both pathologically characterized by abnormal -synuclein (-syn). Mutant GBA1 is a risk factor for both PD and DLB where a reduction of glucocerebrosidase (GCase) activity is seen. Collectively, this indicates the significance of evaluating mutant GCase in synucleinopathies. Our data suggest the critical importance to evaluate the contribution of hippocampal pathologic -syn and brain and serum glucosylsphingosine (GlcSph) accumulation in synucleinopathies. Moreover, these pathologic outcomes may contribute to the nonmotor symptoms clinically observed in PD and DLB. Our findings highlight the importance of GlcSph as a relevant biomarker for future therapeutics.

	<p>Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that plays a crucial role in adaptive behavior. A wealth of studies suggests obesity-related alterations in the central dopamine system. The most direct evidence for such differences in humans comes from molecular neuroimaging studies using positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). The aim of the current review is to give a comprehensive overview of molecular neuroimaging studies that investigated the relation between BMI or weight status and any dopamine target in the striatal and midbrain regions of the human brain. A structured literature search was performed and a summary of the extracted findings are presented for each of the four available domains: (1) D2/D3 receptors, (2) dopamine release, (3) dopamine synthesis, and (4) dopamine transporters. Recent proposals of a nonlinear relationship between severity of obesity and dopamine imbalances are described while integrating findings within and across domains, after which limitations of the review are discussed. We conclude that despite many observed associations between obesity and substrates of the dopamine system in humans, it is unlikely that obesity can be traced back to a single dopaminergic cause or consequence. For effective personalized prevention and treatment of obesity, it will be crucial to identify possible dopamine (and non-dopamine) profiles and their functional characteristics.</p>

	<p>Recently, a large cluster-randomized controlled trial was designed&amp;amp;mdash;Music Interventions for Dementia and Depression in ELderly care (MIDDEL)&amp;amp;mdash;to assess the effectiveness of music interventions on depression in care home residents with dementia (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03496675). To understand the pathophysiological mechanisms, we observed the effect of repeated music interventions on stress in this population since chronic stress was associated with depression and an increased risk for dementia. An exploratory study was designed to assess: (1) changes in hair cortisol concentrations as an indicator of longer-term stress; (2) whether baseline stress is a predictor of therapy outcome; (3) pre- and post-treatment effects on salivary &amp;amp;alpha;-amylase and cortisol response as an indicator of immediate stress in 180&amp;amp;ndash;200 care home residents with dementia and depressive symptoms who partake in the MIDDEL trial. Insights into mediatory effects of stress to explain the effect of music interventions will be gained. Hair cortisol concentrations were assessed at baseline and at 3, 6, and 12 months along with the Perceived Stress Scale. Salivary &amp;amp;alpha;-amylase and cortisol concentrations were assessed at 1, 3, and 6 months. Saliva was collected just before a session and 15 and 60 min after a session, along with a stress Visual Analogue Scale.</p>

	<p>(1) Background: Tinnitus is the awareness of a sound in the absence of an external source. It affects around 10&amp;amp;ndash;15% of people, a significant proportion of whom also experience symptoms such as depression or anxiety that negatively affect their quality of life. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a technique involving constant low-intensity direct current delivered via scalp electrodes. It is a potential treatment option for tinnitus, as well as tinnitus-related conditions such as depression and anxiety. This systematic review estimates the effects of tDCS on outcomes relevant to tinnitus. In addition, it sheds light on the relationship between stimulation parameters and the effect of tDCS on these outcomes; (2) Methods: Exhaustive searches of electronic databases were conducted. Randomised controlled trials were included if they reported at least one of the following outcomes: tinnitus symptom severity, anxiety, or depression. Where available, data on quality of life, adverse effects, and neurophysiological changes were also reviewed. GRADE was used to assess the certainty in the estimate; (3) Results: Meta-analyses revealed a statistically significant reduction in tinnitus (moderate certainty) and depression (low certainty)-but not anxiety-following active tDCS compared to sham control. Network meta-analyses revealed potential optimal stimulation parameters; (4) Conclusions: The evidence synthesised in this review suggests tDCS has the potential to reduce symptom severity in tinnitus and depression. It further narrows down the number of potentially optimal stimulation parameters.</p>

	<p>Speech therapy can be part of the care pathway for patients recovering from comas and presenting a disorder of consciousness (DOC). Although there are no official recommendations for speech therapy follow-up, neuroscientific studies suggest that relevant stimuli may have beneficial effects on the behavioral assessment of patients with a DOC. In two case studies, we longitudinally measured (from 4 to 6 weeks) the behavior (observed in a speech therapy session or using items from the Coma Recovery Scale&amp;amp;mdash;Revised) of two patients in a minimally conscious state (MCS) when presenting music and/or autobiographical materials. The results highlight the importance of using relevant material during a speech therapy session and suggest that a musical context with a fast tempo could improve behavior evaluation compared to noise. This work supports the importance of adapted speech therapy for MCS patients and encourages larger studies to confirm these initial observations.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Simulated actin reorganization mediated by motor proteins</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Maria-Veronica Ciocanel, Aravind Chandrasekaran, Carli Mager, Qin Ni, Garegin A. Papoian, Adriana Dawes</p>

Cortical actin networks are highly dynamic and play critical roles in shaping the mechanical properties of cells. The actin cytoskeleton undergoes significant reorganization in many different contexts, including during directed cell migration and over the course of the cell cycle, when cortical actin can transition between different configurations such as open patched meshworks, homogeneous distributions, and aligned bundles. Several types of myosin motor proteins, characterized by different kinetic parameters, have been involved in this reorganization of actin filaments. Given the limitations in studying the interactions of actin with myosin <i>in vivo</i>, we propose stochastic agent-based models and develop a set of data analysis measures to assess how myosin motor proteins mediate various actin organizations. In particular, we identify individual motor parameters, such as motor binding rate and step size, that generate actin networks with different levels of contractility and different patterns of myosin motor localization, which have previously been observed experimentally. In simulations where two motor populations with distinct kinetic parameters interact with the same actin network, we find that motors may act in a complementary way, by tuning the actin network organization, or in an antagonistic way, where one motor emerges as dominant. This modeling and data analysis framework also uncovers parameter regimes where spatial segregation between motor populations is achieved. By allowing for changes in kinetic rates during the actin-myosin dynamic simulations, our work suggests that certain actin-myosin organizations may require additional regulation beyond mediation by motor proteins in order to reconfigure the cytoskeleton network on experimentally-observed timescales.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Dynamic coupling of residues within proteins as a mechanistic foundation of many enigmatic pathogenic missense variants</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Nicholas J. Ose, Brandon M. Butler, Avishek Kumar, I. Can Kazan, Maxwell Sanderford, Sudhir Kumar, S. Banu Ozkan</p>

Many pathogenic missense mutations are found in protein positions that are neither well-conserved nor fall in any known functional domains. Consequently, we lack any mechanistic underpinning of dysfunction caused by such mutations. We explored the disruption of allosteric dynamic coupling between these positions and the known functional sites as a possible mechanism for pathogenesis. In this study, we present an analysis of 591 pathogenic missense variants in 144 human enzymes that suggests that allosteric dynamic coupling of mutated positions with known active sites is a plausible biophysical mechanism and evidence of their functional importance. We illustrate this mechanism in a case study of <i>β-Glucocerebrosidase</i> (GCase) in which a vast majority of 94 sites harboring Gaucher disease-associated missense variants are located some distance away from the active site. An analysis of the conformational dynamics of GCase suggests that mutations on these distal sites cause changes in the flexibility of active site residues despite their distance, indicating a dynamic communication network throughout the protein. The disruption of the long-distance dynamic coupling caused by missense mutations may provide a plausible general mechanistic explanation for biological dysfunction and disease.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Adaptive and optimized COVID-19 vaccination strategies across geographical regions and age groups</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jeta Molla, Alejandro Ponce de León Chávez, Takayuki Hiraoka, Tapio Ala-Nissila, Mikko Kivelä, Lasse Leskelä</p>

We evaluate the efficiency of various heuristic strategies for allocating vaccines against COVID-19 and compare them to strategies found using optimal control theory. Our approach is based on a mathematical model which tracks the spread of disease among different age groups and across different geographical regions, and we introduce a method to combine age-specific contact data to geographical movement data. As a case study, we model the epidemic in the population of mainland Finland utilizing mobility data from a major telecom operator. Our approach allows to determine which geographical regions and age groups should be targeted first in order to minimize the number of deaths. In the scenarios that we test, we find that distributing vaccines demographically and in an age-descending order is not optimal for minimizing deaths and the burden of disease. Instead, more lives could be saved by using strategies which emphasize high-incidence regions and distribute vaccines in parallel to multiple age groups. The level of emphasis that high-incidence regions should be given depends on the overall transmission rate in the population. This observation highlights the importance of updating the vaccination strategy when the effective reproduction number changes due to the general contact patterns changing and new virus variants entering.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">The expression of virulence genes increases membrane permeability and sensitivity to envelope stress in Salmonella Typhimurium</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Malgorzata Sobota, Pilar Natalia Rodilla Ramirez, Alexander Cambré, Andrea Rocker, Julien Mortier, Théo Gervais, Tiphaine Haas, Delphine Cornillet, Dany Chauvin, Isabelle Hug, Thomas Julou, Abram Aertsen, Médéric Diard</p>

Virulence gene expression can represent a substantial fitness cost to pathogenic bacteria. In the model entero-pathogen <i>Salmonella</i> Typhimurium (<i>S</i>.Tm), such cost favors emergence of attenuated variants during infections that harbor mutations in transcriptional activators of virulence genes (e.g., <i>hilD</i> and <i>hilC</i>). Therefore, understanding the cost of virulence and how it relates to virulence regulation could allow the identification and modulation of ecological factors to drive the evolution of <i>S</i>.Tm toward attenuation. In this study, investigations of membrane status and stress resistance demonstrate that the wild-type (WT) expression level of virulence factors embedded in the envelope increases membrane permeability and sensitizes <i>S</i>.Tm to membrane stress. This is independent from a previously described growth defect associated with virulence gene expression in <i>S</i>.Tm. Pretreating the bacteria with sublethal stress inhibited virulence expression and increased stress resistance. This trade-off between virulence and stress resistance could explain the repression of virulence expression in response to harsh environments in <i>S</i>.Tm. Moreover, we show that virulence-associated stress sensitivity is a burden during infection in mice, contributing to the inherent instability of <i>S</i>.Tm virulence. As most bacterial pathogens critically rely on deploying virulence factors in their membrane, our findings could have a broad impact toward the development of antivirulence strategies.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">RNA Pol IV induces antagonistic parent-of-origin effects on Arabidopsis endosperm</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Prasad R. V. Satyaki, Mary Gehring</p>

Gene expression in endosperm—a seed tissue that mediates transfer of maternal resources to offspring—is under complex epigenetic control. We show here that plant-specific RNA polymerase IV (Pol IV) mediates parental control of endosperm gene expression. Pol IV is required for the production of small interfering RNAs that typically direct DNA methylation. We compared small RNAs (sRNAs), DNA methylation, and mRNAs in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> endosperm from heterozygotes produced by reciprocally crossing wild-type (WT) plants to Pol IV mutants. We find that maternally and paternally acting Pol IV induce distinct effects on endosperm. Loss of maternal or paternal Pol IV impacts sRNAs and DNA methylation at different genomic sites. Strikingly, maternally and paternally acting Pol IV have antagonistic impacts on gene expression at some loci, divergently promoting or repressing endosperm gene expression. Antagonistic parent-of-origin effects have only rarely been described and are consistent with a gene regulatory system evolving under parental conflict.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Hasty sensorimotor decisions rely on an overlap of broad and selective changes in motor activity</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Gerard Derosiere, David Thura, Paul Cisek, Julie Duque</p>

Humans and other animals are able to adjust their speed–accuracy trade-off (SAT) at will depending on the urge to act, favoring either cautious or hasty decision policies in different contexts. An emerging view is that SAT regulation relies on influences exerting broad changes on the motor system, tuning its activity up globally when hastiness is at premium. The present study aimed to test this hypothesis. A total of 50 participants performed a task involving choices between left and right index fingers, in which incorrect choices led either to a high or to a low penalty in 2 contexts, inciting them to emphasize either cautious or hasty policies. We applied transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) on multiple motor representations, eliciting motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) in 9 finger and leg muscles. MEP amplitudes allowed us to probe activity changes in the corresponding finger and leg representations, while participants were deliberating about which index to choose. Our data indicate that hastiness entails a broad amplification of motor activity, although this amplification was limited to the chosen side. On top of this effect, we identified a local suppression of motor activity, surrounding the chosen index representation. Hence, a decision policy favoring speed over accuracy appears to rely on overlapping processes producing a broad (but not global) amplification and a surround suppression of motor activity. The latter effect may help to increase the signal-to-noise ratio of the chosen representation, as supported by single-trial correlation analyses indicating a stronger differentiation of activity changes in finger representations in the hasty context.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Inequities in therapy for infantile spasms: a call to action</a></h4>

              
                <h2>OBJECTIVE</h2>
<p>To determine whether selection of treatment for children with infantile spasms (IS) varies by race/ethnicity.</p>
<h2>METHODS</h2>
<p>The prospective US National Infantile Spasms Consortium database includes children with IS treated from 2012–2018. We examined the relationship between race/ethnicity and receipt of standard IS therapy (prednisolone, adrenocorticotropic hormone, vigabatrin), adjusting for demographic and clinical variables using logistic regression. Our primary outcome was <i>treatment course</i>, which considered therapy prescribed for the first and, when needed, the second IS treatment together.</p>
<h2>RESULTS</h2>
<p>Of 555 children, 324 (58%) were Non-Hispanic white, 55 (10%) Non-Hispanic Black, 24 (4%) Non-Hispanic Asian, 80 (14%) Hispanic, and 72 (13%) Other/Unknown. Most (398, 72%) received a standard treatment course. Insurance type, geographic location, history of prematurity, prior seizures, developmental delay or regression, abnormal head circumference, hypsarrhythmia, and IS etiologies were associated with standard therapy. In adjusted models, Non-Hispanic Black children had lower odds of receiving a standard treatment course compared with Non-Hispanic white children (OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.20–0.89, p = 0.02). Adjusted models also showed that children with public (vs. private) insurance had lower odds of receiving standard therapy for treatment 1 (OR 0.42, CI 0.21–0.84, p = 0.01).</p>
<h2>INTERPRETATION</h2>
<p>Non-Hispanic Black children were more often treated with non-standard IS therapies than Non-Hispanic white children. Likewise, children with public (vs. private) insurance were less likely to receive standard therapies. Investigating drivers of inequities, and understanding the impact of racism on treatment decisions, are critical next steps to improve care for patients with IS.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/neuron/inpress.rss">Unveiling the abstract format of mnemonic representations</a></h4>

              
                Kwak and Curtis demonstrate that the memory formats measured with fMRI for two different visual features, orientation and motion direction, are shared in an abstract line-like format. These results demonstrate that the goal-relevant details of past percepts are recoded into abstract working memory representations in the brain.

                <p>Nature Communications, Published online: 07 April 2022; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-29530-y">doi:10.1038/s41467-022-29530-y</a></p>Poor peptide fragmentation and unusual glycan structures limit mass spectrometry-based analysis of intact N-glycopeptides. Here, the authors develop Glyco-Decipher, a glycan-independent peptide search tool, to tackle these issues and improve the coverage of site-specific glycan analysis.
