	<p>The interaction between Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD) and sleep deprivation has recently gained attention in the scientific literature, and recent advances suggest that AD epidemiology management should coincide with the management of sleeping disorders. This review focuses on the aspects of the mechanisms underlying the link between AD and insufficient sleep with progressing age. We also provide information which could serve as evidence for future treatments of AD from the early stages in connection with sleep disorder medication.</p>

                <p>Single-nucleus RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) has revealed new levels of cellular organization and diversity within the human brain. However, full-length mRNA isoforms are not resolved in typical snRNA-seq analyses using short-read sequencing that cannot capture full-length transcripts. Here we combine standard 10x Genomics short-read snRNA-seq with targeted PacBio long-read snRNA-seq to examine isoforms of genes associated with neurological diseases at the single-cell level from prefrontal cortex samples of diseased and nondiseased human brain, assessing over 165,000 cells. Samples from 25 postmortem donors with Alzheimer's disease (AD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), or Parkinson's disease (PD), along with age-matched controls, were compared. Analysis of the short-read libraries identified shared and distinct gene expression changes across the diseases. The same libraries were then assayed using enrichment probes to target 50 disease-related genes followed by long-read PacBio sequencing, enabling linkage between cell type and isoform expression. Vast mRNA isoform diversity was observed in all 50 targeted genes, even those that were not differentially expressed in the short-read data. We also developed an informatics method for detection of isoform structural differences in novel isoforms versus the reference annotation. These data expand available single-cell datasets of the human prefrontal cortical transcriptome with combined short- and long-read sequencing across AD, DLB, and PD, revealing increased mRNA isoform diversity that may contribute to disease features and could potentially represent therapeutic targets for neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

                <p>by Alexandre Guet-McCreight, Frank Mazza, Thomas D. Prevot, Etienne Sibille, Etay Hay</p>

Treatment for major depressive disorder (depression) often has partial efficacy and a large portion of patients are treatment resistant. Recent studies implicate reduced somatostatin (SST) interneuron inhibition in depression, and new pharmacology boosting this inhibition via positive allosteric modulators of α5-GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors (α5-PAM) offers a promising effective treatment. However, testing the effect of α5-PAM on human brain activity is limited, meriting the use of detailed simulations. We utilized our previous detailed computational models of human depression microcircuits with reduced SST interneuron inhibition and α5-PAM effects, to simulate EEG of individual microcircuits across depression severity and α5-PAM doses. We developed machine learning models that predicted optimal dose from EEG with high accuracy and recovered microcircuit activity and EEG. This study provides dose prediction models for α5-PAM administration based on EEG biomarkers of depression severity. Given limitations in doing the above in the living human brain, the results and tools we developed will facilitate translation of α5-PAM treatment to clinical use.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012041">The Burr distribution as a model for the delay between key events in an individual’s infection history</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Nyall Jamieson, Christiana Charalambous, David M. Schultz, Ian Hall</p>

Understanding the temporal relationship between key events in an individual’s infection history is crucial for disease control. Delay data between events, such as infection and symptom onset times, is doubly censored because the exact time at which these key events occur is generally unknown. Current mathematical models for delay distributions are derived from heuristic justifications. Here, we derive a new model for delay distributions, specifically for incubation periods, motivated by bacterial-growth dynamics that lead to the Burr family of distributions being a valid modelling choice. We also incorporate methods within these models to account for the doubly censored data. Our approach provides biological justification in the derivation of our delay distribution model, the results of fitting to data highlighting the superiority of the Burr model compared to currently used models when the mode of the distribution is clearly defined or when the distribution tapers off. Under these conditions, our results indicate that the derived Burr distribution is a better-performing model for incubation-period data than currently used methods, with the derived Burr distribution being 13 times more likely to be a better-performing model than the gamma distribution for Legionnaires’ disease based on data from a known outbreak.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97350">Eco-evolutionary dynamics of adapting pathogens and host immunity</a></h4>

              
                As pathogens spread in a population of hosts, immunity is built up, and the pool of susceptible individuals are depleted. This generates selective pressure, to which many human RNA viruses, such as influenza virus or SARS-CoV-2, respond with rapid antigenic evolution and frequent emergence of immune evasive variants. However, the host’s immune systems adapt, and older immune responses wane, such that escape variants only enjoy a growth advantage for a limited time. If variant growth dynamics and reshaping of host-immunity operate on comparable time scales, viral adaptation is determined by eco-evolutionary interactions that are not captured by models of rapid evolution in a fixed environment. Here, we use a Susceptible/Infected model to describe the interaction between an evolving viral population in a dynamic but immunologically diverse host population. We show that depending on strain cross-immunity, heterogeneity of the host population, and durability of immune responses, escape variants initially grow exponentially, but lose their growth advantage before reaching high frequencies. Their subsequent dynamics follows an anomalous random walk determined by future escape variants and results in variant trajectories that are unpredictable. This model can explain the apparent contradiction between the clearly adaptive nature of antigenic evolution and the quasi-neutral dynamics of high-frequency variants observed for influenza viruses.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95988">Unveiling chemotherapy-induced immune landscape remodeling and metabolic reprogramming in lung adenocarcinoma by scRNA-sequencing</a></h4>

              
                Chemotherapy is widely used to treat lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) patients comprehensively. Considering the limitations of chemotherapy due to drug resistance and other issues, it is crucial to explore the impact of chemotherapy and immunotherapy on these aspects. In this study, tumor samples from nine LUAD patients, of which four only received surgery and five received neoadjuvant chemotherapy, were subjected to scRNA-seq analysis. In vitro and in vivo assays, including flow cytometry, immunofluorescence, Seahorse assay, and tumor xenograft models, were carried out to validate our findings. A total of 83,622 cells were enrolled for subsequent analyses. The composition of cell types exhibited high heterogeneity across different groups. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that chemotherapy drove significant metabolic reprogramming in tumor cells and macrophages. We identified two subtypes of macrophages: Anti-mac cells (CD45+CD11b+CD86+) and Pro-mac cells (CD45+CD11b+ARG +) and sorted them by flow cytometry. The proportion of Pro-mac cells in LUAD tissues increased significantly after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Pro-mac cells promote tumor growth and angiogenesis and also suppress tumor immunity. Moreover, by analyzing the remodeling of T and B cells induced by neoadjuvant therapy, we noted that chemotherapy ignited a relatively more robust immune cytotoxic response toward tumor cells. Our study demonstrates that chemotherapy induces metabolic reprogramming within the tumor microenvironment of LUAD, particularly affecting the function and composition of immune cells such as macrophages and T cells. We believe our findings will offer insight into the mechanisms of drug resistance and provide novel therapeutic targets for LUAD in the future.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98349">Learning enhances behaviorally relevant representations in apical dendrites</a></h4>

              
                Learning alters cortical representations and improves perception. Apical tuft dendrites in cortical layer 1, which are unique in their connectivity and biophysical properties, may be a key site of learning-induced plasticity. We used both two-photon and SCAPE microscopy to longitudinally track tuft-wide calcium spikes in apical dendrites of layer 5 pyramidal neurons in barrel cortex as mice learned a tactile behavior. Mice were trained to discriminate two orthogonal directions of whisker stimulation. Reinforcement learning, but not repeated stimulus exposure, enhanced tuft selectivity for both directions equally, even though only one was associated with reward. Selective tufts emerged from initially unresponsive or low-selectivity populations. Animal movement and choice did not account for changes in stimulus selectivity. Enhanced selectivity persisted even after rewards were removed and animals ceased performing the task. We conclude that learning produces long-lasting realignment of apical dendrite tuft responses to behaviorally relevant dimensions of a task.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92741">TIPE drives a cancer stem-like phenotype by promoting glycolysis via PKM2/HIF-1α axis in melanoma</a></h4>

              
                TIPE (<i>TNFAIP8</i>) has been identified as an oncogene and participates in tumor biology. However, how its role in the metabolism of tumor cells during melanoma development remains unclear. Here, we demonstrated that TIPE promoted glycolysis by interacting with pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) in melanoma. We found that TIPE-induced PKM2 dimerization, thereby facilitating its translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. TIPE-mediated PKM2 dimerization consequently promoted HIF-1α activation and glycolysis, which contributed to melanoma progression and increased its stemness features. Notably, TIPE specifically phosphorylated PKM2 at Ser 37 in an extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-dependent manner. Consistently, the expression of TIPE was positively correlated with the levels of PKM2 Ser37 phosphorylation and cancer stem cell (CSC) markers in melanoma tissues from clinical samples and tumor bearing mice. In summary, our findings indicate that the TIPE/PKM2/HIF-1α signaling pathway plays a pivotal role in promoting CSC properties by facilitating the glycolysis, which would provide a promising therapeutic target for melanoma intervention.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95488">Impact of the clinically approved BTK inhibitors on the conformation of full-length BTK and analysis of the development of BTK resistance mutations in chronic lymphocytic leukemia</a></h4>

              
                Inhibition of Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) has proven to be highly effective in the treatment of B-cell malignancies such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), autoimmune disorders, and multiple sclerosis. Since the approval of the first BTK inhibitor (BTKi), Ibrutinib, several other inhibitors including Acalabrutinib, Zanubrutinib, Tirabrutinib, and Pirtobrutinib have been clinically approved. All are covalent active site inhibitors, with the exception of the reversible active site inhibitor Pirtobrutinib. The large number of available inhibitors for the BTK target creates challenges in choosing the most appropriate BTKi for treatment. Side-by-side comparisons in CLL have shown that different inhibitors may differ in their treatment efficacy. Moreover, the nature of the resistance mutations that arise in patients appears to depend on the specific BTKi administered. We have previously shown that Ibrutinib binding to the kinase active site causes unanticipated long-range effects on the global conformation of BTK (Joseph et al., 2020). Here, we show that binding of each of the five approved BTKi to the kinase active site brings about distinct allosteric changes that alter the conformational equilibrium of full-length BTK. Additionally, we provide an explanation for the resistance mutation bias observed in CLL patients treated with different BTKi and characterize the mechanism of action of two common resistance mutations: BTK T474I and L528W.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100011">Passive accumulation of alkaloids in inconspicuously colored frogs refines the evolutionary paradigm of acquired chemical defenses</a></h4>

              
                Understanding the origins of novel, complex phenotypes is a major goal in evolutionary biology. Poison frogs of the family Dendrobatidae have evolved the novel ability to acquire alkaloids from their diet for chemical defense at least three times. However, taxon sampling for alkaloids has been biased towards colorful species, without similar attention paid to inconspicuous ones that are often assumed to be undefended. As a result, our understanding of how chemical defense evolved in this group is incomplete. Here, we provide new data showing that, in contrast to previous studies, species from each undefended poison frog clade have measurable yet low amounts of alkaloids. We confirm that undefended dendrobatids regularly consume mites and ants, which are known sources of alkaloids. Thus, our data suggest that diet is insufficient to explain the defended phenotype. Our data support the existence of a phenotypic intermediate between toxin consumption and sequestration — passive accumulation — that differs from sequestration in that it involves no derived forms of transport and storage mechanisms yet results in low levels of toxin accumulation. We discuss the concept of passive accumulation and its potential role in the origin of chemical defenses in poison frogs and other toxin-sequestering organisms. In light of ideas from pharmacokinetics, we incorporate new and old data from poison frogs into an evolutionary model that could help explain the origins of acquired chemical defenses in animals and provide insight into the molecular processes that govern the fate of ingested toxins.

                Multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH) allows genome-scale imaging of RNAs in individual cells in intact tissues. To date, MERFISH has been applied to image thin-tissue samples of ~10 µm thickness. Here, we present a thick-tissue three-dimensional (3D) MERFISH imaging method, which uses confocal microscopy for optical sectioning, deep learning for increasing imaging speed and quality, as well as sample preparation and imaging protocol optimized for thick samples. We demonstrated 3D MERFISH on mouse brain tissue sections of up to 200 µm thickness with high detection efficiency and accuracy. We anticipate that 3D thick-tissue MERFISH imaging will broaden the scope of questions that can be addressed by spatial genomics.

                Previously, we reported that α-synuclein (α-syn) clusters synaptic vesicles (SV) Diao et al., 2013, and neutral phospholipid lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) can mediate this clustering Lai et al., 2023. Meanwhile, post-translational modifications (PTMs) of α-syn such as acetylation and phosphorylation play important yet distinct roles in regulating α-syn conformation, membrane binding, and amyloid aggregation. However, how PTMs regulate α-syn function in presynaptic terminals remains unclear. Here, based on our previous findings, we further demonstrate that N-terminal acetylation, which occurs under physiological conditions and is irreversible in mammalian cells, significantly enhances the functional activity of α-syn in clustering SVs. Mechanistic studies reveal that this enhancement is caused by the N-acetylation-promoted insertion of α-syn’s N-terminus and increased intermolecular interactions on the LPC-containing membrane. N-acetylation in our work is shown to fine-tune the interaction between α-syn and LPC, mediating α-syn’s role in synaptic vesicle clustering.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95106">Telomere length sensitive regulation of interleukin receptor 1 type 1 (IL1R1) by the shelterin protein TRF2 modulates immune signalling in the tumour microenvironment</a></h4>

              
                Telomeres are crucial for cancer progression. Immune signalling in the tumour microenvironment has been shown to be very important in cancer prognosis. However, the mechanisms by which telomeres might affect tumour immune response remain poorly understood. Here, we observed that interleukin-1 signalling is telomere-length dependent in cancer cells. Mechanistically, non-telomeric TRF2 (telomeric repeat binding factor 2) binding at the IL-1-receptor type-1 (IL1R1) promoter was found to be affected by telomere length. Enhanced TRF2 binding at the <i>IL1R1</i> promoter in cells with short telomeres directly recruited the histone-acetyl-transferase (HAT) p300, and consequent H3K27 acetylation activated IL1R1. This altered NF-kappa B signalling and affected downstream cytokines like <i>IL6, IL8,</i> and <i>TNF</i>. Further, <i>IL1R1</i> expression was telomere-sensitive in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) clinical samples. Infiltration of tumour-associated macrophages (TAM) was also sensitive to the length of tumour cell telomeres and highly correlated with <i>IL1R1</i> expression. The use of both IL1 Receptor antagonist (IL1RA) and <i>IL1R1</i> targeting ligands could abrogate M2 macrophage infiltration in TNBC tumour organoids. In summary, using TNBC cancer tissue (&gt;90 patients), tumour-derived organoids, cancer cells, and xenograft tumours with either long or short telomeres, we uncovered a heretofore undeciphered function of telomeres in modulating IL1 signalling and tumour immunity.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96536">A transcription network underlies the dual genomic coordination of mitochondrial biogenesis</a></h4>

              
                Mitochondrial biogenesis requires the expression of genes encoded by both the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes. However, aside from a handful transcription factors regulating specific subsets of mitochondrial genes, the overall architecture of the transcriptional control of mitochondrial biogenesis remains to be elucidated. The mechanisms coordinating these two genomes are largely unknown. We performed a targeted RNAi screen in developing eyes with reduced mitochondrial DNA content, anticipating a synergistic disruption of tissue development due to impaired mitochondrial biogenesis and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) deficiency. Among 638 transcription factors annotated in the <i>Drosophila</i> genome, 77 were identified as potential regulators of mitochondrial biogenesis. Utilizing published ChIP-seq data of positive hits, we constructed a regulatory network revealing the logic of the transcription regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis. Multiple transcription factors in core layers had extensive connections, collectively governing the expression of nearly all mitochondrial genes, whereas factors sitting on the top layer may respond to cellular cues to modulate mitochondrial biogenesis through the underlying network. CG1603, a core component of the network, was found to be indispensable for the expression of most nuclear mitochondrial genes, including those required for mtDNA maintenance and gene expression, thus coordinating nuclear genome and mtDNA activities in mitochondrial biogenesis. Additional genetic analyses validated YL-1, a transcription factor upstream of CG1603 in the network, as a regulator controlling CG1603 expression and mitochondrial biogenesis.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102667">Target protein identification in live cells and organisms with a non-diffusive proximity tagging system</a></h4>

              
                Identifying target proteins for bioactive molecules is essential for understanding their mechanisms, developing improved derivatives, and minimizing off-target effects. Despite advances in target identification (target-ID) technologies, significant challenges remain, impeding drug development. Most target-ID methods use cell lysates, but maintaining an intact cellular context is vital for capturing specific drug–protein interactions, such as those with transient protein complexes and membrane-associated proteins. To address these limitations, we developed POST-IT (Pup-On-target for Small molecule Target Identification Technology), a non-diffusive proximity tagging system for live cells, orthogonal to the eukaryotic system. POST-IT utilizes an engineered fusion of proteasomal accessory factor A and HaloTag to transfer Pup to proximal proteins upon directly binding to the small molecule. After significant optimization to eliminate self-pupylation and polypupylation, minimize depupylation, and optimize chemical linkers, POST-IT successfully identified known targets and discovered a new binder, SEPHS2, for dasatinib, and VPS37C as a new target for hydroxychloroquine, enhancing our understanding these drugs’ mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we demonstrated the application of POST-IT in live zebrafish embryos, highlighting its potential for broad biological research and drug development.

                Growing numbers of children and adults who are deaf are eligible to receive cochlear implants (CI), which provide access to everyday sound. CIs in both ears (bilateral CIs or BiCIs) are becoming standard of care in many countries. However, their effectiveness is limited because they do not adequately restore the acoustic cues essential for sound localization, particularly interaural time differences (ITDs) at low frequencies. The cochlea, the auditory sensory organ, typically transmits ITDs more effectively at the apical region, which is specifically "tuned" to low frequencies. We hypothesized that effective restoration of robust ITD perception through electrical stimulation with BiCIs depends on targeting cochlear locations that transmit information most effectively. Importantly, we show that these locations can occur anywhere along the cochlea, even on the opposite end of the frequency map from where ITD cues are most dominantly encoded in an acoustic hearing system.

">Truncated TrkB: The predominant TrkB Isoform in Nociceptors</a></h4>

              
                Truncated form of the tropomyosin receptor kinase B isoform (TrkBT1), traditionally considered a dominant-negative regulator of full-length TrkB (TrkBTK+), remains poorly understood in peripheral sensory neurons, particularly nociceptors. Furthermore, sensory neuronal TrkB expression and function has been traditionally associated with non-nociceptive neurons, particularly A{delta} low-threshold mechanoreceptors (A{delta}-LTMRs). In this study, we challenge these prevailing assumptions by demonstrating that TrkBT1 is the predominant TrkB isoform expressed in sensory neurons and plays a functional role in modulating neuronal activity. We present a comprehensive characterization of TrkBT1 expression and function in trigeminal sensory neurons and uncover its critical role in nociceptor activity, sensitization, and survival. Using western blot, immunohistochemistry and single-cell RTPCR, we demonstrate that TrkBT1 is the predominant isoform expressed in nociceptors, identified by markers such as TRPV1, TRPA1, TRPM8 and 5HT3A as well as non-nociceptors, while TrkBTK+ is restricted to non-nociceptive subpopulation. Functionally, we show that acute application of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) induces modest calcium influx in nociceptors, though unable to sensitize nociceptors. However, prolonged BDNF exposure significantly potentiates capsaicin-induced calcium influx, an effect blocked by the TrkB-specific antagonist ANA12. Intriguingly, BDNF also promotes the survival of both nociceptive and non-nociceptive sensory neurons in culture, an effect similarly dependent on TrkBT1 activity. Our data also reveal that ANA12 inhibits BDNF-mediated neuronal sensitization and survival in a concentration-dependent manner, implicating distinct TrkBT1 signaling pathways in these processes. Collectively, our findings redefine TrkBT1 as a functional modulator of nociceptor activity rather than a passive regulator of full-length TrkB. By uncovering its dual roles in nociceptor sensitization and survival, this study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms of BDNF/TrkB signaling in pain. Future work evaluating the role of TrkBT1 in sensory biology could offer new perspectives on how this receptor contributes to neuronal function and plasticity during chronic pain conditions.

">Subregional Biomarkers in FDG PET for Alzheimer's Diagnosis and Staging: An Interpretable and Explainable model</a></h4>

              
                Objective: To investigate the radiomics features of the hippocampus and the amygdala subregions in FDG-PET images that can best differentiate Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), Alzheimer's Disease (AD), and healthy patients. Methods: Baseline FDG-PET data from 555 participants in the ADNI dataset were analyzed, comprising 189 cognitively normal (CN) individuals, 201 with MCI, and 165 with AD. The hippocampus and amygdala were segmented based on the DKT-Atlas, with additional subdivisions guided by probabilistic atlases from Freesurfer. Then radiomic features (n=120) were extracted from 38 hippocampal subregions and 18 amygdala nuclei using PyRadiomics. Various feature selection techniques, including ANOVA, PCA, Chi-square, and LASSO, were applied alongside nine machine learning classifiers. Results: The Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model combined with LASSO demonstrated excellent classification performance: ROC AUC of 0.957 for CN vs. AD, ROC AUC of 0.867 for MCI vs. AD, and ROC AUC of 0.782 for CN vs. MCI. Key regions, including the accessory basal nucleus, presubiculum head, and CA4 head, were identified as critical biomarkers. Features including GLRLM (Long Run Emphasis) and Small Dependence Emphasis (GLDM) showed strong diagnostic potential, reflecting subtle metabolic and microstructural changes often preceding anatomical alterations. Conclusion: Specific hippocampal and amygdala subregions and their four radiomic features were found to have a significant role in the early diagnosis of AD, its staging, and its severity assessment by capturing subtle shifts in metabolic patterns. Furthermore, these features offer potential insights into the disease's underlying mechanisms and model interpretability.

">An Independent Coding Scheme for Distance versus Position in the Hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                Animals navigate using cognitive maps of their environment, integrating external landmarks and distances between them. Hippocampal place cells are the neuronal substrate of these cognitive maps. However, while hippocampal allocentric position coding in reference to external landmarks is well characterized, the determinants of idiothetic hippocampal distance coding remain poorly understood. Using virtual reality, electrophysiological recordings in mice, and local cue manipulations we could dissociate distance from position coding. In the cue-poor condition, we found pervasive distance coding with high distance indices in all bidirectional place cells including both superficial and deep CA1 pyramidal cells. In this condition, the mapping of distance onto a low-dimensional manifold and rigid distance relationships between place fields suggested strong attractor dynamics similar to those observed for grid cells. Inactivation of the medial septum (MS), which disrupts grid cells, significantly reduced both distance coding and rigid distance dynamics, suggesting an alteration (but not complete abolition) of the underlying attractor. In contrast, allocentric position coding could be observed in cue-rich environments, predominantly engaged deep CA1 pyramidal cells, and persisted during MS inactivation. These results are consistent with a selective contribution of grid cells and associated rigid attractor dynamics to hippocampal idiothetic distance coding but not allocentric position coding.

">Phylogenetic variation of immature neurons in mammalian amygdala: high prevalence in primate expanded nuclei projecting to neocortex</a></h4>

              
                Structural changes involving new neurons can occur through stem cell-driven neurogenesis and late-maturing immature neurons, namely undifferentiated neuronal precursors frozen in a state of arrested maturation. The latter exist in the cerebral cortex, being particularly abundant in large-brained mammals. Similar cells have been described in the amygdala of some species, although their interspecies variation remain poorly understood. Here, their occurrence, number, molecular expression, and morphology were systematically analyzed in eight diverse mammalian species widely differing in neuroanatomy, brain size, lifespan, and socioecology. We show remarkable phylogenetic variation of the immature neurons in the amygdala, with a significantly greater prevalence in primates. The cells are associated with the amygdala basolateral complex that in evolution has expanded in primates in conjunction with cortical projections, thus mimicking the general trend of the neocortex. These results support the emerging view that large brains performing complex socio-cognitive functions rely on wide reservoirs of immature neurons.

">Morphometric Identification of Parvalbumin-Positive Interneurons: A Data-Driven Approach</a></h4>

              
                Traditionally, anatomical studies of parvalbumin-positive (PV+) labelled interneurons describe them as a homogeneous population of neurons. In contrast, recent single-cell RNAseq studies have identified multiple transcriptomically distinct categories of PV+ cells. That difference between a single anatomical category of PV+ neurons and multiple transcriptomic categories presents a problem in understanding the role of these neurons in cortical function. One gap that might contribute to this discrepancy is that PV+ morphology is typically addressed using qualitative descriptions and simple quantifications, while single-cell RNAseq studies use big data and high dimensional analyses. PV+ neurons play critical roles in the experience-dependent development of the cortex and are often involved in disease-related changes associated with neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders. Here, we developed a modern data-driven analysis pipeline to quantify PV+ morphology. We quantified 97 morphometric features from 14274 PV+ neurons and applied unsupervised clustering that identified 13 different PV+ morphologies. We extended the analysis to compare PV+ dendritic arbour patterns and cell body morphologies. Finally, we compared the morphologies of PV+ neurons with the cell body morphologies of neurons expressing various genes associated with PV+ transcriptomic cell types. This approach identified a range of PV+ morphologies similar to the number of transcriptomic categories. It also found that the PV+ morphologies have cortical area, laminar, and transcriptomic biases that might contribute to cortical function.

">Latrophilin-3 conditional knockout in tyrosine hydroxylase neurons (Lphn3-Th-Cre) compared with Lphn3 global KO rats: Role of Lphn3 in tyrosine hydroxylase neurons on cognitive and behavioral effects of this ADHD susceptibility gene</a></h4>

              
                Latrophilin-3 (LPHN3) is a brain specific adhesion G-protein coupled receptor associated with elevated risk of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). We developed a global Lphn3 knock-out (gKO) rat using CRISPR/Cas9 to delete exon-3. Here we report the development of a floxed Lphn3 rat crossed with tyrosine hydroxylase (Th-Cre) rats to create a conditional Lphn3 KO rat specific for catecholaminergic-positive cells. The gKO rats are hyperactive and have egocentric and allocentric navigation deficits but showed sparing of conditioned contextual and novel object recognition memory. Here we compared gKO and cKO rats controlling for litter effects. Both gKO and cKO rats were hyperactive and were impaired in egocentric navigation in the Cincinnati water maze (CWM) with deficits greater in gKO rats. The gKO rats were impaired in allocentric navigation in the Morris water maze (MWM) whereas cKO rats were only slightly affected compared with WT, cre, and floxed rats. Striatal tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine D1 receptors were not significantly different in either model, nor were NMDA-NR1 or NMDA-NR2 in the hippocampus. We previously showed, however, that dopamine is released more rapidly in the striatum of gKO rats by fast-scan cyclic voltammetry. The cKO model shows an important role of catecholamines in the phenotype of LPHN3 disruption and add evidence that this synaptic protein plays a role in neuroplasticity that are consistent with ADHD.

">Integration of Transplanted Interneurons Over a New Period of Ocular Dominance Plasticity in Adult Mouse Visual Cortex</a></h4>

              
                Cortical interneurons play an important role in mediating the juvenile critical period for ocular dominance plasticity in the mouse primary visual cortex. Previously, we showed that transplantation of cortical interneurons derived from the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) opens a robust period of ocular dominance plasticity 33-35 days after transplantation into neonatal host visual cortex. The plasticity can be induced by transplanting either PV or SST MGE-derived cortical interneurons; it requires transplanted interneurons to express the vesicular GABAergic transporter; and it is manifested by changes to the host visual circuit. Here, we show that transplantation of MGE-derived cortical interneurons into the adult host visual cortex also opens a period of ocular dominance plasticity. The transplanted interneurons must be active to induce plasticity, and the neuronal activity and tuning of visually evoked responses in transplanted and host PV and SST interneurons are modulated by the locomotor state of the host. We also show that changes in activity over the period of plasticity induction are different between PV and SST interneurons but similar between host and transplanted interneurons of each type. The present findings demonstrate that the transplant-induced plasticity generated in adult visual cortex has many features in common with the role of these interneurons during the normal, juvenile critical period.

">Perceiving direction of deformation-based motion</a></h4>

              
                Transparent liquid flow deforms its background through light refraction, creating complex spatiotemporal patterns that challenge the visual system in discerning flow direction. This study investigates how the visual system perceptually resolves the direction of transparent liquid flow. Using two-dimensional 1/f noise as background, we sequentially deformed the noise with pre-defined displacement maps displaced across frames, systematically manipulating spatial frequency and displacement magnitude. Participants reported the perceived direction of deformation-based motion. The results emphasize the critical role of the relationship between the minimum wavelength and displacement magnitude. Performance declined when the displacement magnitude exceeded a certain proportion relative to the wavelength. Conversely, performance also dropped significantly under conditions of small displacements combined with low cut-off frequencies. Further analysis revealed the local deformation possibly hinders the detection of deformation-based motion. These findings enhance understanding of how global and local motion cues interact, providing insight into the visual system's processing of deformation-induced motion and transparency.

">Effects of Age and Cognitive Functions on the Neural Tracking of Speech in Noise</a></h4>

              
                Older adults often struggle to comprehend speech in noisy environments, a challenge influenced by declines in both auditory processing and cognitive functions. This study examines age-related differences in speech recognition in noise, focusing on the roles of delta (1-4 Hz) and theta (4-8 Hz) neural oscillations and their relationship with cognitive function, particularly working memory. Electroencephalography (EEG) was used to collect data from 23 young adults (20-35 years) and 23 older adults (65-80 years) with normal hearing. Cognitive assessments were administered to older adults, and both groups completed an EEG task involving speech recognition in Speech-Shaped Noise (SSN) at individualized noise levels based on their Sentence Recognition Scores (SRS). Results showed that age significantly impacted hit rates and reaction times in noisy speech recognition tasks. Theta-band neural tracking was notably stronger in older adults, while delta-band tracking showed no age-related difference. Pearson's correlations indicated significant associations between age-related cognitive decline, reduced hearing sensitivity, and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores. Regression analyses showed that theta-band neural tracking at specific SRS levels significantly predicted word list recognition in the higher SRT group, while constructional recall was strongly predicted in the lower SRT group. The findings suggest that older adults may rely on theta-band neural tracking as a compensatory mechanism to support speech perception in noise, with indirect links between working memory and speech perception. Further research is needed to explore the causal relationship between cognitive function and hearing.

">Prelimbic Cortex Activity Predicts Anxiety-Like Behavior in the Elevated Plus Maze</a></h4>

              
                The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) plays a critical role in emotional regulation, and its dysregulation is linked to anxiety disorders. In particular, the prelimbic cortex (PrL) of the mPFC is thought to modulate anxiety-related behaviors, though its precise role remains debated. Here, we used endoscopic in vivo calcium imaging to assess PrL neuronal activity in male and female Sprague-Dawley rats performing in the Elevated Plus Maze (EPM), a widely used task to measure anxiety-like behavior. We found that animals that spent less time in the open arms exhibited higher PrL activity in the open arms, suggesting that heightened PrL activity may reflect greater anxiety or increased avoidance behavior. These results suggest that the PrL may play a role in regulating the emotional response to anxiety-provoking situations, potentially influencing the tolerance for exposure to threatening environments.

	<p>Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s Disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a range of motor and non-motor symptoms (NMSs) that significantly impact patients&amp;amp;rsquo; quality of life. This review aims to synthesize the current literature on the application of brain stimulation techniques, including non-invasive methods such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), transcranial electrical stimulation (tES), transcranial focused ultrasound stimulation (tFUS), and transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (tVNS), as well as invasive approaches like deep brain stimulation (DBS). We explore the efficacy and safety profiles of these techniques in alleviating both motor impairments, such as bradykinesia and rigidity, and non-motor symptoms, including cognitive decline, depression, and impulse control disorders. Current findings indicate that while non-invasive techniques present a favorable safety profile and are effective for milder symptoms, invasive methods like DBS provide significant relief for severe cases that are unresponsive to other treatments. Future research is needed to optimize stimulation parameters, establish robust clinical protocols, and expand the application of these technologies across various stages of PD. This review underscores the potential of brain stimulation as a vital therapeutic tool in managing PD, paving the way for enhanced treatment strategies and improved patient outcomes.</p>

	<p>Background: Spatial working memory is crucial for processing visual and spatial information, serving as a foundation for complex cognitive tasks. However, the effects of prolonged sleep deprivation on its dynamics and underlying neural mechanisms remain unclear. This study aims to investigate the specific trends and neural mechanisms underlying spatial working memory alterations during 36 h of acute sleep deprivation. Methods: Twenty participants underwent a 36 h protocol of acute sleep deprivation. Utilizing the spatial 2-back task for assessing spatial working memory, combined with event-related potential (ERP) technology, we compared behavioral and neural responses at four critical time points&amp;amp;mdash;before deprivation, and after 12, 24, and 36 h of sleep deprivation&amp;amp;mdash;to uncover dynamic cognitive changes. Results: The findings indicate that the impact of sleep deprivation on spatial working memory exhibits significant temporal dependence. After 24 h of deprivation, both behavioral performance and ERP component amplitudes showed significant declines. During the period from 24 to 36 h, the amplitudes of the P2, N2, and P3 components exhibited a recovery trend, potentially reflecting neural compensatory mechanisms. Conclusions: The impact of 36 h acute sleep deprivation on spatial working memory is characterized by time-dependent and phase-specific effects. Initially, sleep deprivation leads to severe cognitive depletion, followed by an adaptive compensatory phase where neural mechanisms may partially restore function. These findings highlight the non-linear nature of cognitive impairment due to sleep deprivation, involving complex self-regulatory and compensatory mechanisms, with implications for understanding cognitive resilience and adaptive processes.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Autistic adults are more likely to be unemployed compared to neurotypical adults and those with disability. To address these poorer employment outcomes, it is important to consider factors that may be impacting on autistic adults&amp;amp;rsquo; employment outcomes. Anxiety is a common co-occurring condition for autistic adults; however, there is little research on how anxiety affects or influences autistic people&amp;amp;rsquo;s experience across the employment-seeking process. The aim of this study was to explore whether anxiety is perceived to affect autistic adults&amp;amp;rsquo; ability to engage in employment-seeking tasks. Methods: Online, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 12 autistic adults (22&amp;amp;ndash;52 years) who were actively seeking employment or had sought employment in the last 18 months. Interview transcripts were analysed using thematic analysis. Results: Three themes were generated from the data analysis. Theme 1, Finding the &amp;amp;ldquo;sweet spot&amp;amp;rdquo;, identified some level of anxiety&amp;amp;mdash;but not too much&amp;amp;mdash;was helpful in performing the employment-seeking tasks and this &amp;amp;ldquo;spot&amp;amp;rdquo; could vary depending on the person and the task. Theme 2, Anxiety affects the ability to perform and function, encapsulates the autistic person&amp;amp;rsquo;s experience when anxiety is too high. The third theme, The &amp;amp;ldquo;vicious cycle&amp;amp;rdquo; of anxiety and employment-seeking behaviours, explores participants&amp;amp;rsquo; ongoing experience of anxiety on their employment-seeking behaviours. Conclusions: The findings suggest that autistic job candidates would benefit from tailored accommodations and adjustments offered throughout the recruitment process, to reduce anxiety and improve employment-seeking outcomes for autistic candidates.</p>

	<p>Brain connectivity analysis plays a crucial role in unraveling the complex network dynamics of the human brain, providing insights into cognitive functions, behaviors, and neurological disorders. Traditional graph-theoretical methods, while foundational, often fall short in capturing the high-dimensional and dynamic nature of brain connectivity. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently emerged as a powerful approach for this purpose, with the potential to improve diagnostics, prognostics, and personalized interventions. This review examines recent studies leveraging GNNs in brain connectivity analysis, focusing on key methodological advancements in multimodal data integration, dynamic connectivity, and interpretability across various imaging modalities, including fMRI, MRI, DTI, PET, and EEG. Findings reveal that GNNs excel in modeling complex, non-linear connectivity patterns and enable the integration of multiple neuroimaging modalities to provide richer insights into both healthy and pathological brain networks. However, challenges remain, particularly in interpretability, data scarcity, and multimodal integration, limiting the full clinical utility of GNNs. Addressing these limitations through enhanced interpretability, optimized multimodal techniques, and expanded labeled datasets is crucial to fully harness the potential of GNNs for neuroscience research and clinical applications.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: The Sound Sensitivity Symptoms Questionnaire version 2 (SSSQ2) is a brief clinical tool with six items designed to be used (1) as a measure for severity of sound sensitivity symptoms in general (based on its total score) and (2) as a checklist to screen different forms of sound sensitivity. The objective of this study was to assess the psychometric properties of the SSSQ2. Method: This was a cross-sectional study. A total of 451 people completed the online survey. A total of 154 people completed the survey twice with a two-week interval to establish test&amp;amp;ndash;retest reliability. The average age of the participants was 36.5 years (range 18 to 86 years). Results: Confirmatory factor analysis showed that the SSSQ2 is a one-factor questionnaire. Cronbach&amp;amp;rsquo;s &amp;amp;alpha; was 0.80. The test&amp;amp;ndash;retest reliability was good for the total SSSQ2 score and was moderate for the sum of items 1 and 3 (indicating loudness hyperacusis), item 2 (for pain hyperacusis), item 4 (for misophonia), item 5 (for fear hyperacusis), and item 6 (for noise sensitivity). The minimum amount of change that constitutes a true change in the total SSSQ2 score is &amp;amp;ge;5 points. Conclusions: The SSSQ2 can be used in clinical practice or research setting to measure the severity of general sound sensitivity as a one-factor questionnaire with acceptable internal consistency and good reliability. In addition, the individual items in the SSSQ2 can be used as a checklist to screen for various forms of sound sensitivity.</p>

	<p>Background/objectives: Negative symptoms in schizophrenia spectrum disorders are related to impaired social functioning and lower quality of life, making accurate assessment important. To date, most tools for assessing negative symptoms are observational, which can be influenced by the raters&amp;amp;rsquo; experience and opinion. Self-rating scales, like the Self-Evaluation of Negative Symptoms (SNS), could complement observer ratings by adding information from the patient&amp;amp;rsquo;s perspective. Here, we aim to evaluate the psychometric properties of the Dutch translation of the SNS and the relationship between the SNS and functional outcomes. Methods: The SNS was added to the Pharmacotherapy Monitoring Outcome Survey (PHAMOUS)-protocol for adults with a DSM-5 classification of a disorder in the psychosis spectrum. Internal consistency was assessed by Cronbach&amp;amp;rsquo;s alpha. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to evaluate the construct validity of the five subscales of the SNS. Correlational analyses were performed between the SNS and the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), the Health of Nation Outcomes Scales (HoNOS), the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF), Functional Remission tool (FR) and the Manchester Short Assessment of Quality of Life (ManSA). Results: A total of 247 patients participated in this study. Internal consistency was good (&amp;amp;alpha; = 0.87). CFA confirmed the five-factor structure of the SNS. The SNS was significantly correlated (all p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) with the PANSS positive (r = 0.31), PANSS negative (r = 0.33), HoNOS (r = 0.37), FR (r = 0.27) and the ManSA (r = &amp;amp;minus;0.40). Conclusions: The Dutch SNS shows good psychometric properties and is related to functional outcomes and quality of life. The SNS can be valuable in complementing current observational-based instruments, and future research may investigate whether the SNS can be used as a standalone measurement tool for the assessment of negative symptoms.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/11/12/ENEURO.0209-24.2024?rss=1">Minimal Variation in Functional Connectivity in Relation to Daily Affect</a></h4>

              
                <p>Reported associations between functional connectivity and affective disorder symptoms are minimally reproducible, which can partially be attributed to difficulty capturing highly variable clinical symptoms in cross-sectional study designs. "Dense sampling" protocols, where participants are sampled across multiple sessions, can overcome this limitation by studying associations between functional connectivity and variable clinical states. Here, we characterized effect sizes for the association between functional connectivity and time-varying positive and negative daily affect in a nonclinical cohort. Data were analyzed from 24 adults who attended four research visits, where participants self-reported daily affect using the PANAS-X questionnaire and completed 39&nbsp;min of functional magnetic resonance imaging across three passive viewing conditions. We modeled positive and negative daily affect in relation to network-level functional connectivity, with hypotheses regarding within-network connectivity of the default mode, salience/cingulo-opercular, frontoparietal, dorsal attention, and visual networks and between-network connectivity of affective subcortical regions (amygdala and nucleus accumbens) with both default mode and salience/cingulo-opercular networks. Effect sizes for associations between affect and network-level functional connectivity were small and nonsignificant across analyses. We additionally report that functional connectivity variance is largely attributable to individual identity with small relative variance (&lt;3%) accounted for by within-subject daily affect variation. These results support previous reports that functional connectivity is dominated by stable subject-specific connectivity patterns, while additionally suggesting relatively minimal influence of day-to-day affect. Researchers planning studies examining functional connectivity in relation to daily affect, or other varying stable states, should therefore anticipate small effect sizes and carefully consider power in study planning.</p>

                <p>Preterm infants are at risk for brain injury and neurodevelopmental impairment due, in part, to white matter injury following chronic hypoxia exposure. However, the precise molecular mechanisms by which neonatal hypoxia disrupts early neurodevelopment are poorly understood. Here, we constructed a brain-wide map of the regenerative response to newborn brain injury using high-resolution imaging-based spatial transcriptomics to analyze over 800,000 cells in a mouse model of chronic neonatal hypoxia. Additionally, we developed a new method for inferring condition-associated differences in cell type spatial proximity, enabling the identification of niche-specific changes in cellular architecture. We observed hypoxia-associated changes in region-specific cell states, cell type composition, and spatial organization. Importantly, our analysis revealed mechanisms underlying reparative neurogenesis and gliogenesis, while also nominating pathways that may impede circuit rewiring following neonatal hypoxia. Altogether, our work provides a comprehensive description of the molecular response to newborn brain injury.</p>

                <p>by Yongqi Bu, Jiaxuan Liang, Zhen Li, Jianbo Wang, Jun Wang, Guoxian Yu</p>

Diagnosing cancer subtypes is a prerequisite for precise treatment. Existing multi-omics data fusion-based diagnostic solutions build on the requisite of sufficient samples with complete multi-omics data, which is challenging to obtain in clinical applications. To address the bottleneck of collecting sufficient samples with complete data in clinical applications, we proposed a flexible integrative model (CancerSD) to diagnose cancer subtype using limited samples with incomplete multi-omics data. CancerSD designs contrastive learning tasks and masking-and-reconstruction tasks to reliably impute missing omics, and fuses available omics data with the imputed ones to accurately diagnose cancer subtypes. To address the issue of limited clinical samples, it introduces a category-level contrastive loss to extend the meta-learning framework, effectively transferring knowledge from external datasets to pretrain the diagnostic model. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that CancerSD not only gives accurate diagnosis, but also maintains a high authenticity and good interpretability. In addition, CancerSD identifies important molecular characteristics associated with cancer subtypes, and it defines the Integrated CancerSD Score that can serve as an independent predictive factor for patient prognosis.

For the vast majority of genes in sequenced genomes, there is limited understanding of how they are regulated. Without such knowledge, it is not possible to perform a quantitative theory-experiment dialogue on how such genes give rise to physiological and evolutionary adaptation. One category of high-throughput experiments used to understand the sequence-phenotype relationship of the transcriptome is massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs). However, to improve the versatility and scalability of MPRAs, we need a “theory of the experiment” to help us better understand the impact of various biological and experimental parameters on the interpretation of experimental data. These parameters include binding site copy number, where a large number of specific binding sites may titrate away transcription factors, as well as the presence of overlapping binding sites, which may affect analysis of the degree of mutual dependence between mutations in the regulatory region and expression levels. To that end, in this paper we create tens of thousands of synthetic gene expression outputs for bacterial promoters using both equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium models. These models make it possible to imitate the summary statistics (information footprints and expression shift matrices) used to characterize the output of MPRAs and thus to infer the underlying regulatory architecture. Specifically, we use a more refined implementation of the so-called thermodynamic models in which the binding energies of each sequence variant are derived from energy matrices. Our simulations reveal important effects of the parameters on MPRA data and we demonstrate our ability to optimize MPRA experimental designs with the goal of generating thermodynamic models of the transcriptome with base-pair specificity. Further, this approach makes it possible to carefully examine the mapping between mutations in binding sites and their corresponding expression profiles, a tool useful not only for developing a theory of transcription, but also for exploring regulatory evolution.

                <p>by Tal Gutman, Tamir Tuller</p>

The P-glycoprotein efflux pump, encoded by the <i>MDR1</i> gene, is an ATP-driven transporter capable of expelling a diverse array of compounds from cells. Overexpression of this protein is implicated in the multi-drug resistant phenotype observed in various cancers. Numerous studies have attempted to decipher the impact of genetic variants within <i>MDR1</i> on P-glycoprotein expression, functional activity, and clinical outcomes in cancer patients. Among these, three specific single nucleotide polymorphisms—<i>T1236C</i>, <i>T2677G</i>, and <i>T3435C</i> - have been the focus of extensive research efforts, primarily through in vitro cell line models and clinical cohort analyses. However, the findings from these studies have been remarkably contradictory. In this study, we employ a computational, data-driven approach to systematically evaluate the effects of these three variants on principal stages of the gene expression process. Leveraging current knowledge of gene regulatory mechanisms, we elucidate potential mechanisms by which these variants could modulate P-glycoprotein levels and function. Our findings suggest that all three variants significantly change the mRNA folding in their vicinity. This change in mRNA structure is predicted to increase local translation elongation rates, but not to change the protein expression. Nonetheless, the increased translation rate near <i>T3435C</i> is predicted to affect the protein’s co-translational folding trajectory in the region of the second ATP binding domain. This potentially impacts P-glycoprotein conformation and function. Our study demonstrates the value of computational approaches in elucidating the functional consequences of genetic variants. This framework provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms of <i>MDR1</i> variants and their potential impact on cancer prognosis and treatment resistance. Furthermore, we introduce an approach which can be systematically applied to identify mutations potentially affecting mRNA folding in pathology. We demonstrate the utility of this approach on both ClinVar and TCGA and identify hundreds of disease related variants that modify mRNA folding at essential positions.

                <p>by Nikoleta E. Glynatsi, Vincent Knight, Marc Harper</p>

Researchers have explored the performance of Iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma strategies for decades, from the celebrated performance of Tit for Tat to the introduction of the zero-determinant strategies and the use of sophisticated learning structures such as neural networks. Many new strategies have been introduced and tested in a variety of tournaments and population dynamics. Typical results in the literature, however, rely on performance against a small number of somewhat arbitrarily selected strategies, casting doubt on the generalizability of conclusions. In this work, we analyze a large collection of 195 strategies in thousands of computer tournaments, present the top performing strategies across multiple tournament types, and distill their salient features. The results show that there is not yet a single strategy that performs well in diverse Iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma scenarios, nevertheless there are several properties that heavily influence the best performing strategies. This refines the properties described by Axelrod in light of recent and more diverse opponent populations to: be nice, be provocable and generous, be a little envious, be clever, and adapt to the environment. More precisely, we find that strategies perform best when their probability of cooperation matches the total tournament population’s aggregate cooperation probabilities. The features of high performing strategies help cast some light on why strategies such as Tit For Tat performed historically well in tournaments and why zero-determinant strategies typically do not fare well in tournament settings.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Computed tomography perfusion (CTP) imaging is crucial in quantifying cerebral blood flow (CBF) and thereby making an endovascular treatment (EVT) after large vessel occlusion. However, CTP is prone to overestimating the ischemic core. We sought to delineate the optimal regional CBF (rCBF) thresholds of pre-EVT CTP.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We collected acute ischemic stroke patients due to large vessel occlusion who achieved successful recanalization with baseline CTP, immediate post-EVT diffusion-weighted image (DWI) within 3 hours, and delayed post-EVT DWI between 24 and 196 hours. Core volumes estimated by CTP at various rCBF thresholds were validated against immediate and delayed DWI lesion volumes.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 175 acute large vessel occlusion patients were included. Baseline CTP was taken in a median of 24 minutes (interquartile range [IQR] 21–31 minutes) after arrival; after the CTP, groin puncture in a median of 37 minutes (IQR 28–52 minutes), immediate post-EVT DWI scans in a median of 1.6 hours (IQR 0.8–2.1 hours), and delayed DWI scans in a median of 89 hours (IQR 69–106 hours). The correlations between the rCBF thresholds were the best at rCBF &lt;22% for immediate DWI (0.64; 95% CI 0.55–0.73) and at rCBF &lt;30% for delayed DWI (0.69; 95% CI 0.61–0.76). The interval between CTP and recanalization was inversely correlated with the overestimation of ischemic core volume compared with the subsequent DWI.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Optimal rCBF thresholds for estimating ischemic core using CTP depend significantly on the timing of DWI post-EVT and CTP to recanalization delay. The optimal rCBF thresholds for ischemic core estimation may vary depending on the clinical setting. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>In keeping with the historical focus of this special issue of Hippocampus, this paper reviews the history of my development of the SPEAR model. The SPEAR model proposes that separate phases of encoding and retrieval (SPEAR) allow effective storage of multiple overlapping associative memories in the hippocampal formation and other cortical structures. The separate phases for encoding and retrieval are proposed to occur within different phases of theta rhythm with a cycle time on the order of 125 ms. The same framework applies to the slower transition between encoding and consolidation dynamics regulated by acetylcholine. The review includes description of the experimental data on acetylcholine and theta rhythm that motivated this model, the realization that existing associative memory models require these different dynamics, and the subsequent experimental data supporting these dynamics. The review also includes discussion of my work on the encoding of episodic memories as spatiotemporal trajectories, and some personal description of the episodic memories from my own spatiotemporal trajectory as I worked on this model.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23668?af=R">The Anatomy of Context</a></h4>

              
                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>For most of my career, I focused on understanding how and where spatial context, the place where things happen, is represented in the brain. My interest in this began in the early 1990's, during my postdoctoral training with David Amaral, when we defined the rodent homolog of the primate parahippocampal cortex, a region implicated in processing spatial and contextual information. We parceled out the caudal portion of the rat perirhinal cortex (PER) and called it the postrhinal cortex (POR). In my own lab at Brown University, I continued to study the anatomy of the PER, POR, and entorhinal cortices. I also began to characterize and differentiate the functions of these regions, particularly the newly defined POR and the redefined PER. Our electrophysiological and behavioral evidence supports a view of POR function that aligns with our anatomical evidence. Briefly, the POR integrates object and feature information from the PER with spatial information from the retrosplenial, posterior parietal, and secondary visual cortices and the pulvinar and uses this information to represent specific environmental contexts, including the spatial arrangement of objects and features within each context. In addition to maintaining a representation of the current context, the POR plays an attentional role by continually monitoring the context for changes and updating the context representation when changes occur. This context representation is accessible to other regions for cognitive processes, including binding life events with context to form episodic memories, guiding context-relevant behavior, and recognizing objects within scenes and contexts.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23677?af=R">Towards an Understanding of the Dentate Gyrus Hilus</a></h4>

              
                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>For many years, the hilus of the dentate gyrus (DG) was a mystery because anatomical data suggested a bewildering array of cells without clear organization. Moreover, some of the anatomical information led to more questions than answers. For example, it had been identified that one of the major cell types in the hilus, the mossy cell, innervates granule cells (GCs). However, mossy cells also targeted local GABAergic neurons. Furthermore, it was not yet clear if mossy cells were glutamatergic or GABAergic. This led to many debates about the role of mossy cells. However, it was clear that hilar neurons, including mossy cells, were likely to have very important functions because they provided strong input to GCs. Hilar neurons also attracted attention in epilepsy because pathological studies showed that hilar neurons were often lost, but GCs remained. Vulnerability of hilar neurons also occurred after traumatic brain injury and ischemia. These observations fueled an interest to understand hilar neurons and protect them, an interest that continues to this day. This article provides a historical and personal perspective into the ways that I sought to contribute to resolving some of the debates and moving the field forward. Despite several technical challenges the outcomes of the studies have been worth the effort with some surprising findings along the way. Given the growing interest in the hilus, and the advent of multiple techniques to selectively manipulate hilar neurons, there is a great opportunity for future research.</p>

                In pancreatic cancer, significant alterations occur in the local nervous system, including axonogenesis, neural remodeling, perineural invasion, and perineural neuritis. Pancreatic cancer can impact the central nervous system (CNS) through cancer cell-intrinsic factors or systemic factors, particularly in the context of cancer cachexia. These peripheral and central neuropathic changes exert substantial influence on cancer initiation and progression. Moreover, chemotherapy-induced neuropathy is common in pancreatic cancer, causing peripheral nerve damage and cognitive dysfunction. Targeting the crosstalk between pancreatic cancer and the nervous system, either peripherally or centrally, holds promise in cancer treatment, pain relief, and improved quality of life. Here, we summarize recent findings on the molecular mechanisms behind these neuropathic changes in pancreatic cancer and discuss potential intervention strategies.

">Differentiating BOLD and non-BOLD signals in fMRI time series using cross-cortical depth delay patterns</a></h4>

              
                Over the past two decades, rapid advancements in magnetic resonance technology have significantly enhanced the imaging resolution of functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), far surpassing its initial capabilities. Beyond mapping brain functional architecture at unprecedented scales, high-spatial-resolution acquisitions have also inspired and enabled several novel analytical strategies that can potentially improve the sensitivity and neuronal specificity of fMRI. With small voxels, one can sample from different levels of the vascular hierarchy within the cerebral cortex and resolve the temporal progression of hemodynamic changes from parenchymal to pial vessels. We propose that this characteristic pattern of temporal progression across cortical depths can aid in distinguishing neurogenic blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) signals from typical nuisance factors arising from non-BOLD origins, such as head motion and pulsatility. In this study, we examine the feasibility of applying cross-cortical depth temporal delay patterns to automatically categorize BOLD and non-BOLD signal components in modern-resolution BOLD-fMRI data. We construct an independent component analysis (ICA)-based framework for fMRI de-noising, analogous to previously proposed multi-echo (ME) ICA, except that here we explore the across-depth instead of across-echo dependence to distinguish BOLD and non-BOLD components. The efficacy of this framework is demonstrated using visual task data at three graded spatiotemporal resolutions (voxel sizes = 1.1, 1.5, and 2.0 mm isotropic at temporal intervals = 1700, 1120, and 928 ms). The proposed framework leverages prior knowledge of the spatiotemporal properties of BOLD-fMRI and serves as an alternative to ME-ICA for cleaning moderate- and high-spatial-resolution fMRI data when multi-echo acquisitions are not available.

">The Effect of Visual Field Occlusion on Visually Induced Motion Sickness</a></h4>

              
                Visually induced motion sickness (VIMS), characterized by symptoms such as dizziness, nausea, and postural instability, presents significant challenges in modern visual and interactive technologies. These symptoms undermine the immersion into and comfort of virtual and augmented reality (VR/AR) systems and reduce the usability of autonomous vehicles, highlighting the urgent need to address VIMS for broader adoption of these technologies. While previous studies have largely focused on the motion characteristics that induce VIMS, the impact of visual field configuration, such as segmentation and occlusion, has been largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we conducted five human psychophysics experiments systematically investigating how visual field segmentation and masking influence VIMS under controlled three-dimensional optical flow conditions. Participants were exposed to different masking patterns, including variations in the number of divided sections, the masking of the central screen region, and the thickness of the masks. Paired-comparison methods were employed to assess participants' susceptibility to VIMS under each condition. Our findings showed that visual field segmentation significantly influenced VIMS susceptibility. Specifically, the results revealed three key findings: (1) segmenting the visual field into multiple subsections using visual masks significantly increased VIMS susceptibility, (2) thinner masks exacerbated motion sickness more than thicker ones, and (3) masking the central region of the screen reduced susceptibility. These effects were independent of the presented motion patterns. Our findings offer new insights for optimizing the design of VR/AR systems, graphical user interfaces, and autonomous vehicles by highlighting the importance of visual field configuration in mitigating VIMS for improving user experience.

">PrecisionTrack: Reliable Tracking of Large Groups of Animals Interacting in Complex Environments Over Extended Periods</a></h4>

              
                Mice living in complex social groups within ethological environments exhibit a wide range of adaptive behaviors, including individual and group dynamics, often undetected in standard behavioral studies. To better understand the coping and adaptive strategies employed by each member of a social colony, it is necessary to develop tools that enable accurate, long-term monitoring of large groups of animals in a fully automated and unbiased manner. In this work, we introduce PrecisionTrack, a practical solution to the multi-animal pose tracking problem. This solution enables an accurate and reliable tracking of large groups of animal socially interacting within complex environments, even over prolonged periods. Our algorithm builds on a Transformer-CNN hybrid neural network for cross-species classification, detection, and pose estimation, leveraging pose-based matching AI-driven ArUco identification for fast and accurate re-identification. PrecisionTrack demonstrates superior performance in tracking accuracy and latency compared to current gold standards, while sustaining these capabilities over extended periods when tracking large groups of animals in complex environments. Furthermore, we trained PrecisionTrack to identify and monitor over 30 animal species. Overall, PrecisionTrack represents a reliable, accessible step toward adopting more ethological methodologies in behavioral research.

">Longer Interstimulus Intervals Enhance Efficacy of Automated Phase-Targeted Auditory Stimulation on Procedural Memory Consolidation</a></h4>

              
                Up-phase-targeted auditory stimulation (up-PTAS) during slow-wave sleep has become a valuable tool for modulating slow oscillations and slow-oscillation-spindle-coupling in favor of overnight memory retention. Developing effective, automated protocols for translation into more naturalistic or clinical settings is an ongoing challenge, especially given that current PTAS protocols and their behavioral effects vary greatly between different studies. Here, we assessed the electrophysiological and behavioral effects of systematically varying interstimulus intervals (ISIs) in automated up-PTAS in the home setting, using a mobile PTAS device and app-based behavioral tasks. Building on studies suggesting a non-linear relationship between stimulus number and PTAS effects, we show that applying fewer stimuli with longer ISIs enhanced overnight memory consolidation of a finger-tapping sequence more effectively than applying more stimuli with shorter ISIs. The behavioral response was predicted by the number of stimuli with auditory evoked K-complexes relative to the number of stimuli without K-complexes. PTAS stimuli applied at longer ISIs (> 1.25) were associated with a higher likelihood of K-complex responses and fast spindles nesting in the K-complex up-phase. Our results suggest that up-PTAS can be optimized for overnight memory consolidation by introducing ISIs of at least 1.25s. Our study highlights the feasibility of longitudinal at-home PTAS combined with app-based behavioral tasks in healthy participants while leveraging the mechanistic insights such data can offer.

Statement of SignificancePhase-targeted auditory stimulation (PTAS) holds great promise for non-invasively enhancing essential functions of slow-wave sleep. However, current protocols have produced variable results and are often confined to laboratory settings. Our study demonstrates the feasibility of a mobile application of automated PTAS and provides experimental evidence that prolonging interstimulus intervals positively affects overnight procedural memory consolidation via K-complexes and coupled sleep spindles. As K-complexes may also be involved in cardiovascular function and brain waste clearance, the proposed protocol optimization may have effects beyond memory enhancement. Together, our findings lay a foundation for a broader application of PTAS in clinical longitudinal studies to improve patient care and recovery outcomes.

">Sub-second characterization of locomotor activities of mouse models of Parkinsonism</a></h4>

              
                The degeneration of midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons disrupts the neural control of natural behavior, such as walking, posture, and gait in Parkinsons disease. While some aspects of motor symptoms can be managed by dopamine replacement therapies, others respond poorly. Recent advancements in machine learning-based technologies offer opportunities for unbiased segmentation and quantification of natural behavior in both healthy and diseased states. In the present study, we applied the motion sequencing (MoSeq) platform to study the spontaneous locomotor activities of neurotoxin and genetic mouse models of Parkinsonism as the midbrain DA neurons progressively degenerate. We also evaluated the treatment efficacy of levodopa (L-DOPA) on behavioral modules at fine time scales. We revealed robust changes in the kinematics and usage of the behavioral modules that encode spontaneous locomotor activity. Further analysis demonstrates that fast behavioral modules with higher velocities were more vulnerable to loss of DA and preferentially affected at early stages of Parkinsonism. Last, L-DOPA effectively improved the velocity, but not the usage and transition probability, of behavioral modules of Parkinsonian animals. In conclusion, the hypokinetic phenotypes in Parkinsonism are mediated by the decreased velocities of behavioral modules and the disrupted temporal organization of sub-second modules into actions. Moreover, we showed that the therapeutic effect of L-DOPA is mainly mediated by its effect on the velocities of behavior modules at fine time scales. This work documents robust changes in the velocity, usage, and temporal organization of behavioral modules and their responsiveness to dopaminergic treatment under the Parkinsonian state.

">Pro-cognitive reshaping of neuronal dynamics by a human CSF-based factor</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal connection dysfunction is a convergent cause of cognitive deficits in mental disorders. Cognitive processes are finely regulated at the synaptic level by membrane proteins, some of which are shed and detectable in patients cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). However, whether these soluble synaptic proteins can harnessed as innovative pro-cognitive factors to treat brain disorders remains unclear. Here, we use quantitative proteomics to identify shed synaptic proteins dysregulated in the CSF of subjects with schizophrenia (SCZ), a mental disorder characterized by cognitive and synaptic dysfunction. The level of a yet uncharacterized soluble form of the voltage-gated calcium channel auxiliary subunit, 2{delta}-1, is robustly reduced in SCZ CSF. Remarkably, soluble 2{delta}-1 is convergently downregulated across several brain disorder CSF proteomes. We show that the brain releases soluble 2{delta}-1 in an activity-dependent manner, which can reorganize neuronal network dynamics by binding to synaptic targets and promoting inhibitory neuron plasticity. A single brain injection of a synthetic soluble 2{delta}-1 improved interneuron and cognitive deficits in a mutant mouse model of SCZ and cortical dysfunction. These findings underscore the potential of shed synaptic proteins as novel therapeutic agents capable of enhancing brain function in diverse brain disorders characterized by cognitive impairment.

">Aggression experience and observation promote shared behavioral and neural changes</a></h4>

              
                The ability to observe the social behavior of others and use observed information to bias future action is a fundamental building block of social cognition. A foundational question is whether social observation and experience engage common circuit mechanisms that enable behavioral change. While classic studies on social learning have shown that aggressive behaviors can be learned through observation, it remains unclear whether aggression observation promotes persistent neural changes that generalize to new contexts. Here, to directly compare the effects of aggression experience and observation at brain-wide scale, we develop a strategy to perform large-scale cell-type specific recordings across subcortical networks for social behavior control and learning. We record longitudinally while animals train through direct experience or observation, then probe shared differences in behavior and neural activity in a novel hard aggression context. Using supervised and unsupervised methods for behavioral quantification, we detect unique signatures of a shared behavioral strategy not present in animals with no training. During observation, we find widespread activation that mimics experience in networks for behavior generation, with critical differences in signals associated with reward and threat learning. After observation, we observe that changes persist into the novel aggression context, with increased similarity in the neural dynamics between experience and observation groups. Network-level modeling reveals persistent shared changes to a core aggression network, with widespread decoupling of inhibition from a key hypothalamic output region. This demonstrates that experience-like activity during observation can recruit a shared plasticity mechanism that biases behavior toward adaptive defensive strategies in new contexts.

">Ultrastructural membrane dynamics of mouse and human cortical synapses</a></h4>

              
                Live human brain tissues provide unique opportunities for understanding the physiology and pathophysiology of synaptic transmission. Investigations have been limited to anatomy, electrophysiology, and protein localization--while crucial parameters such as synaptic vesicle dynamics were not visualized. Here we utilize zap-and-freeze time-resolved electron microscopy to overcome this hurdle. First we validate the approach with acute mouse brain slices to demonstrate that axons parallel to the electrical field can be stimulated to produce calcium signaling. Next we show that ultrafast endocytosis is induced and can be captured in both mouse and human brain slices. Crucially, in both species a protein essential for ultrafast endocytosis Dynamin 1xA (Dyn1xA) localizes to the region peripheral to the active zone, the putative endocytic zone, indicating a likely mechanism conservation between mouse and human. This approach has the potential to reveal dynamic, high-resolution information about synaptic membrane trafficking in intact human brain slices.

">Visual circuitry for distance estimation in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Animals must infer the three-dimensional structure of their environment from two-dimensional images on their retinas. In particular, visual cues like motion parallax and binocular disparity can be used to judge distances to objects. Studies across several animal models have found neural signals that correlate with visual distance, but the causal role of these neurons in distance estimation as well as the range of possible neural properties that can inform distance estimation have remained poorly understood. Here, we developed a novel high-throughput behavioral assay to identify neurons in the Drosophila visual system that are involved in distance estimation during free locomotion. We found that silencing the primary motion detectors in the fly visual system eliminated their ability to perceive distance, consistent with a reliance on motion parallax to judge distance. Through a targeted silencing screen of visual neurons during behavior and through in vivo two-photon microscopy, we identified a visual projection neuron that encodes the parallax signal in the relative motion of foreground and background. Interestingly, it differs from previously identified parallax-tuned neurons in its lack of direction selectivity both to moving bars and to moving backgrounds. This non-canonical tuning is interpretable in the context of parallax signals that the fly would likely encounter during naturalistic walking behavior. Our results demonstrate how both direction selective and non-direction selective feature-detecting neurons can contribute to distance estimation using parallax cues, providing a framework for considering broader classes of parallax-encoding neurons in distance estimation across visual systems.

                Many artificial neural networks (ANNs) trained with ecologically plausible objectives on naturalistic data align with behavior and neural representations in biological systems. Here, we show that this alignment is a consequence of convergence onto the same representations by high-performing ANNs and by brains. We developed a method to identify stimuli that systematically vary the degree of inter-model representation agreement. Across language and vision, we then showed that stimuli from high-and low-agreement sets predictably modulated model-to-brain alignment. We also examined which stimulus features distinguish high-from low-agreement sentences and images. Our results establish representation universality as a core component in the model-to-brain alignment and provide a new approach for using ANNs to uncover the structure of biological representations and computations.

">Neurodevelopmental deviations in schizophrenia: Evidences from multimodal connectome-based brain ages</a></h4>

              
                BackgroundPathologic schizophrenia process originate early in brain development, leading to detectable brain alterations via structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Recent MRI studies have sought to characterize disease effects from a brain age perspective, but developmental deviations from the typical brain age trajectory in youths with schizophrenia remain unestablished.

AimThis study investigated brain development deviations in early-onset schizophrenia (EOS) patients by applying machine learning algorithms to structural and functional MRI data.

MethodsMultimodal MRI data, including T1-weighted MRI (T1w-MRI), diffusion MRI, and resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) data, were collected from 80 antipsychotic-naive first-episode EOS patients and 91 typically developing (TD) controls. The morphometric similarity connectome (MSC), structural connectome (SC), and functional connectome (FC) were separately constructed by using these three modalities. According to these connectivity features, eight brain age estimation models were first trained with the TD group, the best of which was then used to predict brain ages in patients. Individual brain age gaps (BAGs) were assessed as brain ages minus chronological ages.

ResultsBoth the SC and MSC features performed well in brain age estimation, whereas the FC features did not. Compared with the TD controls, the EOS patients presented widened structural BAGs, with opposite trends between childhood and adolescence. These increased absolute BAG scores for EOS patients were positively correlated with the severity of their clinical symptoms.

ConclusionThese findings from a multimodal brain age perspective suggest that advanced BAGs exist early in youths with schizophrenia.

Motor sequence learning may arise from three distinct processes: (1) improved execution of individual movements independent of their sequential context; (2) enhanced anticipation of "what" movement should be executed next, enabling faster initiation; and (3) the development of motoric sequence-specific representations that encode "how" movements should be optimally performed within a sequence. However, many existing paradigms conflate the "what" and "how" components of learning, as participants often acquire both the sequence content (what to do) and its execution (how to do it). This overlap obscures the distinct contributions of each mechanism to motor sequence learning. In this study, we disentangled these mechanisms using a continuous reaching task. Performance in trained sequences was compared to random sequences to rule out improvements attributable solely to isolated movement execution. By also varying how many upcoming targets were visible we assessed the role of anticipation in learning. When participants could only see one future target, improvements were mostly due to them learning which target would come next. When they could see four future targets, participants immediately demonstrated fast movement times and increased movement smoothness, surpassing late-stage performance in the one target condition. Crucially, even with full visibility of future targets, participants showed further sequence-specific learning caused by a continuous optimization of movement trajectories. Follow-up experiments revealed that the learned sequence representations were effector-specific and encoded contextual information of four movements or longer. Our paradigm enables a clear dissociation between the "what" and "how" components of motor sequence learning and provides compelling evidence for the development of effector-specific sequence representations that guide optimal movement execution.

">Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex TMS evokes responses in the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex: Evidence from human intracranial EEG</a></h4>

              
                Transcranial magnetic stimulation combined with intracranial local field potential recordings in humans (TMS-iEEG) represents a new method for investigating electrophysiologic effects of TMS with spatiotemporal precision. We applied TMS-iEEG to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) in two subjects and demonstrate evoked activity in the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC). This study provides direct electrophysiologic evidence that dlPFC TMS, as targeted for depression treatment, can modulate brain activity in the sgACC.

">Hindering memory suppression by perturbing the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex</a></h4>

              
                A reminder of the past can trigger the involuntary retrieval of an unwanted memory. Yet, we can intentionally stop this process and thus prevent the memory from entering awareness. Such suppression not only transiently hinders the retrieval of the memory, it can also induce forgetting. Neuroimaging has implicated the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) in initiating this process. Specifically, this region seems to downregulate activity in brain systems that would otherwise support the reinstatement of the memory. We here probed the causal contribution of the right dlPFC to suppression by combining the Think/No-Think task with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). Participants first learned pairs of cue and target words, and then repeatedly recalled some of the targets (think condition) and suppressed others (no-think condition). We applied 10 Hz rTMS bursts to the right dlPFC during the suppression of half the no-think items, and to the contra-lateral primary motor area (M1) as an active control site during the other half. As hypothesized, participants experienced less success at keeping the memories out of awareness with concurrent dlPFC than M1 stimulation. Similarly, a memory test yielded evidence for suppression-induced forgetting (SIF) following M1 but not dlPFC stimulation. However, the difference in forgetting between the stimulation conditions was not significant. The study thus provides causal evidence for the role of the dlPFC in preventing retrieval. Future work will need to conclusively establish the relationship between this transient effect and suppression-induced forgetting.

">Hippocampal sharp-wave ripples decrease during physical actions including consummatory behavior in immobile rodents</a></h4>

              
                Hippocampal sharp-wave ripples (SWRs) are intermittent, fast synchronous oscillations that play a pivotal role in memory formation. It is well known that SWRs occur during "consummatory behaviors", e.g., eating or drinking a reward for correct action. However, most of typical behavioral experiments using freely-moving rodents have not rigorously distinguished eating/drinking itself (regardless of whether it means consummation or consumption) from stopping locomotion (immobility). In this study, therefore, we examined the occurrence of SWRs during a reward-seeking action and subsequent consummatory reward licking in constantly immobile rats under head fixation and body restriction. The immobile rats performed a pedal hold-release action that was rewarded with water every other time for their correct action (false and true consummation). Unexpectedly, the SWRs remarkably decreased during reward licking as well as pedal release action. Unlearned rats also showed a similar SWR decrease during water licking. On the other hand, the SWRs increased gradually during pedal hold period, which was enhanced by reward expectation. A cluster of hippocampal neurons responded to Cue/pedal release and reward as known previously. Some other clusters exhibited spike activity changes similar to the SWR occurrence, i.e., decreasing during the pedal release action and reward licking, and enhanced by reward expectation during pedal hold period. These task event-responsive neurons and SWR-like neurons displayed stronger spiking synchrony with the SWRs than task-unrelated neurons. These findings suggest that the hippocampus generates the SWRs, which may associate action with outcome, in animals "relative immobility" (action pauses) rather than specific consummation or consumption.

Significance StatementTo clarify the nature of sharp-wave ripples (SWRs) in the hippocampus, we analyzed the SWRs occurring during operant task performance by immobile rats under head-fixation and body restriction. First, we found the SWRs decreased when they licked and drank water, which conflicts with the theory that the SWRs occur in consummatory behavior. Second, hippocampal neurons showed different task-related activities, particularly those that resemble the SWR occurrence and those that conveyed specific signals on task events. Third, these task-related neurons displayed strong synchronous discharges during the SWRs in task-engaged periods. These findings may explain the neuronal mechanism underlying the association between an action and its outcome.

">Modulation of hippocampal sharp-wave ripples by behavioral states and body movements in head-fixed rodents</a></h4>

              
                Hippocampal sharp-wave ripples (SWRs) are critical events implicated in memory consolidation, planning, and the reactivation of recent experiences. Under freely moving conditions, a well-established dichotomy exists: hippocampal networks predominantly generate theta oscillations during periods of reward pursuit (preparatory behaviors) and exhibit pronounced SWR activity once the reward is achieved (consummatory behaviors). Here, we examined how SWRs are modulated by reward delivery and subtle movements in head-fixed rats. Contrary to the canonical view established in freely moving settings, we found that the dominant and more enduring effect was a sustained suppression of SWR activity immediately following water delivery. Moreover, even minor, localized movements (such as whisking or body adjustments) decreased SWR occurrence, demonstrating that hippocampal ripple generation is highly sensitive to motor engagement, irrespective of reward timing. Such movement-induced suppression of ripples persisted during both sleep-like states and quiet wakefulness, suggesting that while large-scale brain states modulate the overall likelihood of SWR generation, local motor-related influences exert a state-independent inhibitory effect on hippocampal ripples. Our results show that SWR modulation by behavioral states and body movements is more context-dependent than previously appreciated.

">Longitudinal assessment of DREADD expression and efficacy in the monkey brain</a></h4>

              
                Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs) offer a powerful means for reversible control of neuronal activity through systemic administration of inert actuators. Because chemogenetic control relies on DREADD expression levels, understanding and quantifying the temporal dynamics of their expression is crucial for planning long-term experiments in monkeys. In this study, we longitudinally quantified in vivo DREADD expression in macaque monkeys using positron emission tomography with the DREADD-selective tracer [11C]deschloroclozapine (DCZ), complemented by functional studies. Twenty macaque monkeys were evaluated after being injected with adeno-associated virus vectors expressing the DREADDs hM4Di or hM3Dq, whose expression was quantified as changes in [11C]DCZ binding potential from baseline levels. Expression levels of both hM4Di and hM3Dq peaked around 60 days post-injection, remained stable for about 1.5 years, and declined gradually after two years. Significant chemogenetic control of neural activity and behavior persisted for about two years. Virus titer and the presence of protein tags significantly influenced expression levels, with co-expressed protein tags reducing overall expression levels. These findings provide valuable insights and guidelines for optimizing the use of DREADDs in long-term primate studies and potential therapeutic applications.

	<p>Background/Objectives: Virtual reality (VR) is an innovative technology with the potential to transform digital experiences, particularly in relation to mental health concerns such as anxiety. Therefore, this study investigates the potential of a newly designed VR experience to alleviate anxiety by focusing on the mediating role of VR-induced immersion. Methods: The study included 419 individuals aged 10 to 80 years, with 29 aged 10&amp;amp;ndash;15 years and 390 above 15 years, who were randomly assigned to experimental and control groups on the basis of project-defined criteria, including a random allocation to the wheelchair-using group. Both groups used goggles for virtual space navigation, with the experimental group employing a multijoint arm mounted on an aluminum frame and special algorithms to navigate without controllers. We assessed immersion in VR using the Polish adaptation of the Immersion Questionnaire and anxiety using the Polish adaptations of the State&amp;amp;ndash;Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-X1) and its early adolescent version, the State&amp;amp;ndash;Trait Anxiety Inventory&amp;amp;ndash;Children (STAI-C1). Results and Conclusions: The results indicate that individuals using the new VR device demonstrated increased immersion and reduced post-test anxiety levels, highlighting the significance of immersion in enhancing positive affect, mitigating the negative effects of VR technology, and offering insights for future development and refinement of VR solutions.</p>

	<p>Introduction. In women, smoking during pregnancy and the postpartum period has important consequences for maternal and infant health, and interventions to assist smoking cessation during this period are essential. Although smoking has been associated with the presence of mental health problems, few studies addressing the factors associated with perinatal smoking have examined the role of stress. The aim of this review was to identify the relationships between the presence of stress and smoking during pregnancy and the postpartum period. Method. A literature search of the PsycInfo, Pubmed and Web of Science databases was carried out to identify relevant articles published between January 2013 and June 2024. A total of 15 studies that met the inclusion criteria were selected for review. Results. Twelve of the studies analysed the relationship between stress and smoking during pregnancy, two studies involved the postpartum period, and one study included both periods. Diverse instruments were used to assess stress, although the PSS-14 was the most commonly used. Eleven of the studies found a relationship between stress and smoking in the perinatal period, with stress being a predictor of smoking. Conclusions. The findings highlight the need to consider stress management when developing effective interventions to help women quit smoking during pregnancy and maintain abstinence in the postpartum period.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Previous research indicates that Ginkgo biloba extract (Gbe) may contribute to slowing down the progression of dementia. This retrospective cohort study analyzed the association between Gbe prescriptions and the progression of dementia severity in a real-world setting. Methods: This study was conducted using data from patients with an initial diagnosis of mild or moderate dementia between January 2005 and December 2022 from the IQVIA&amp;amp;trade; Disease Analyzer database. The follow-up period was up to 10 years. The association between Gbe prescription and dementia severity progression was assessed by Kaplan&amp;amp;ndash;Meier analysis and Cox regression, with adjustments made for age, sex, health insurance status, physician specialty, co-prescription of antidementia drugs, and co-diagnoses. Results: A total of 4765 patients were included, of whom 177 were prescribed Gbe. The cumulative incidence of dementia severity progression was 12.7% for patients with Gbe prescription and 22.1% for those without. Gbe prescription was associated with a significantly decreased risk of dementia severity progression (hazard ratio: 0.50; 95% CI: 0.27&amp;amp;ndash;0.95), both in patients with mild (HR: 0.44; 95% CI: 0.22&amp;amp;ndash;0.90) and moderate dementia (HR: 0.24; 95% CI: 0.06&amp;amp;ndash;0.98). Conclusions: This study provides evidence that Gbe prescription is associated with a reduced risk of dementia severity progression in a real-world setting.</p>

	<p>Purpose: Cognitive dysfunctions are still very common in the chronic phase of stroke when patients are discharged from neurorehabilitation centers. Even individuals who appear to have made a full clinical recovery may exhibit new deficiencies at home. Here, we present evidence of a novel kind of therapy at home aimed at contrasting the heterogenic evolution of stroke patients using a multidomain cognitive approach. Methods: Eighteen ischemic stroke patients were assessed in a within-subject longitudinal design (age 62.33 &amp;amp;plusmn; 11.1 years; eight men). Patients underwent the Tele-NeuroRehabilitation (TNR) multidomain cognitive training treatment using the Virtual Reality Rehabilitation System (VRRS) five times a week for 1 h sessions for four consecutive weeks. The protocol included the stimulation of specific cognitive functions, such as logical skills, praxis skills, attention, executive functions, memory, space time orientation and perception, and speech therapy. To determine neuropsychological changes, patients were evaluated before the sessions (T0), at the end of the sessions (T1), and after six months (T2). Results: The multidomain cognitive training induced a significant improvement in the working memory and language abilities as well as depression symptoms and alleviated caregiver burden. Most of this cognitive enhancement persisted after six months (T2), with the exception of depression symptoms. Otherwise, a significant decline in attention abilities was reported, thus demonstrating a lack of effect in this function. Conclusions: Our results suggest that multidomain cognitive TNR is a suitable protocol for reducing some cognitive and behavioral alterations in patients with strokes, with a beneficial impact also on the caregivers&amp;amp;rsquo; burden distress management. Further RCTs are warranted to validate this new kind of approach.</p>

	<p>Background: Cerebrovascular diseases (CVAs) have several risk factors that are categorized as modifiable and nonmodifiable. Periodontal diseases (PD) have a modifiable role in causing CVA, where several studies suggested direct or indirect correlations with systemic diseases. This study aims to summarize, evaluate and analyze all the evidence available in literature, to reach a better understanding of the relation between periodontitis, gingivitis, tooth loss and CVA. Methods: PubMed, Cochrane, Scopus and Web of Science databases were searched for all meta-analyses assessing the effect of PD on CVA in accordance with Joanna Briggs Institute guidance for umbrella reviews in March 2024. Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) was used for quality assessment. Pooled analysis was performed to assess the effect of periodontitis, gingivitis and tooth loss on CVA, depending on the availability of data using Review Manager Version 5.2.11. Results: Seven of the identified meta-analyses were of high quality, and they were distributed in different countries. Periodontitis was generally associated with a significant increase in CVA risk (OR = 2.32, 95% CI: 1.70, 3.17, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.00001 and RR = 1.22, 95% CI: 1.15&amp;amp;ndash;1.29, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.00001), same as tooth loss, but to a lower degree (0.78). However, the effect of gingivitis was insignificant in terms of CVA (RR = 1.32, 95% CI: 1.12&amp;amp;ndash;1.56, p = 0.0008). Conclusions: This study confirms the effect of periodontitis and tooth loss on CVA, disregarding any significant role for gingivitis. The relation reached favors the suggested role of some inflammatory changes in the pathogenic pathway leading to atherosclerotic changes.</p>

<p>In mouse permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion, remote ischemic conditioning (RIC) increased cerebral blood flow at peripheral area (dotted circle) and diminished early ischemic lesion in MRI DWI and final infarct volume in TTC staining compared with Sham procedure, However, hypothermia showed only marginal effect. RIC might be more promising strategy than hypothermia for brain protection against ischemic insult.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Remote ischemic conditioning (RIC) has attracted considerable attention as a brain protection strategy, although its impact remains unclear. Hypothermia is the most effective strategy in experimental transient cerebral ischemia. Therefore, we compared the efficacy of RIC, hypothermia, and no treatment on cerebral ischemia. We assessed the effects of both permanent and transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for 45 min in male mice. Brain hemodynamics were monitored during and after the procedure via 2D color-coded ultrasound imaging. Ischemic lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)–diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), early breakdown of microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2), expression levels of inflammatory cytokines by reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), and neurological signs and infarct volume were examined. In permanent MCAO, RIC increased cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the peri-infarct area, reduced early lesions on MRI–DWI, decreased early MAP2 breakdown, and lowered infarct volume compared with no treatment. However, hypothermia only showed a protective effect against neurological signs. In contrast, in transient MCAO, both RIC and hypothermia reduced the expression of inflammatory cytokines, mitigated MAP2 breakdown, and reduced infarct volume to a similar extent compared with no treatment. In conclusion, although RIC proved to be more effective than hypothermia in permanent MCAO, the protective effects of RIC and hypothermia were comparable in transient cerebral ischemia. Thus, RIC could be a promising strategy for brain protection against cerebral ischemia.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Remote identification of individuals with severe hyposmia may enable scalable recruitment of participants with underlying alpha-synuclein aggregation. We evaluated the performance of a staged screening paradigm using remote smell testing to enrich for abnormal dopamine transporter single-photon emission computed tomography imaging (DAT-SPECT) and alpha-synuclein aggregation.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) recruited participants for the prodromal cohort who were 60-years and older without a Parkinson's disease diagnosis. Participants were invited to complete a University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) independently through an online portal. Hyposmic participants were invited to complete DAT-SPECT, which determined eligibility for enrollment in longitudinal assessments and further biomarker evaluation including cerebrospinal fluid alpha-synuclein seed amplification assay (aSynSAA).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>As of January 29, 2024, 49,843 participants were sent an UPSIT and 31,293 (63%) completed it. Of UPSIT completers, 8,301 (27%) scored &lt;15th percentile. Of 1,546 who completed DAT-SPECT, 1,060 (69%) had DAT-SPECT binding &lt;100% expected for age and sex. Participants with an UPSIT &lt;10th percentile (n = 1,221) had greater likelihood of low DAT-SPECT binding compared to participants with an UPSIT in the 10th to 15th percentile (odds ratio, 3.01; 95% confidence interval, 1.85–4.91). Overall, 55% (198/363) of cases with UPSIT &lt;15th percentile and DAT-SPECT &lt;100% had positive aSynSAA, which increased to 70% (182/260) when selecting for more severe hyposmia (UPSIT &lt;10th percentile).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Remote screening for hyposmia and reduced DAT-SPECT binding identifies participants with a high proportion positive aSynSAA. Longitudinal data will be essential to define progression patterns in these individuals to ultimately inform recruitment into disease modification clinical trials. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>As requested by the editors of this special issue of Hippocampus on Scientific Histories of Hippocampal Research, this review provides a detailed personal perspective and historical background on the research involved in a number of findings. The review includes description of the development of the water maze and its use in providing evidence to support the role of the hippocampus in spatial memory function. The review also describes how the water maze was then used in further work to support the proposal that NMDA-dependent synaptic modification in the hippocampus mediates the encoding of new spatial memories. This personal history gives a perspective on the convergence of different streams of physiological, biochemical, theoretical and behavioral research that resulted in these findings on hippocampal function.</p>

">Contribution of glutamatergic projections to neurons in the nonhuman primate lateral substantia nigra pars reticulata for the reactive inhibition</a></h4>

              
                The basal ganglia play a crucial role in action selection by facilitating desired movements and suppressing unwanted ones. The substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr), a key output nucleus, facilitates movement through disinhibition of the superior colliculus (SC). However, its role in action suppression, particularly in primates, remains less clear. We investigated whether individual SNr neurons in three male macaque monkeys bidirectionally modulate their activity to both facilitate and suppress actions and examined the role of glutamatergic inputs in suppression. Monkeys performed a sequential choice task, selecting or rejecting visually presented targets. Electrophysiological recordings showed SNr neurons decreased firing rates during target selection and increased firing rates during rejection, demonstrating bidirectional modulation. Pharmacological blockade of glutamatergic inputs to the lateral SNr disrupted saccadic control and impaired suppression of reflexive saccades, providing causal evidence for the role of excitatory input in behavioral inhibition. These findings suggest that glutamatergic projections, most likely from the subthalamic nucleus, drive the increased SNr activity during action suppression. Our results highlight conserved basal ganglia mechanisms across species and offer insights into the neural substrates of action selection and suppression in primates, with implications for understanding disorders such as Parkinsons disease.

Significance StatementUnderstanding how the basal ganglia facilitate desired actions while suppressing unwanted ones is fundamental to neuroscience. This study shows that neurons in the primate substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) bidirectionally modulate activity to control action, decreasing firing rates to facilitate movements and increasing rates to suppress them. Importantly, we provide causal evidence that glutamatergic inputs to the lateral SNr mediate action suppression. These findings reveal a conserved mechanism of action control in primates and highlight the role of excitatory inputs in behavioral inhibition. This advances our understanding of basal ganglia function and has significant implications for treating movement disorders like Parkinsons disease.

">LPS-induced sepsis disrupts brain activity in a region- and vigilance-state specific manner</a></h4>

              
                Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) is a common complication of sepsis and the systemic inflammatory response syndrome that leads to lasting consequences in survivors. It manifests as early EEG changes, that are region-, time- and state-specific, possibly reflecting distinct mechanisms of injury.

Here, we investigated the effects of 5mg/kg lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on hippocampal and cortical sleep-wake states, oscillatory and non-oscillatory neuronal activity, as well as on within and between state dynamics using state-space analysis.

LPS induced rapid-onset severe temporal and spatial vigilance state fragmentation, which preceded all other spectral changes by [~]90 minutes. Thereafter, LPS led to specific destabilization and increased delta oscillatory activity in wakefulness, but not NREM sleep, although state transitions remained largely normal. Instead, reduced NREM delta power resulted from aperiodic spectrum changes. LPS specifically reduced higher frequency hippocampal gamma oscillations (60-80Hz peak) in wakefulness, but not cortical high gamma or lower frequency gamma oscillations.

These results suggest that disruption of sleep-wake patterns could serve as an early indicator of sepsis and associated encephalopathy, independent of spectral changes. Moreover, treatment aimed at stabilizing vigilance states in early stages of sepsis might prove to be a novel option preventing the development of further pathological neurophysiology, as well as limiting inflammation-related brain damage.

	<p>Background/Objectives: &amp;amp;alpha;-Synuclein (&amp;amp;alpha;-syn) protein is a major pathological agent of familial Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD), and its levels and aggregations determine neurotoxicity in PD pathogenesis. Although the pathophysiological functions of &amp;amp;alpha;-syn have been extensively studied, its biological functions remain elusive, and there are reports of wild-type (WT) &amp;amp;alpha;-syn and two missense mutations of &amp;amp;alpha;-syn (A30P and A53T) inducing protective neuritogenesis through neurite outgrowth. However, the function of another &amp;amp;alpha;-syn mutation, E46K, has not been fully elucidated. Thus, we compared the effect of E46K &amp;amp;alpha;-syn with other types to identify the mechanisms underlying neurite outgrowth. Methods: We transfected SK-N-SH cells with WT and mutant (A53T and E46K) &amp;amp;alpha;-syn to investigate the effects of their overexpression on neurite outgrowth. Then, we compared the differential effects of &amp;amp;alpha;-syn on neurite outgrowth using microscopic analysis, including confocal microscopy. We also analyzed the differential regulation of cell division control 42 effector protein 2 (Cdc42EP2) using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis. Finally, to confirm the implication of neurite outgrowth, we knocked down Cdc42EP2 using small interfering RNA. Results: Unlike WT and A53T &amp;amp;alpha;-syn, E46K &amp;amp;alpha;-syn failed to promote neurite outgrowth by not inducing Cdc42EP2 and subsequent &amp;amp;beta;III-tubulin expression. Cdc42EP2 knockdown impaired neurite outgrowth in WT and A53T &amp;amp;alpha;-syn transfectants. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that WT and mutant &amp;amp;alpha;-syn are linked to Cdc42EP2 production in neuritogenesis, implying &amp;amp;alpha;-syn involvement in the physiological function of axon growth and synapse formation. Thus, &amp;amp;alpha;-syn may be a potential therapeutic target for PD.</p>

	<p>Background: Motor imagery includes visual imagery and kinesthetic imagery, which are two strategies that exist for mental rotation and are currently widely studied. However, different mental rotation tests can lead to different strategic performances. There are also many research results where two different strategies appear simultaneously under the same task. Previous studies on the comparative brain mechanisms of kinesthetic imagery and visual imagery have not adopted consistent stimulus images or mature mental rotation paradigms, making it difficult to effectively compare these types of imagery. Methods: In this study, we utilized functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to investigate the brain activation of sixty-seven young right-handed participants with different strategy preferences during hand lateral judgment tasks (HLJT). Results: The results showed that the accuracy of the kinesthetic imagery group was significantly higher than that of the visual imagery group, and the reaction time of the kinesthetic imagery group was significantly shorter than that of the visual imagery group. The areas significantly activated in the kinesthetic imagery group were wider than those in the visual imagery group, including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (BA9, 46), premotor cortex (BA6), supplementary motor area (SMA), primary motor cortex (BA4), and parietal cortex (BA7, 40). It is worth noting that the activation levels in the frontal eye fields (BA8), primary somatosensory cortex (BA1, 2, 3), primary motor cortex (BA4), and parietal cortex (BA40) of the kinesthetic imagery group were significantly higher than those in the visual imagery group. Conclusion: Therefore, we speculate that kinesthetic imagery has more advantages than visual imagery in the mental rotation of egocentric transformations.</p>

	<p>Background: Prolonged confinement in enclosed environments has raised concerns about its effects on both physical and mental health. Although increased rates of depression or anxiety during COVID-19 lockdowns have been reported, the effects of short-term restrictions on social activities and physical on brain function and structure remain poorly known. Methods: This study explored longitudinal changes in brain gray matter volume (GMV) and functional connectivity (FC) immediately after and four months following a short-term lockdown in comparison to pre-lockdown conditions. MRI data were collected from 20 participants before the lockdown, from 29 participants (14 original, 15 new) two months post-lockdown, and from 27 out of the 29 participants four months post-lifting of the lockdown. Results: Results showed significant GMV reductions in the right gyrus rectus and cuneus post-lockdown, with further reductions observed four months after lifting the restrictions, affecting additional brain regions. Longitudinal FC trajectories revealed decreased connectivity between the default mode network (DMN) and sensorimotor/attention networks post-lockdown, and recovery after four months post-lifting of the lockdown. Conclusions: The observed plasticity in brain FC indicates substantial recovery potential with the potential long-term effect of structural changes. Our findings offer insights into the effects of isolation on the human brain, potentially informing rehabilitation mechanisms and interventions for individuals in similar conditions.</p>

                VAPB is an adaptor protein known for its role as an anchor for other proteins at the endoplasmic reticulum. A mutant form of VAPB has been linked to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and the underlying mechanisms resulting from this defect are studied by researchers in this area to uncover its implication in the disease. Here we have characterized six VAPB commercial antibodies for western blot, immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence using a standardized experimental protocol based on comparing read-outs in knockout cell lines and isogenic parental controls. These studies are part of a larger, collaborative initiative seeking to address antibody reproducibility issues by characterizing commercially available antibodies for human proteins and publishing the results openly as a resource for the scientific community. While use of antibodies and protocols vary between laboratories, we encourage readers to use this report as a guide to select the most appropriate antibodies for their specific needs.

                The past decade has been marked by increased discussions on sustainability; some of the prominent accelerators being, mounting natural disasters, vocal climate activism, and the UN Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development. The interest has crossed over from deliberations in global summits to grassroots-level communication. Additionally, the literature points to the increasing usage of social media in the communication of sustainability with an increase of interest in this area among Asian researchers. This paper aims to understand the direction of sustainability communication and the usage of social media in the communication of sustainability, in the last decade (2013-2023), from an Asian perspective – researchers and respondents from Asia. A comprehensive search of the literature by Asian researchers on sustainability communication on social media in the past decade was conducted using the Scopus database. The studies were clustered around common directions and terminologies, basis an in-depth content analysis. Based on the analysis, the study presents prominent themes and the current direction of research in sustainability communication on social media. The studies analyzed in the scoping review affirm that sustainability communication on social media in Asia has substantial potential to improve the environmental awareness of the public and promote actual pro-environmental behavior both in terms of green purchase as well as conservation behavior. The review provides a holistic view of the recent trends and possible future directions for sustainability communication on social media.

                Background Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) in the head and neck pose a challenge in their management due to their local aggressiveness and high recurrence risk. This study aimed to analyze literature on head and neck AVM recurrence post-treatment and identify the most effective strategy with a lower recurrence rate. Objectives To analyse existing literature on the recurrence of head and neck AVMs following treatment. Our goal was to identify the most effective treatment option with a lower recurrence rate. Methods We conducted a thorough literature search using PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Scopus, from year 2000 to the present. Our analysis focused on key endpoints, specifically the recurrence rates of head and neck AVMs following various treatment approaches. Results Out of the initial pool of 108 screened articles, a total of 83 patients were deemed suitable for inclusion in the literature review. The reviewed articles demonstrated that appropriate diagnostic tests were documented in 95% of the included studies. Among the patients, 37.3% had previously undergone interventions and were currently dealing with regrowth masses. Notably, 55.4% of patients underwent a combined approach involving both endovascular and surgical methods, while 25.3% opted for a surgical-only approach, and only 19.3% pursued an endovascular-only approach. The studies showed a promising curing rate of AVMs, with a success rate of 94%, albeit with a complication rate of 32.5%. The average follow-up duration for all patients was 26 months, with a standard deviation of 20.5 months. Out of the 83 patients, 5 experienced recurrence, with single-modality approach. Interestingly, no patients who received a multi-modality of treatments experienced recurrence or regrowth of the AVM mass within the follow up period. Conclusion The multi-modality approach outperformed single-modality treatments in preventing AVM recurrence. These findings highlight the importance of a comprehensive and multidisciplinary approach in the management of these complex vascular anomalies.

                Background Death due to hanging is commonly seen. Sometime the ligature mark will be very prominent and in some cases it might not. In those cases, the post-mortem examination with its gross morphological findings and histopathological analysis, becomes significantly important. Objective: The objective of this study was to identify the patterns of epidemiological, gross morphological, and histopathological features in hanging cases. Methods The study was conducted on 46 cases of hanging. Their sociodemographic features were collected. Gross morphological analysis of the ligature mark and various measurements were taken. Later tissue from the ligature mark was sent for histopathological analysis. Statistical analysis was performed on the collected parameters. Results Significant male preponderance was observed in hanging cases. The maximum number of cases of hanging were observed in the fourth decade of life. Daily wage workers were the most significantly affected population. Depression was cited as the cause of suicide in most cases. Carotid intimal tears and injuries to bony and cartilaginous structures were present in smaller numbers. Vital reaction was observed in all 46 cases. Classification of fwound vitality showed a correlation to known time since injury. Conclusion The results of the present study showed that socio-demographic factors play a significant role in the circumstances leading to suicidal deaths. Therefore, in reducing the burden of suicidal deaths, these factors must be addressed. To identify the cause of death as hanging analysis of various gross features and histopathology are very important and should be conducted carefully.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96312">A multisite validation of brain white matter pathways of resilience to chronic back pain</a></h4>

              
                Chronic back pain (CBP) is a global health concern with significant societal and economic burden. While various predictors of back pain chronicity have been proposed, including demographic and psychosocial factors, neuroimaging studies have pointed to brain characteristics as predictors of CBP. However, large-scale, multisite validation of these predictors is currently lacking. In two independent longitudinal studies, we examined white matter diffusion imaging data and pain characteristics in patients with subacute back pain (SBP) over 6- and 12-month periods. Diffusion data from individuals with CBP and healthy controls (HC) were analyzed for comparison. Whole-brain tract-based spatial statistics analyses revealed that a cluster in the right superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) tract had larger fractional anisotropy (FA) values in patients who recovered (SBPr) compared to those with persistent pain (SBPp), and predicted changes in pain severity. The SLF FA values accurately classified patients at baseline and follow-up in a third publicly available dataset (Area under the Receiver Operating Curve ~0.70). Notably, patients who recovered had FA values larger than those of HC suggesting a potential role of SLF integrity in resilience to CBP. Structural connectivity-based models also classified SBPp and SBPr patients from the three data sets (validation accuracy 67%). Our results validate the right SLF <i>as a robust predictor of CBP development, with potential for clinical translation</i>. Cognitive and behavioral processes dependent on the right SLF, such as proprioception and visuospatial attention, should be analyzed in subacute stages as they could prove important for back pain chronicity.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99833">Accurate predictions of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity from comprehensive analysis</a></h4>

              
                An unprecedented amount of SARS-CoV-2 data has been accumulated compared with previous infectious diseases, enabling insights into its evolutionary process and more thorough analyses. This study investigates SARS-CoV-2 features as it evolved to evaluate its infectivity. We examined viral sequences and identified the polarity of amino acids in the receptor binding motif (RBM) region. We detected an increased frequency of amino acid substitutions to lysine (K) and arginine (R) in variants of concern (VOCs). As the virus evolved to Omicron, commonly occurring mutations became fixed components of the new viral sequence. Furthermore, at specific positions of VOCs, only one type of amino acid substitution and a notable absence of mutations at D467 were detected. We found that the binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2 lineages to the ACE2 receptor was impacted by amino acid substitutions. Based on our discoveries, we developed APESS, an evaluation model evaluating infectivity from biochemical and mutational properties. In silico evaluation using real-world sequences and in vitro viral entry assays validated the accuracy of APESS and our discoveries. Using Machine Learning, we predicted mutations that had the potential to become more prominent. We created AIVE, a web-based system, accessible at <a href="https://ai-ve.org">https://ai-ve.org</a> to provide infectivity measurements of mutations entered by users. Ultimately, we established a clear link between specific viral properties and increased infectivity, enhancing our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 and enabling more accurate predictions of the virus.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96344">The satiety hormone cholecystokinin gates reproduction in fish by controlling gonadotropin secretion</a></h4>

              
                Life histories of oviparous species dictate high metabolic investment in the process of gonadal development leading to ovulation. In vertebrates, these two distinct processes are controlled by the gonadotropins follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), respectively. While it was suggested that a common secretagogue, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), oversees both functions, the generation of loss-of-function fish challenged this view. Here, we reveal that the satiety hormone cholecystokinin (CCK) is the primary regulator of this axis in zebrafish. We found that FSH cells express a CCK receptor, and our findings demonstrate that mutating this receptor results in a severe hindrance to ovarian development. Additionally, it causes a complete shutdown of both gonadotropins secretion. Using in-vivo and ex-vivo calcium imaging of gonadotrophs, we show that GnRH predominantly activates LH cells, whereas FSH cells respond to CCK stimulation, designating CCK as the bona fide FSH secretagogue. These findings indicate that the control of gametogenesis in fish was placed under different neural circuits, that are gated by CCK.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89638">Improving PD-1 blockade plus chemotherapy for complete remission of lung cancer by nanoPDLIM2</a></h4>

              
                Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and their combination with other therapies such as chemotherapy, fail in most cancer patients. We previously identified the PDZ-LIM domain-containing protein 2 (PDLIM2) as a bona fide tumor suppressor that is repressed in lung cancer to drive cancer and its chemo and immunotherapy resistance, suggesting a new target for lung cancer therapy improvement. In this study, human clinical samples and data were used to investigate <i>PDLIM2</i> genetic and epigenetic changes in lung cancer. Using an endogenous mouse lung cancer model faithfully recapitulating refractory human lung cancer and a clinically feasible nano-delivery system, we investigated the therapeutic efficacy, action mechanism, and safety of systemically administrated PDLIM2 expression plasmids encapsulated in nanoparticles (nanoPDLIM2) and its combination with PD-1 antibody and chemotherapeutic drugs. Our analysis indicate that PDLIM2 repression in human lung cancer involves both genetic deletion and epigenetic alteration. NanoPDLIM2 showed low toxicity, high tumor specificity, antitumor activity, and greatly improved the efficacy of anti-PD-1 and chemotherapeutic drugs, with complete tumor remission in most mice and substantial tumor reduction in the remaining mice by their triple combination. Mechanistically, nanoPDLIM2 increased major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) expression, suppressed multi-drug resistance 1 (MDR1) induction and survival genes and other tumor-related genes expression in tumor cells, and enhanced lymphocyte tumor infiltration, turning the cold tumors hot and sensitive to ICIs and rendering them vulnerable to chemotherapeutic drugs and activated tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) including those unleashed by ICIs. These studies established a clinically applicable PDLIM2-based combination therapy with great efficacy for lung cancer and possibly other cold cancers.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101248">Gasdermin D-mediated neutrophil pyroptosis drives inflammation in psoriasis</a></h4>

              
                Psoriasis is a multifactorial immune-mediated inflammatory disease. Its pathogenesis involves abnormal accumulation of neutrophils and T-cell-related abnormalities. Pyroptosis is a type of regulated cell death associated with innate immunity, but its role in psoriasis is unclear. In this study, we found that <i>gasdermin D (GSDMD</i>) is higher in human psoriatic skin than that in normal skin, and in imiquimod-induced psoriasis-like mouse skin, the expression of <i>Gsdmd</i> was most significantly altered in neutrophils and <i>Il1b</i> was also mainly expressed in neutrophils. Immunohistochemical staining of serial sections of skin lesions from psoriasis patients and healthy control also showed that GSDMD expression is higher in psoriasis lesion, especially in neutrophils. <i>Gsdmd</i> deficiency mitigates psoriasis-like inflammation in mice. GSDMD in neutrophils contributes to psoriasis-like inflammation, while <i>Gsdmd</i> depletion in neutrophils attenuates the development of skin inflammation in psoriasis and reduces the release of the inflammatory cytokines. We found that neutrophil pyroptosis is involved in and contributes to psoriasis inflammation, which provides new insights into the treatment of psoriasis by targeting neutrophil pyroptosis.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93749">Bridging the gap between presynaptic hair cell function and neural sound encoding</a></h4>

              
                Neural diversity can expand the encoding capacity of a circuitry. A striking example of diverse structure and function is presented by the afferent synapses between inner hair cells (IHCs) and spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) in the cochlea. Presynaptic active zones at the pillar IHC side activate at lower IHC potentials than those of the modiolar side that have more presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels. The postsynaptic SGNs differ in their spontaneous firing rates, sound thresholds, and operating ranges. While a causal relationship between synaptic heterogeneity and neural response diversity seems likely, experimental evidence linking synaptic and SGN physiology has remained difficult to obtain. Here, we aimed at bridging this gap by ex vivo paired recordings of murine IHCs and postsynaptic SGN boutons with stimuli and conditions aimed to mimic those of in vivo SGN characterization. Synapses with high spontaneous rate of release (<i>SR</i>) were found predominantly on the pillar side of the IHC. These high <i>SR</i> synapses had larger and more temporally compact spontaneous EPSCs, lower voltage thresholds, tighter coupling of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and vesicular release sites, shorter response latencies, and higher initial release rates. This study indicates that synaptic heterogeneity in IHCs directly contributes to the diversity of spontaneous and sound-evoked firing of SGNs.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100205">Constitutively active receptor ADGRA3 signaling induces adipose thermogenesis</a></h4>

              
                The induction of adipose thermogenesis plays a critical role in maintaining body temperature and improving metabolic homeostasis to combat obesity. β3-adrenoceptor (β3-AR) is widely recognized as a canonical β-adrenergic G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that plays a crucial role in mediating adipose thermogenesis in mice. Nonetheless, the limited expression of β3-AR in human adipocytes restricts its clinical application. The objective of this study was to identify a GPCR that is highly expressed in human adipocytes and to explore its potential involvement in adipose thermogenesis. Our research findings have demonstrated that the adhesion G-protein-coupled receptor A3 (ADGRA3), an orphan GPCR, plays a significant role in adipose thermogenesis through its constitutively active effects. ADGRA3 exhibited high expression levels in human adipocytes and mouse brown fat. Furthermore, the knockdown of <i>Adgra3</i> resulted in an exacerbated obese phenotype and a reduction in the expression of thermogenic markers in mice. Conversely, <i>Adgra3</i> overexpression activated the adipose thermogenic program and improved metabolic homeostasis in mice without exogenous ligand. We found that ADGRA3 facilitates the biogenesis of beige human or mouse adipocytes in vitro. Moreover, hesperetin was identified as a potential agonist of ADGRA3, capable of inducing adipocyte browning and ameliorating insulin resistance in mice. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that the overexpression of constitutively active ADGRA3 or the activation of ADGRA3 by hesperetin can induce adipocyte browning by Gs-PKA-CREB axis. These findings indicate that the utilization of hesperetin and the selective overexpression of ADGRA3 in adipose tissue could serve as promising therapeutic strategies in the fight against obesity.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93646">CaBP1 and 2 enable sustained CaV1.3 calcium currents and synaptic transmission in inner hair cells</a></h4>

              
                To encode continuous sound stimuli, the inner hair cell (IHC) ribbon synapses utilize calcium-binding proteins (CaBPs), which reduce the inactivation of their Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 calcium channels. Mutations in the <i>CABP2</i> gene underlie non-syndromic autosomal recessive hearing loss DFNB93. Besides CaBP2, the structurally related CaBP1 is highly abundant in the IHCs. Here, we investigated how the two CaBPs cooperatively regulate IHC synaptic function. In <i>Cabp1/2</i> double-knockout mice, we find strongly enhanced Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 inactivation, slowed recovery from inactivation and impaired sustained exocytosis. Already mild IHC activation further reduces the availability of channels to trigger synaptic transmission and may effectively silence synapses. Spontaneous and sound-evoked responses of spiral ganglion neurons in vivo are strikingly reduced and strongly depend on stimulation rates. Transgenic expression of CaBP2 leads to substantial recovery of IHC synaptic function and hearing sensitivity. We conclude that CaBP1 and 2 act together to suppress voltage- and calcium-dependent inactivation of IHC Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels in order to support sufficient rate of exocytosis and enable fast, temporally precise and indefatigable sound encoding.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Neural oscillations are fundamental for brain function and govern various cognitive processes. Recent functional magnetic resonance imaging advances offer the opportunity to study frequency-specific properties of blood-oxygen-level-dependent oscillations at multiple frequency bands. However, most have focused on spontaneous brain activity in the resting state, leaving a gap in direct evidence regarding the specific activations of cognitive tasks across different frequency bands. We aim to address this gap by exploring the role of blood-oxygen-level-dependent oscillations across multiple frequency bands in cognitive processes. We used task-functional magnetic resonance imaging data of 339 healthy young adults from the Human Connectome Project to map the activation patterns of performing seven cognitive tasks at multiple frequency bands (ie slow-1 to slow-6). Our findings revealed that different frequency bands are associated with distinct task-activation patterns. Specifically, slow-1/2/3 oscillations primarily contribute to local sensory information processing, while slow-4 is crucial for various fundamental cognitive functions. Slow-5 is involved in cognitive processes that require greater memory load, integrated cognitive processing, and attention maintenance. This underscores the importance of analyzing a broad frequency range to capture the full spectrum of cognitive function, highlighting the diverse roles of different frequency bands in brain activity, shedding light on the underlying mechanism of brain–behavior associations.</span>

Dev Cogn Neurosci. 2024;66:101347. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dcn.2024.101347">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dcn.2024.101347</a>) in which participants implicitly learned Icelandic morphosyntactic rules and performed a grammaticality judgment task in the scanner. Behaviorally, Menks et al. (2024) showed that grammaticality judgment task performance increased steadily from 8 to 15.4 yr, after which age had no further effect. We show in the current study that this age-related grammaticality judgment task performance was negatively related to cortical gray matter volume and cortical thickness in many clusters throughout the brain. Hippocampal volume was positively related to age-related grammaticality judgment task performance and L2 (English) vocabulary knowledge. Furthermore, we found that grammaticality judgment task performance, L2 grammar proficiency, and L2 vocabulary knowledge were positively related to gray matter maturation within parietal regions, overlapping with the functional MRI clusters that were reported previously in Menks et al. (2024) and which showed increased brain activation in relation to grammar learning. We propose that this overlap in functional and structural results indicates that brain maturation in parietal regions plays an important role in second language learning.</span>

We used functional magnetic resonance-based multivariate pattern analysis to identify such regions. Human participants (20 females, 12 males) watched videos of successful and failed attempts of actions with different goals involving two different object types. We found that the bilateral anterior inferior parietal lobe and the right ventral premotor cortex distinguished between object-specific action goals regardless of outcomes. The left anterior inferior parietal lobe encodes action goals regardless of both outcomes and object types.

	<p>Background/Objectives: Attention is a complex process involving various components such as alerting, orienting, and resolving conflicts. These components have been widely examined using the Attention Network Test (ANT), which has also been used to explore attentional decline associated with aging. However, discrepancies exist in the literature regarding which specific aspects of attention are most impacted by aging. These inconsistencies could be due to methodological issues such as group comparisons that may exaggerate differences between groups while flattening subtle variations within groups. Methods: To address this issue, we administered the ANT to 60 healthy participants aged between 62 and 90 years. Using a multivariate regression analysis, we examined whether increasing age was associated with changes in alerting, orienting, and conflict resolution, while controlling for overall performance in terms of both reaction times and accuracy. Results: The results showed a general and age-insensitive decline in two of the three attentional components: the alerting effect, which was abolished, and a large conflict effect, which was present regardless of age. In contrast, the orienting of spatial attention was found to linearly increase with increasing age. More focused analyses revealed that the ability to shift attention from the central (initial) to the peripheral (target) location slowed down as a function of age. Conclusions: These results suggest that aging is associated with a greater difficulty in disengaging endogenous attention from the central, uninformative cue to direct attention on task-relevant peripheral targets.</p>

	<p>Background: Anterior choroidal artery (AChoA) aneurysms pose a challenge for both endovascular and clipping procedures. The eloquent territory supplied by the parent vessel has limited collateralization and its compromise can lead to significant morbidity. This study aims to analyze the clinical outcomes and procedure-related complications of clipping and endovascular treatment of AChoA aneurysms to aid physician decision making. Methods: Thirty-two ruptured and unruptured AChoA aneurysms that underwent catheter angiography at a single neurovascular center between January 2000 and December 2023 were included. Either conservative management, clipping, and/or endovascular treatment were performed. Clinical outcomes and complications were analyzed retrospectively. Results: Twenty-four endovascular treatments and seven clipping procedures were included. Of the total 24 endovascular procedures, 46% were primary coiling, 25% were balloon-assisted coiling, 13% were flow diverting stent, 8% were combined balloon-assisted coiling and flow diverting stent, and 8% were combined balloon-assisted and stent-assisted coiling. There was no procedure-related mortality in both groups. No intra- or post-procedural ruptures/re-ruptures occurred during follow-up in both endovascular and clipping cohorts. AChoA territory infarcts occurred in 4% of the endovascular and 29% of the clipping cohorts. Other thromboembolic complications occurred in 4% of the endovascular cohort. The recurrence rate requiring retreatment was 12.5% for the endovascular and 43% for the clipping cohort. A favorable clinical outcome (mRS &amp;amp;le; 2) was 78% for the endovascular cohort and 67% for the clipping cohort. Conclusions: Endovascular and clipping outcomes align with prior studies, with endovascular showing a favorable safety profile. Both approaches are viable, though they present distinct risks and advantages.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: This research investigates brain connectivity patterns in reaction to social and non-social stimuli within a virtual reality environment, emphasizing their impact on cognitive functions, specifically working memory. Methods: Employing the LEiDA framework with EEG data from 47 participants, I examined dynamic brain network states elicited by social avatars compared to non-social stick cues during a VR memory task. Through the integration of LEiDA with deep learning and graph theory analyses, unique connectivity patterns associated with cue type were discerned, underscoring the substantial influence of social cues on cognitive processes. LEiDA, conventionally utilized with fMRI, was creatively employed in EEG to detect swift alterations in brain network states, offering insights into cognitive processing dynamics. Results: The findings indicate distinct neural states for social and non-social cues; notably, social cues correlated with a unique brain state characterized by increased connectivity within self-referential and memory-processing networks, implying greater cognitive engagement. Moreover, deep learning attained approximately 99% accuracy in differentiating cue contexts, highlighting the efficacy of prominent eigenvectors from LEiDA in EEG analysis. Analysis of graph theory also uncovered structural network disparities, signifying enhanced integration in contexts involving social cues. Conclusions: This multi-method approach elucidates the dynamic influence of social cues on brain connectivity and cognition, establishing a basis for VR-based cognitive rehabilitation and immersive learning, wherein social signals may significantly enhance cognitive function.</p>

	<p>Background: The human sensorimotor system can naturally synchronize with environmental rhythms, such as light pulses or sound beats. Several studies showed that different styles and tempos of music, or other rhythmic stimuli, have an impact on physiological rhythms, including electrocortical brain activity, heart rate, and motor coordination. Such synchronization, also known as the &amp;amp;ldquo;entrainment effect&amp;amp;rdquo;, has been identified as a crucial mechanism impacting cognitive, motor, and affective functioning. Objectives: This review examines theoretical and empirical contributions to the literature on entrainment, with a particular focus on the physiological mechanisms underlying this phenomenon and its role in cognitive, motor, and affective functions. We also address the inconsistent terminology used in the literature and evaluate the range of measurement approaches used to assess entrainment phenomena. Finally, we propose a definition of &amp;amp;ldquo;physiological entrainment&amp;amp;rdquo; that emphasizes its role as a fundamental mechanism that encompasses rhythmic interactions between the body and its environment, to support information processing across bodily systems and to sustain adaptive motor responses. Methods: We reviewed the recent literature through the lens of the &amp;amp;ldquo;embodied cognition&amp;amp;rdquo; framework, offering a unified perspective on the phenomenon of physiological entrainment. Results: Evidence from the current literature suggests that physiological entrainment produces measurable effects, especially on neural oscillations, heart rate variability, and motor synchronization. Eventually, such physiological changes can impact cognitive processing, affective functioning, and motor coordination. Conclusions: Physiological entrainment emerges as a fundamental mechanism underlying the mind&amp;amp;ndash;body connection. Entrainment-based interventions may be used to promote well-being by enhancing cognitive, motor, and affective functions, suggesting potential rehabilitative approaches to enhancing mental health.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Cognitive functions are a crucial part of daily living, especially for adults with Down syndrome (DS) who have a high likelihood of developing Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease in adulthood. In addition, adults with DS move slower and are not meeting the standard aerobic activity guidelines each week. The aim of this study was to examine if Assisted Cycle Therapy (ACT) would improve cognitive planning as measured by the Tower of London (TOL), set switching as measured by the modified Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, and spatial memory as measured by the Corsi Block Test in adults with DS as compared to self-paced cycling. Methods: Twenty-four participants were randomly assigned to one of two interventions over eight weeks. (1) Thirteen older adults with DS completed the ACT intervention, which is stationary cycling with the assistance of a motor to maintain a cadence at least 35% greater than voluntary cycling. (2) Eleven older adults with DS completed voluntary cycling (VC). Results: Our results showed that cognitive planning as measured by total correct score in the TOL showed improvement for both ACT and VC after 8 weeks of exercise, F(1, 22) = 6.22, p = 0.021. There were no significant differences for spatial memory or set switching. Conclusions: We concluded that cycling exercise has a positive impact on cognitive function, especially problem solving in older adults with DS. Our results are discussed with respect to upregulation of neurotrophic factors that increase functioning in the prefrontal cortex that accompanies exercise and leads to improvements in cognitive planning which is essential to many activities of daily living and quality of life for older adults with DS.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: The auditory middle-latency responses (AMLRs) assess central sensory processing beyond the brainstem and serve as a measure of sensory gating. They have clinical relevance in the diagnosis of neurological conditions. In this study, magnitude and habituation of the AMLRs were tested for sensitivity and specificity in classifying dizzy patients with vestibular migraine (VM) and post-concussive syndrome. Methods: Twenty-three healthy individuals, 12 concussion and 26 VM patients were recruited. AMLR were recorded performing five blocks of 200 binaural click-stimulations at 60 dB sensation level with a repetition rate of 6.1 Hz. Reduction in P0, Na and Pa magnitudes between blocks was measured. Group classifications were performed through logistic and multiple regression. Results: Among healthy subjects, a consistent P0 and Na habituation can be observed. Concussed subjects show control-like Na habituation, despite a lower magnitude, while P0 habituation was negligible. VM patients showed poor habituation for all waves. Regression analyses suggest that P0 and Na better distinguish healthy subjects from neurological patients, whereas Pa best distinguishes concussion from VM patients. Conclusions: The results support that AMLR habituation can contribute to unraveling different mechanisms of dizziness due to concussion compared to VM, providing insights that can complement routine diagnostic assessments.</p>

                Background The approach to estimating mandibular age has been widely used, although it has shown age estimation disparities in diverse populations, including Indians. Objective Our goal was to test the Demirjian 8-teeth approach utilizing orthopantomogram to estimate age reliably after incorporating the third molar. We also used Chaillet and Demirjian’s regression equations to estimate age estimation accuracy in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia. Methods The retrospective study included 196 people. Individuals were 8–24 years old. The left mandibular teeth were staged using an orthopantomographs utilizing the Demirjian 8-teeth approach. The Chaillet and Demirjian’s regression models determined dental age, and statistical methods compared dental age to chronological age. Results The gender breakdown was 49.5% male and 50.5% female. Gender did not significantly affect chronological mean age or estimated mean age (13.39±3.77 vs. 13.10±3.51, p = 0.583; 11.75±2.92 vs. 11.58±2.70, p = 0.674). Statistically substantial differences in chronological and estimated mean ages between male and female individuals (p<0.001). Out of the total participants, 31.6% had a difference in age of ±1 year, 30.6% had a difference of 1-2 years, and 37.8% had a difference of more than 2 years. Compared to chronological and estimated ages, these variations in age between males and females were not statistically significant (p=0.557). Conclusions The findings of this study support the use of Demirjian’s 8-teeth approach in the Saudi population residing in the Eastern Province of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, employing Chaillet and Demirjian’s regression equations.

                Abstract Introduction Preoperative carbohydrate loading (PCL), part of Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) protocols, involves giving carbohydrate-rich liquids before surgery instead of traditional fasting. It improves glucose control, reduces insulin resistance, and enhances patient comfort. Methods A comprehensive scoping review was conducted using databases such as PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Scopus, and Web of Science, focusing on studies from 2017 to 2024. Primary, English-language clinical trial involving pediatric patients were included without restrictions on surgical procedure, or outcomes. Data extraction was focused on sample sizes, PCL types, and perioperative outcomes. Results The scoping review examined 11 studies on PCL in pediatric surgery, covering various procedures with sample sizes ranging from 18 to 1200 participants. Most studies indicated metabolic benefits, with 7 out of 11 showing stabilized blood glucose and reduced hypoglycemia risk. Additionally, 5 studies associated PCL with reduced preoperative anxiety, agitation, and discomfort, including thirst and hunger. For stomach content, 5 studies showed PCL reduced gastric residual volume and improved pH. Postoperative findings were mixed: 4 studies found no significant difference in nausea and vomiting, while 2 suggested benefits. Length of hospital stay from 3 studies showed no clinical difference results. Conclusions PCL in pediatric surgery shows potential to stabilize blood glucose, reduce metabolic risks, and improve recovery. However, the evidence regarding outcomes such as length of hospital stay and postoperative complications remains inconsistent, indicating the need for further investigation.

                Background Indonesia currently could not make it to the top ten global halal due to some external and internal factors, although it is the largest Muslim country. In the external sector, the competition map is getting tougher, while internally, there are handicaps in the form of weak public awareness of competition. As a country with the largest Muslim population in the world, Indonesia can become one of the largest markets in the world. As indicated in the Global Islamic Economic Report (GIER), Indonesia is one of the top ten countries that control the Islamic economic market, yet it fails to dominate its Islamic market. Accordingly, the government needs to play a stronger role through regulatory policies to encourage the development of the Islamic economic ecosystem in Indonesia (halal value chain). The purpose of this study is to find out and analyse the existence of Micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in Indonesia in the world’s market for Halal products and Services. Methods The researchers have conducted a form of normative juridical research with the analytical descriptive method, namely by collecting, describing, analysing, and presenting what is (das sein) and what ought to be (das sollen). Results Support from the government and stakeholders has not been optimal in improving welfare - capital access, management, and halal certification, so the existence of the global halal ecosystem has not yet impacted MSMEs’ ability to compete competitively. Conclusions The conclusion of this study shows that the quadruple helix innovation system is capable of guaranteeing the development of MSMEs in a manner to achieves a high level of competitiveness - efficiency, and effectiveness of the products and services produced.

                Objectives To investigate the impact of electroacupuncture on cognitive function, quality of life (QoL), and depression severity in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). Methods This double-blinded randomized controlled trial included 60 participants aged 18-55 with cognitive symptoms related to MDD at Thammasat University Hospital. Participants were divided into two groups: the electroacupuncture group combined with standard antidepressant treatment (EG; n=30) and the control group receiving standard care with placebo acupuncture (CG; n=30). The study assessed 1) executive functions using the Trail making test- B and Stroop Color and Word Test, 2) delayed recall, and 3) subjective cognitive complaint and Quality of life (QoL) using WHODAS 2.0. Depressive symptoms were measured using the Thai version of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Baseline and post-intervention assessments were conducted over 10 weeks. Mann-Whitney U test analyzed treatment effects by comparing median differences between groups. Results Both groups exhibited similar demographics and cognitive traits. Cognitive improvement was observed in both groups at the endpoint. Intention-to-treat analysis revealed significantly higher median scores for subjective cognitive complaints in the EG compared to the CG (EG: Median = 5.5, CG: Median = 0.0, p=0.049). No serious side effects were identified from either electroacupuncture or placebo acupuncture. Conclusions Electroacupuncture improved subjective complaints in MDD patients with cognitive symptoms, but did not show effects on specific cognitive functions, QoL, or depressive symptoms. This study provides initial evidence supporting the potential of electroacupuncture in MDD patients with cognitive symptoms, suggesting opportunities for further research.

                Background Cesarean section is the most common obstetric procedure performed. This can lead to maternal anxiety, which is a significant contributor to postpartum depression. This can adversely affect pregnant women both mentally and emotionally, negatively impacting their well-being and family bonding. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the addition of an informative cesarean section operative steps video on the maternal anxiety score compared with standard pre-cesarean section care. Methods This randomized controlled trial was conducted at Thammasat University Hospital, Thailand, between April and September 2023. Pregnant women who underwent their first cesarean section were allocated to two groups: intervention and control groups. Participants in the intervention group were required to watch a 5-minute informative video that elaborately described the process from pre-operative steps until post-operative care on the day scheduled for cesarean delivery. All participants received the same routine pre-operative and post-operative care. The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) was used to measure both populations on two occasions: the day of scheduled cesarean delivery and postpartum day 1. Results A total of 178 women were recruited. The demographic and obstetric characteristics were similar between the two groups. The pre-operative STAI scores of the intervention and control groups were 42.9 and 44.1 points, respectively, with no significant difference. However, the post-operative anxiety score showed a significant decline in the intervention group compared to that in the control group (p = 0.002). Moreover, most of the participants in the intervention group showed a low level of anxiety after the operation, while half of the control group remained at a moderate to high level score. Conclusions The provision of an informative educational video before cesarean delivery is a powerful tool that significantly reduces cesarean operative anxiety and improves health outcomes.

                Preterm birth is a major cause of perinatal complications and neonatal deaths. Furthermore, in the field of obstetrics many clinical entities like uterine contractions or the occurrence of pre- eclampsia remain to be serious complications during pregnancy and represent a major psychological, financial, and economic burden for society. Several published guidelines, studies and recommendations have highlighted the importance of supplementation of omega-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) during pregnancy. This narrative review aims at giving an overview on the modern perception of inflammatory processes and the role of specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) in their resolution, especially in obstetrics. Additionally, we highlight the possible role of SPMs in the prevention of obstetric complications through oral supplementation using enriched marine oil nutritional’s. The intake of PUFAs may result in an overall improvement of pregnancy outcomes by contributing to fetal brain growth and neurological development but more importantly though modulation of inflammation-associated pathologies. Especially the use of SPMs represents a promising approach for the management of obstetric and perinatal complications. SPMs are monohydroxylates derived from enriched marine oil nutritional’s that involve certain pro-resolutive metabolites of omega-3 long chains PUFAs and may contribute to an attenuation of inflammatory diseases. This may be obtained through various mechanisms necessary for a proper resolution of inflammation such as the termination of neutrophil tissue infiltration, initiation of phagocytosis, downregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines or tissue regeneration. In this way, acute and chronic inflammatory diseases associated with serious obstetrical complications can be modulated, which might contribute to an improved pregnancy outcome.

                <p>by Hyeontae Jo, Sung Woong Cho, Hyung Ju Hwang</p>

Differential equations are pivotal in modeling and understanding the dynamics of various systems, as they offer insights into their future states through parameter estimation fitted to time series data. In fields such as economy, politics, and biology, the observation data points in the time series are often independently obtained (i.e., Repeated Cross-Sectional (RCS) data). RCS data showed that traditional methods for parameter estimation in differential equations, such as using mean values of RCS data over time, Gaussian Process-based trajectory generation, and Bayesian-based methods, have limitations in estimating the shape of parameter distributions, leading to a significant loss of data information. To address this issue, this study proposes a novel method called Estimation of Parameter Distribution (EPD) that provides accurate distribution of parameters without loss of data information. EPD operates in three main steps: generating synthetic time trajectories by randomly selecting observed values at each time point, estimating parameters of a differential equation that minimizes the discrepancy between these trajectories and the true solution of the equation, and selecting the parameters depending on the scale of discrepancy. We then evaluated the performance of EPD across several models, including exponential growth, logistic population models, and target cell-limited models with delayed virus production, thereby demonstrating the ability of the proposed method in capturing the shape of parameter distributions. Furthermore, we applied EPD to real-world datasets, capturing various shapes of parameter distributions over a normal distribution. These results address the heterogeneity within systems, marking a substantial progression in accurately modeling systems using RCS data. Therefore, EPD marks a significant advancement in accurately modeling systems with RCS data, realizing a deeper understanding of system dynamics and parameter variability.

                <p>by Xin-Yu Zhang, Lan-Lan Yu, Wei-Yi Wang, Gui-Quan Sun, Jian-Cheng Lv, Tao Zhou, Quan-Hui Liu</p>

Monitoring the spread of infectious disease is essential to design and adjust the interventions timely for the prevention of the epidemic outbreak and safeguarding the public health. The governments have generally adopted the incidence-based statistical method to estimate the time-varying effective reproduction number <i>R</i><sub>t</sub> and evaluate the transmission ability of epidemics. However, this method exhibits biases arising from the reported incidence data and assumes the generation interval distribution which is not available at the early stage of epidemic. Recent studies showed that the viral loads characterized by cycle threshold (Ct) of the infected populations evolving throughout the course of epidemic and providing a possibility to infer the epidemic trajectory. In this work, we propose the Cycle Threshold-based Transformer (Ct-Transformer) to estimate <i>R</i><sub>t</sub>. We find the supervised learning of Ct-Transformer outperforms the traditional incidence-based statistic and Ct-based <i>R</i><sub>t</sub> estimating methods, and more importantly Ct-Transformer is robustness to the detection resources. Further, we apply the proposed model to self-supervised pre-training tasks and obtain excellent fine-tuning performance, which attains comparable performance with the supervised Ct-Transformer, verified by both the synthetic and real-world datasets. We demonstrate that the Ct-based deep learning method can improve the real-time estimates of <i>R</i><sub>t</sub>, enabling more easily adapted to the track of the newly emerged epidemic.

                <p>by Annie G. Bryant, Kevin Aquino, Linden Parkes, Alex Fornito, Ben D. Fulcher</p>

The brain’s complex distributed dynamics are typically quantified using a limited set of manually selected statistical properties, leaving the possibility that alternative dynamical properties may outperform those reported for a given application. Here, we address this limitation by systematically comparing diverse, interpretable features of both intra-regional activity and inter-regional functional coupling from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data, demonstrating our method using case–control comparisons of four neuropsychiatric disorders. Our findings generally support the use of linear time-series analysis techniques for rs-fMRI case–control analyses, while also identifying new ways to quantify informative dynamical fMRI structures. While simple statistical representations of fMRI dynamics performed surprisingly well (e.g., properties within a single brain region), combining intra-regional properties with inter-regional coupling generally improved performance, underscoring the distributed, multifaceted changes to fMRI dynamics in neuropsychiatric disorders. The comprehensive, data-driven method introduced here enables systematic identification and interpretation of quantitative dynamical signatures of multivariate time-series data, with applicability beyond neuroimaging to diverse scientific problems involving complex time-varying systems.

Accurate estimates of the incidence of infectious diseases are key for the control of epidemics. However, healthcare systems are often unable to test the population exhaustively, especially when asymptomatic and paucisymptomatic cases are widespread; this leads to significant and systematic under-reporting of the real incidence. Here, we propose a machine learning approach to estimate the incidence of a pandemic in real-time, using reported cases and the overall test rate. In particular, we use Bayesian symbolic regression to automatically learn the closed-form mathematical models that most parsimoniously describe incidence. We develop and validate our models using COVID-19 incidence values for nine different countries, confirming their ability to accurately predict daily incidence. Remarkably, despite the differences in epidemic trajectories and dynamics across countries, we find that a single model for all countries offers a more parsimonious description and is more predictive of actual incidence compared to separate models for each country. Our results show the potential to accurately model incidence in real-time using closed-form mathematical models, providing a valuable tool for public health decision-makers.

                <p>by Juliana Chase, Liyu Xia, Lung-Hao Tai, Wan Chen Lin, Anne G. E. Collins, Linda Wilbrecht</p>

Computational modeling has revealed that human research participants use both rapid working memory (WM) and incremental reinforcement learning (RL) (RL+WM) to solve a simple instrumental learning task, relying on WM when the number of stimuli is small and supplementing with RL when the number of stimuli exceeds WM capacity. Inspired by this work, we examined which learning systems and strategies are used by adolescent and adult mice when they first acquire a conditional associative learning task. In a version of the human RL+WM task translated for rodents, mice were required to associate odor stimuli (from a set of 2 or 4 odors) with a left or right port to receive reward. Using logistic regression and computational models to analyze the first 200 trials per odor, we determined that mice used both incremental RL and stimulus-insensitive, one-back strategies to solve the task. While these one-back strategies may be a simple form of short-term or working memory, they did not approximate the boost to learning performance that has been observed in human participants using WM in a comparable task. Adolescent and adult mice also showed comparable performance, with no change in learning rate or softmax beta parameters with adolescent development and task experience. However, reliance on a one-back perseverative, win-stay strategy increased with development in males in both odor set sizes, but was not dependent on gonadal hormones. Our findings advance a simple conditional associative learning task and new models to enable the isolation and quantification of reinforcement learning alongside other strategies mice use while learning to associate stimuli with rewards within a single behavioral session. These data and methods can inform and aid comparative study of reinforcement learning across species.

                <p>by Armaan A. Abraham, Zhixin Cyrillus Tan, Priyanka Shrestha, Emily R. Bozich, Aaron S. Meyer</p>

Systems serology aims to broadly profile the antigen binding, Fc biophysical features, immune receptor engagement, and effector functions of antibodies. This experimental approach excels at identifying antibody functional features that are relevant to a particular disease. However, a crucial limitation of this approach is its incomplete description of what structural features of the antibodies are responsible for the observed immune receptor engagement and effector functions. Knowing these antibody features is important for both understanding how effector responses are naturally controlled through antibody Fc structure and designing antibody therapies with specific effector profiles. Here, we address this limitation by modeling the molecular interactions occurring in these assays and using this model to infer quantities of specific antibody Fc species among the antibodies being profiled. We used several validation strategies to show that the model accurately infers antibody properties and then applied the model to infer previously unavailable antibody fucosylation information from existing systems serology data. Using this capability, we find that COVID-19 vaccine efficacy is associated with the induction of afucosylated spike protein-targeting IgG. Our results also question an existing assumption that controllers of HIV exhibit gp120-targeting IgG that are less fucosylated than those of progressors. Additionally, we confirm that afucosylated IgG is associated with membrane-associated antigens for COVID-19 and HIV, and present new evidence indicating that this relationship is specific to the host cell membrane. Finally, we use the model to identify redundant assay measurements and subsets of information-rich measurements from which Fc properties can be inferred. In total, our modeling approach provides a quantitative framework for the reasoning typically applied in these studies, improving the ability to draw mechanistic conclusions from these data.

                <p>by Sarah E. Baum, Daniele M. Pelissari, Fernanda Dockhorn Costa, Luiza O. Harada, Mauro Sanchez, Patricia Bartholomay, Ted Cohen, Marcia C. Castro, Nicolas A. Menzies</p>

Effectively responding to drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) requires accurate and timely information on resistance levels and trends. In contexts where use of drug susceptibility testing has not been universal (i.e. not all patients are offered testing), surveillance for rifampicin-resistance—one of the core drugs in the TB treatment regimen—has relied on resource-intensive and infrequent nationally-representative prevalence surveys. The expanded availability of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) over the past decade has increased testing coverage in many settings. However, RDT data collected in the course of routine (but not universal) use may provide biased estimates of resistance if the subset of patients receiving RDTs is not representative of the overall cohort. Here, we developed a method that attempts to correct for non-random use of RDT testing in the context of routine TB diagnosis to recover unbiased estimates of resistance among new and previously treated TB cases. Specifically, we employed statistical corrections to model rifampicin resistance among TB notifications with observed Xpert MTB/RIF (a WHO-recommended RDT) results using a hierarchical generalized additive regression model, and then used model output to impute results for untested individuals. We applied this model to 2017–2023 case-level data on over 800,000 patients from Brazil. Modeled estimates of the prevalence of rifampicin resistance were substantially higher than naïve estimates, with estimated prevalence ranging between 28–44% higher for new cases and 2–17% higher for previously treated cases. Our estimates of RR-TB incidence were estimated with narrower uncertainty intervals relative to WHO estimates for the same time period, and were robust to alternative model specifications. Our approach provides a generalizable method to leverage routine RDT data to derive timely estimates of RR-TB prevalence among notified TB cases in settings where testing for TB drug resistance is not universal.

                <p>by Jiyoung Kang, Hae-Jeong Park</p>

Integrating multiscale, multimodal neuroimaging data is essential for a comprehensive understanding of neural circuits. However, this is challenging due to the inherent trade-offs between spatial coverage and resolution in each modality, necessitating a computational strategy that combines modality-specific information effectively. This study introduces a dynamic causal modeling (DCM) framework designed to address the challenge of combining partially observed, multiscale signals across a larger-scale neural circuit by employing a shared neural state model with modality-specific observation models. The proposed method achieves robust circuit inference by iteratively integrating parameter estimates from local microscale and global meso- or macroscale circuits, derived from signals across various scales and modalities. Parameters estimated from high-resolution data within specific regions inform global circuit estimation by constraining neural properties in unobserved regions, while large-scale circuit data help elucidate detailed local circuitry. Using a virtual ground truth system, we validated the method across diverse experimental settings, combining calcium imaging (CaI), voltage-sensitive dye imaging (VSDI), and blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals—each with distinct coverage and resolution. Our reciprocal and iterative parameter estimation approach markedly improves the accuracy of neural property and connectivity estimates compared to traditional one-step estimation methods. This iterative integration of local and global parameters presents a reliable approach to inferring extensive, complex neural circuits from partially observed, multimodal, and multiscale data, showcasing how information from different scales reciprocally enhances entire circuit parameter estimation.

Neuroblastoma is the most common extra-cranial solid tumour in children. Over half of all high-risk cases are expected to succumb to the disease even after chemotherapy, surgery, and immunotherapy. Although the importance of <i>MYCN</i> amplification in this disease is indisputable, the mechanistic details remain enigmatic. Here, we present a multicellular model of neuroblastoma comprising a continuous automaton, discrete cell agents, and a centre-based mechanical model, as well as the simulation results we obtained with it. The continuous automaton represents the tumour microenvironment as a grid-like structure, where each voxel is associated with continuous variables such as the oxygen level therein. Each discrete cell agent is defined by several attributes, including its cell cycle position, mutations, gene expression pattern, and more with behaviours such as cell cycling and cell death being stochastically dependent on these attributes. The centre-based mechanical model represents the properties of these agents as physical objects, describing how they repel each other as soft spheres. By implementing a stochastic simulation algorithm on modern GPUs, we simulated the dynamics of over one million neuroblastoma cells over a period of months. Specifically, we set up 1200 heterogeneous tumours and tracked the <i>MYCN</i>-amplified clone’s dynamics in each, revealed the conditions that favour its growth, and tested its responses to 5000 drug combinations. Our results are in agreement with those reported in the literature and add new insights into how the <i>MYCN</i>-amplified clone’s reproductive advantage in a tumour, its gene expression profile, the tumour’s other clones (with different mutations), and the tumour’s microenvironment are inter-related. Based on the results, we formulated a hypothesis, which argues that there are two distinct populations of neuroblastoma cells in the tumour; the p53 protein is pro-survival in one and pro-apoptosis in the other. It follows that alternating between inhibiting MDM2 to restore p53 activity and inhibiting ARF to attenuate p53 activity is a promising, if unorthodox, therapeutic strategy. The multicellular model has the advantages of modularity, high resolution, and scalability, making it a potential foundation for creating digital twins of neuroblastoma patients.

The baroreflex is one of the most important control mechanisms in the human cardiovascular system. This work utilises a closed-loop in silico model of baroreflex regulation, coupled to pulsatile mechanical models with (i) one heart chamber and 36-parameters and (ii) four chambers and 51 parameters. We perform the first global sensitivity analysis of these closed-loop systems which considers <i>both</i> cardiovascular and baroreflex parameters, and compare the models with their respective unregulated equivalents. Results show the reduced influence of regulated parameters compared to unregulated equivalents and that, in the physiological resting state, model outputs (pressures, heart rate, cardiac output etc.) are most sensitive to parasympathetic arc parameters. This work provides insight into the effects of regulation and model input parameter influence on clinical metrics, and constitutes a first step to understanding the role of regulation in models for personalised healthcare.

                <p>by Bethan Cracknell Daniels, Darunee Buddhari, Taweewun Hunsawong, Sopon Iamsirithaworn, Aaron R. Farmer, Derek A. T. Cummings, Kathryn B. Anderson, Ilaria Dorigatti</p>

The development of a safe and efficacious vaccine that provides immunity against all four dengue virus serotypes is a priority, and a significant challenge for vaccine development has been defining and measuring serotype-specific outcomes and correlates of protection. The plaque reduction neutralisation test (PRNT) is the gold standard assay for measuring serotype-specific antibodies, but this test cannot differentiate homotypic and heterotypic antibodies and characterising the infection history is challenging. To address this, we present an analysis of pre- and post-infection antibody titres measured using the PRNT, collected from a prospective cohort of Thai children. We applied four machine learning classifiers and multinomial logistic regression to the titre data to predict the infecting serotype. The models were validated against the true infecting serotype, identified using RT-PCR. Model performance was calculated using 100 bootstrap samples of the train and out-of-sample test sets. Our analysis showed that, on average, the greatest change in titre was against the infecting serotype. However, in 53.4% (109/204) of the subjects, the highest titre change did not correspond to the infecting serotype, including in 34.3% (11/35) of dengue-naïve individuals (although 8/11 of these seronegative individuals were seropositive to Japanese encephalitis virus prior to their infection). The highest post-infection titres of seropositive cases were more likely to match the serotype of the highest pre-infection titre than the infecting serotype, consistent with antigenic seniority or cross-reactive boosting of pre-infection titres. Despite these challenges, the best performing machine learning algorithm achieved 76.3% (95% CI 57.9–89.5%) accuracy on the out-of-sample test set in predicting the infecting serotype from PRNT data. Incorporating additional spatiotemporal data improved accuracy to 80.6% (95% CI 63.2–94.7%), while using only post-infection titres as predictor variables yielded an accuracy of 71.7% (95% CI 57.9–84.2%). These results show that machine learning classifiers can be used to overcome challenges in interpreting PRNT titres, making them useful tools in investigating dengue immune dynamics, infection history and identifying serotype-specific correlates of protection, which in turn can support the evaluation of clinical trial endpoints and vaccine development.

Finding optimal parameters for detailed neuronal models is a ubiquitous challenge in neuroscientific research. In recent years, manual model tuning has been gradually replaced by automated parameter search using a variety of different tools and methods. However, using most of these software tools and choosing the most appropriate algorithm for a given optimization task require substantial technical expertise, which prevents the majority of researchers from using these methods effectively. To address these issues, we developed a generic platform (called Neuroptimus) that allows users to set up neural parameter optimization tasks via a graphical interface, and to solve these tasks using a wide selection of state-of-the-art parameter search methods implemented by five different Python packages. Neuroptimus also offers several features to support more advanced usage, including the ability to run most algorithms in parallel, which allows it to take advantage of high-performance computing architectures. We used the common interface provided by Neuroptimus to conduct a detailed comparison of more than twenty different algorithms (and implementations) on six distinct benchmarks that represent typical scenarios in neuronal parameter search. We quantified the performance of the algorithms in terms of the best solutions found and in terms of convergence speed. We identified several algorithms, including covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy and particle swarm optimization, that consistently, without any fine-tuning, found good solutions in all of our use cases. By contrast, some other algorithms including all local search methods provided good solutions only for the simplest use cases, and failed completely on more complex problems. We also demonstrate the versatility of Neuroptimus by applying it to an additional use case that involves tuning the parameters of a subcellular model of biochemical pathways. Finally, we created an online database that allows uploading, querying and analyzing the results of optimization runs performed by Neuroptimus, which enables all researchers to update and extend the current benchmarking study. The tools and analysis we provide should aid members of the neuroscience community to apply parameter search methods more effectively in their research.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Despite treatments which reduce relapses in multiple sclerosis (MS), many patients continue to experience progressive disability accumulation. MS is associated with metabolic disruptions and cerebral metabolic stress predisposes to tissue injury and possibly impaired remyelination. Additionally, myelin homeostasis is metabolically expensive and reliant on glycolysis. We investigated cerebral metabolic changes in MS and when in the disease course they occurred, and assessed their relationship with microstructural changes.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This study used combined fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to measure cerebral metabolic rate of glucose and oxygen, thereby quantifying glycolysis. Twelve healthy controls, 20 patients with relapsing MS, and 13 patients with non-relapsing MS were studied. Relapsing patients with MS were treatment naïve and scanned pre- and post-initiation of high efficacy disease modifying therapy.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In normal appearing white matter, we observed increased glucose utilization and reduced oxygen utilization in newly diagnosed MS, consistent with increased glycolysis. Increased glycolysis was greater in patients with a longer disease duration course and higher disability. Among newly diagnosed patients, different treatments had differential impacts on glucose utilization. Last, whereas hypermetabolism within lesions was clearly associated with inflammation, no such relationship was found within normal appearing white matter.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Increased white matter glycolysis is a prominent feature of cerebral metabolism in MS. It begins early in the disease course, increases with disease duration and is independent of microstructural evidence of inflammation in normal appearing white matter. Optimization of the metabolic environment may be an important component of therapies designed to reduce progressive disability. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder traditionally characterized by the selective loss of medium spiny neurons in the basal ganglia. However, it has become apparent that white matter injury and oligodendrocyte dysfunction precede the degeneration of medium spiny neurons, garnering interest as a key pathogenic mechanism of HD. Oligodendrocytes are glial cells found within the central nervous system involved in the production of myelin and the myelination of axons. Myelin is a lipid-rich sheath that wraps around axons, facilitating signal conduction and neuronal viability. The degeneration of myelin hinders effective communication and leaves neurons vulnerable to external damage and subsequent degeneration. Abnormalities in oligodendrocyte maturation have been established in the HD human brain, however, investigations into the underlying dysfunction of human oligodendrocytes in HD are limited. This review will detail the involvement of oligodendrocytes and white matter damage in HD. Recent developments in modeling human-specific oligodendrocyte pathology in HD will be discussed, with a particular focus on emerging somatic cell reprogramming approaches.</p>

<p>Dipyridamole (DIP) improved Niemann Pick C1 disease (NPC1) mice motivation to perform the Erasmus Ladder test and preserved their recognition memory. This effect was accompanied by an increased expression of CaBP in the hippocampus. Our results demonstrated that DIP could represent a valuable therapeutic tool to be used in combination with other approved drugs in NPC.</p>

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Niemann Pick type C1 (NPC1) is a rare, fatal disorder characterized by endosomal lipid accumulation that leads to damage of both peripheral organs and central nervous system (cerebellum and hippocampus are especially affected). Currently, miglustat is the only approved drug for NPC1, thus the identification of new treatments is mandatory. We have previously demonstrated that the drug dipyridamole (DIP), an enhancer of adenosine signaling, can reduce the pathological phenotype in patient-derived fibroblasts. In this paper, we evaluated the <i>in vivo</i> effects of DIP in NPC1 mice. Male and female NPC1<sup>nih</sup> mice were treated with DIP 30 mg/kg i.p. from 28 to 64 days of age. Motor function was assessed by Erasmus Ladder test, hippocampal cognitive decline by Novel Object Recognition test and brain pathology by immunofluorescence and biochemical assays. Peripheral pathology was evaluated by analyzing lipid accumulation in spleen and liver (HP-TLC). In NPC1, mice DIP rescued recognition memory and increased hippocampal expression of calbindin. On the contrary, the drug was unable to improve motor function, cerebellar pathology and lipid accumulation in spleen and liver. Our results demonstrated that DIP selectively ameliorates the cognitive impairment in NPC1 mice. This drug could thus represent a valuable therapeutic tool to be used in combination with other treatments in NPC1.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23678?af=R">Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation Over Bilateral Temporal Lobes Modulates Hippocampal‐Occipital Functional Connectivity and Visual Short‐Term Memory Precision</a></h4>

              
                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Although the medial temporal lobe (MTL) is traditionally considered a region dedicated to long-term memory, recent neuroimaging and intracranial recording evidence suggests that the MTL also contributes to certain aspects of visual short-term memory (VSTM), such as the quality or precision of retained VSTM content. This study aims to further investigate the MTL's role in VSTM precision through the application of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Participants underwent 1.5 mA offline tDCS over bilateral temporal lobes using left cathodal and right anodal electrodes, administered for either 20 min (active) or 0.5 min within a 20-min window (sham), in a counterbalanced design. As the electrical current passes through midbrain structures with this bilateral stimulation montage, prior behavioral and modeling evidence suggests that this tDCS protocol can modulate MTL functions. To confirm this and examine its impacts on VSTM, participants completed a VSTM color recall task immediately following tDCS, while undergoing a 20-min fMRI scan and a subsequent 7.5-min resting-state scan, during which they focused on a fixation cross. Behavioral results indicated that this tDCS protocol decreased VSTM precision without significantly affecting overall recall success. Furthermore, psychophysiological interaction analysis revealed that tDCS over the temporal lobe modulated hippocampal-occipital functional connectivity during the VSTM task, despite no main effect on fMRI BOLD activity. Notably, this modulation was also observed during resting-state fMRI 15–20 min post-tDCS, with the magnitude of the effect correlating with participants' behavioral changes in VSTM precision across active and control conditions. Combined, these findings suggest that tDCS over the temporal lobe can modulate the intrinsic functional connectivity between the MTL and visual sensory areas, thereby affecting VSTM precision.</p>

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Accumulating evidence indicates that inherited astrocyte dysfunction can be a primary trigger for epilepsy development; however, the available data are rather limited. In addition, astrocytes are considered as a perspective target for the design of novel and improvement of the existing antiepileptic therapy. Piracetam and related nootropic drugs are widely used in the therapy of various epileptic disorders, but detailed mechanisms of racetams action and, in particular, their effects on glial functions are poorly understood. In this study, we explored the functional state of astrocytes in the dentate gyrus (DG) of Krushinsky–Molodkina (KM) rats genetically prone to audiogenic seizures and compared the action of piracetam on the DG astrocytes in KM and normal Wistar rats. Wistar and naïve KM rats which received injections of saline (control) or piracetam (100 mg/kg) for 21 days were recruited in our studies. Comparative analysis of control Wistar and KM rats revealed genetically determined abnormalities in DG astrocytes of KM rats including an increased expression of NFIA but a decreased GFAP, ALDH1L1, EAATs, and glutamine synthetase (GS). Piracetam treatment normalized the expression of all studied markers, except NFIA, in KM rats, while in Wistar rats, it potentiated only GS and NFIA. The results suggested that the nootropic and antiepileptic effects of piracetam may be, at least partially, mediated by the modulation of astroglia functions. In addition, analysis of NFIA and GS colocalization revealed the novel pattern of astrocyte heterogeneity in the DG which was significantly altered in epileptic rats but corrected by piracetam.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97465">Genome concentration limits cell growth and modulates proteome composition in Escherichia coli</a></h4>

              
                Defining the cellular factors that drive growth rate and proteome composition is essential for understanding and manipulating cellular systems. In bacteria, ribosome concentration is known to be a constraining factor of cell growth rate, while gene concentration is usually assumed not to be limiting. Here, using single-molecule tracking, quantitative single-cell microscopy, and modeling, we show that genome dilution in <i>Escherichia coli</i> cells arrested for DNA replication limits total RNA polymerase activity within physiological cell sizes across tested nutrient conditions. This rapid-onset limitation on bulk transcription results in sub-linear scaling of total active ribosomes with cell size and sub-exponential growth. Such downstream effects on bulk translation and cell growth are near-immediately detectable in a nutrient-rich medium, but delayed in nutrient-poor conditions, presumably due to cellular buffering activities. RNA sequencing and tandem-mass-tag mass spectrometry experiments further reveal that genome dilution remodels the relative abundance of mRNAs and proteins with cell size at a global level. Altogether, our findings indicate that chromosome concentration is a limiting factor of transcription and a global modulator of the transcriptome and proteome composition in <i>E. coli</i>. Experiments in <i>Caulobacter crescentus</i> and comparison with eukaryotic cell studies identify broadly conserved DNA concentration-dependent scaling principles of gene expression.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100086">The evolutionary modifications of a GoLoco motif in the AGS protein facilitate micromere formation in the sea urchin embryo</a></h4>

              
                The evolutionary introduction of asymmetric cell division (ACD) into the developmental program facilitates the formation of a new cell type, contributing to developmental diversity and, eventually, species diversification. The micromere of the sea urchin embryo may serve as one of those examples: an ACD at the 16-cell stage forms micromeres unique to echinoids among echinoderms. We previously reported that a polarity factor, activator of G-protein signaling (AGS), plays a crucial role in micromere formation. However, AGS and its associated ACD factors are present in all echinoderms and across most metazoans. This raises the question of what evolutionary modifications of AGS protein or its surrounding molecular environment contributed to the evolutionary acquisition of micromeres only in echinoids. In this study, we learned that the GoLoco motifs at the AGS C-terminus play critical roles in regulating micromere formation in sea urchin embryos. Further, other echinoderms’ AGS or chimeric AGS that contain the C-terminus of AGS orthologs from various organisms showed varied localization and function in micromere formation. In contrast, the sea star or the pencil urchin orthologs of other ACD factors were consistently localized at the vegetal cortex in the sea urchin embryo, suggesting that AGS may be a unique variable factor that facilitates ACD diversity among echinoderms. Consistently, sea urchin AGS appears to facilitate micromere-like cell formation and accelerate the enrichment timing of the germline factor Vasa during early embryogenesis of the pencil urchin, an ancestral type of sea urchin. Based on these observations, we propose that the molecular evolution of a single polarity factor facilitates ACD diversity while preserving the core ACD machinery among echinoderms and beyond during evolution.

                The IncRNA <i>Malat1</i> was initially believed to be dispensable for physiology due to the lack of observable phenotypes in <i>Malat1</i> knockout (KO) mice. However, our study challenges this conclusion. We found that both <i>Malat1</i> KO and conditional KO mice in the osteoblast lineage exhibit significant osteoporosis. Mechanistically, <i>Malat1</i> acts as an intrinsic regulator in osteoblasts to promote osteogenesis. Interestingly, <i>Malat1</i> does not directly affect osteoclastogenesis but inhibits osteoclastogenesis in a non-autonomous manner in vivo via integrating crosstalk between multiple cell types, including osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and chondrocytes. Our findings substantiate the existence of a novel remodeling network in which <i>Malat1</i> serves as a central regulator by binding to β-catenin and functioning through the β-catenin-OPG/Jagged1 pathway in osteoblasts and chondrocytes. In pathological conditions, <i>Malat1</i> significantly promotes bone regeneration in fracture healing. Bone homeostasis and regeneration are crucial to well-being. Our discoveries establish a previous unrecognized paradigm model of <i>Malat1</i> function in the skeletal system, providing novel mechanistic insights into how a lncRNA integrates cellular crosstalk and molecular networks to fine tune tissue homeostasis, remodeling and repair.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97180">Base editing of Ptbp1 in neurons alleviates symptoms in a mouse model of Parkinson’s disease</a></h4>

              
                Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a multifactorial disease caused by irreversible progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons (DANs). Recent studies have reported the successful conversion of astrocytes into DANs by repressing polypyrimidine tract binding protein 1 (PTBP1), which led to the rescue of motor symptoms in a chemically-induced mouse model of PD. However, follow-up studies have questioned the validity of this astrocyte-to-DAN conversion model. Here, we devised an adenine base editing strategy to downregulate PTBP1 in astrocytes and neurons in a chemically-induced PD mouse model. While PTBP1 downregulation in astrocytes had no effect, PTBP1 downregulation in neurons of the striatum resulted in the expression of the DAN marker tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in non-dividing neurons, which was associated with an increase in striatal dopamine concentrations and a rescue of forelimb akinesia and spontaneous rotations. Phenotypic analysis using multiplexed iterative immunofluorescence imaging further revealed that most of these TH-positive cells co-expressed the dopaminergic marker DAT and the pan-neuronal marker NEUN, with the majority of these triple-positive cells being classified as mature GABAergic neurons. Additional research is needed to fully elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the expression of the observed markers and understand how the formation of these cells contributes to the rescue of spontaneous motor behaviors. Nevertheless, our findings support a model where downregulation of neuronal, but not astrocytic, PTBP1 can mitigate symptoms in PD mice.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93002">Clinical phenotypes in acute and chronic infarction explained through human ventricular electromechanical modelling and simulations</a></h4>

              
                Sudden death after myocardial infarction (MI) is associated with electrophysiological heterogeneities and ionic current remodelling. Low ejection fraction (EF) is used in risk stratification, but its mechanistic links with pro-arrhythmic heterogeneities are unknown. We aim to provide mechanistic explanations of clinical phenotypes in acute and chronic MI, from ionic current remodelling to ECG and EF, using human electromechanical modelling and simulation to augment experimental and clinical investigations. A human ventricular electromechanical modelling and simulation framework is constructed and validated with rich experimental and clinical datasets, incorporating varying degrees of ionic current remodelling as reported in literature. In acute MI, T-wave inversion and Brugada phenocopy were explained by conduction abnormality and local action potential prolongation in the border zone. In chronic MI, upright tall T-waves highlight large repolarisation dispersion between the border and remote zones, which promoted ectopic propagation at fast pacing. Post-MI EF at resting heart rate was not sensitive to the extent of repolarisation heterogeneity and the risk of repolarisation abnormalities at fast pacing. T-wave and QT abnormalities are better indicators of repolarisation heterogeneities than EF in post-MI.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98441">Virus adaptation to heparan sulfate comes with capsid stability tradeoff</a></h4>

              
                Because of high mutation rates, viruses constantly adapt to new environments. When propagated in cell lines, certain viruses acquire positively charged amino acids on their surface proteins, enabling them to utilize negatively charged heparan sulfate (HS) as an attachment receptor. In this study, we used enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) as model and demonstrated that unlike the parental MP4 variant, the cell-adapted strong HS-binder MP4-97R/167G does not require acidification for uncoating and releases its genome in the neutral or weakly acidic environment of early endosomes. We experimentally confirmed that this pH-independent entry is not associated with the use of HS as an attachment receptor but rather with compromised capsid stability. We then extended these findings to another HS-dependent strain. In summary, our data indicate that acquisition of capsid mutations conferring affinity for HS come together with decreased capsid stability and allow EV-A71 to enter the cell via a pH-independent pathway. This pH-independent entry mechanism boosts viral replication in cell lines but may prove deleterious <i>in vivo</i>, especially for enteric viruses crossing the acidic gastric environment before reaching their primary replication site, the intestine. Our study thus provides new insight into the mechanisms underlying the <i>in vivo</i> attenuation of HS-binding EV-A71 strains. Not only are these viruses hindered in tissues rich in HS due to viral trapping, as generally accepted, but our research reveals that their diminished capsid stability further contributes to attenuation <i>in vivo</i>. This underscores the complex relationship between HS-binding, capsid stability, and viral fitness, where increased replication in cell lines coincides with attenuation in harsh in vivo environments like the gastrointestinal tract.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100260">The emergence of visual category representations in infants’ brains</a></h4>

              
                Organizing the continuous stream of visual input into categories like places or faces is important for everyday function and social interactions. However, it is unknown when neural representations of these and other visual categories emerge. Here, we used steady-state evoked potential electroencephalography to measure cortical responses in infants at 3–4 months, 4–6 months, 6–8 months, and 12–15 months, when they viewed controlled, gray-level images of faces, limbs, corridors, characters, and cars. We found that distinct responses to these categories emerge at different ages. Reliable brain responses to faces emerge first, at 4–6 months, followed by limbs and places around 6–8 months. Between 6 and 15 months response patterns become more distinct, such that a classifier can decode what an infant is looking at from their brain responses. These findings have important implications for assessing typical and atypical cortical development as they not only suggest that category representations are learned, but also that representations of categories that may have innate substrates emerge at different times during infancy.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94884">A novel human pluripotent stem cell gene activation system identifies IGFBP2 as a mediator in the production of haematopoietic progenitors in vitro</a></h4>

              
                A major challenge in the stem cell biology field is the ability to produce fully functional cells from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) that are a valuable resource for cell therapy, drug screening, and disease modelling. Here, we developed a novel inducible CRISPR-mediated activation strategy (iCRISPRa) to drive the expression of multiple endogenous transcription factors (TFs) important for in vitro cell fate and differentiation of iPSCs to haematopoietic progenitor cells. This work has identified a key role for IGFBP2 in developing haematopoietic progenitors. We first identified nine candidate TFs that we predicted to be involved in blood cell emergence during development, then generated tagged gRNAs directed to the transcriptional start site of these TFs that could also be detected during single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq). iCRISPRa activation of these endogenous TFs resulted in a significant expansion of arterial-fated endothelial cells expressing high levels of IGFBP2, and our analysis indicated that IGFBP2 is involved in the remodelling of metabolic activity during in vitro endothelial to haematopoietic transition. As well as providing fundamental new insights into the mechanisms of haematopoietic differentiation, the broader applicability of iCRISPRa provides a valuable tool for studying dynamic processes in development and for recapitulating abnormal phenotypes characterised by ectopic activation of specific endogenous gene expression in a wide range of systems.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92004">Basement membranes are crucial for proper olfactory placode shape, position and boundary with the brain, and for olfactory axon development</a></h4>

              
                Despite recent progress, the complex roles played by the extracellular matrix in development and disease are still far from being fully understood. Here, we took advantage of the zebrafish <i>sly</i> mutation which affects Laminin γ1, a major component of basement membranes, to explore its role in the development of the olfactory system. Following a detailed characterisation of Laminin distribution in the developing olfactory circuit, we analysed basement membrane integrity, olfactory placode and brain morphogenesis, and olfactory axon development in <i>sly</i> mutants, using a combination of immunochemistry, electron microscopy and quantitative live imaging of cell movements and axon behaviours. Our results point to an original and dual contribution of Laminin γ1-dependent basement membranes in organising the border between the olfactory placode and the adjacent brain: they maintain placode shape and position in the face of major brain morphogenetic movements, they establish a robust physical barrier between the two tissues while at the same time allowing the local entry of the sensory axons into the brain and their navigation towards the olfactory bulb. This work thus identifies key roles of Laminin γ1-dependent basement membranes in neuronal tissue morphogenesis and axon development in vivo.

	<p>Background/Objectives:&amp;amp;nbsp;Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii), an obligate food-borne intracellular parasite, causes severe neuropathology by establishing a persistent infection in the host brain. We have previously shown that T. gondii infection induces severe neuropathology in the brain manifested by increased nitric oxide production, oxidative stress, glial activation/BBB damage, increased pro-inflammatory cytokine glia maturation factor-beta and induced apoptosis. Methods: The aim of this experimental study was to investigate the serum amyloid P (SAP) components, nuclear factor kappa B (NF-&amp;amp;kappa;B), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1&amp;amp;beta;), caspase 1 (Casp 1), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-&amp;amp;alpha;) and complement 3 (C3) gene expressions on the 10th, 20th and 30th days after infection with T. gondii in the neuroimmunopathogenesis of toxoplasmic encephalitis (TE) in mouse brains by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The study also aimed to determine whether there was a correlation between the markers included in the study on these critical days, which had not previously been investigated. The mRNA expression levels of SAP components, NF-&amp;amp;kappa;B, IL-1&amp;amp;beta;, Casp 1, TNF-&amp;amp;alpha; and C3 were examined. Results: The most notable outcome of this investigation was the observation that SAP components exhibited a 13.9-fold increase on day 10 post-infection, followed by a rapid decline in the subsequent periods. In addition, IL-1&amp;amp;beta; expression increased 20-fold, while SAP components decreased 13-fold on day 20 after infection. Additionally, the TNF-&amp;amp;alpha;, Casp 1 and NF-&amp;amp;kappa;B expression levels were consistently elevated to above normal levels at each time point. Conclusions: This study identified SAP components, NF-&amp;amp;kappa;B, IL-1&amp;amp;beta;, Casp 1 and TNF-&amp;amp;alpha; expressions as playing critical roles in TE neuroimmunopathogenesis. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate SAP components during the transition from acute systemic infection to early/medium chronic and chronic infection and to explore the relationship between SAP components and other nuclear factors/pro-cytokines.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Recent research has explored the presence of subthreshold autistic traits (ATs) in individuals with borderline personality disorder (BPD), suggesting that these traits may contribute to the severity of BPD symptoms and increase the risk of other mental health issues, including suicidal behaviors. This study aims to investigate the relationship between ATs and affective symptoms, such as mood instability and suicidality, in people diagnosed with BPD. Methods: A total of 48 subjects with BPD were assessed with self-report questionnaires including the Adult Autism Subthreshold Spectrum (AdAS Spectrum), the mood spectrum self-report version (MOODS-SR) and the ruminative response scale (RRS). Results: Subjects with significant ATs scored higher than BPD subjects in all domains and in the total score of AdAS Spectrum, RRS, and MOODS-SR, as well as in the items investigating suicidality. RRS total score, its depression domain, and the MOODS-SR rhythmicity domain, as well as suicidality, were predictors of the presence of ATs. Conclusions: Our data confirm the relationship between the presence of clinically significant ATs and affective symptoms, ruminative thinking, and suicidality in patients with BPD.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Military aviators can be exposed to extreme physiological stressors, including decompression stress, G-forces, as well as intermittent hypoxia and/or hyperoxia, which may contribute to neurobiological dysfunction/damage. This study aimed to investigate the levels of neurological biomarkers in military aviators to assess the potential risk of long-term brain injury and neurodegeneration. Methods: This cross-sectional study involved 48 Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) aviators and 48 non-aviator CAF controls. Plasma samples were analyzed for biomarkers of glial activation (GFAP), axonal damage (NF-L, pNF-H), oxidative stress (PRDX-6), and neurodegeneration (T-tau), along with S100b, NSE, and UCHL-1. The biomarker concentrations were quantified using multiplexed immunoassays. Results: The aviators exhibited significantly elevated levels of GFAP, NF-L, PRDX-6, and T-tau compared to the CAF controls (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), indicating increased glial activation, axonal injury, and oxidative stress. Trends toward higher levels of S100b, NSE, and UCHL-1 were observed but were not statistically significant. The elevated biomarker levels suggest cumulative brain damage, raising concerns about potential long-term neurological impairments. Conclusions: Military aviators are at increased risk for neurobiological injury, including glial and axonal damage, oxidative stress, and early neurodegeneration. These findings emphasize the importance of proactive monitoring and further research to understand the long-term impacts of high-altitude flight on brain health and to develop strategies for mitigating cognitive decline and neurodegenerative risks in this population.</p>

	<p>Radiation therapy is widely recognized as an efficacious modality for treating neoplasms located within the craniofacial region. Nevertheless, this approach is not devoid of risks, predominantly concerning potential harm to the neural structures. Adverse effects may encompass focal cerebral necrosis, cognitive function compromise, cerebrovascular pathology, spinal cord injury, and detriment to the neural fibers constituting the brachial plexus. With increasing survival rates among oncology patients, evaluating post-treatment quality of life has become crucial in assessing the benefits of radiation therapy. Consequently, it is imperative to investigate therapeutic strategies to mitigate cerebral complications from radiation exposure. Current management of radiation-induced cerebral damage involves corticosteroids and bevacizumab, with preclinical research on antioxidants and thalidomide. Despite these efforts, an optimal treatment remains elusive. Recent studies suggest the gut microbiota&amp;amp;rsquo;s involvement in neurologic pathologies. This review aims to discuss the causes and existing treatments for radiation-induced cerebral injury and explore gut microbiota modulation as a potential therapeutic strategy.</p>

In this study, 66 participants with normal cognition, 59 with subjective cognitive decline, 12 with mild cognitive impairment, and 11 with Alzheimer’s disease dementia were included in the Sino Longitudinal Study on Cognitive Decline (SILCODE) cohort. A regional asymmetry index, denoting the left–right asymmetry of β-amyloid plaques, was derived for each region based on the Anatomical Automatic Labeling atlas. The level of β-amyloid plaques in each region was compared among different clinical stages of Alzheimer’s disease using the analysis of variance. An additional correlation analysis examined the relationship between each region of interest’s cognitive performance scores and asymmetry index values. We found that β-amyloid appears to be lateralized in different stages of Alzheimer’s disease. In addition, there is a significant correlation between β-amyloid asymmetry in various brain regions and cognition. The observed Aβ lateralization could potentially be utilized as a neuroimaging biomarker throughout AD progression.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is applied both in research settings and clinically, notably in treating depression through the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). We have recently shown that transcranial alternating current stimulation of the dlPFC partially entrains muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) to the stimulus. We, therefore, aimed to further explore the sympathetic properties of the dlPFC, hypothesizing that single-pulse TMS could generate de novo MSNA bursts. Microneurography was performed on the right common peroneal nerve in 12 participants. TMS pulses were then delivered to the ipsilateral dlPFC at resting motor threshold (MT) of the first dorsal interosseous muscle and at powers 20 below, 10 below, 10% above, and 20% above MT. The MT and 10% above MT intensities were also used to stimulate the right motor cortex and shoulder. Comparisons between stimulus intensities at the same site and between sites at the same intensities revealed no differences in MSNA burst frequency, burst incidence, or single MSNA spikes. Most stimulus trains, however, showed reduced burst frequency and incidence from baseline, regardless of site. This suggests that the TMS itself was evoking arousal-based sympathoinhibition, independent of dlPFC influences. It seems the dlPFC is capable of modulating MSNA but cannot directly generate bursts.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Foreseeing the future outcomes is the art of decision-making. Substantial evidence shows that, during choice deliberation, the brain can retrieve prospective decision outcomes. However, decisions are seldom made in a vacuum. Context carries information that can radically affect the outcomes of a choice. Nevertheless, most investigations of retrieval processes examined decisions in isolation, disregarding the context in which they occur. Here, we studied how context shapes prospective outcome retrieval during deliberation. We designed a decision-making task where participants were presented with object–context pairs and made decisions which led to a certain outcome. We show during deliberation, likely outcomes were retrieved in transient patterns of neural activity, as early as 3 s before participants decided. The strength of prospective outcome retrieval explains participants’ behavioral efficiency, but only when context affects the decision outcome. Our results suggest context imparts strong constraints on retrieval processes and how neural representations are shaped during decision-making.</span>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Anti-MAG polyneuropathy is a demyelinating peripheral neuropathy associated with IgM monoclonal gammopathies, particularly MGUS (monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance) and Waldenstr&amp;amp;ouml;m macroglobulinemia. It is characterized by a subacute onset of distal sensory symptoms, with distal motor dysfunction typically appearing only in the later stages of the disease. The condition is caused by the presence of autoantibodies directed against myelin-associated glycoprotein, a structural protein of myelin. This leads to abnormalities in electrophysiological studies, such as markedly delayed distal latencies without conduction blocks or temporal dispersion of potentials. While rituximab (RTX) is the primary treatment, its efficacy is limited, with improvement seen in only 30&amp;amp;ndash;50% of patients. Recently, acute worsening of symptoms after RTX treatment has been increasingly reported. Methods: This systematic review compiles case reports and series from inception to June 2024 published on Scopus, PubMed or Cochrane, documenting acute exacerbations after RTX treatment in patients with anti-MAG polyneuropathy. Additionally, we present a case report from our institution that highlights this phenomenon. Results: We identified 13 clinical cases of acute deterioration in patients with anti-MAG polyneuropathy. Among these, eight patients (62%) achieved full recovery following additional treatment, while five patients (38%) did not return to their previous level of function. Plasmapheresis led to complete recovery in all four patients who received this intervention. Interestingly, many patients also experienced recovery after discontinuation of rituximab (RTX) treatment without the need for further therapeutic intervention. Conclusions: Acute clinical deterioration following RTX treatment in anti-MAG polyneuropathy is a possible occurrence. However, to date, no studies have assessed the true prevalence of this phenomenon. Further research is warranted to identify potential predictors of worsening following RTX treatment in this patient population.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) are neurodevelopmental disorders marked by challenges in social interaction, communication, and repetitive behaviors. People with ASD may exhibit repetitive behaviors, unique ways of learning, and different ways of interacting with the world. The term &amp;amp;ldquo;spectrum&amp;amp;rdquo; reflects the wide variability in how ASD manifests in individuals, including differences in abilities, symptoms, and support needs, and conditions characterized by difficulties in social interactions, communication, restricted interests, and repetitive behaviors. Inflammation plays a crucial role in the pathophysiology, with increased pro-inflammatory cytokines in cerebrospinal fluid. Previous studies with transcranial magnetic stimulation have shown promising results, suggesting nervous system susceptibility to electromagnetic fields, with evidence indicating that extremely low-frequency electromagnetic field (ELF-EMF) treatment may modulate inflammatory responses through multiple pathways, including the reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-6 and TNF-&amp;amp;alpha;, and the enhancement of anti-inflammatory mediators. Methods: This pilot study included 20 children (ages 2&amp;amp;ndash;13) with a confirmed diagnosis of ASD. A 15-week protocol involved ELF-EMF treatments using the SEQEX device, with specific day and night programs. Assessment was conducted through standardized pre- and post-treatment tests: Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist, Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test-4, Expressive One Word Picture Vocabulary Test-4, and Conner&amp;amp;rsquo;s 3GI. Results: Statistically significant improvements were observed in receptive language (PPVT-4: from 74.07 to 90.40, p = 0.002) and expressive language (EOWPVT-4: from 84.17 to 90.50, p = 0.041). Notable reductions, with statistical significance, were found in externalizing problems across both age groups (1.5&amp;amp;ndash;5 years: p = 0.028; 6&amp;amp;ndash;18 years: p = 0.027), with particular improvement in attention and behavioral problems. The results were observed over a short period of 15 weeks, therefore excluding the possibility of coincidental age-related gains, that would typically occur during a normal developmental timeframe. Parent evaluations showed significant reduction in ASD symptoms, particularly in the 1.5&amp;amp;ndash;5 years group (p = 0.046). Conclusions: ELF-EMF treatment demonstrated a high safety profile and efficacy in mitigating ASD-related symptoms. The observed improvements suggest both direct effects on central and autonomic nervous systems and indirect effects through inflammatory response modulation. Further studies are needed to confirm these promising results through broader demographics and randomized control designs.</p>

	<p>Background: Cognitive impairment poses a significant global health challenge, emphasizing the critical need for early detection and intervention. Traditional diagnostics like neuroimaging and clinical evaluations are often subjective, costly, and inaccessible, especially in resource-poor settings. Previous research has focused on speech analysis primarily conducted using English data, leaving multilingual settings unexplored. Methods: In this study, we present our results from the INTERSPEECH 2024 TAUKADIAL Challenge, where we aimed to automatically detect mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and predict cognitive scores for English and Chinese speakers (169 in total). Our approach leverages Whisper, a speech foundation model, to extract language-agnostic speech embeddings. We then utilize ensemble models to incorporate task-specific information. Results: Our model achieved unweighted average recall of 81.83% in an MCI classification task, and root mean squared error of 1.196 in cognitive score prediction task, which placed the model at the second and the first position, respectively, in the ranking for each task. Comparison between language-agnostic and language-specific models reveals the importance of capturing language-specific nuances for accurate cognitive impairment prediction. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the effectiveness of language-specific ensemble modeling with Whisper embeddings in enabling scalable, non-invasive cognitive health assessments of Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease, achieving state-of-the-art results in multilingual settings.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Recent studies have investigated the effects of ketamine on fear memory in animals. However, it is unclear if ketamine might affect avoidance memory and emotional behaviors concomitantly. In this study, we compared the effects of (R,S)- and (S)-ketamine in modulating avoidance responses, depression- and anxiety-related behaviors in stressed mice. Methods: Mice were previously exposed to inescapable footshock stress, and 24 h later, they were trained in the active avoidance task. (R,S)-ketamine or (S)-isomer was administered 1 h prior to re-exposition to the active avoidance task. Three hours after drug administration, mice were tested in the tail suspension, followed by the open field test. Results: Neither form of ketamine affected avoidance memory retrieval, while (S)-ketamine, and tangentially, (R,S) reduced avoidance responses during re-exposition to aversive stimulus. In the tail suspension test, (R,S)- and (S)-ketamine equally evoked antidepressant effects. In the open field test, the racemic mixture, but not (S)-ketamine, induced anxiolytic actions. Conclusions: These findings reinforce the therapeutic potential of ketamine for the treatment of stress-related disorders, with (R,S)-ketamine being more effective in simultaneously inducing antidepressant and anxiolytic responses and reducing avoidance responses in stressed mice.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Parkinson's disease (PD) resting tremor is thought to be initiated in the basal ganglia and amplified in the cerebello-thalamo-cortical circuit. Because stress worsens tremor, the noradrenergic system may play a role in amplifying tremor. We tested if and how propranolol, a non-selective beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist, reduces PD tremor and whether or not this effect is specific to stressful conditions.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In a cross-over, double-blind intervention study, participants with PD resting tremor received propranolol (40 mg, single dose) or placebo (counter-balanced) on 2 different days. During both days, we assessed tremor severity (with accelerometry) and tremor-related brain activity (with functional magnetic resonance imaging), as well as heart rate and pupil diameter, while subjects performed a stressful cognitive load task that has been linked to the noradrenergic system. We tested for effects of drug (propranolol vs placebo) and stress (cognitive load vs rest) on tremor power and tremor-related brain activity.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We included 27 PD patients with prominent resting tremor. Tremor power significantly increased during cognitive load versus rest (<i>F</i>[1,19] = 13.8; <i>p</i> = 0.001; ηp2$$ {\upeta}_{\mathrm{p}}^2 $$ = 0.42) and decreased by propranolol versus placebo (<i>F</i>[1,19] = 6.4; <i>p</i> = 0.02; ηp2$$ {\upeta}_{\mathrm{p}}^2 $$ = 0.25), but there was no interaction. We observed task-related brain activity in a stress-sensitive cognitive control network and tremor power-related activity in the cerebello-thalamo-cortical circuit. Propranolol significantly reduced tremor-related activity in the motor cortex compared to placebo (<i>F</i>[1,21] = 5.3; <i>p</i> = 0.03; ηp2$$ {\upeta}_{\mathrm{p}}^2 $$ = 0.20), irrespective of cognitive load.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings indicate that propranolol has a general, context-independent, tremor-reducing effect that may be implemented at the level of the primary motor cortex. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>This article is my recollection of events surrounding the discovery of head direction (HD) cells by Jim Ranck in 1984 and the first journal publications 6 years later. Ranck first described the fundamental properties of HD cells qualitatively in a <i>Society for Neuroscience</i> abstract (1984) and in the proceedings to a conference. Ranck, however, was convinced by Bob Muller, a faculty colleague in the lab, to delay writing up Jim's discovery until they developed a two-spot video tracking system, which would enable proper quantitative analyses. The development of this system was complex and was still undergoing development when I arrived in the Brooklyn lab in 1986. By this time, Jim had begun to refocus his efforts on thinking about the relationship between space and manifolds and was no longer engaged in active research. It thus befell me (unintentionally) to complete the recordings of these fascinating cells. This endeavor involved recording additional HD cells with the new video tracking system, monitoring the cells' responses following a series of environmental manipulations, and performing quantitative analyses on the data. Throughout 1987, I recorded most of the cells that would form the basis for our 1990 papers published in the <i>Journal of Neuroscience</i>. Along the way, there were many events and emotions: luck, excitement, humor, frustration, tutorials, unintended outcomes, and long-lasting friendships. I was guided and supported during this time by both Bob Muller and John Kubie, but remain forever grateful to Jim for this wonderful opportunity.</p>

                Poluben et al. show that prostate cancer cell resistance to an androgen receptor (AR) antagonist targeting the full-length AR (ARfl) is driven by an AR spice variant (ARv7) that functions independently of ARfl but requires adaptations associated with increased chromatin accessibility and is dependent on nuclear factor I transcription factors.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Electroencephalogram (EEG) brain networks describe the driving and synchronous relationships among multiple brain regions and can be used to identify different emotional states. However, methods for extracting interpretable structural features from brain networks are still lacking. In the current study, a novel deep learning structure comprising both an attention mechanism and a domain adversarial strategy is proposed to extract discriminant and interpretable features from brain networks. Specifically, the attention mechanism enhances the contribution of crucial rhythms and subnetworks for emotion recognition, whereas the domain-adversarial module improves the generalization performance of our proposed model for cross-subject tasks. We validated the effectiveness of the proposed method for subject-independent emotion recognition tasks with the SJTU Emotion EEG Dataset (SEED) and the EEGs recorded in our laboratory. The experimental results showed that the proposed method can effectively improve the classification accuracy of different emotions compared with commonly used methods such as domain adversarial neural networks. On the basis of the extracted network features, we also revealed crucial rhythms and subnetwork structures for emotion processing, which are consistent with those found in previous studies. Our proposed method not only improves the classification performance of brain networks but also provides a novel tool for revealing emotion processing mechanisms.</span>

A cortical signature of EOAD was recently proposed and may facilitate EOAD investigation. Here, we aimed to validate this proposed MRI biomarker of EOAD neurodegeneration in an Appalachian clinical cohort. We also compared differences in EOAD signature atrophy in participants with biomarker-positive EOAD, LOAD, early-onset non-AD pathologies, and cognitively normal individuals. Cortical thinning was reliably detected in eight of nine signature areas of persons with EOAD relative to cognitively normal individuals despite very early disease stage. Additionally, individuals with EOAD showed thinner cortex in most signature regions relative to those with early-onset non-AD pathologies. EOAD and LOAD showed similar cortical atrophy within most EOAD signature regions. Whole-brain vertex-wise cortical analyses supported these findings. Furthermore, signature cortical atrophy showed expected relationships with measures of global and specific cognitive and functional status. This investigation further validates and expands upon the recently defined EOAD signature and suggests its robustness within a rural population, even at early disease stage. Larger scale and longitudinal studies employing this marker of EOAD neurodegeneration are needed to further understand clinical effects and appropriate management of persons with EOAD.</span>

	<p>Objectives: Growing evidence suggests a link between organophosphate insecticides and depression disorder. These chemicals are metabolized and subsequently expelled through the urinary tract. The present study aims to investigate whether dialkyl phosphate metabolites associate with depression score and severity among the general population. Methods: This cross-sectional study used data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Depression was evaluated by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). All urinary dialkyl phosphate metabolites were quantitatively analyzed. The survey&amp;amp;rsquo;s complex design parameters and sampling weights were considered. Results: 3035 eligible individuals were included. The estimated prevalence of mild and major depression was 18.3% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 16.9&amp;amp;ndash;19.7%) and 9.9% (95% CI: 8.7&amp;amp;ndash;11.0%). For each incremental unit in the level of urinary dimethyl phosphate (DMP), individuals were found to have a higher depression score of 0.77 and a significantly increased odds ratio (OR) of 1.13 (95% CI: 1.12&amp;amp;ndash;1.13) for mild depression and 2.75 (95% CI: 2.74&amp;amp;ndash;2.76) for major depression. Conclusions: Our findings indicate positive and independent associations between urinary dialkyl phosphate metabolites and an elevated risk of depression among the general population.</p>

	<p>Background: Emotions play a crucial role in people&amp;amp;rsquo;s lives, profoundly affecting their cognition, decision-making, and interpersonal communication. Emotion recognition based on brain signals has become a significant challenge in the fields of affective computing and human-computer interaction. Methods: Addressing the issue of inaccurate feature extraction and low accuracy of existing deep learning models in emotion recognition, this paper proposes a multi-channel automatic classification model for emotion EEG signals named DACB, which is based on dual attention mechanisms, convolutional neural networks, and bidirectional long short-term memory networks. DACB extracts features in both temporal and spatial dimensions, incorporating not only convolutional neural networks but also SE attention mechanism modules for learning the importance of different channel features, thereby enhancing the network&amp;amp;rsquo;s performance. DACB also introduces dot product attention mechanisms to learn the importance of spatial and temporal features, effectively improving the model&amp;amp;rsquo;s accuracy. Results: The accuracy of this method in single-shot validation tests on the SEED-IV and DREAMER (Valence-Arousal-Dominance three-classification) datasets is 99.96% and 87.52%, 90.06%, and 89.05%, respectively. In 10-fold cross-validation tests, the accuracy is 99.73% and 84.26%, 85.40%, and 85.02%, outperforming other models. Conclusions: This demonstrates that the DACB model achieves high accuracy in emotion classification tasks, demonstrating outstanding performance and generalization ability and providing new directions for future research in EEG signal recognition.</p>
