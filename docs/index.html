Recent analyses of MDGA–neuroligin complexes revealed the structural basis of this activity and indicate that MDGAs interact with all neuroligins with differential affinities. Surprisingly, analyses of mouse mutants revealed a functional divergence, with targeted mutation of <em>Mdga1</em> and <em>Mdga2</em> elevating inhibitory and excitatory synapses, respectively, on hippocampal pyramidal neurons. Further research is needed to determine the synapse-specific organizing properties of MDGAs in neural circuits, which may depend on relative levels and subcellular distributions of each MDGA, neuroligin and neurexin.

Abstract
<p>Large-scale slow oscillations allow the integration of neuronal activity across brain regions during sensory or cognitive processing. However, evidence that this form of coding also holds for pathological networks, such as for distributed networks in epileptic disorders, does not yet exist. Here, we show in a mouse model of unilateral hippocampal epilepsy that epileptic fast ripples generated in the neocortex distant from the primary focus occur during transient trains of interictal epileptic discharges. During these epileptic paroxysms, local phase-locking of neuronal firing and a phase–amplitude coupling of the epileptic discharges over a slow oscillation at 3–5 Hz are detected. Furthermore, the buildup of the slow oscillation begins in the bihippocampal network that includes the focus, which synchronizes and drives the activity across the large-scale epileptic network into the frontal cortex. This study provides the first functional description of the emergence of neocortical fast ripples in hippocampal epilepsy and shows that cross-frequency coupling might be a fundamental mechanism underlying the spreading of epileptic activity.</p>

Abstract
<p>Learning to read specializes a portion of the left mid-fusiform cortex for printed word recognition, the putative visual word form area (VWFA). This study examined whether a VWFA specialized for English is sufficiently malleable to support learning a perceptually atypical second writing system. The study utilized an artificial orthography, HouseFont, in which house images represent English phonemes. House images elicit category-biased activation in a spatially distinct brain region, the so-called parahippocampal place area (PPA). Using house images as letters made it possible to test whether the capacity for learning a second writing system involves neural territory that supports reading in the first writing system, or neural territory tuned for the visual features of the new orthography. Twelve human adults completed two weeks of training to establish basic HouseFont reading proficiency and underwent functional neuroimaging pre and post-training. Analysis of three functionally defined regions of interest (ROIs), the VWFA, and left and right PPA, found significant pre-training versus post-training increases in response to HouseFont words only in the VWFA. Analysis of the relationship between the behavioral and neural data found that activation changes from pre-training to post-training within the VWFA predicted HouseFont reading speed. These results demonstrate that learning a new orthography utilizes neural territory previously specialized by the acquisition of a native writing system. Further, they suggest VWFA engagement is driven by orthographic functionality and not the visual characteristics of graphemes, which informs the broader debate about the nature of category-specialized areas in visual association cortex.</p>

Abstract
<p>The membrane guanylate cyclase, ROS-GC, that synthesizes cyclic GMP for use as a second messenger for visual transduction in retinal rods and cones, is stimulated by bicarbonate. Bicarbonate acts directly on ROS-GC1, because it enhanced the enzymatic activity of a purified, recombinant fragment of bovine ROS-GC1 consisting solely of the core catalytic domain. Moreover, recombinant ROS-GC1 proved to be a true sensor of bicarbonate, rather than a sensor for CO<sub>2</sub>. Access to bicarbonate differed in rods and cones of larval salamander, <i>Ambystoma tigrinum</i>, of unknown sex. In rods, bicarbonate entered at the synapse and diffused to the outer segment, where it was removed by Cl<sup>-</sup>-dependent exchange. In contrast, cones generated bicarbonate internally from endogenous CO<sub>2</sub> or from exogenous CO<sub>2</sub> that was present in extracellular solutions of bicarbonate. Bicarbonate production from both sources of CO<sub>2</sub> was blocked by the carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, acetazolamide. Carbonic anhydrase II expression was verified immunohistochemically in cones but not in rods. In addition, cones acquired bicarbonate at their outer segments as well as at their inner segments. The multiple pathways for access in cones may support greater uptake of bicarbonate than in rods and buffer changes in its intracellular concentration.</p>

<p>Ferroptotic death is a mechanism for tumor suppression by pharmacological inhibitors that target the X<sub>c</sub>  <sup>–</sup> transporter (cystine/glutamate antiporter) in a host of non-CNS and CNS tumors. Inhibition of this transporter leads to reduction of cystine uptake, cyst(e)ine deprivation, subsequent depletion of the versatile antioxidant glutathione, and reactive lipid species-dependent death. Accordingly, pharmacological inhibitors of the X<sub>c</sub>  <sup>–</sup> transporter can also induce neuronal cell death raising concerns about toxicity in the CNS and PNS if these agents are used for chemotherapy. Here, we show that ferroptotic death induced by the canonical ferroptosis inducer erastin is similar in HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells and primary cortical neurons although cell death is mediated more potently in cancer cells. Reducing the toxicity of ferroptosis inducers will require, among other things, the identification of agents that protect neurons from ferroptosis but exacerbate it in tumor cells. Although we show that a number of agents known to block ferroptosis in primary mouse neurons also inhibit ferroptosis in fibrosarcoma cells, class I histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors selectively protect neurons while augmenting ferroptosis in cancer cells. Our results further suggest that cell death pathways induced by erastin in these two cell types are statistically identical to each other and identical to oxidative glutamate toxicity in neurons, where death is also mediated via inhibition of X<sub>c</sub><sup>–</sup> cystine transport. Together, these studies identify HDACs inhibitors as a novel class of agents to augment tumor suppression by ferroptosis induction and to minimize neuronal toxicity that could manifest as peripheral neuropathy or chemo brain.</p>

<p>Low-threshold mechanosensitive C fibers (C-LTMRs) that express the vesicular glutamate transporter VGLUT3 are thought to signal affective touch, and may also play a role in mechanical allodynia. However, the nature of the central termination of C-LTMRs in the dorsal horn remains largely unexplored. Here, we used light and electron microscopy in combination with VGLUT3 immunolabeling as a marker of C-LTMR terminations to investigate this issue. VGLUT3<sup>+</sup> C-LTMRs formed central terminals of Type II glomeruli in the inner part of lamina II of the dorsal horn, often establishing multiple asymmetric synapses with postsynaptic dendrites but also participating in synaptic configurations with presynaptic axons and dendrites. Unexpectedly, essentially all VGLUT3<sup>+</sup> C-LTMR terminals showed substantial VGLUT1 expression in the rat, whereas such terminals in mice lacked VGLUT1. Most VGLUT3<sup>+</sup> C-LTMR terminals exhibited weak-to-moderate VGLUT2 expression. Further, C-LTMR terminals formed numerous synapses with excitatory protein kinase C (PKC) interneurons and inhibitory parvalbumin neurons, whereas synapses with calretinin neurons were scarce. C-LTMR terminals rarely if ever established synapses with neurokinin 1 receptor (NK1R)-possessing dendrites traversing lamina II. Thus, VGLUT3<sup>+</sup> C-LTMR terminals appear to largely correspond to neurofilament-lacking central terminals of Type II glomeruli in inner lamina II and can thus be identified at the ultrastructural level by morphological criteria. The participation of C-LTMR terminals in Type II glomeruli involving diverse populations of interneuron indicates highly complex modes of integration of C-LTMR mediated signaling in the dorsal horn. Furthermore, differences in VGLUT1 expression indicate distinct species differences in synaptic physiology of C-LTMR terminals.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.05515">Influence of nicotine and alcohol on sleep and implications on insomnia: the reward-attention circuit model. (arXiv:1902.05515v1 [q-bio.NC])</a></h4>

<p>Dopamine, a neurotransmitter well known for regulating movement, reward, and
learning, is emerging as one of the neuromodulators of wakefulness. Drugs that
increase the level of dopamine in the brain (including, but not limited to,
nicotine) also increase feelings of wakefulness. Diseases that are
characterized by low dopamine levels, like Parkinson's disease, also are
related to sleep disorders.
</p>
<p>In this work we investigate the influence that nicotine and alcohol exert on
sleep, modeling the coupling of reward and thalamocortical circuits in a
reward-attention circuit. Computer simulations of the circuit reflect the
spiking behavior of neurons in the network under the presence or absence of
nicotine or alcohol.
</p>
<p>Each neuron in the reward-attention model represents a population of cells in
the circuit, and is described by a coupled system of nonlinear differential
equations that replicates essential neurophysiological properties of the
population. The computational simulations highlight aspects of clinical
insomnia symptoms in Parkinson's disease, attention deficit hyperactivity
disorder and autism spectrum disorder.
</p>
<p>Our results imply that nicotine can disrupt sleep, promoting wakefulness. In
contrast, alcohol increases sleep latency (time to fall asleep). Also, the
simulations suggest that alcohol has a sedative effect in people with insomnia.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/43284">Arabidopsis RCD1 coordinates chloroplast and mitochondrial functions through interaction with ANAC transcription factors</a></h4>

Reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent signaling pathways from chloroplasts and mitochondria merge at the nuclear protein RADICAL-INDUCED CELL DEATH1 (RCD1). RCD1 interacts <i>in vivo</i> and suppresses the activity of the transcription factors ANAC013 and ANAC017, which mediate a ROS-related retrograde signal originating from mitochondrial complex III. Inactivation of <i>RCD1</i> leads to increased expression of mitochondrial dysfunction stimulon (MDS) genes regulated by ANAC013 and ANAC017. Accumulating MDS gene products, including alternative oxidases (AOXs), affect redox status of the chloroplasts, leading to changes in chloroplast ROS processing and increased protection of photosynthetic apparatus. ROS alter the abundance, thiol redox state and oligomerization of the RCD1 protein <i>in vivo</i>, providing feedback control on its function. RCD1-dependent regulation is linked to chloroplast signaling by 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphate (PAP). Thus, RCD1 integrates organellar signaling from chloroplasts and mitochondria to establish transcriptional control over the metabolic processes in both organelles.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/41873">A Y-chromosome shredding gene drive for controlling pest vertebrate populations</a></h4>

Self-replicating gene drives that modify sex ratios or infer a fitness cost could be used to control populations of invasive alien species. The targeted deletion of Y sex chromosomes using CRISPR technology offers a new approach for sex bias that could be incorporated within gene-drive designs. We introduce a novel gene-drive strategy termed Y-CHromosome deletion using Orthogonal Programmable Endonucleases (Y-CHOPE), incorporating a programmable endonuclease that 'shreds' the Y chromosome, thereby converting XY males into fertile XO females. Firstly, we demonstrate that the CRISPR/Cas12a system can eliminate the Y chromosome in embryonic stem cells with high efficiency (<i>c</i>. 90 %). Next, using stochastic, individual-based models of a pest mouse population, we show that a Y-shredding drive that progressively depletes the pool of XY males could effect population eradication through mate limitation. Our molecular and modelling data suggest that a Y-CHOPE gene drive could be a viable tool for vertebrate pest control.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/41556">Combined transcriptome and proteome profiling reveals specific molecular brain signatures for sex, maturation and circalunar clock phase</a></h4>

Many marine animals, ranging from corals to fishes, synchronise reproduction to lunar cycles. In the annelid <i>Platynereis dumerilii,</i> this timing is orchestrated by an endogenous monthly (circalunar) clock entrained by moonlight. Whereas daily (circadian) clocks cause extensive transcriptomic and proteomic changes, the quality and quantity of regulations by circalunar clocks have remained largely elusive. By establishing a combined transcriptomic and proteomic profiling approach, we provide first systematic insight into the molecular changes in <i>Platynereis</i> heads between circalunar phases, and across sexual differentiation and maturation. Whereas maturation elicits large transcriptomic and proteomic changes, the circalunar clock exhibits only minor transcriptomic, but strong proteomic regulation. Our study provides a versatile extraction technique and comprehensive resources. It corroborates that circadian and circalunar clock effects are likely distinct and identifies key molecular brain signatures for reproduction, sex and circalunar clock phase. Examples include prepro-whitnin/proctolin and ependymin-related proteins as circalunar clock targets.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/38065">A multicellular rosette-mediated collective dendrite extension</a></h4>

Coordination of neurite morphogenesis with surrounding tissues is crucial to the establishment of neural circuits, but the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. We show that neurons in a <i>C. elegans </i>sensory organ, called the amphid, undergo a collective dendrite extension to form the sensory nerve. The amphid neurons first assemble into a multicellular rosette. The vertex of the rosette, which becomes the dendrite tips, is attached to the anteriorly migrating epidermis and carried to the sensory depression, extruding the dendrites away from the neuronal cell bodies. Multiple adhesion molecules including DYF-7, SAX-7, HMR-1 and DLG-1 function redundantly in rosette-to-epidermis attachment. PAR-6 is localized to the rosette vertex and dendrite tips, and promotes DYF-7 localization and dendrite extension. Our results suggest a collective mechanism of neurite extension that is distinct from the classical pioneer-follower model and highlight the role of mechanical cues from surrounding tissues in shaping neurites.

How sensory evidence is transformed across multiple brain regions to influence behavior remains poorly understood. We trained mice in a visual change detection task designed to separate the covert antecedents of choices from activity associated with their execution. Widefield calcium imaging across dorsal cortex revealed fundamentally different dynamics of activity underlying these processes. While signals related to execution of choice were widespread, fluctuations in sensory evidence in the absence of overt motor responses triggered a confined activity cascade, beginning with transient modulation of visual cortex, followed by sustained recruitment of secondary and primary motor cortex. The activation of motor cortex by sensory evidence was selectively gated by animals' expectation of when the stimulus was likely to change. These results identify distinct activation profiles of specific cortical areas during decision-making, and show that the recruitment of motor cortex depends on the interaction of sensory evidence and expectation.

Among animals with complex visual processing mechanisms, the leech Hirudo verbana is a rare example in which all neurons can be identified. However, little is known about its visual system, which is composed of several pigmented head eyes and photosensitive non-pigmented sensilla that are distributed across its entire body. Although several interneurons are known to respond to visual stimuli, their response properties are poorly understood. Among these, the S cell system is especially intriguing: It is multimodal, spans the entire body of the leech, and is thought to be involved in complex sensory integration. To improve our understanding of the role of this system, we tested its spectral sensitivity, spatial integration, and adaptation properties. The response of the S cell system to visual stimuli was found to be strongly dependent on the size of the area stimulated, and adaptation was local. Furthermore, a "bleaching experiment" demonstrated that at least two color channels contributed to the response, and that their contribution was dependent on the adaptation to the background. The existence of at least two color channels was further supported by transcriptomic evidence, which indicated the existence of at least two distinct groups of putative opsins for leeches. Taken together, our results show that the S cell system has highly sophisticated response properties, and could be involved in the processing of complex visual stimuli. We propose the leech as a novel system to understand visual processing mechanisms with many practical advantages.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/551879v1?rss=1">Noradrenergic responsiveness preserves selective attention across the adult life span</a></h4>

Selectively attending to relevant information while blocking out distractors is crucial for goal-directed behavior, yet with advancing age, deficits emerge in attentional selectivity. Decrements in attention have been associated with altered noradrenergic activity in animals. However, research linking noradrenergic functioning to attention in aging humans is scarce, likely reflecting long-standing methodological challenges in non-invasive assessments. We studied whether age-related differences in the noradrenergic system predict differences in attention. We measured pupil dilation, a non-invasive marker of phasic norepinephrine (NE) release, while concurrently recording the electroencephalogram (EEG), of younger (N=39; 25.2 +/- 3.2 years) and older adults (N=38; 70.6 +/- 2.7 years). NE release was triggered on a trial-by-trial basis using fear-conditioned (CS+) stimuli. During conditioning, pupil and EEG markers related to heightened NE activity were identified. Afterwards, in a dichotic listening task, participants were cued to direct attention to either the left or right ear while highly similar syllable pairs were presented simultaneously to both ears. During the dichotic listening task, presentation of fear-conditioned stimuli reinstated the acquired fear response, as reflected in pupil and EEG alpha-beta-band responses. Critically, pupil dilation to CS+ was correlated with stronger EEG alpha-beta desynchronization, suggesting a common dependence on NE release. On a behavioral level, NE release facilitated attention. In particular, structural equation modeling revealed that the responsiveness of the NE system is associated with attention on a latent construct level, measured by several indicator tasks. Overall, our results suggest that the responsiveness of the NE system supports attention across the life span.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/551853v1?rss=1">Drosophila carboxypeptidase D (SILVER) is a key enzyme in neuropeptide processing required to maintain locomotor activity levels and survival rate</a></h4>

Neuropeptides are processed from larger preproproteins by a dedicated set of enzymes. The molecular and biochemical mechanisms underlying preproprotein processing and the functional importance of processing enzymes are well characterised in mammals, but little studied outside this group. In contrast to mammals, Drosophila lacks a gene for carboxypeptidase E (CPE), a key enzyme for mammalian peptide processing. By combining peptidomics and neurogenetics, we addressed the role of Drosophila carboxypeptidase D (dCPD) in global neuropeptide processing and selected peptide-regulated behaviours. We found that a deficiency in dCPD results in C-terminally extended peptides across the peptidome, suggesting that dCPD took over CPE function in the fruit fly. dCPD is widely expressed throughout the nervous system, including peptidergic neurons in the mushroom body and neuroendocrine cells expressing adipokinetic hormone. Conditional hypomorphic mutation in the dCPD-encoding gene silver in the larva causes lethality, and leads to deficits in adult starvation-induced hyperactivity and appetitive gustatory preference, as well as to reduced survival rate and activity levels. A phylogenomic analysis suggests that loss of CPE is not a common insect feature, but specifically occured in Hymenoptera and Diptera. Our results show that dCPD is a key enzyme for neuropeptide processing in Drosophila, and is required for proper peptide-regulated behaviour. dCPD thus appears as a suitable target to genetically shut down total neuropeptide production in peptidergic neurons. Our results raise the question why Drosophila and other Diptera and Hymenoptera, unlike other insects, obviously have lost the gene for CPE but kept a gene encoding CPD.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/551812v1?rss=1">Network-wide abnormalities explain memory variability in hippocampal amnesia</a></h4>

Patients with hippocampal amnesia play a central role in memory neuroscience but the neural underpinnings of amnesia are hotly debated. We hypothesized that focal hippocampal damage is associated with changes across the extended hippocampal system and that these, rather than hippocampal atrophy per se, would explain variability in memory between patients. We assessed this hypothesis in a uniquely large cohort of patients (n=38) after autoimmune limbic encephalitis, a syndrome associated with focal structural hippocampal pathology. These patients showed impaired recall, recognition and maintenance of new information, and remote autobiographical amnesia. Besides hippocampal atrophy, we observed correlatively reduced thalamic volume, resting-state inter-hippocampal connectivity and activity in posteromedial cortex. Associations of hippocampal volume with recall, recognition, and remote memory were fully mediated by wider network abnormalities, and were only direct in forgetting. Such network abnormalities may explain the variability across studies of amnesia and speak to theoretical debates in memory neuroscience.

Prodromal positive psychotic symptoms and anxiety are two strong risk factors for schizophrenia in 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS). The analysis of large-scale brain network dynamics during rest is promising to investigate aberrant brain function and identify potentially more reliable biomarkers. We retrieved and examined dynamics of large-scale functional brain networks using innovation-driven co-activation patterns (iCAPs) and probed into functional signatures of prodromal psychotic symptoms and anxiety. Patients with 22q11DS had shorter activation in cognitive brain networks and longer activation in emotion processing networks. Functional signatures of prodromal psychotic symptoms confirmed an implication of cingulo-prefrontal salience network activation duration and coupling. Functional signatures of anxiety uncovered an implication of amygdala activation and coupling, indicating differential roles of dorsal and ventral sub-divisions of anterior cingulate and medial prefrontal cortices. These results confirm that the dynamic nature of brain network activation contains essential function to develop clinically relevant imaging markers of psychosis vulnerability.

Relational memory requires the hippocampus, but whether distinct hippocampal mechanisms along the anterior-posterior axis are required for different types of relations is debated. We investigated the contribution of structural changes in hippocampal head, body, and tail subregions to the capacity to remember item-space, item-time, and item-item relations. Memory for each relation and volumes of hippocampal subregions were assessed longitudinally in 171 participants across 3 time points (Mage at T1= 9.45 years; Mage at T2= 10.86 years, Mage at T3= 12.12 years; comprising 393 behavioral assessments and 362 structural scans). Among older children, volumetric growth in: (a) head and body predicted improvements in item-time memory, (b) head predicted improvements in item-item memory; and (c) right tail predicted improvements in item-space memory. The present research establishes that volumetric changes in hippocampal subregions differentially predict changes in different aspects of relational memory, underscoring a division of labor along the hippocampal anterior-posterior axis.

Microglia rapidly respond to changes in neural activity and inflammation to regulate synaptic connectivity. The extracellular signals, particularly neuron-derived molecules, that drive these microglial functions at synapses remains a key open question. Here, whisker lesioning, known to dampen cortical activity, induces microglia-mediated synapse elimination. We show that this synapse elimination is dependent on the microglial fractalkine receptor, CX3CR1, but not complement receptor 3, signaling. Further, mice deficient in the CX3CR1 ligand (CX3CL1) also have profound defects in synapse elimination. Single-cell RNAseq then revealed that Cx3cl1 is cortical neuron-derived and ADAM10, a metalloprotease that cleaves CX3CL1 into a secreted form, is upregulated specifically in layer IV neurons and microglia following whisker lesioning. Finally, inhibition of ADAM10 phenocopies Cx3cr1-/- and Cx3cl1-/- synapse elimination defects. Together, these results identify novel neuron-to-microglia signaling necessary for cortical synaptic remodeling and reveal context-dependent immune mechanisms are utilized to remodel synapses in the mammalian brain.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/551671v1?rss=1">Graph Signal Processing of Low and High-Order Dynamic Functional Connectivity Networks Using EEG Resting-State for Schizophrenia: A Whole Brain Breakdown</a></h4>

Conventional static or dynamic functional connectivity graph (FCG/DFCG) referred to as low-order FCG focusing on temporal correlation estimates of the resting-state electroencephalography (rs-EEG) time series between any potential pair of brain areas. A DFCG is first constructed from multichannel recordings by adopting the methodology of sliding-window and a proper functional connectivity estimator. However, low-order FC ignores the high-level inter-relationship of brain areas. Recently, a high-order version of FCG has emerged by estimating the correlations of the time series that describe the fluctuations of the functional strength of every pair of ROIs across experimental time. In the present study, a dynamic functional connectivity graph (DFCG) has been estimated using the imaginary part of phase lag value (iPLV). We analyzed DFCG profiles of electroencephalographic resting state (eyes-closed) recordings of healthy controls subjects (n=39) and subjects with symptoms of schizophrenia (n=45) in basic frequency bands {{delta},{theta},1,2,{beta}1,{beta}2,{gamma}}. In our analysis, we incorporated both intra and cross-frequency coupling modes. Adopting our recent Dominant Intrinsic Coupling Mode (DICM) model leads to the construction of an integrated DFCG (iDFCG) that encapsulates both the functional strength but also the DICM of every pair of brain areas. Based on the LO - IDFCG, we constructed the HO- IDFCG by adopting the cosine similarity between the time-series derived from the LO-DIFCG. At a second level, we estimated the laplacian transformations of both LO and HO-IDFCG and by calculating the temporal evolution of Synchronizability (Syn), four network metric time series (NMTSSyn) were produced. Following, a machine learning approach based on multi-kernel SVM with the four NMTSSyn used as potential features and appropriate kernels, we succeeded a superior classification accuracy (~98%). DICM and flexibility index (FI) achieved a classification with absolute performance (100%) Schizophrenic subjects demonstrated a hypo-synchronization compared to healthy control group which can be interpreted as a low global synchronization of co-fluctuate functional patterns. Our analytic pathway could be helpful both for the design of reliable biomarkers and also for evaluating non-intervention treatments tailored to schizophrenia. EEG offers a low-cost environment for applied neuroscience and the transfer of research knowledge from neuroimaging labs to daily clinical practice.

Deep regions of the brain are not easily accessible to investigation at the mesoscale level in awake animals or humans. We have recently developed functional Ultrasound (fUS) imaging fUS imaging technique to uncover deep hemodynamic functional responses. Applying fUS imaging on two awake non-human primates performing a passive fixation task, we reconstructed their retinotopic maps down to the deep calcarine and lunate sulci on visual areas (V1, V2 and V3). These maps were acquired in a single hour session with very few stimuli presentation. The spatial resolution of the technology is illustrated by mapping of Ocular Dominance (OD) columns within superficial and deep layers of the primary visual cortex. These acquisitions showed that OD selectivity is mostly present in layer IV but with evidence also in layers II/III and V. The fUS imaging technology therefore provides a new mesoscale approach to map brain activities at high spatiotemporal resolution in awake subjects within the whole depth of the cortex.

Objective - Measurement of the cortical tracking of continuous natural speech from electroencephalography (EEG) recordings using a forward model is becoming an important tool in auditory neuroscience. However, it requires a manual channel selection based on visual inspection or prior knowledge to obtain a summary measure of cortical tracking. In this study, we present a method to on the one hand remove non-stimulus-related activity from the EEG signals to be predicted, and on the other hand automatically select the channels of interest. We also aim to show that the EEG prediction from phonology-related speech features is possible in Dutch. Approach - Eighteen participants listened to a Flemish story, while their EEG was recorded. Subject-specific and grand-average temporal responses functions were determined between the EEG activity in different frequency bands and several stimulus features: the envelope, spectrogram, phonemes, phonetic features or a combination. The temporal response functions were then used to predict EEG from the stimulus, and the predicted was compared with the recorded EEG, yielding a measure of cortical tracking of stimulus features. A spatial filter was calculated based on the generalized eigenvalue decomposition (GEVD), and the effect on EEG prediction accuracy was determined. Main results - A model including both low- and high-level speech representations was able to better predict the brain responses to the speech than a model only including low-level features. The inclusion of a GEVD-based spatial filter in the model increased the prediction accuracy of cortical responses to each speech feature at both single-subject (270% improvement) and group-level (310 %). Significance - We showed that the inclusion of acoustical and phonetic speech information and the addition of a data-driven spatial filter allow improved modelling of the relationship between the speech and its brain response and offer an automatic channel selection.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/550947v1?rss=1">BDNF controls bidirectional endocannabinoid-plasticity at corticostriatal synapses</a></h4>

The dorsal striatum exhibits bidirectional corticostriatal synaptic plasticity, NMDAR- and endocannabinoids-(eCB)-mediated, necessary for the encoding of procedural learning. Therefore, characterizing factors controlling corticostriatal plasticity is of crucial importance. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its receptor, the tropomyosine receptor kinase-B (TrkB), shape striatal functions and their dysfunction deeply affect basal ganglia. BDNF/TrkB signaling controls NMDAR-plasticity in various brain structures including striatum. However, despite cross-talks between BDNF and eCBs, the role of BDNF in eCB-plasticity remains unknown. Here, we show that BDNF/TrkB signaling promotes eCB-plasticity (LTD and LTP) induced by rate-based (low-frequency stimulation) or spike-timing-based (spike-timing-dependent plasticity, STDP) paradigm in striatum. We show that TrkB activation is required for the expression and the scaling of both eCB-LTD and eCB-LTP. Using two-photon imaging of the dendritic spines combined with patch-clamp recordings, we show that TrkB activation induces an intracellular calcium boost, thus increasing eCB synthesis and release. We provide a mathematical model for the dynamics of the signaling pathways involved in corticostriatal plasticity. Finally, we show that TrkB activation allows an enlargement of the domain of expression of eCB-STDP. Our results reveal a novel role for BDNF/TrkB signaling in governing eCB-plasticity expression in striatum, and thus the engram of procedural learning.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/550913v1?rss=1">Mutant huntingtin protein alters the response of microglial cells to inflammatory stimuli</a></h4>

Huntington's disease (HD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects the striatum and cerebral cortex. It is caused by a dominant CAG trinucleotide expansion in exon 1 of the HTT gene. Mutant huntingtin protein (mHtt) is expressed in neurons and immune cells. HD patients demonstrate altered blood cytokine profiles and altered responses of peripheral immune cells to inflammatory stimuli. However, the effects of mHtt on microglial immune responses are not fully understood. Herein we discuss the current understanding of how mHtt alters microglial inflammatory responses. Using lentivirus, we expressed the N171 N-terminal fragment of wild-type or mhtt containing 18 and 82 glutamine repeats in cultured EOC-20 microglial cells. We then measured responses to lipopolysaccharide or interleukin-6. Mutant huntingtin-expressing microglial cells produced less interleukin-6 and nitric oxide in response to lipopolysaccharide stimulation than wild-type huntingtin-expressing cells. However, mHtt-expressing microglia stimulated with interleukin-6 produced more nitric oxide than wild-type cells. Mutant huntingtin-expressing cells had higher basal NF-{kappa}B and further elevations of NF-{kappa}B after interleukin-6 but not lipopolysaccharide stimulation. Thus we demonstrate the potential of mHtt to dampen responses to lipopolysaccharide but potentiate responses to interleukin-6. This work adds to the emerging understanding that mHtt alters not only baseline status of cells but may also result in altered immune responses dependent on the nature of the inflammatory stimuli. We also present our perspective that in human HD the extent of inflammation may depend, in part, on altered responses to varied inflammatory stimuli including environmental factors such as infection.

Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by a dominant CAG-repeat expansion in the huntingtin gene. Morphologic activation of microglia is a key marker of neuroinflammation that is present before clinical onset in HD patients. The kynurenine pathway of tryptophan degradation is restricted in part to microglia and is activated in HD, where it contributes to disease progression. Indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) is a microglial enzyme that catalyzes the first step in this pathway. HD brain microglial cells also accumulate iron; however, the role of iron in promoting microglial activation and the kynurenine pathway is unclear. Based on analyses of morphological characteristics of microglia, we showed that HD mice demonstrate an activated microglial morphology compared with controls. Neonatal iron supplementation resulted in additional microglial morphology changes compared with HD controls. Increased microglial activation in iron-supplemented HD mice was indicated by increased soma volume and decreased process length. In our assessment of whether iron can affect the kynurenine pathway, iron directly enhanced the activity of human recombinant IDO1 with an EC50 of 1.24 nM. We also detected elevated microglial cytoplasmic labile iron in N171-82Q HD mice, an increase that is consistent with the cellular location of IDO. We further demonstrated that neonatal iron supplementation, a model for studying the role of iron in neurodegeneration, activates IDO directly in the mouse brain and promotes neurodegeneration in HD mice. Kynurenine pathway metabolites were also modified in HD and by iron supplementation in wild- type mice. These findings indicate that iron dysregulation contributes to the activation of microglia and the kynurenine pathway in a mouse model of HD.

Selective spatial attention, the ability to dynamically prioritize the most important spatial location, is essential for adaptive behavior. It has been studied primarily in head-fixed animals, and almost exclusively in primates. Here, we report the development of two human-inspired, discrimination-based behavioral paradigms for studying selective visuospatial attention in the freely behaving mouse: the spatial probability task, and the flanker task. In the spatial probability task, we found enhanced response accuracy, perceptual discriminability, and rates of sensory evidence accumulation at the location with higher probability of target occurrence, and opposite effects at the lower probability location. In the absence of systematic differences in sensory input, motor biases, and trial structure, these results demonstrated endogenous expectation-driven shifts of spatial attention. In the flanker task, we found that a second, "flanker" stimulus presented with the target, but with incongruent information, caused switch-like decrements in response accuracy and perceptual discriminability as a function of flanker contrast, as well as a reduced rate of evidence accumulation. These results demonstrated exogenous capture of spatial attention. The innovation of behavioral tasks for selective visuospatial attention in unrestrained mice opens up a rich avenue for future research dissecting the neural circuit mechanisms underlying this critical executive function.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/550731v1?rss=1">Retrieval Practice Facilitates Judgments of Learning Through Multiple Mechanisms</a></h4>

Prior studies have shown that predictions of subsequent performance (i.e., Judgments of Learning, JoLs) following practice tests are more accurate than those following re-study. The majority of studies have suggested that retrieval practice allows people to base their predictions on the current retrieval outcomes so that they assign a higher likelihood of remembering the answers with high confidence. We speculated that other information made available through retrieval practice might also be important for JoLs. In the present study, we asked participants to study word pairs and undergo either a practice test or re-study. Two testing formats (cued-recall and multiple choice) were administrated for practice tests in two separate experiments. After each practice trial, participants rated their confidence in the current retrieval accuracy (test) or confidence in acquisition (re-study), followed by a JoL rating where participants predicted their performance in the final test one day later. The results of both experiments showed that the correlation between JoL ratings and the final accuracy was higher for trials practiced with testing. Moreover, using mediation analyses, we found that this high correspondence was only partially mediated by participants' confidence in practice tests. More importantly, the reaction time of retrieval also significantly mediated the correspondence between JoLs and the final accuracy, suggesting that participants were able to correctly base their JoLs on multiple sources of information that is made available through retrieval practice. We conclude that practice testing benefits JoLs through multiple mechanisms.

Toxoplasma gondii causes a prevalent neuroinvasive protozoal pathogen that in immune competent individuals results in latent infection characterized by intra-cellular parasite cysts in brain. Despite life-long infection, the role of latent toxoplasmosis on chronic neurodegenerative processes is poorly understood. Huntingtons disease (HD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder caused by a dominant CAG repeat expansion in the huntingtin gene (HTT) that results in the expression and accumulation of mutant huntingtin protein (mHTT). The mutant HD gene is fully penetrant. However, there is significant variability in disease progression that is in part explained by as yet unidentified environmental factors. The kynurenine pathway of tryptophan metabolism (KP) is an inflammatory pathway and its activation is implicated in HD pathogenesis. KP upregulation also occurs in response to infection with Toxoplasma gondii suggesting that the latent infection may promote HD. We discovered that mice on the FVB/NJ background develop latent toxoplasmosis following infection with the ME49 strain of T. gondii. This finding enabled us to address the hypothesis that latent toxoplasmosis potentiates disease in the YAC128 mouse model of HD, as these mice are maintained on the FVB/NJ background. Wild-type and HD mice were infected at 2-months of age. During the 10-month follow-up, infection had adverse effects on mice of both genotypes. However, YAC128 HD mice demonstrated specific vulnerability to latent toxoplasmosis, as demonstrated by the presence of increased striatal degeneration, high levels of the blood neurodegeneration marker neurofilament light protein, and elevated brain soluble mHTT. Our studies have uncovered a novel HD-infection interaction in mice that provides insights into the large variability of the human HD phenotype.

Purpose: Quantitative MRI applications, such as mapping the T1 time of tissue, puts high demands on the accuracy and precision of transmit field (B1+) estimation. A candidate approach to satisfy these requirements exploits the difference in phase induced by the Bloch-Siegert Shift (BSS) of two acquisitions with opposite off-resonance frequency RF pulses. Interleaving these RF pulses ensures robustness to motion and scanner drifts, however, here we demonstrate that doing so also introduces a bias in the B1+ estimates. Methods: We show via simulation and experiments that the amplitude of the error depends on MR pulse sequence parameters, such as TR and RF spoiling increment, but more problematically, on the intrinsic properties, T1 and T2, of the investigated tissue. To solve these problems, we present a new approach to BSS-based B1+ estimation that uses a multi-echo acquisition and a general linear model (GLM) to estimate the correct BSS-induced phase. Results: In line with simulations, phantom and in-vivo experiments confirmed that the GLM-based method removed the dependency on tissue properties and pulse sequence settings. It also showed greater robustness to hardware imperfections. Conclusion: The GLM-based method is recommended as a more accurate approach to BSS-based B1+ mapping.

Advanced paternal age has deleterious effects on mental health of next generation. Using a mouse model, we have confirmed that offspring derived from aged fathers showed impairments in behavior and abnormalities in the brain structure and activity. Comprehensive target DNA methylome analyses revealed in aged sperm more hypo-methylated genomic regions, in which REST/NRSF binding motif was enriched. Gene set enrichment analyses also identified enrichment of "REST/NRSF target genes", in addition to "Late-fetal genes" and autism spectrum disorder-related "SFARI genes", in up-regulated genes of developing brains from aged father. Indeed, gene sets near hypo-methylated genomic regions with REST/NRSF binding motif were also enriched in up-regulated genes of developing brains. Taken altogether, DNA hypo-methylation due to paternal aging in sperm will induce leaky expression of REST/NRSF target genes in the developing brain, thereby causing neuronal abnormalities and subsequent behavioral alteration in offspring.

<p>by Brandon Monier, Adam McDermaid, Cankun Wang, Jing Zhao, Allison Miller, Anne Fennell, Qin Ma</p>

Next-Generation Sequencing has made available substantial amounts of large-scale Omics data, providing unprecedented opportunities to understand complex biological systems. Specifically, the value of RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) data has been confirmed in inferring how gene regulatory systems will respond under various conditions (bulk data) or cell types (single-cell data). RNA-Seq can generate genome-scale gene expression profiles that can be further analyzed using correlation analysis, co-expression analysis, clustering, differential gene expression (DGE), among many other studies. While these analyses can provide invaluable information related to gene expression, integration and interpretation of the results can prove challenging. Here we present a tool called IRIS-EDA, which is a Shiny web server for expression data analysis. It provides a straightforward and user-friendly platform for performing numerous computational analyses on user-provided RNA-Seq or Single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) data. Specifically, three commonly used R packages (edgeR, DESeq2, and limma) are implemented in the DGE analysis with seven unique experimental design functionalities, including a user-specified design matrix option. Seven discovery-driven methods and tools (correlation analysis, heatmap, clustering, biclustering, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Multidimensional Scaling (MDS), and t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)) are provided for gene expression exploration which is useful for designing experimental hypotheses and determining key factors for comprehensive DGE analysis. Furthermore, this platform integrates seven visualization tools in a highly interactive manner, for improved interpretation of the analyses.

<p>by Giuseppe Passucci, Megan E. Brasch, James H. Henderson, Vasily Zaburdaev, M. Lisa Manning</p>

We seek to characterize the motility of mouse fibroblasts on 2D substrates. Utilizing automated tracking techniques, we find that cell trajectories are super-diffusive, where displacements scale faster than <i>t</i><sup>1/2</sup> in all directions. Two mechanisms have been proposed to explain such statistics in other cell types: run and tumble behavior with Lévy-distributed run times, and ensembles of cells with heterogeneous speed and rotational noise. We develop an automated toolkit that directly compares cell trajectories to the predictions of each model and demonstrate that ensemble-averaged quantities such as the mean-squared displacements and velocity autocorrelation functions are equally well-fit by either model. However, neither model correctly captures the short-timescale behavior quantified by the displacement probability distribution or the turning angle distribution. We develop a hybrid model that includes both run and tumble behavior and heterogeneous noise during the runs, which correctly matches the short-timescale behaviors and indicates that the run times are not Lévy distributed. The analysis tools developed here should be broadly useful for distinguishing between mechanisms for superdiffusivity in other cells types and environments.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/KIPDgR1gWNs" width="1" />

The dynamic nature of technological developments invites us to rethink the learning spaces. In this context, science education can be enriched by the contribution of new computational resources, making the educational process more up-to-date, challenging, and attractive. Bioinformatics is a key interdisciplinary field, contributing to the understanding of biological processes that is often underrated in secondary schools. As a useful resource in learning activities, bioinformatics could help in engaging students to integrate multiple fields of knowledge (logical-mathematical, biological, computational, etc.) and generate an enriched and long-lasting learning environment. Here, we report our recent project in which high school students learned basic concepts of programming applied to solving biological problems. The students were taught the Python syntax, and they coded simple tools to answer biological questions using resources at hand. Notably, these were built mostly on the students’ own smartphones, which proved to be capable, readily available, and relevant complementary tools for teaching. This project resulted in an empowering and inclusive experience that challenged differences in social background and technological accessibility.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/DU--q7uExMA" width="1" />

In this review, we summarize progress on the understanding of the dopamine release apparatus and evaluate how its properties may shape dopamine signaling during firing. We discuss how mechanisms of regulation may act through this machinery and propose that striatal architecture for dopamine signaling may have evolved to support rapid dopamine coding.</p></div>

Abstract
<p>Estradiol potentiates behavioral sensitization to cocaine as well as self-administration of cocaine and other drugs of abuse in female rodents. Furthermore, stimulated dopamine (DA) in the dorsolateral striatum (DLS) is rapidly enhanced by estradiol, and it is hypothesized that this enhanced DA release mediates the more rapid escalation of drug taking seen in females, compared with males. The mechanisms mediating the effect of estradiol to enhance stimulated DA release were investigated in this study. Using <i>in vivo</i> microdialysis and high performance liquid chromatography coupled with electrochemical detection, we first examined the effect of estradiol on amphetamine-induced DA increase in the DLS of ovariectomized rats. We then tested whether the potentiation of this DA increase could be blocked by the estradiol receptor antagonist, ICI 182,780 (ICI), or an antagonist to the metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 5 (mGlu5), 2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)pyridine (MPEP). There is evidence that estradiol receptors collaborate with mGlu5 within caveoli in DLS and mGlu5 is hypothesized to mediate many of the effects of estradiol in the addiction processes in females. Our data show that estradiol enhances the DA response to amphetamine. Either ICI or MPEP prevented the effect of estradiol to enhance DA release. Importantly, our results also showed that neither ICI or MPEP alone is able to influence the DA response to amphetamine when estradiol is not administrated, suggesting that ICI and MPEP act via estradiol receptors. Together, our findings demonstrate that estradiol potentiates amphetamine-stimulated DA release in the DLS and this effect requires both estradiol receptors and mGlu5.</p>

Abstract<p>Increased expression of the <i>FK506-binding protein 5</i> (<i>FKBP5)</i> gene has been associated with a number of diseases, but most prominently in connection to psychiatric illnesses. Many of these psychiatric disorders present with dementia and other cognitive deficits, but a direct connection between these issues and alterations in <i>FKBP5</i> remains unclear. We generated a novel transgenic mouse to selectively overexpress <i>FKBP5,</i> which encodes the FKBP51 protein, in the corticolimbic system, which had no overt effects on gross body weight, motor ability, or general anxiety. Instead, we found that overexpression of FKBP51 impaired long-term depression as well as spatial reversal learning and memory, suggesting a role in glutamate receptor regulation. Indeed, FKBP51 altered the association of heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) with AMPA receptors, which was accompanied by an accelerated rate of AMPA receptor. In this way, the chaperone system is critical in triage decisions for AMPA receptor trafficking. Imbalance in the chaperone system may manifest in impairments in both inhibitory learning and cognitive function. These findings uncover an unexpected and essential mechanism for learning and memory that is controlled by the psychiatric risk factor <i>FKBP5</i>.</p><p><b>Significance statement</b> Candidate studies have identified a link between <i>FKBP5</i> allelic variants and psychiatric disorders. Patients with these disorders often present with cognitive defects. <i>FKBP5</i> variants have been correlated to decreased hippocampal volume, but a direct connection between <i>FKBP5</i> and cognitive function has not been established. Here, we have found that mice with high levels of <i>FKBP5</i> have altered reversal learning and memory, which may be through direct regulation of neuronal activity by regulating AMPA receptors.</p>

<p>In recent years artificial neural networks achieved performance close to or
better than humans in several domains: tasks that were previously human
prerogatives, such as language processing, have witnessed remarkable
improvements in state of the art models. One advantage of this technological
boost is to facilitate comparison between different neural networks and human
performance, in order to deepen our understanding of human cognition. Here, we
investigate which neural network architecture (feed-forward vs. recurrent)
matches human behavior in artificial grammar learning, a crucial aspect of
language acquisition. Prior experimental studies proved that artificial
grammars can be learnt by human subjects after little exposure and often
without explicit knowledge of the underlying rules. We tested four grammars
with different complexity levels both in humans and in feedforward and
recurrent networks. Our results show that both architectures can 'learn' (via
error back-propagation) the grammars after the same number of training
sequences as humans do, but recurrent networks perform closer to humans than
feedforward ones, irrespective of the grammar complexity level. Moreover,
similar to visual processing, in which feedforward and recurrent architectures
have been related to unconscious and conscious processes, our results suggest
that explicit learning is best modeled by recurrent architectures, whereas
feedforward networks better capture the dynamics involved in implicit learning.

<p>Originally inspired by neurobiology, deep neural network models have become a
powerful tool of machine learning and artificial intelligence, where they are
used to approximate functions and dynamics by learning from examples. Here we
give a brief introduction to neural network models and deep learning for
biologists. We introduce feedforward and recurrent networks and explain the
expressive power of this modeling framework and the backpropagation algorithm
for setting the parameters. Finally, we consider how deep neural networks might
help us understand the brain's computations.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/44239">The structure of the Ctf19c/CCAN from budding yeast</a></h4>

Eukaryotic kinetochores connect spindle microtubules to chromosomal centromeres. A group of proteins called the Ctf19 complex (Ctf19c) in yeast and the constitutive centromere associated network (CCAN) in other organisms creates the foundation of a kinetochore. The Ctf19c/CCAN influences the timing of kinetochore assembly, sets its location by associating with a specialized nucleosome containing the histone H3 variant Cse4/CENP-A, and determines the organization of the microtubule attachment apparatus. We present here the structure of a reconstituted 13-subunit Ctf19c determined by cryo-electron microscopy at ~4 Å resolution. The structure accounts for known and inferred contacts with the Cse4 nucleosome and for an observed assembly hierarchy. We describe its implications for establishment of kinetochores and for their regulation by kinases throughout the cell cycle.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/41017">Negative reciprocity, not ordered assembly, underlies the interaction of Sox2 and Oct4 on DNA</a></h4>

The mode of interaction of transcription factors (TFs) on eukaryotic genomes remains a matter of debate. Single-molecule data in living cells for the TFs Sox2 and Oct4 were previously interpreted as evidence of ordered assembly on DNA. However, the quantity that was calculated does not determine binding order but, rather, energy expenditure away from thermodynamic equilibrium. Here, we undertake a rigorous biophysical analysis which leads to the concept of reciprocity. The single-molecule data imply that Sox2 and Oct4 exhibit negative reciprocity, with expression of Sox2 increasing Oct4’s genomic binding but expression of Oct4 decreasing Sox2’s binding. Models show that negative reciprocity can arise either from energy expenditure or from a mixture of positive and negative cooperativity at distinct genomic loci. Both possibilities imply unexpected complexity in how TFs interact on DNA, for which single-molecule methods provide novel detection capabilities.

Zhang et al. uncover the mystery of sub-quanta and quanta during vesicular release of multi-neurotransmitters. Catecholamine sub-quanta are jointly produced by fusion pores and the vesicular matrix, whereas the co-released ATP quanta are fully released during transient fusion events.

A well-established notion in cognitive neuroscience proposes that multiple brain systems contribute to choice behaviour. These include: (1) a model-free system that uses values cached from the outcome history of alternative actions, and (2) a model-based system that considers action outcomes and the transition structure of the environment. The widespread use of this distinction, across a range of applications, renders it important to index their distinct influences with high reliability. Here we consider the two-stage task, widely considered as a gold standard measure for the contribution of model-based and model-free systems to human choice. We tested the internal/temporal stability of measures from this task, including those estimated via an established computational model, as well as an extended model using drift-diffusion. Drift-diffusion modeling suggested that both choice in the first stage, and RTs in the second stage, are directly affected by a model-based/free trade-off parameter. Both parameter recovery and the stability of model-based estimates were poor but improved substantially when both choice and RT were used (compared to choice only), and when more trials (than conventionally used in research practice) were included in our analysis. The findings have implications for interpretation of past and future studies based on the use of the two-stage task, as well as for characterising the contribution of model-based processes to choice behaviour.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/86pzuygctls" width="1" />

<p>by Yangchun Frank Chen, Yu Xia</p>

An important goal of systems medicine is to study disease in the context of genetic and environmental perturbations to the human interactome network. For diseases with both genetic and infectious contributors, a key postulate is that similar perturbations of the human interactome by either disease mutations or pathogens can have similar disease consequences. This postulate has so far only been tested for a few viral species at the level of whole proteins. Here, we expand the scope of viral species examined, and test this postulate more rigorously at the higher resolution of protein domains. Focusing on diseases with both genetic and viral contributors, we found significant convergent perturbation of the human domain-resolved interactome by endogenous genetic mutations and exogenous viral proteins inducing similar disease phenotypes. Pan-cancer, pan-oncovirus analysis further revealed that domains of human oncoproteins either physically targeted or structurally mimicked by oncoviruses are enriched for cancer driver rather than passenger mutations, suggesting convergent targeting of cancer driver pathways by diverse oncoviruses. Our study provides a framework for high-resolution, network-based comparison of various disease factors, both genetic and environmental, in terms of their impacts on the human interactome.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/SPabstvBCoc" width="1" />

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p><i>LRRK2</i> mutations, the most common genetic cause of Parkinson's disease (PD) display incomplete penetrance, indicating the importance of other genetic and environmental influences on disease pathogenesis in <i>LRRK2</i> mutation carriers. The present study investigates whether urate, an antioxidant, Nrf2 activator, and inverse risk factor for idiopathic PD, is one such candidate biomarker of PD risk modulation in pathogenic <i>LRRK2</i> mutation carriers.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Banked plasma samples or urate levels were obtained for three cohorts of age‐ and sex‐matched subjects with and without a known <i>LRRK2</i> mutation in PD and unaffected controls to conduct a pilot study of 192 subjects from the LRRK2 Cohort Consortium (LCC) and two validation studies of 380 additional subjects from the LCC and of 922 subjects from the Parkinson Progression Marker Initiative. Urate levels were compared by multiple regression between subjects with and without a PD diagnosis conditional on <i>LRRK2</i> status, controlling for age and sex.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Non‐manifesting <i>LRRK2</i> mutation carriers had significantly higher levels of urate than those who developed PD in each of the three independent cohorts. A meta‐analysis demonstrated an adjusted mean difference of 0.62 mg/dL (p&lt;0.001), with similar results for separate assessments of women (p&lt;0.02) and men (p&lt;0.001). A 2 mg/dL increment in urate concentration decreased the odds of having PD by more than 50% (OR = 0.48; p = 0.004).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These findings identify and substantiate urate as a biomarker of resistance to PD among <i>LRRK2</i> mutation carriers.</p>

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>This study analyzed serum neurofilament light chains (NfL) in 2 European cohorts of 312 MS patients to investigate whether NfL are biomarkers of PML during natalizumab treatment. The cohort comprised 25 PML, 136 natalizumab‐treated, and 151 untreated MS patients. Patients subsequently developing PML had similar NfL to other natalizumab‐treated MS patients. At PML onset, NfL were 10‐fold higher than in the pre‐PML condition and in natalizumab‐treated or untreated MS patients, and NfL continued to increase until onset of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome. The results suggest that in natalizumab‐treated patients NfL may represent an early and accessible marker of PML.</p>

<p><b>Significance statement</b> Motor and reinforcement learning have been classically linked to functionally independent brain networks centered on the cerebellum and the basal ganglia respectively. In a recent study published in <i>eNeuro,</i> Therrien et al. (2018) showed that increasing motor noise in healthy subjects disrupts reinforcement learning. However, this impairment remained well below that detected in cerebellar patients even when motor noise in healthy subjects was adjusted to match that observed in the patients. This suggests that impaired reinforcement learning following cerebellar damage cannot be solely accounted for by altered motor noise in these patients. Based on recent anatomical and functional evidence, we argue that the cerebellum may directly contribute to reinforcement learning, consistent with its tight connections with the basal ganglia.</p>

Abstract<p>Parkinson’s disease (PD) is characterized by the gradual degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, leading to striatal dopamine depletion. A partial unilateral striatal 6-OHDA lesion causes 40 – 60% dopamine depletion in the lesioned rat striatum, modeling the early stage of PD. In this study, we explored the connectivity between the brain regions in partially 6-OHDA lesioned male Wistar rats under urethane anesthesia using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) at 5 weeks after the 6-OHDA infusion. Under urethane anesthesia, the brain fluctuates between the two states, resembling rapid-eye-movement (REM) and non-REM (NREM) sleep states. We observed clear urethane-induced sleep-like states in 8/19 lesioned animals and 8/18 control animals. 6-OHDA lesioned animals exhibited significantly lower functional connectivity between the brain regions. However, we observed these differences only during the REM-like sleep state, suggesting the involvement of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway in REM sleep regulation. Corticocortical and corticostriatal connections were decreased in both hemispheres, reflecting the global effect of the lesion. Overall, this study describes a promising model to study PD-related sleep disorders in rats using fMRI.</p><p><b>Significance statement</b> Disturbances in sleep patterns and rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder are among the first symptoms of Parkinson’s disease (PD). However, PD-related sleep disorders have been virtually unexplored in animal models. This is a first study which has examined the functional connectivity (FC) during urethane-induced sleep-like states in the partial striatal 6-OHDA lesion rat model of early-stage PD using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We found that FC is significantly decreased in 6-OHDA lesioned animals, but only during the REM-like state. These changes affected both the lesioned and intact hemispheres, mostly involving corticocortical and corticostriatal connections. The results suggest that this rat model is a promising tool for studying sleep disturbances in early-stage Parkinson’s disease with resting-state fMRI.</p>

<p>Individuals with sleep apnea often exhibit changes in cognitive behaviors consistent with alterations in the hippocampus. It is hypothesized that adult neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus is an ongoing process that maintains normal hippocampal function in many mammalian species, including humans. However, the impact of chronic intermittent hypoxia (IH), a principal consequence of sleep apnea, on hippocampal adult neurogenesis remains unclear. Using a murine model, we examined the impact of 30 d of IH (IH<sub>30</sub>) on adult neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity in the dentate gyrus. Although IH<sub>30</sub> did not affect paired-pulse facilitation, IH<sub>30</sub> suppressed long-term potentiation (LTP). Immunohistochemical experiments also indicate that IH perturbs multiple aspects of adult neurogenesis. IH<sub>30</sub> increased the number of proliferating Sox2<sup>+</sup> neural progenitor cells in the subgranular zone yet reduced the number of doublecortin-positive neurons. Consistent with these findings, cell lineage tracing revealed that IH<sub>30</sub> increased the proportion of radial glial cells in the subgranular zone, yet decreased the proportion of adult-born neurons in the dentate gyrus. While administration of a superoxide anion scavenger during IH did not prevent neural progenitor cell proliferation, it mitigated the IH-dependent suppression of LTP and prevented adult-born neuron loss. These data demonstrate that IH causes both reactive oxygen species-dependent and reactive oxygen species-independent effects on adult neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity in the dentate gyrus. Our findings identify cellular and neurophysiological changes in the hippocampus that may contribute to cognitive and behavioral deficits occurring in sleep apnea.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Individuals with sleep apnea experience periods of intermittent hypoxia (IH) that can negatively impact many aspects of brain function. Neurons are continually generated throughout adulthood to support hippocampal physiology and behavior. This study demonstrates that IH exposure attenuates hippocampal long-term potentiation and reduces adult neurogenesis. Antioxidant treatment mitigates these effects indicating that oxidative signaling caused by IH is a significant factor that impairs synaptic plasticity and reduces adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus.</p>

<p>The 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) is a recurrent copy number variant with high penetrance for developmental neuropsychiatric disorders. Study of individuals with 22q11DS therefore may offer key insights into neural mechanisms underlying such complex illnesses. Resting-state functional connectivity MRI studies in idiopathic schizophrenia have consistently revealed disruption of thalamic and hippocampal circuitry. Here, we sought to test whether this circuitry is similarly disrupted in the context of this genetic high-risk condition. To this end, resting-state functional connectivity patterns were assessed in a sample of human youth with 22q11DS (<i>n</i> = 42; 59.5% female) and demographically matched healthy controls (<i>n</i> = 39; 53.8% female). Neuroimaging data were acquired via single-band protocols and analyzed in line with methods provided by the Human Connectome Project. We computed functional relationships between individual-specific anatomically defined thalamic and hippocampal seeds and all gray matter voxels in the brain. Whole-brain Type I error protection was achieved through nonparametric permutation-based methods. The 22q11DS patients displayed dissociable disruptions in thalamic and hippocampal functional connectivity relative to control subjects. Thalamocortical coupling was increased in somatomotor regions and reduced across associative networks. The opposite effect was observed for the hippocampus in regards to somatomotor and associative network connectivity. The thalamic and hippocampal dysconnectivity observed in 22q11DS suggests that high genetic risk for psychiatric illness is linked with disruptions in large-scale corticosubcortical networks underlying higher-order cognitive functions. These effects highlight the translational importance of large-effect copy number variants for informing mechanisms underlying neural disruptions observed in idiopathic developmental neuropsychiatric disorders.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Investigation of neuroimaging biomarkers in highly penetrant genetic syndromes represents a more biologically tractable approach to identify neural circuit disruptions underlying developmental neuropsychiatric conditions. The 22q11.2 deletion syndrome confers particularly high risk for psychotic disorders and is thus an important translational model in which to investigate systems-level mechanisms implicated in idiopathic illness. Here, we show resting-state fMRI evidence of large-scale sensory and executive network disruptions in youth with 22q11DS. In particular, this study provides the first evidence that these networks are disrupted in a dissociable fashion with regard to the functional connectivity of the thalamus and hippocampus, suggesting circuit-level dysfunction.</p>

<p>Emotionally evocative messages can be an effective way to change behavior, but the neural pathways that translate messages into effects on individuals and populations are not fully understood. We used a human functional neuroimaging approach to ask how affect-, value-, and regulation-related brain systems interact to predict effects of graphic anti-smoking messages for individual smokers (both males and females) and within a population-level messaging campaign. Results indicated that increased activity in the amygdala, a region involved in affective reactivity, predicted both personal quit intentions and population-level information-seeking and this was mediated by activity in ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), a region involved in computing an integrative value signal. Further, the predictive value of these regions was moderated by expression of a meta-analytically defined brain pattern indexing emotion regulation. That is, amygdala and vmPFC activity strongly tracked with population behavior only when participants showed low recruitment of this brain pattern, which consists of regions involved in goal-driven regulation of affective responses. Overall, these findings suggest that affective and value-related brain responses can predict the success of persuasive messages and that neural mechanisms of emotion regulation can shape these responses, moderating the extent to which they track with population-level message impact.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> People and organizations often appeal to our emotions to persuade us, but how these appeals engage the brain to drive behavior is not fully understood. We present an fMRI-based model that integrates affect-, control-, and value-related brain responses to predict the impact of graphic anti-smoking stimuli within a small group of smokers and a larger-scale public messaging campaign. This model indicated that amygdala activity predicted the impact of the anti-smoking messages, but that this relationship was mediated by ventromedial prefrontal cortex and moderated by expression of a distributed brain pattern associated with regulating emotion. These results suggest that neural mechanisms of emotion regulation can shape the extent to which affect and value-related brain responses track with population behavioral effects.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/7/1275?rss=1">Upregulation of Anandamide Hydrolysis in the Basolateral Complex of Amygdala Reduces Fear Memory Expression and Indices of Stress and Anxiety</a></h4>

<p>Increased anandamide (AEA) signaling through inhibition of its catabolic enzyme fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) in the basolateral complex of amygdala (BLA) is thought to buffer against the effects of stress and reduces behavioral signs of anxiety and fear. However, examining the role of AEA signaling in stress, anxiety, and fear through pharmacological depletion has been challenging due to the redundant complexity of its biosynthesis and the lack of a pharmacological synthesis inhibitor. We developed a herpes simplex viral vector to rapidly yet transiently overexpress FAAH specifically within the BLA to assess the impact of suppressing AEA signaling on stress, fear, and anxiety in male rats. Surprisingly, FAAH overexpression in BLA dampened stress-induced corticosterone release, reduced anxiety-like behaviors, and decreased conditioned fear expression. Interestingly, depleting AEA signaling in the BLA did not prevent fear conditioning itself or fear reinstatement. These effects were specific to the overexpression of FAAH because they were reversed by intra-BLA administration of an FAAH inhibitor. Moreover, the fear-suppressive effects of FAAH overexpression were also mitigated by intra-BLA administration of a low dose of a GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor antagonist, but not an NMDA/AMPA/kainate receptor antagonist, suggesting that they were mediated by an increase in GABAergic neurotransmission. Our data suggest that a permissive AEA tone within the BLA might gate GABA release and that loss of this tone through elevated AEA hydrolysis increases inhibition in the BLA, which in turn reduces stress, anxiety, and fear. These data provide new insights on the mechanisms by which amygdalar endocannabinoid signaling regulates emotional behavior.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Amygdala endocannabinoid signaling is involved in the regulation of stress, anxiety, and fear. Our data indicate that viral-mediated augmentation of anandamide hydrolysis within the basolateral amygdala reduces behavioral indices of stress, anxiety, and conditioned fear expression. These same effects have been previously documented with inhibition of anandamide hydrolysis in the same brain region. Our results indicate that the ability of anandamide signaling to regulate emotional behavior is nonlinear and may involve actions at distinct neuronal populations, which could be influenced by the basal level of anandamide. Modulation of anandamide signaling is a current clinical therapeutic target for stress-related psychiatric illnesses, so these data underscore the importance of fully understanding the mechanisms by which anandamide signaling regulates amygdala-dependent changes in emotionality.</p>

<p>Expectations substantially influence pain perception, but the relationship between positive and negative expectations remains unclear. Recent evidence indicates that the integration between pain-related expectations and prediction errors is crucial for pain perception, which suggests that aversive prediction error-associated regions, such as the anterior insular cortex (aIC) and rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC), may play a pivotal role in expectation-induced pain modulation and help to delineate the relationship between positive and negative expectations. In a stimulus expectancy paradigm combining fMRI in healthy volunteers of both sexes, we found that, although positive and negative expectations respectively engaged the right aIC and right rACC to modulate pain, their associated activations and pain rating changes were significantly correlated. When positive and negative expectations modulated pain, the right aIC and rACC exhibited opposite coupling with periaqueductal gray (PAG) and the mismatch between actual and expected pain respectively modulated their coupling with PAG and thalamus across individuals. Participants' certainty about expectations predicted the extent of pain modulation, with positive expectations involving connectivity between aIC and hippocampus, a region regulating anxiety, and negative expectations engaging connectivity between rACC and lateral orbitofrontal cortex, a region reflecting outcome value and certainty. Interestingly, the strength of these certainty-related connectivities was also significantly associated between positive and negative expectations. These findings suggest that aversive prediction-error-related regions interact with pain-processing circuits to underlie stimulus expectancy effects on pain, with positive and negative expectations engaging dissociable but interrelated neural responses that are dependently regulated by individual certainty about expectations.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Positive and negative expectations substantially influence pain perception, but their relationship remains unclear. Using fMRI in a stimulus expectancy paradigm, we found that, although positive and negative expectations engaged separate brain regions encoding the mismatch between actual and expected pain and involved opposite functional connectivities with the descending pain modulatory system, they produced significantly correlated pain rating changes and brain activation. Moreover, participants' certainty about expectations predicted the magnitude of both types of pain modulation, with the underlying functional connectivities significantly correlated between positive and negative expectations. These findings advance current understanding about cognitive modulation of pain, suggesting that both types of pain modulation engage different aversive prediction error signals but are dependently regulated by individual certainty about expectations.</p>

<p>The costs associated with obtaining illicit drugs can fluctuate depending upon the relative drug availability. As a consequence of the changing costs, the effort that one must exert to obtain drugs is dynamic. Considerable evidence illustrates a critical role for dopamine in the ventral medial striatum in mediating drug reinforcement. However, little is known regarding how dopamine release is affected by changes in the costs associated with earning drugs. We used fast-scan cyclic voltammetry to determine how changes in the operant requirement affected dopamine release to self-administered cocaine in male rats. Dopamine release to cocaine infusions increased across trials during self-administration sessions using a fixed-ratio reinforcement schedule with a low operant requirement. However, increasing the operant requirement abolished the within-session elevation in dopamine release to drug rewards. This effect was not due to underlying changes in preinfusion dopamine levels and was not explained by cocaine levels in the brain. This within-session increase in dopamine release to cocaine infusions reemerged when the operant requirement was lowered. Under a progressive ratio reinforcement schedule, there was no increase in dopamine release to drug rewards across trials, which contrasts with prior studies demonstrating an increase in dopamine release to food rewards. Collectively, these findings illustrate that the influence of operant costs on reward-evoked dopamine release depends upon type of reward that can be earned (e.g., food or drug).</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The mesolimbic dopamine system is involved with mediating drug reinforcement. Although the costs associated with earning drugs are dynamic, no studies to date have examined how dopamine release to drug rewards is affected by changing costs. By performing fast-scan cyclic voltammetry recordings in rats self-administering cocaine, the present work demonstrates that changing the operant costs reversibly modulates the dopamine response to cocaine rewards. Furthermore, these findings highlight that the influence of costs on dopamine release to drug rewards differs from the established effect of costs on dopamine release to food rewards.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/7/1236?rss=1">Motor Cortex Excitability Reflects the Subjective Value of Reward and Mediates Its Effects on Incentive-Motivated Performance</a></h4>

<p>Performance-based incentives tend to increase an individual's motivation, resulting in enhancements in behavioral output. While much work has focused on understanding how the brain's reward circuitry influences incentive-motivated performance, fewer studies have investigated how such reward representations act on the motor system. Here we measured motor cortical excitability with transcranial magnetic stimulation while female and male human participants performed a motoric incentive motivation task for prospective monetary gains and losses. We found that individuals' performance increased for increasing prospective gains and losses. While motor cortical excitability appeared insensitive to prospective loss, temporal features of motor cortical excitability for prospective gains were modulated by an independent measure of an individual's subjective preferences for incentive (i.e., loss aversion). Those individuals that were more loss averse had a greater motor cortical sensitivity to prospective gain, closer to movement onset. Critically, behavioral sensitivity to incentive and motor cortical sensitivity to prospective gains were both predicted by loss aversion. Furthermore, causal modeling indicated that motor cortical sensitivity to incentive mediated the relationship between subjective preferences for incentive and behavioral sensitivity to incentive. Together, our findings suggest that motor cortical activity integrates information about the subjective value of reward to invigorate incentive-motivated performance.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Increasing incentives tend to increase motivation and effort. Using a motoric incentive motivation task and transcranial magnetic stimulation, we studied the motor cortical mechanisms responsible for incentive-motivated motor performance. We provide experimental evidence that motor cortical sensitivity to incentive mediates the relationship between subjective preferences for incentive and incentive-motivated performance. These results indicate that, rather than simply being a reflection of motor output, motor cortical physiology integrates information about reward value to motivate performance.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/7/1222?rss=1">Transient Knock-Down of Prefrontal DISC1 in Immune-Challenged Mice Causes Abnormal Long-Range Coupling and Cognitive Dysfunction throughout Development</a></h4>

<p>Compromised brain development has been hypothesized to account for mental illness. This concept was underpinned by the function of the molecule disrupted-in-schizophrenia 1 (DISC1), which represents an intracellular hub of developmental processes and has been related to cognitive dysfunction in psychiatric disorders. Mice with whole-brain DISC1 knock-down show impaired prefrontal–hippocampal function and cognitive abilities throughout development and at adulthood, especially when combined with early environmental stressors, such as maternal immune activation (MIA). However, the contribution of abnormal DISC1-driven maturation of either prefrontal cortex (PFC) or hippocampus (HP) to these deficits is still unknown. Here, we use <i>in utero</i> electroporation to restrict the DISC1 knock-down to prefrontal layer II/III pyramidal neurons during perinatal development and expose these mice to MIA as an environmental stressor (dual-hit G<sub>PFC</sub>E mice, both sexes). Combining <i>in vivo</i> electrophysiology and neuroanatomy with behavioral testing, we show that G<sub>PFC</sub>E mice at neonatal age have abnormal patterns of oscillatory activity and firing in PFC, but not HP. Abnormal firing rates in PFC of G<sub>PFC</sub>E mice relate to sparser dendritic arborization and lower spine density. Moreover, the long-range coupling within prefrontal–hippocampal networks is decreased at this age. The transient prefrontal DISC1 knock-down was sufficient to permanently perturb the prefrontal–hippocampal communication and caused poorer recognition memory performance at pre-juvenile age. Thus, developmental dysfunction of prefrontal circuitry causes long-lasting disturbances related to mental illness.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Hypofrontality is considered a main cause of cognitive deficits in mental disorders, yet the underlying mechanisms are still largely unknown. During development, long before the emergence of disease symptoms, the functional coupling within the prefrontal–hippocampal network, which is the core brain circuit involved in cognitive processing, is reduced. To assess to which extent impaired prefrontal development contributes to the early dysfunction, immune-challenged mice with transient DISC1 knock-down confined to PFC were investigated in their prefrontal–hippocampal communication throughout development by <i>in vivo</i> electrophysiology and behavioral testing. We show that perturbing developmental processes of prefrontal layer II/III pyramidal neurons is sufficient to diminish prefrontal–hippocampal coupling and decrease the cognitive performance throughout development.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/7/1206?rss=1">Experience-Dependent Intrinsic Plasticity During Auditory Learning</a></h4>

<p>Song learning in zebra finches (<i>Taeniopygia guttata</i>) requires exposure to the song of a tutor, resulting in an auditory memory. This memory is the foundation for later sensorimotor learning, resulting in the production of a copy of the tutor's song. The cortical premotor nucleus HVC (proper name) is necessary for auditory and sensorimotor learning as well as the eventual production of adult song. We recently discovered that the intrinsic physiology of HVC neurons changes across stages of song learning, but are those changes the result of learning or are they experience-independent developmental changes? To test the role of auditory experience in driving intrinsic changes, patch-clamp experiments were performed comparing HVC neurons in juvenile birds with varying amounts of tutor exposure. The intrinsic physiology of HVC neurons changed as a function of tutor exposure. Counterintuitively, tutor deprivation resulted in juvenile HVC neurons showing an adult-like phenotype not present in tutor-exposed juveniles. Biophysical models were developed to predict which ion channels were modulated by experience. The models indicate that tutor exposure transiently suppressed the <i>I</i><sub>h</sub> and T-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents in HVC neurons that target the basal ganglia, whereas tutor exposure increased the resting membrane potential and decreased the spike amplitude in HVC neurons that drive singing. Our findings suggest that intrinsic plasticity may be part of the mechanism for auditory learning in the HVC. More broadly, models of learning and memory should consider intrinsic plasticity as a possible mechanism by which the nervous system encodes the lasting effects of experience.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> It is well established that learning involves plasticity of the synapses between neurons. However, the activity of a neural circuit can also be dramatically altered by changes in the intrinsic properties (ion channels) of the component neurons. The present experiments show experience-dependent changes in the intrinsic physiology of neurons in the cortical premotor nucleus HVC (proper name) in juvenile zebra finches (<i>Taeniopygia guttata</i>) during auditory learning of a tutor's song. Tutor deprivation does not "arrest" development of intrinsic properties, but rather results in neurons with a premature adult-like physiological phenotype. It is possible that auditory learning involves a form of nonsynaptic plasticity and that experience-dependent suppression of specific ion channels may work in concert with synaptic plasticity to promote vocal learning.</p>

<p>In the primary auditory cortex (A1) of rats, refinement of excitatory input to layer (L)4 neurons contributes to the sharpening of their frequency selectivity during postnatal development. L4 neurons receive both feedforward thalamocortical and recurrent intracortical inputs, but how potential developmental changes of each component can account for the sharpening of excitatory input tuning remains unclear. By combining <i>in vivo</i> whole-cell recording and pharmacological silencing of cortical spiking in young rats of both sexes, we examined developmental changes at three hierarchical stages: output of auditory thalamic neurons, thalamocortical input and recurrent excitatory input to an A1 L4 neuron. In the thalamus, the tonotopic map matured with an expanded range of frequency representations, while the frequency tuning of output responses was unchanged. On the other hand, the tuning shape of both thalamocortical and intracortical excitatory inputs to a L4 neuron became sharpened. In particular, the intracortical input became better tuned than thalamocortical excitation. Moreover, the weight of intracortical excitation around the optimal frequency was selectively strengthened, resulting in a dominant role of intracortical excitation in defining the total excitatory input tuning. Our modeling work further demonstrates that the frequency-selective strengthening of local recurrent excitatory connections plays a major role in the refinement of excitatory input tuning of L4 neurons.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> During postnatal development, sensory cortex undergoes functional refinement, through which the size of sensory receptive field is reduced. In the rat primary auditory cortex, such refinement in layer (L)4 is mainly attributed to improved selectivity of excitatory input a L4 neuron receives. In this study, we further examined three stages along the hierarchical neural pathway where excitatory input refinement might occur. We found that developmental refinement takes place at both thalamocortical and intracortical circuit levels, but not at the thalamic output level. Together with modeling results, we revealed that the optimal-frequency-selective strengthening of intracortical excitation plays a dominant role in the refinement of excitatory input tuning.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/7/1182?rss=1">Behavioral Role of the Reciprocal Inhibition between a Pair of Mauthner Cells during Fast Escapes in Zebrafish</a></h4>

<p>During many behaviors in vertebrates, the CNS generates asymmetric activities between the left and right sides to produce asymmetric body movements. For asymmetrical activations of the CNS, reciprocal inhibition between the left and right sides is believed to play a key role. However, the complexity of the CNS makes it difficult to identify the reciprocal inhibition circuits at the level of individual cells and the contribution of each neuron to the asymmetric activity. Using larval zebrafish, we examined this issue by investigating reciprocal inhibition circuits between a pair of Mauthner (M) cells, giant reticulospinal neurons that trigger fast escapes. Previous studies have shown that a class of excitatory neurons, called cranial relay neurons, is involved in the reciprocal inhibition pathway between the M cells. Using transgenic fish, in which two of the cranial relay neurons (Ta1 and Ta2) expressed GFP, we showed that Ta1 and Ta2 constitute major parts of the pathway. In larvae in which Ta1/Ta2 were laser-ablated, the amplitude of the reciprocal IPSPs dropped to less than one-third. Calcium imaging and electrophysiological recording showed that the occurrence probability of bilateral M-cell activation upon sound/vibration stimuli was greatly increased in the Ta1/Ta2-ablated larvae. Behavioral experiments revealed that the Ta1/Ta2 ablation resulted in shallower body bends during sound/vibration-evoked escapes, which is consistent with the observation that increased occurrence of bilateral M-cell activation impaired escape performance. Our study revealed major components of the reciprocal inhibition circuits in the M cell system and the behavioral importance of the circuits.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Reciprocal inhibition between the left and right side of the CNS is considered imperative for producing asymmetric movements in animals. It has been difficult, however, to identify the circuits at the individual cell level and their role in behavior. Here, we address this problem by examining the reciprocal inhibition circuits of the hindbrain Mauthner (M) cell system in larval zebrafish. We determined that two paired interneurons play a critical role in the reciprocal inhibition between the paired M cells and that the reciprocal inhibition prevents bilateral firing of the M cells and is thus necessary for the full body bend during M cell-initiated escape. Further, we discussed the cooperation of multiple reciprocal inhibitions working in the hindbrain and spinal cord to ensure high-performance escapes.</p>

<p>Cerebellar granule cells (GrCs) constitute over half of all neurons in the vertebrate brain and are proposed to decorrelate convergent mossy fiber (MF) inputs in service of learning. Interneurons within the GrC layer, Golgi cells (GoCs), are the primary inhibitors of this vast population and therefore play a major role in influencing the computations performed within the layer. Despite this central function for GoCs, few studies have directly examined how GoCs integrate inputs from specific afferents, which vary in density to regulate GrC population activity. We used a variety of methods in mice of either sex to study feedforward inhibition recruited by identified MFs, focusing on features that would influence integration by GrCs. Comprehensive 3D reconstruction and quantification of GoC axonal boutons revealed tightly clustered boutons that focus feedforward inhibition in the neighborhood of GoC somata. Acute whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from GrCs in brain slices showed that, despite high GoC bouton density, fast phasic inhibition was very sparse relative to slow spillover mediated inhibition. Dynamic-clamp simulating inhibition combined with optogenetic MF activation at moderate rates supported a predominant role of slow spillover mediated inhibition in reducing GrC activity. Whole-cell recordings from GoCs revealed a role for the density of active MFs in preferentially driving them. Thus, our data provide empirical confirmation of predicted rules by which MFs activate GoCs to regulate GrC activity levels.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> A unifying framework in neural circuit analysis is identifying circuit motifs that subserve common computations. Wide-field inhibitory interneurons globally inhibit neighbors and have been studied extensively in the insect olfactory system and proposed to serve pattern separation functions. Cerebellar Golgi cells (GoCs), a type of mammalian wide-field inhibitory interneuron observed in the granule cell layer, are well suited to perform normalization or pattern separation functions, but the relationship between spatial characteristics of input patterns to GoC-mediated inhibition has received limited attention. This study provides unprecedented quantitative structural details of GoCs and identifies a role for population input activity levels in recruiting inhibition using <i>in vitro</i> electrophysiology and optogenetics.</p>

<p>The cornea has the densest sensory innervation of the body, originating primarily from neurons in the trigeminal ganglion. The basic principles of cornea nerve patterning have been established many years ago using classic neuroanatomical methods, such as immunocytochemistry and electrophysiology. Our understanding of the morphology and distribution of the sensory nerves in the skin has considerably progressed over the past few years through the generation and analysis of a variety of genetically modified mouse lines. Surprisingly, these lines were not used to study corneal axons. Here, we have screened a collection of transgenic and knockin mice (of both sexes) to select lines allowing the visualization and genetic manipulation of corneal nerves. We identified multiple lines, including some in which different types of corneal axons can be simultaneously observed with fluorescent proteins expressed in a combinatorial manner. We also provide the first description of the morphology and arborization of single corneal axons and identify three main types of branching pattern. We applied this genetic strategy to the analysis of corneal nerve development and plasticity. We provide direct evidence for a progressive reduction of the density of corneal innervation during aging. We also show that the semaphorin receptor neuropilin-1 acts cell-autonomously to control the development of corneal axons and that early axon guidance defects have long-term consequences on corneal innervation.</p>

<p>Clinical studies indicate that psychosocial stress contributes to adverse chronic pain outcomes in patients, but it is unclear how this is initiated or amplified by stress. Repeated social defeat (RSD) is a mouse model of psychosocial stress that activates microglia, increases neuroinflammatory signaling, and augments pain and anxiety-like behaviors. We hypothesized that activated microglia within the spinal cord facilitate increased pain sensitivity following RSD. Here we show that mechanical allodynia in male mice was increased with exposure to RSD. This stress-induced behavior corresponded with increased mRNA expression of several inflammatory genes, including IL-1β, TNF-α, CCL2, and TLR4 in the lumbar spinal cord. While there were several adhesion and chemokine-related genes increased in the lumbar spinal cord after RSD, there was no accumulation of monocytes or neutrophils. Notably, there was evidence of microglial activation selectively within the nociceptive neurocircuitry of the dorsal horn of the lumbar cord. Elimination of microglia using the colony stimulating factor 1 receptor antagonist PLX5622 from the brain and spinal cord prevented the development of mechanical allodynia in RSD-exposed mice. Microglial elimination also attenuated RSD-induced IL-1β, CCR2, and TLR4 mRNA expression in the lumbar spinal cord. Together, RSD-induced allodynia was associated with microglia-mediated inflammation within the dorsal horn of the lumbar spinal cord.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Mounting evidence indicates that psychological stress contributes to the onset and progression of adverse nociceptive conditions. We show here that repeated social defeat stress causes increased pain sensitivity due to inflammatory signaling within the nociceptive circuits of the spinal cord. Studies here mechanistically tested the role of microglia in the development of pain by stress. Pharmacological ablation of microglia prevented stress-induced pain sensitivity. These findings demonstrate that microglia are critical mediators in the induction of pain conditions by stress. Moreover, these studies provide a proof of principle that microglia can be targeted as a therapeutic strategy to mitigate adverse pain conditions.</p>

Abstract
<p>Stress causes divergent patterns of structural and physiological plasticity in the hippocampus versus amygdala. However, a majority of earlier studies focused primarily on neurons. Despite growing evidence for the importance of glia in health and disease, relatively little is known about how stress affects astrocytes. Further, previous work focused on hippocampal astrocytes. Hence, we examined the impact of chronic immobilization stress (2 h/d, 10 d), on the number and structure of astrocytes in the rat hippocampus and amygdala. We observed a reduction in the number of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive astrocytes in the basal amygdala (BA), 1 d after the end of 10 d of chronic stress. Detailed morphometric analysis of individual dye-filled astrocytes also revealed a decrease in the neuropil volume occupied by these astrocytes in the BA, alongside a reduction in the volume fraction of fine astrocytic protrusions rather than larger dendrite-like processes. By contrast, the same chronic stress had no effect on the number or morphology of astrocytes in hippocampal area CA3. We also confirmed previous reports that chronic stress triggers dendritic hypertrophy in dye-filled BA principal neurons that were located adjacent to astrocytes that had undergone atrophy. Thus, building on earlier evidence for contrasting patterns of stress-induced plasticity in neurons across brain areas, our findings offer new evidence that the same stress can also elicit divergent morphological effects in astrocytes in the hippocampus versus the amygdala.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/6/1/ENEURO.0198-18.2019?rss=1">A Cellular Mechanism Underlying Enhanced Capability for Complex Olfactory Discrimination Learning</a></h4>

Abstract
<p>The biological mechanisms underlying complex forms of learning requiring the understanding of rules based on previous experience are not yet known. Previous studies have raised the intriguing possibility that improvement in complex learning tasks requires the long-term modulation of intrinsic neuronal excitability, induced by reducing the conductance of the slow calcium-dependent potassium current (sI<sub>AHP</sub>) simultaneously in most neurons in the relevant neuronal networks in several key brain areas. Such sI<sub>AHP</sub> reduction is expressed in attenuation of the postburst afterhyperpolarization (AHP) potential, and thus in enhanced repetitive action potential firing. Using complex olfactory discrimination (OD) learning as a model for complex learning, we show that brief activation of the GluK2 subtype glutamate receptor results in long-lasting enhancement of neuronal excitability in neurons from controls, but not from trained rats. Such an effect can be obtained by a brief tetanic synaptic stimulation or by direct application of kainate, both of which reduce the postburst AHP in pyramidal neurons. Induction of long-lasting enhancement of neuronal excitability is mediated via a metabotropic process that requires PKC and ERK activation. Intrinsic neuronal excitability cannot be modulated by synaptic activation in neurons from GluK2 knock-out mice. Accordingly, these mice are incapable of learning the complex OD task. Moreover, viral-induced overexpression of Gluk2 in piriform cortex pyramidal neurons results in remarkable enhancement of complex OD learning. Thus, signaling via kainate receptors has a central functional role in higher cognitive abilities.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25435?af=R">A case‐control‐family study of idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder</a></h4>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>To determine the familial aggregation of idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (iRBD), neurodegenerative diseases, and related biomarkers.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A total of 404 and 387 first‐degree relatives of 102 patients with iRBD and 89 controls were recruited, respectively. Among them, 204 and 208 relatives of patients and controls underwent face‐to‐face clinical assessment, while 97 and 75 relatives underwent further video‐polysomnographic assessment, respectively.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Compared with relatives of controls, relatives of patients demonstrated higher levels of RBD features including chin tonic electromyography activity (mean: 1.5&amp;pm7.5 vs. 0.3&amp;pm1.0, p=0.04) and behavioral events (n [weighted %]: 12 [11.3] vs. 2 [1.9], adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]=7.69, 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.54‐33.33, p=0.009) during rapid eye movement sleep, probable diagnosis (n [%]: 57 [14.9] vs. 20 [4.9], aHR=3.45, 95% CI=1.96‐6.25, p &lt;0.001), and definite diagnosis (n [weighted %]: 10 [8.4] vs. 2 [1.4], aHR=5.56, 95% CI=1.16‐25.00, p=0.03). They also had higher risks of Parkinson's disease (3.1% vs 0.5%, aHR=5.88, 95% CI=1.37‐25.00, p=0.02), dementia (6.9% vs. 2.6%, aHR=2.44, 95% CI=1.15‐5.26, p=0.02), constipation (8.3% vs. 2.4%, adjusted odds ratio=4.21, 95% CI=1.34‐13.17, p=0.01), and motor dysfunction (MDS‐UPDRS part III motor score, mean: 1.9&amp;pm3.2 vs. 0.9&amp;pm2.3, p=0.002). The unaffected relatives of patients demonstrated a higher likelihood ratio of prodromal Parkinson's disease (median [interquartile range]: 0.27 [1.19] vs. 0.22 [0.51], p=0.03).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>iRBD is familial aggregated from isolated features to full‐blown sleep disorder. Relatives of patients carry a higher risk of alpha‐synucleinopathy in terms of neurodegenerative diseases and prodromal markers, suggesting a familial aggregation and staging pathology of alpha‐synucleinopathy.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25434?af=R">Blood pressure variability and hemorrhagic transformation in patients with successful recanalization after endovascular recanalization therapy: a retrospective observational study</a></h4>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Although BP variability has been regarded as a risk factor for hemorrhagic transformation (HTF) after intravenous thrombolysis, its effect on HTF after endovascular recanalization therapy (ERT) remains to be elucidated. We aimed to study the relationship between BP variability and symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH) after successful recanalization with ERT.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A total of 211 patients with acute ischemic stroke and successful recanalization (Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction 2b or 3) after ERT were included between January 2013 and May 2017. The BP data following ERT was obtained over the first 24 hours using parameters including mean, maximum, minimum, difference between maximum and minimum, standard deviation, coefficient of variation, successive variations, and time rate (TR) of BP variation for systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP). sICH was defined as parenchymal hemorrhage type 2 with neurological deterioration of 4 points of more on the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Among the included patients, 20 (9.5%) developed sICH after successful ERT. The parameters linked with BP fluctuation over time were significantly related to sICH. After adjusting for confounders, the TR of SBP (per 0.1 mmHg/min increase) variation was independently associated with sICH (odds ratio, 1.71; 95% confidence interval, 1.013–2.886).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Time‐related BP variability in the first 24 hours following successful ERT was more correlated with sICH than other absolute BP level. This suggests that maintaining a stable BP may be an important factor in preventing sICH after successful ERT.</p>

<p>According to the Integrated Information Theory of Consciousness,
consciousness is a fundamental observer-independent property of physical
systems, and the measure Phi of integrated information is identical to the
quantity or level of consciousness. For this to be plausible, there should be
no alternative formulae for Phi consistent with the axioms of IIT, and there
should not be cases of Phi being ill-defined. This article presents three ways
in which Phi, in its current formulation, fails to meet these standards, and
discusses how this problem might be addressed.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/43271">Macrophages restrict the nephrogenic field and promote endothelial connections during kidney development</a></h4>

The origins and functions of kidney macrophages in the adult have been explored, but their roles during development remain largely unknown. Here we characterise macrophage arrival, localisation, heterogeneity, and functions during kidney organogenesis. Using genetic approaches to ablate macrophages, we identify a role for macrophages in nephron progenitor cell clearance as mouse kidney development begins. Throughout renal organogenesis, most kidney macrophages are perivascular and express F4/80 and CD206. These macrophages are enriched for mRNAs linked to developmental processes, such as blood vessel morphogenesis. Using antibody-mediated macrophage-depletion, we show macrophages support vascular anastomoses in cultured kidney explants. We also characterise a subpopulation of galectin-3<sup>+</sup> (Gal3<sup>+</sup>) myeloid cells within the developing kidney. Our findings may stimulate research into macrophage-based therapies for renal developmental abnormalities and have implications for the generation of bioengineered kidney tissues.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/43158">Architectural principles for Hfq/Crc-mediated regulation of gene expression</a></h4>

In diverse bacterial species, the global regulator Hfq contributes to post-transcriptional networks that control expression of numerous genes. Hfq of the opportunistic pathogen <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> inhibits translation of target transcripts by forming a regulatory complex with the catabolite repression protein Crc. This repressive complex acts part of an intricate mechanism of preferred nutrient utilisation. We describe high-resolution cryo-EM structures of the assembly of Hfq and Crc bound to the translation initiation site of a target mRNA. The core of the assembly is formed through interactions of two cognate RNAs, two Hfq hexamers and a Crc pair. Additional Crc protomers are recruited to the core to generate higher-order assemblies with demonstrated regulatory activity <i>in vivo</i>. This study reveals how Hfq cooperates with a partner protein to regulate translation, and provides a structural basis for an RNA code that guides global regulators to interact cooperatively and regulate different RNA targets.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/42143">Dystroglycan is a scaffold for extracellular axon guidance decisions</a></h4>

Axon guidance requires interactions between extracellular signaling molecules and transmembrane receptors, but how appropriate context-dependent decisions are coordinated outside the cell remains unclear. Here we show that the transmembrane glycoprotein Dystroglycan interacts with a changing set of environmental cues that regulate the trajectories of extending axons throughout the mammalian brain and spinal cord. Dystroglycan operates primarily as an extracellular scaffold during axon guidance, as it functions non-cell autonomously and does not require signaling through its intracellular domain. We identify the transmembrane receptor Celsr3/Adgrc3 as a binding partner for Dystroglycan, and show that this interaction is critical for specific axon guidance events <i>in vivo</i>. These findings establish Dystroglycan as a multifunctional scaffold that coordinates extracellular matrix proteins, secreted cues, and transmembrane receptors to regulate axon guidance.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/40760">Mismatch repair-signature mutations activate gene enhancers across human colorectal cancer epigenomes</a></h4>

Commonly-mutated genes have been found for many cancers, but less is known about mutations in cis-regulatory elements. We leverage gains in tumor-specific enhancer activity, coupled with allele-biased mutation detection from H3K27ac ChIP-seq data, to pinpoint potential enhancer-activating mutations in colorectal cancer (CRC). Analysis of a genetically-diverse cohort of CRC specimens revealed that microsatellite instable (MSI) samples have a high indel rate within active enhancers. Enhancers with indels show evidence of positive selection, increased target gene expression, and a subset is highly recurrent. The indels affect short homopolymer tracts of A/T and increase affinity for FOX transcription factors. We further demonstrate that signature mismatch-repair (MMR) mutations activate enhancers using a xenograft tumor metastasis model, where mutations are induced naturally via CRISPR/Cas9 inactivation of <i>MLH1</i> prior to tumor cell injection. Our results suggest that MMR signature mutations activate enhancers in CRC tumor epigenomes to provide a selective advantage.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/40368">Quorums enable optimal pooling of independent judgements in biological systems</a></h4>

Collective decision-making is ubiquitous, and majority-voting and the Condorcet Jury Theorem pervade thinking about collective decision-making. Thus, it is typically assumed that majority-voting is the best possible decision mechanism, and that scenarios exist where individually-weak decision-makers should not pool information. Condorcet and its applications implicitly assume that only one kind of error can be made, yet signal detection theory shows two kinds of errors exist, ‘false positives’ and ‘false negatives’. We apply signal detection theory to collective decision-making to show that majority voting is frequently sub-optimal, and can be optimally replaced by quorum decision-making. While quorums have been proposed to resolve within-group conflicts, or manage speed-accuracy trade-offs, our analysis applies to groups with aligned interests undertaking single-shot decisions. Our results help explain the ubiquity of quorum decision-making in nature, relate the use of sub- and super-majority quorums to decision ecology, and may inform the design of artificial decision-making systems.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/38968">Microtubule plus-ends act as physical signaling hubs to activate RhoA during cytokinesis</a></h4>

Microtubules (MTs) are essential for cleavage furrow positioning during cytokinesis, but the mechanisms by which MT-derived signals spatially define regions of cortical contractility are unresolved. In this study cytokinesis regulators visualized in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> (<i>Dm</i>) cells were found to localize to and track MT plus-ends during cytokinesis. The RhoA GEF Pebble (<i>Dm </i>ECT2) did not evidently tip-track, but rather localized rapidly to cortical sites contacted by MT plus-tips, resulting in RhoA activation and enrichment of myosin-regulatory light chain. The MT plus-end localization of centralspindlin was compromised following EB1 depletion, which resulted in a higher incidence of cytokinesis failure. Centralspindlin plus-tip localization depended on the C-terminus and a putative EB1-interaction motif (hxxPTxh) in RacGAP50C. We propose that MT plus-end-associated centralspindlin recruits a cortical pool of <i>Dm </i>ECT2 upon physical contact to activate RhoA and to trigger localized contractility.

Farías et al. report that the localization of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in the axon is controlled by the interaction between ER-shaping proteins and the microtubule cytoskeleton. Local ER and microtubule crosstalk promotes ER tubule-microtubule stabilization and drives neuronal polarity.

Using cellular-resolution activity mapping and innovative population analyses, Minderer et al. show that navigation-related information is distributed and varies gradually across large parts of the posterior cortex, even across retinotopic boundaries. This suggests a distance-based principle for cortical encoding and multimodal integration.

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/NySPD1pQXwY/article">Maps of variability in cell lineage trees</a></h4>

<p>by Damien G. Hicks, Terence P. Speed, Mohammed Yassin, Sarah M. Russell</p>

New approaches to lineage tracking have allowed the study of differentiation in multicellular organisms over many generations of cells. Understanding the phenotypic variability observed in these lineage trees requires new statistical methods. Whereas an invariant cell lineage, such as that for the nematode <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>, can be described by a lineage map, defined as the pattern of phenotypes overlaid onto the binary tree, a traditional lineage map is static and does not describe the variability inherent in the cell lineages of higher organisms. Here, we introduce lineage variability maps which describe the pattern of second-order variation in lineage trees. These maps can be undirected graphs of the partial correlations between every lineal position, or directed graphs showing the dynamics of bifurcated patterns in each subtree. We show how to infer these graphical models for lineages of any depth from sample sizes of only a few pedigrees. This required developing the generalized spectral analysis for a binary tree, the natural framework for describing tree-structured variation. When tested on pedigrees from <i>C. elegans</i> expressing a marker for pharyngeal differentiation potential, the variability maps recover essential features of the known lineage map. When applied to highly-variable pedigrees monitoring cell size in T lymphocytes, the maps show that most of the phenotype is set by the founder naive T cell. Lineage variability maps thus elevate the concept of the lineage map to the population level, addressing questions about the potency and dynamics of cell lineages and providing a way to quantify the progressive restriction of cell fate with increasing depth in the tree.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/NySPD1pQXwY" width="1" />

Abstract<p>Whilst the primary role of vesicular transporters is to load neurotransmitters into synaptic vesicles, accumulating evidence suggests that these proteins also contribute to additional aspects of synaptic function, including vesicle release. In this study, we extend the role of the vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) to include regulating the transmitter content of synaptic vesicles. We report that manipulation of a C-terminal poly-glutamine (polyQ) region in the <i>Drosophila</i> VAChT is sufficient to influence transmitter content, and release frequency, of cholinergic vesicles from the terminals of premotor interneurons. Specifically, we find that reduction of the polyQ region, by one glutamine residue (<i>13Q to 12Q</i>), results in a significant increase in both amplitude and frequency of spontaneous cholinergic mEPSCs recorded in the aCC and RP2 motoneurons. Moreover, this truncation also results in evoked synaptic currents that show increased duration: consistent with increased ACh release. By contrast, extension of the polyQ region by one glutamine (<i>13Q to 14Q</i>) is sufficient to reduce mEPSC amplitude and frequency and, moreover, prevents evoked synaptic vesicle release. Finally, a complete deletion of the PolyQ region (13Q to 0Q) has no obvious effects to mEPSCs, but again evoked synaptic currents show increased duration. The mechanisms that ensure synaptic vesicles are filled to physiologically-appropriate levels remain unknown. Our study identifies the polyQ region of the insect VAChT to be required for correct vesicle transmitter loading and, thus, provides opportunity to increase understanding of this critical aspect of neurotransmission.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Neurotransmitter-loading of synaptic vesicles is tightly regulated and underpins the quantal theory of neurotransmission. However, although observed at every synapse studied, the mechanistic basis that ensures vesicle-filling stops at a fixed, pre-determined, level remains poorly understood. In this study we identify a C-terminal poly-glutamine region in the <i>Drosophila</i> VAChT to be critical for vesicle-loading of ACh. Reduction or extension of this region, by just one glutamine residue, is sufficient to increase or decrease, respectively, the amount of ACh loaded. Our work significantly advances the field of synaptic physiology by identifying a region of a vesicular transporter that regulates the extent to which synaptic vesicles are filled.</p>

Abstract<p>Cholecystokinin-expressing GABAergic (CCK-GABA) neurons are perisomatic inhibitory cells that have been argued to regulate emotion and sculpt the network oscillations associated with cognition. However, no study has selectively manipulated CCK-GABA neuron activity during behavior in freely-moving animals. To explore the behavioural effects of activating CCK-GABA neurons on emotion and cognition, we utilized a novel intersectional genetic mouse model coupled with a chemogenetic approach. Specifically, we generated triple transgenic <i>CCK-Cre;Dlx5/6-Flpe;RC::FL-hM3Dq</i> (CCK-GABA/hM3Dq) mice that expressed the synthetic excitatory hM3Dq receptor in CCK-GABA neurons. Results showed that CNO-mediated activation of CCK-GABA neurons did not alter open field or tail suspension performance and only slightly increased anxiety in the elevated plus maze. Though CNO treatment had only modestly affected emotional behavior, it significantly enhanced multiple cognitive and memory behaviors including social recognition, contextual fear conditioning, contextual discrimination, object recognition and problem-solving in the puzzle box. Collectively, these findings suggest that systemic activation of CCK-GABA neurons minimally affects emotion but significantly enhances cognition and memory. Our results imply that CCK-GABA neurons are more functionally diverse than originally expected and could serve as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of cognitive/memory disorders.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> CCK-GABA neurons are thought to play an important role in pathologies such as schizophrenia, but their contributions to behavior in the healthy states are poorly understood. Here we report a novel method for selectively targeting CCK-GABA neurons and manipulating their activity during behavioural tasks. Our data demonstrate that activating CCK-GABA neurons subtly affects emotional behavior but surprisingly enhances multiple memory and cognitive processes.</p>

Abstract<p>The periaqueductal gray (PAG) is a significant modulator of both analgesic and fear behaviors in both humans and rodents, but the underlying circuitry responsible for these two phenotypes is incompletely understood. Importantly, it is not known if there is a way to produce analgesia without anxiety by targeting the PAG, as modulation of glutamate or GABA neurons in this area initiates both antinociceptive and anxiogenic behavior. While dopamine (DA) neurons in the ventrolateral PAG (vlPAG) /dorsal raphe display a supraspinal antinociceptive effect, their influence on anxiety and fear are unknown. Using DAT-cre and Vglut2-cre male mice, we introduced Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs) to DA and glutamate neurons within the vlPAG using viral-mediated delivery and found that levels of analgesia were significant and quantitatively similar when DA and glutamate neurons were selectively stimulated. Activation of glutamatergic neurons, however, reliably produced higher indices of anxiety, with increased freezing time and more time spent in the safety of a dark enclosure. In contrast, animals in which PAG/dorsal raphe DA neurons were stimulated failed to show fear behaviors. DA-mediated antinociception was inhibitable by haloperidol and was sufficient to prevent persistent inflammatory pain induced by carrageenan. In summary, only activation of DA neurons in the PAG/dorsal raphe produced profound analgesia without signs of anxiety, indicating that PAG/dorsal raphe DA neurons are an important target involved in analgesia that may lead to new treatments for pain.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Clinicians have long had the goal of separating analgesia from anxiety when using deep brain electrical stimulation of the periaqueductal gray (PAG) for difficult to treat pain. Here we show that selective activation of dopamine neurons within the PAG produces analgesia without other behavioral effects, while stimulating glutamate neurons mediates stress-induced anxiety and analgesia. Our results suggest that dopamine agonists may represent a novel class of analgesic drugs and elucidate target neurons that could mediate their effect.</p>

<p>We study temporal correlations of interspike intervals (ISIs), quantified by
the network-averaged serial correlation coefficient (SCC), in networks of both
current- and conductance-based purely inhibitory integrate-and-fire neurons.
Numerical simulations reveal transitions to negative SCCs at intermediate
values of bias current drive and network size. As bias drive and network size
are increased past these values, the SCC returns to zero. The SCC is maximally
negative at an intermediate value of the network oscillation strength. The
dependence of the SCC on two canonical schemes for synaptic connectivity is
studied, and it is shown that the results occur robustly in both schemes. For
conductance-based synapses, the SCC becomes negative at the onset of both a
fast and slow coherent network oscillation. Finally, we devise a noise-reduced
diffusion approximation for current-based networks that accounts for the
observed temporal correlation transitions.

<p>The Caf\'e Wall illusion is one of a class of tilt illusions where lines that
are parallel appear to be tilted. We demonstrate that a simple Differences of
Gaussian model provides an explanatory mechanism for the illusory tilt
perceived in a family of Caf\'e Wall illusion generalizes to the dashed
versions of Caf\'e Wall. Our explanation models the visual mechanisms in
low-level stages that can reveal tilt cues in Geometrical distortion illusions
such as Tile illusions particularly Caf\'e Wall illusions. For this, we
simulate the activation of the retinal/cortical simple cells in responses to
these patterns based on a Classical Receptive Field (CRF) model to explain tilt
effects in these illusions. Previously, it was assumed that all these visual
experiences of tilt arise from the orientation selectivity properties described
for more complex cortical cells. An estimation of an overall tilt angle
perceived in these illusions is based on the integration of the local tilts
detected by simple cells which is presumed to be a key mechanism utilized by
the complex cells to create our final perception of tilt.

<p>When the human brain manifests the birth of organised communication among
local and large-scale neuronal populations activity remains undescribed. We
report, in resting-state EEG source-estimates of 100 infants at term age, the
existence of macro-scale dynamic functional connectivity, which have rich
topological organisations, distinct spectral fingerprints and scale-invariance
temporal dynamics. These functional networks encompass the default mode,
primary sensory-limbic system, thalamo-frontal, thalamo-sensorimotor and
visual-limbic system confined in the delta and low-alpha frequency intervals
(1-8 Hz). The temporal dynamics of these networks not only are nested within
much slower timescale (&lt;0.1 Hz) but also correlated in a hierarchical
leading-following organisation. We show that the anatomically constrained
richly organised spatial topologies, spectral contents and temporal
fluctuations of resting-state networks reflect an established intrinsic dynamic
functional connectome in the human brain at term age. The graph theoretical
analysis of the spatial architectures of the networks revealed small-world
topology and distinct rich-club organisations of interconnected cortical hubs
that exhibit rich synchronous dynamics at multiple timescales. The approach
opens new avenues to advance our understanding about the early configuration
organisation of dynamic networks in the human brain and offers a novel
monitoring platform to investigate functional brain network development in sick
preterm infants.

<p>The brain is an intricately structured organ responsible for the rich
emergent dynamics that support the complex cognitive functions we enjoy as
humans. With around $10^{11}$ neurons and $10^{15}$ synapses, understanding how
the human brain works has proven to be a daunting endeavor, requiring concerted
collaboration across traditional disciplinary boundaries. In some cases, that
collaboration has occurred between experimentalists and technicians, who offer
new physical tools to measure and manipulate neural function. In other
contexts, that collaboration has occurred between experimentalists and
theorists, who offer new conceptual tools to explain existing data and inform
new directions for empirical research. In this chapter, we offer an example of
the latter. Specifically, we focus on the simple but powerful framework of
linear systems theory as a useful tool both for capturing biophysically
relevant parameters of neural activity and connectivity, and for analytical and
numerical study. We begin with a brief overview of state-space representations
and linearization of neural models for non-linear dynamical systems. We then
derive core concepts in the theory of linear systems such as the impulse and
controlled responses to external stimuli, achieving desired state transitions,
controllability, and minimum energy control. Afterwards, we discuss recent
advances in the application of linear systems theory to structural and
functional brain data across multiple spatial and temporal scales, along with
methodological considerations and limitations. We close with a brief discussion
of open frontiers and our vision for the future.

<p>We investigate the dynamics of a network consisting of an array of identical
cortical units with nearest neighbor interactions under periodic arousal. Each
unit consists of two interconnected populations of neurons tuned to a state in
which many nonlinear resonances are available. The network is critically
balanced due to short-ranged antisymmetric connections between units. For wide
ranges of the network parameters, the patterns of activity resemble the
dynamics of cellular automata. It is argued that these dynamical states may
provide a template in which computation can be implemented.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/42914">Regional complexity in enteric neuron wiring reflects diversity of motility patterns in the mouse large intestine</a></h4>

The enteric nervous system controls a variety of gastrointestinal functions including intestinal motility. The minimal neuronal circuit necessary to direct peristalsis is well-characterized but several intestinal regions display also other motility patterns for which the underlying circuits and connectivity schemes that coordinate the transition between those patterns are poorly understood. We investigated whether in regions with a richer palette of motility patterns, the underlying nerve circuits reflect this complexity. Using Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging, we determined the location and response fingerprint of large populations of enteric neurons upon focal network stimulation. Complemented by neuronal tracing and volumetric reconstructions of synaptic contacts, this shows that the multifunctional proximal colon requires specific additional circuit components as compared to the distal colon, where peristalsis is the predominant motility pattern. Our study reveals that motility control is hard-wired in the enteric neural networks and that circuit complexity matches the motor pattern portfolio of specific intestinal regions.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/42693">Extensive transmission of microbes along the gastrointestinal tract</a></h4>

The gastrointestinal tract is abundantly colonized by microbes, yet the translocation of oral species to the intestine is considered a rare aberrant event, and a hallmark of disease. By studying salivary and fecal microbial strain populations of 310 species in 470 individuals from five countries, we found that transmission to, and subsequent colonization of, the large intestine by oral microbes is common and extensive among healthy individuals. We found evidence for a vast majority of oral species to be transferable, with increased levels of transmission in colorectal cancer and rheumatoid arthritis patients and, more generally, for species described as opportunistic pathogens. This establishes the oral cavity as an endogenous reservoir for gut microbial strains, and oral-fecal transmission as an important process that shapes the gastrointestinal microbiome in health and disease.

<i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> possesses a limited set of actin-regulatory proteins and relies on only three formins (FRMs) to nucleate and polymerize actin. We combined filamentous actin (F-actin) chromobodies with gene disruption to assign specific populations of actin filaments to individual formins. FRM2 localizes to the apical juxtanuclear region and participates in apicoplast inheritance. Restricted to the residual body, FRM3 maintains the intravacuolar cell-cell communication. Conoidal FRM1 initiates a flux of F-actin crucial for motility, invasion and egress. This flux depends on myosins A and H and is controlled by phosphorylation via PKG (protein kinase G) and CDPK1 (calcium-dependent protein kinase 1) and by methylation via AKMT (apical lysine methyltransferase). This flux is independent of microneme secretion and persists in the absence of the glideosome-associated connector (GAC). This study offers a coherent model of the key players controlling actin polymerization, stressing the importance of well-timed post-translational modifications to power parasite motility.

Much of the work done by faculty at both public and private universities has significant public dimensions: it is often paid for by public funds; it is often aimed at serving the public good; and it is often subject to public evaluation. To understand how the public dimensions of faculty work are valued, we analyzed review, promotion, and tenure documents from a representative sample of 129 universities in the US and Canada. Terms and concepts related to public and community are mentioned in a large portion of documents, but mostly in ways that relate to service, which is an undervalued aspect of academic careers. Moreover, the documents make significant mention of traditional research outputs and citation-based metrics: however, such outputs and metrics reward faculty work targeted to academics, and often disregard the public dimensions. Institutions that seek to embody their public mission could therefore work towards changing how faculty work is assessed and incentivized.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/41574">Fish-hunting cone snail venoms are a rich source of minimized ligands of the vertebrate insulin receptor</a></h4>

The fish-hunting marine cone snail <i>Conus geographus</i> uses a specialized venom insulin to induce hypoglycemic shock in its prey. We recently showed that this venom insulin, Con-Ins G1, has unique characteristics relevant to the design of new insulin therapeutics. Here, we show that fish-hunting cone snails provide a rich source of minimized ligands of the vertebrate insulin receptor. Insulins from <i>C. geographus</i>, <i>Conus tulipa</i> and <i>Conus kinoshitai</i> exhibit diverse sequences, yet all bind to and activate the human insulin receptor. Molecular dynamics reveal unique modes of action that are distinct from any other insulins known in nature. When tested in zebrafish and mice, venom insulins significantly lower blood glucose in the streptozotocin-induced model of diabetes. Our findings suggest that cone snails have evolved diverse strategies to activate the vertebrate insulin receptor and provide unique insight into the design of novel drugs for the treatment of diabetes.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/41328">Individuals physically interacting in a group rapidly coordinate their movement by estimating the collective goal</a></h4>

How can a human collective coordinate, for example to move a banquet table, when each person is influenced by the inertia of others who may be inferior at the task? We hypothesized that large groups cannot coordinate through touch alone, accruing to a zero-sum scenario where individuals inferior at the task hinder superior ones. We tested this hypothesis by examining how dyads, triads and tetrads, whose right hands were physically coupled together, followed a common moving target. Surprisingly, superior individuals followed the target accurately even when coupled to an inferior group, and the interaction benefits increased with the group size. A computational model shows that these benefits arose as each individual uses their respective interaction force to infer the collective’s target and enhance their movement planning, which permitted coordination in seconds independent of the collective’s size. By estimating the collective’s movement goal, its individuals make physical interaction beneficial, swift and scalable.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/40811">Overriding FUS autoregulation in mice triggers gain-of-toxic dysfunctions in RNA metabolism and autophagy-lysosome axis</a></h4>

Mutations in coding and non-coding regions of FUS cause amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The latter mutations may exert toxicity by increasing FUS accumulation. We show here that broad expression within the nervous system of wild-type or either of two ALS-linked mutants of human FUS in mice produces progressive motor phenotypes accompanied by characteristic ALS-like pathology. FUS levels are autoregulated by a mechanism in which human FUS downregulates endogenous FUS at mRNA and protein levels. Increasing wild-type human FUS expression achieved by saturating this autoregulatory mechanism produces a rapidly progressive phenotype and dose-dependent lethality. Transcriptome analysis reveals mis-regulation of genes that are largely not observed upon FUS reduction. Likely mechanisms for FUS neurotoxicity include autophagy inhibition and defective RNA metabolism. Thus, our results reveal that overriding FUS autoregulation will trigger gain-of-function toxicity via altered autophagy-lysosome pathway and RNA metabolism function, highlighting a role for protein and RNA dyshomeostasis in FUS-mediated toxicity.

Myelin is a multilayer lipid membrane structure that wraps and insulates axons, allowing for the efficient propagation of action potentials. During developmental myelination of the central nervous system (CNS), oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) proliferate and migrate to their final destination, where they terminally differentiate into mature oligodendrocytes and myelinate axons. Lineage progression and terminal differentiation of oligodendrocyte lineage cells are under tight transcriptional and post-transcriptional control.

Real-time forecasts based on mathematical models can inform critical decision-making during infectious disease outbreaks. Yet, epidemic forecasts are rarely evaluated during or after the event, and there is little guidance on the best metrics for assessment. Here, we propose an evaluation approach that disentangles different components of forecasting ability using metrics that separately assess the calibration, sharpness and bias of forecasts. This makes it possible to assess not just how close a forecast was to reality but also how well uncertainty has been quantified. We used this approach to analyse the performance of weekly forecasts we generated in real time for Western Area, Sierra Leone, during the 2013–16 Ebola epidemic in West Africa. We investigated a range of forecast model variants based on the model fits generated at the time with a semi-mechanistic model, and found that good probabilistic calibration was achievable at short time horizons of one or two weeks ahead but model predictions were increasingly unreliable at longer forecasting horizons. This suggests that forecasts may have been of good enough quality to inform decision making based on predictions a few weeks ahead of time but not longer, reflecting the high level of uncertainty in the processes driving the trajectory of the epidemic. Comparing forecasts based on the semi-mechanistic model to simpler null models showed that the best semi-mechanistic model variant performed better than the null models with respect to probabilistic calibration, and that this would have been identified from the earliest stages of the outbreak. As forecasts become a routine part of the toolkit in public health, standards for evaluation of performance will be important for assessing quality and improving credibility of mathematical models, and for elucidating difficulties and trade-offs when aiming to make the most useful and reliable forecasts.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/dohLaSUCB4U" width="1" />

Plant tissue architecture and organ morphogenesis rely on the proper orientation of cell divisions. Previous attempts to predict division planes from cell geometry in plants mostly focused on 2D symmetric divisions. Using the stereotyped division patterns of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> early embryogenesis, we investigated geometrical principles underlying plane selection in symmetric and in asymmetric divisions within complex 3D cell shapes. Introducing a 3D computational model of cell division, we show that area minimization constrained on passing through the cell centroid predicts observed divisions. Our results suggest that the positioning of division planes ensues from cell geometry and gives rise to spatially organized cell types with stereotyped shapes, thus underlining the role of self-organization in the developing architecture of the embryo. Our data further suggested the rule could be interpreted as surface minimization constrained by the nucleus position, which was validated using live imaging of cell divisions in the stomatal cell lineage.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/TM2g1M-Iy2U" width="1" />

Electrocorticography (ECoG) is becoming more prevalent due to improvements in fabrication and recording technology as well as its ease of implantation compared to intracortical electrophysiology, larger cortical coverage, and potential advantages for use in long term chronic implantation. Given the flexibility in the design of ECoG grids, which is only increasing, it remains an open question what geometry of the electrodes is optimal for an application. Conductive polymer, PEDOT:PSS, coated microelectrodes have an advantage that they can be made very small without losing low impedance. This makes them suitable for evaluating the required granularity of ECoG recording in humans and experimental animals. We used two-dimensional (2D) micro-ECoG grids to record intra-operatively in humans and during acute implantations in mouse with separation distance between neighboring electrodes (i.e., pitch) of 0.4 mm and 0.2/0.25 mm respectively. To assess the spatial properties of the signals, we used the average correlation between electrodes as a function of the pitch. In agreement with prior studies, we find a strong frequency dependence in the spatial scale of correlation. By applying independent component analysis (ICA), we find that the spatial pattern of correlation is largely due to contributions from multiple spatially extended, time-locked sources present at any given time. Our analysis indicates the presence of spatially structured activity down to the sub-millimeter spatial scale in ECoG despite the effects of volume conduction, justifying the use of dense micro-ECoG grids.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Ux3pcYLlGPE" width="1" />

<p>by Qingtian Zhang, Xiaolin Hu, Bo Hong, Bo Zhang</p>

The auditory pathway consists of multiple stages, from the cochlear nucleus to the auditory cortex. Neurons acting at different stages have different functions and exhibit different response properties. It is unclear whether these stages share a common encoding mechanism. We trained an unsupervised deep learning model consisting of alternating sparse coding and max pooling layers on cochleogram-filtered human speech. Evaluation of the response properties revealed that computing units in lower layers exhibited spectro-temporal receptive fields (STRFs) similar to those of inferior colliculus neurons measured in physiological experiments, including properties such as sound onset and termination, checkerboard pattern, and spectral motion. Units in upper layers tended to be tuned to phonetic features such as plosivity and nasality, resembling the results of field recording in human auditory cortex. Variation of the sparseness level of the units in each higher layer revealed a positive correlation between the sparseness level and the strength of phonetic feature encoding. The activities of the units in the top layer, but not other layers, correlated with the dynamics of the first two formants (F1, F2) of all phonemes, indicating the encoding of phoneme dynamics in these units. These results suggest that the principles of sparse coding and max pooling may be universal in the human auditory pathway.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/-nQbwxjQ_kY" width="1" />

Prediction of response to specific cancer treatments is complicated by significant heterogeneity between tumors in terms of mutational profiles, gene expression, and clinical measures. Here we focus on the response of Estrogen Receptor (ER)+ post-menopausal breast cancer tumors to aromatase inhibitors (AI). We use a network smoothing algorithm to learn novel features that integrate several types of high throughput data and new cell line experiments. These features greatly improve the ability to predict response to AI when compared to prior methods. For a subset of the patients, for which we obtained more detailed clinical information, we can further predict response to a specific AI drug.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/WYd1C4aBjEQ" width="1" />

<p>by Abhishek Niroula, Mauno Vihinen</p>

Computational tools are widely used for interpreting variants detected in sequencing projects. The choice of these tools is critical for reliable variant impact interpretation for precision medicine and should be based on systematic performance assessment. The performance of the methods varies widely in different performance assessments, for example due to the contents and sizes of test datasets. To address this issue, we obtained 63,160 common amino acid substitutions (allele frequency ≥1% and &lt;25%) from the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) database, which contains variants from 60,706 genomes or exomes. We evaluated the specificity, the capability to detect benign variants, for 10 variant interpretation tools. In addition to overall specificity of the tools, we tested their performance for variants in six geographical populations. PON-P2 had the best performance (95.5%) followed by FATHMM (86.4%) and VEST (83.5%). While these tools had excellent performance, the poorest method predicted more than one third of the benign variants to be disease-causing. The results allow choosing reliable methods for benign variant interpretation, for both research and clinical purposes, as well as provide a benchmark for method developers.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Z-k0jB47zFU" width="1" />

Abstract<p>Learning to read specializes a portion of the left mid-fusiform cortex for printed word recognition, the putative "visual word form area" (VWFA). This study examined whether a VWFA specialized for English is sufficiently malleable to support learning a perceptually atypical second writing system. The study utilized an artificial orthography, "HouseFont," in which house images represent English phonemes. House images elicit category-biased activation in a spatially distinct brain region, the so-called "parahippocampal place area" (PPA). Using house images as letters made it possible to test whether the capacity for learning a second writing system involves neural territory that supports reading in the first writing system, or neural territory tuned for the visual features of the new orthography. Twelve human adults completed two-weeks of training to establish basic HouseFont reading proficiency and underwent functional neuroimaging pre and post-training. Analysis of three functionally defined regions of interest, the VWFA, and left and right PPA, found significant pre- versus post-training increases in response to HouseFont words only in the VWFA. Analysis of the relationship between the behavioral and neural data found that activation changes from pre- to post-training within the VWFA predicted HouseFont reading speed. These results demonstrate that learning a new orthography utilizes neural territory previously specialized by the acquisition of a native writing system. Further, they suggest VWFA engagement is driven by orthographic functionality and not the visual characteristics of graphemes, which informs the broader debate about the nature of category-specialized areas in visual association cortex.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Fluent reading recruits a portion of the brain known as the visual word form area (VWFA), but it is less well understood how malleable the VWFA remains after acquiring literacy in a native language. There is also debate about the type of visual information the VWFA can process as orthographically meaningful. We tested whether native English-speaking adults could learn a second, visually atypical writing system for English and used neuroimaging data to assess the location of any learning effects. Participants acquired basic reading ability and learning effects were found in the neural territory that underlies English reading. This suggests that the VWFA remains plastic after initial literacy and is not restricted by the visual features of a writing system.</p>

Abstract<p>Despite the profound influence on coding capacity of sensory neurons, the measurements of noise correlations have been inconsistent. This is, possibly, because nonstationarity, i.e. drifting baselines, engendered the spurious long-term correlations even if no actual short-term correlation existed. Although attempts to separate them have been made previously, they were ad hoc for specific cases or computationally too demanding. Here we proposed an information-geometric method to unbiasedly estimate pure short-term noise correlations irrespective of the background brain activities without demanding computational resources. First, the benchmark simulations demonstrated that the proposed estimator is more accurate and computationally e cient than the conventional correlograms and the residual correlations with Kalman filters or moving averages of length three or more, while the best moving average of length two coincided with the propose method regarding correlation estimates. Next, we analyzed the cat V1 neural responses to demonstrate that the statistical test accompanying the proposed method combined with the existing nonstationarity test enabled us to dissociate short- and long-term noise correlations. When we excluded the spurious noise correlations of purely long-term nature, only small fraction of neuron pairs showed significant short-term correlations, possibly reconciling the previous inconsistent observations on existence of significant noise correlations. The decoding accuracy was slightly improved by the short-term correlations. Although the long-term correlations deteriorated the generalizability, the generalizability was recovered by the decoder with trend removal, suggesting that brains could overcome nonstationarity. Thus the proposed method enables us to elucidate the impacts of short- and long-term noise correlations in a dissociated manner.</p><p><b>Significance statement</b> The proposed measure for spike-count noise correlations, based on the local temporal detrending, enables us to decompose the correlated responses into long- and short-timescale components. The proposed method is essential to elucidate the population codes in the era of large-scale electrophysiology as it works for large number of simultaneously recorded neurons while existing methods do not. With the additional help of the machine learning that classifies stimuli from neural activities, we demonstrate proper ways to assess the impacts on decoding of the presence of short- or long-term noise correlations, separately. The well-designed decoding analysis with dissociated correlated activities will help to gain insight into the brain’s decoding strategies under changing environments.</p>

ABSTRACT<p>The consolidation of newly formed memories and their retrieval are energetically demanding processes. Aerobic glycolysis (AG), also known as the Warburg effect, consists of the production of lactate from glucose in the presence of oxygen. The astrocyte neuron lactate shuttle hypothesis posits that astrocytes process glucose by AG to generate lactate, which is used as a fuel source within neurons to maintain synaptic activity. Studies in mice have demonstrated that lactate transport between astrocytes and neurons is required for long-term memory formation, yet the role of lactate production in memory acquisition and retrieval has not previously been explored. Here, we examined the effect of dichloroacetic acid (DCA), a chemical inhibitor of lactate production, on spatial learning and memory in mice using the Morris Water Maze (MWM). <i>In vivo</i> hyperpolarized <sup>13</sup>C-pyruvate magnetic resonance spectroscopy revealed decreased conversion of pyruvate to lactate in the mouse brain following DCA administration, concomitant with a reduction in phosphorylation of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH). DCA exposure before each training session in the MWM impaired learning, which subsequently resulted in impaired memory during the probe trial. In contrast, mice that underwent training without DCA exposure, but received a single DCA injection before the probe trial exhibited normal memory. Our findings indicate that AG plays a key role during memory acquisition but is less important for retrieval of established memories. Thus, activation of AG may be important for learning-dependent synaptic plasticity rather than the activation of signaling cascades required for memory retrieval.</p><p><b>SIGNIFICANCE</b> Neuronal activation is an energetically demanding process. The brain is mainly fueled by glucose, yet a substantial portion of this metabolite is converted to lactate despite the presence of adequate oxygen, a phenomenon known as aerobic glycolysis (AG). The transport of lactate between astrocytes and neurons is key for learning and memory, yet the role of lactate production in these processes is poorly understood. Here we report that administration of dichloroacetate (DCA), a chemical inhibitor of AG, attenuates conversion of pyruvate to lactate in the brains of mice. DCA exposure impaired spatial learning but had no effect on the retrieval of an established memory. These observations suggest that lactate production may be required for memory acquisition but not retrieval.</p>

Abstract<p>Odor information is transmitted from olfactory sensory neurons to principal neurons at the glomeruli of the olfactory bulb. The intraglomerular neuronal circuit also includes hundreds of interneurons referred to as juxtaglomerular (JG) cells. Stimulus selectivity is well correlated among many JG cells that are associated with the same glomerulus, consistent with their highly homogeneous sensory inputs. However, much less is known about the temporal aspects of their activity, including the temporal coordination of their odor-evoked responses. As many JG cells within a glomerular module respond to the same stimulus, the extent to which their activity is temporally aligned will affect the temporal profile of their population inhibitory inputs. Using random-access high-speed two-photon microscopy, we recorded the odor-evoked calcium transients of mouse JG cells and compared the onset latency and rise time among neurons putatively associated with the same and different glomeruli. Whereas the overall onset latencies of odor-evoked transients were distributed across a ~150 ms time window, those from cells putatively associated with the same glomerulus were confined to a much narrower window of several tens of milliseconds. This result suggests that onset latency primarily depends on the associated glomerulus. We also observed glomerular specificity in the rise time. The glomerulus-specific temporal pattern of odor-evoked activity implies that the temporal patterns of inputs from the intraglomerular circuit are unique to individual glomerulus–odor pairs, which may contribute to efficient shaping of the temporal pattern of activity in the principal neurons.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> The sense of smell is essential for assessing chemicals in one’s atmospheric environment. In understanding the biological mechanisms by which humans and animals recognize various odorous chemicals, a key question is how the signals sent from the nose are transformed in the brain. In this work, we studied the temporal pattern of activity in interneurons that tune the sensory inputs to the principal (signal-carrying) neurons in the olfactory bulb via structures known as glomeruli. We found that the odor responses of these interneurons are precisely coordinated in time, suggesting that the glomerulus is a temporally well-organized unit. Our finding suggests that the temporal coordination of glomerular activity is important in signal transformation in the olfactory system.</p>

Abstract<p>Mutations in the <i>KCNV2</i> gene, which encodes the voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> channel protein Kv8.2, cause a distinctive form of cone dystrophy with a supernormal rod response (CDSRR). Kv8.2 channel subunits only form functional channels when combined in a heterotetramer with Kv2.1 subunits encoded by the <i>KCNB1</i> gene. The CDSRR disease phenotype indicates that photoreceptor adaptation is disrupted. The electroretinogram (ERG) response of affected individuals shows depressed rod and cone activity, but what distinguishes this disease is the supernormal rod response to a bright flash of light. Here, we have utilised knock-out mutations of both genes in the mouse to study the pathophysiology of CDSRR. The Kv8.2 KO mice show many similarities to the human disorder, including a depressed a-wave and an elevated b-wave response with bright light stimulation. OCT imaging and immunohistochemistry indicate that the changes in 6 months old Kv8.2 KO retinae are largely limited to the outer nuclear layer, while outer segments appear intact. In addition, there is a significant increase in TUNEL positive cells throughout the retina. The Kv2.1 KO and double KO mice also show a severely depressed a-wave, but the elevated b-wave response is absent. Interestingly, in all three KO genotypes, the c-wave is totally absent. The differential response shown here of these KO lines, that either possess homomeric or lack channels completely, has provided further insights into the role of K<sup>+</sup> channels in the generation of the a-, b- and c-wave components of the ERG.</p><p><b>Significance statement</b> Heterotetrameric Kv voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> channels are formed by two subunits, Kv8.2 and Kv2.1, encoded respectively by the <i>KCNV2</i> gene and <i>KCNB1</i> gene. Kv8.2 subunits act as modifiers of channel activity but are not capable of forming functional homomeric channels. Mutations in <i>KCNV2</i> result in a blinding disorder that combines photoreceptor dystrophy with an enhanced rod ERG, a feature that is generally diagnostic for the disorder. In this study, mouse models with knock-out mutations of the <i>Kcnv2 and Kcnb1</i> genes have been used to study of the function of Kv channels in the response to light stimulation as analysed by ERG recordings in order to further our understanding of the role of these channels in vision and disease.</p>

<p>There is a widespread view that the human brain is so complex that it cannot
be efficiently simulated by universal Turing machines, let alone ordinary
classical computers. During the last decades the question has therefore been
raised whether we need to consider quantum effects to explain the imagined
cognitive power of a conscious mind.
</p>
<p>This paper presents a personal view of several fields of philosophy and
computational neurobiology in an attempt to suggest a realistic picture of how
the brain might work as a basis for perception, consciousness and cognition.
The purpose is to be able to identify and evaluate instances where quantum
effects might play a significant role in cognitive processes.
</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, the conclusion is that quantum-enhanced cognition and
intelligence are very unlikely to be found in biological brains. Quantum
effects may certainly influence the functionality of various components and
signalling pathways at the molecular level in the brain network, like ion
ports, synapses, sensors, and enzymes. This might evidently influence the
functionality of some nodes and perhaps even the overall intelligence of the
brain network, but hardly give it any dramatically enhanced functionality. So,
the conclusion is that biological quantum networks can only approximately solve
small instances of NP-hard problems.
</p>
<p>On the other hand, artificial intelligence and machine learning implemented
in complex dynamical systems based on genuine quantum networks can certainly be
expected to show enhanced performance and quantum advantage compared with
classical networks. Nevertheless, even quantum networks can only be expected to
solve NP-hard problems approximately. In the end it is a question of precision
- Nature is approximate.

<p>Illusions are fascinating and immediately catch people's attention and
interest, but they are also valuable in terms of giving us insights into human
cognition and perception. A good theory of human perception should be able to
explain the illusion, and a correct theory will actually give quantifiable
results. We investigate here the efficiency of a computational filtering model
utilised for modelling the lateral inhibition of retinal ganglion cells and
their responses to a range of Geometric Illusions using isotropic Differences
of Gaussian filters. This study explores the way in which illusions have been
explained and shows how a simple standard model of vision based on classical
receptive fields can predict the existence of these illusions as well as the
degree of effect. A fundamental contribution of this work is to link bottom-up
processes to higher level perception and cognition consistent with Marr's
theory of vision and edge map representation.

<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is necessary to address the large and growing
deficit in retina and healthcare access globally. And mobile AI diagnostic
platforms running in the Cloud may effectively and efficiently distribute such
AI capability. Here we sought to evaluate the feasibility of Cloud-based mobile
artificial intelligence for detection of retinal disease. And to evaluate the
accuracy of a particular such system for detection of subretinal fluid (SRF)
and macula edema (ME) on OCT scans. A multicenter retrospective image analysis
was conducted in which board-certified ophthalmologists with fellowship
training in retina evaluated OCT images of the macula. They noted the presence
or absence of ME or SRF, then compared their assessment to that obtained from
Fluid Intelligence, a mobile AI app that detects SRF and ME on OCT scans.
Investigators consecutively selected retinal OCTs, while making effort to
balance the number of scans with retinal fluid and scans without. Exclusion
criteria included poor scan quality, ambiguous features, macula holes,
retinoschisis, and dense epiretinal membranes. Accuracy in the form of
sensitivity and specificity of the AI mobile App was determined by comparing
its assessments to those of the retina specialists. At the time of this
submission, five centers have completed their initial studies. This consists of
a total of 283 OCT scans of which 155 had either ME or SRF ("wet") and 128 did
not ("dry"). The sensitivity ranged from 82.5% to 97% with a weighted average
of 89.3%. The specificity ranged from 52% to 100% with a weighted average of
81.23%. CONCLUSION: Cloud-based Mobile AI technology is feasible for the
detection retinal disease. In particular, Fluid Intelligence (alpha version),
is sufficiently accurate as a screening tool for SRF and ME, especially in
underserved areas. Further studies and technology development is needed.

<p>The ability of humans and animals to quickly adapt to novel tasks is
difficult to reconcile with the standard paradigm of learning by slow synaptic
weight modification. Here we show that already static neural networks can learn
to generate required dynamics by imitation. After appropriate weight
pretraining, the networks dynamically adapt to learn new tasks and thereafter
continue to achieve them without further teacher feedback. We explain this
ability and illustrate it with a variety of target dynamics, ranging from
oscillatory trajectories to driven and chaotic dynamical systems.

Ultrasound can be used to modulate activity in deep brain areas. After stimulation, activity in the targeted brain area becomes less coupled to its network. Effects are specific to the stimulation site, long-lasting, and not due to auditory confounds.

<p>Disorders of consciousness (DOC) are a common consequence of severe brain injuries, and clinical evaluation is critical to provide a correct diagnosis and prognosis. The revised Motor Behavior Tool (MBT‐r) is a clinical complementary tool aiming to identify subtle motor behaviors that might reflect residual cognition in DOC. In this prospective study including 30 DOC patients in the early stage after brain injury, we show that the revised MBT‐r has an excellent inter‐rater agreement and has the ability to identify a subgroup of patients, underestimated by the Coma Recovery Scale‐Revised, showing residual cognition and a subsequent recovery of consciousness.

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>There is no scale for rating the severity of autoimmune encephalitis (AE). In this study, we aimed to develop a novel scale for rating severity in patients with diverse AE syndromes and to verify the reliability and validity of the developed scale.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The key items were generated by a panel of experts and selected according to content validity ratios. The developed scale was initially applied to 50 patients with AE (development cohort) to evaluate its acceptability, reproducibility, internal consistency, and construct validity. Then, the scale was applied to another independent cohort (validation cohort, n = 38).</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A new scale consisting of 9 items (seizure, memory dysfunction, psychiatric symptoms, consciousness, language problems, dyskinesia/dystonia, gait instability and ataxia, brainstem dysfunction, and weakness) was developed. Each item was assigned a value of up to 3 points. The total score could therefore range from 0 to 27. We named the scale the Clinical Assessment Scale in Autoimmune Encephalitis (CASE). The new scale showed excellent interobserver (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] = 0.97) and intraobserver (ICC = 0.96) reliability for total scores, was highly correlated with modified Rankin scale (<i>r</i> = 0.86, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), and had acceptable internal consistency (Cronbach α = 0.88). Additionally, in the validation cohort, the scale showed high interobserver reliability (ICC = 0.99) and internal consistency (Cronbach α = 0.92).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>CASE is a novel clinical scale for AE with a high level of clinimetric properties. It would be suitable for application in clinical practice and might help overcome the limitations of current outcome scales for AE. Ann Neurol 2019</p>

<p>Publication date: August 2019</p><p><b>Source:</b> Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 57</p><p>Author(s): Gladys Lima Caldeira, João Peça, Ana Luísa Carvalho</p><div><p>Growing evidence implicates synaptic proteins in the pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric disorders such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD), intellectual disability (ID) and schizophrenia. In fact, mutations in genes encoding synaptic proteins are enriched and overlap among different conditions highlighting the complex and pleiotropic nature of these disorders. In this review, we discuss recently described candidate genes that affect excitatory synapse function and result in changes in spine number and morphology. Spine pathology has been observed in several animal models of disease and in human brain post-mortem samples from ID, ASD, and schizophrenia patients. Recent data point to convergent mechanisms, such as dysregulation of the actin cytoskeleton and dysfunction of microglia synaptic remodeling, underlying dendritic spine dysgenesis. Interestingly, the reversion of important pathologic features, including spine abnormalities, has been observed in adult animal models of neuropsychiatric disorders, suggesting that therapies may not be restricted to a specific developmental window. Shedding light on the specific mechanisms impacted in neuropsychiatric disorders will undeniably contribute to the development of more directed and personalized therapies.</p></div>

BioJava is an open-source project that provides a Java library for processing biological data. The project aims to simplify bioinformatic analyses by implementing parsers, data structures, and algorithms for common tasks in genomics, structural biology, ontologies, phylogenetics, and more. Since 2012, we have released two major versions of the library (4 and 5) that include many new features to tackle challenges with increasingly complex macromolecular structure data. BioJava requires Java 8 or higher and is freely available under the LGPL 2.1 license. The project is hosted on GitHub at https://github.com/biojava/biojava. More information and documentation can be found online on the BioJava website (http://www.biojava.org) and tutorial (https://github.com/biojava/biojava-tutorial).

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Small‐fiber sensory and autonomic symptoms are early presentations of familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP) with transthyretin (TTR) mutations. This study aimed to explore the potential of skin nerve pathologies as early and disease‐progression biomarkers and their relationship with skin amyloid deposits.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Skin biopsies were performed in patients and carriers to measure intraepidermal nerve fiber (IENF) density, sweat gland innervation index of structural protein gene product 9.5 [SGII(PGP9.5)] and peptidergic vasoactive intestinal peptide [SGII(VIP)], and cutaneous amyloid index. These skin pathologies were analyzed with clinical disability assessed by FAP stage score (stage 0~4) and compared to neurophysiological and psychophysical tests.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>There were 70 TTR‐mutant subjects (22 carriers and 48 patients) and 66 cases were TTR‐A97S. Skin nerve pathologies were distinct according to stage. In carriers, both skin denervation and peptidergic sudomotor denervation were evident: (1) IENF density was gradually reduced from stage 0 through 4, and (2) SGII(VIP) was markedly reduced from stage 1 to 2. In contrast, SGII(PGP9.5) was similar between carriers and controls, but it declined in patients from stage 2. Skin amyloids were absent in carriers and became detectable from stage 1. Cutaneous amyloid index was correlated with SGII(PGP9.5) and stage in a multivariable mixed‐effect model. When all tests were compared, only IENF density, SGII(PGP9.5), and cutaneous amyloid index were correlated with stage, and IENF density had the highest abnormal rate in carriers.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Biomarkers of sensory and sudomotor innervation exhibited a stage‐dependent progression pattern, with sensory nerve degeneration as the early skin nerve pathology.</p>

<p>Publication date: August 2019</p><p><b>Source:</b> Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 57</p><p>Author(s): Michael T Kelliher, Harriet AJ Saunders, Jill Wildonger</p><div><p>Neurons are exquisitely polarized cells whose structure and function relies on microtubules. Microtubules in signal-receiving dendrites and signal-sending axons differ in their organization and microtubule-associated proteins. These differences, coupled with microtubule post-translational modifications, combine to locally regulate intracellular transport, morphology, and function. Recent discoveries provide new insight into the regulation of non-centrosomal microtubule arrays in neurons, the relationship between microtubule acetylation and mechanosensation, and the spatial patterning of microtubules that regulates motor activity and cargo delivery in axons and dendrites. Together, these new studies bring us closer to understanding how microtubule function is locally tuned to match the specialized tasks associated with signal reception and transmission.</p></div>

<p>Diagnosing epilepsy is a problem of crucial importance. So analysing EEG data
is of much importance to help this diagnosis. Assembling the Feigenbaum graphs
for EEG signals. And calculating their average clustering, average degree, and
average shortest path length. We manage to characterize two different data sets
from each other. Each data set consisted of focal and non-focal activity, from
where epileptic regions could be identified. This method yields good results
for identifying sets of data from epileptic zones. Suggesting our approach
could be used to aid physicians with diagnosing epilepsy from EEG data.

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/qkXV8ndLl4k/article">Information integration in large brain networks</a></h4>

<p>by Daniel Toker, Friedrich T. Sommer</p>

An outstanding problem in neuroscience is to understand how information is integrated across the many modules of the brain. While classic information-theoretic measures have transformed our understanding of feedforward information processing in the brain’s sensory periphery, comparable measures for information flow in the massively recurrent networks of the rest of the brain have been lacking. To address this, recent work in information theory has produced a sound measure of network-wide “integrated information”, which can be estimated from time-series data. But, a computational hurdle has stymied attempts to measure large-scale information integration in real brains. Specifically, the measurement of integrated information involves a combinatorial search for the informational “weakest link” of a network, a process whose computation time explodes super-exponentially with network size. Here, we show that spectral clustering, applied on the correlation matrix of time-series data, provides an approximate but robust solution to the search for the the informational weakest link of large networks. This reduces the computation time for integrated information in large systems from longer than the lifespan of the universe to just minutes. We evaluate this solution in brain-like systems of coupled oscillators as well as in high-density electrocortigraphy data from two macaque monkeys, and show that the informational “weakest link” of the monkey cortex splits posterior sensory areas from anterior association areas. Finally, we use our solution to provide evidence in support of the long-standing hypothesis that information integration is maximized by networks with a high global efficiency, and that modular network structures promote the segregation of information.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/qkXV8ndLl4k" width="1" />

<p>by Simon N. Weber, Henning Sprekeler</p>

Grid cells have attracted broad attention because of their highly symmetric hexagonal firing patterns. Recently, research has shifted its focus from the global symmetry of grid cell activity to local distortions both in space and time, such as drifts in orientation, local defects of the hexagonal symmetry, and the decay and reappearance of grid patterns after changes in lighting condition. Here, we introduce a method that allows to visualize and quantify such local distortions, by assigning both a local grid score and a local orientation to each individual spike of a neuronal recording. The score is inspired by a standard measure from crystallography, which has been introduced to quantify local order in crystals. By averaging over spikes recorded within arbitrary regions or time periods, we can quantify local variations in symmetry and orientation of firing patterns in both space and time.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/tQ_b-Q4hyrA" width="1" />

<p>by Lior Tiroshi, Joshua A. Goldberg</p>

The theory of phase oscillators is an essential tool for understanding population dynamics of pacemaking neurons. GABAergic pacemakers in the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr), a main basal ganglia (BG) output nucleus, receive inputs from the direct and indirect pathways at distal and proximal regions of their dendritic arbors, respectively. We combine theory, optogenetic stimulation and electrophysiological experiments in acute brain slices to ask how dendritic properties impact the propensity of the various inputs, arriving at different locations along the dendrite, to recruit or entrain SNr pacemakers. By combining cable theory with sinusoidally-modulated optogenetic activation of either proximal somatodendritic regions or the entire somatodendritic arbor of SNr neurons, we construct an analytical model that accurately fits the empirically measured somatic current response to inputs arising from illuminating the soma and various portions of the dendritic field. We show that the extent of the dendritic tree that is illuminated generates measurable and systematic differences in the pacemaker’s phase response curve (PRC), causing a shift in its peak. Finally, we show that the divergent PRCs correctly predict differences in two major features of the collective dynamics of SNr neurons: the fidelity of population responses to sudden step-like changes in inputs; and the phase latency at which SNr neurons are entrained by rhythmic stimulation, which can occur in the BG under both physiological and pathophysiological conditions. Our novel method generates measurable and physiologically meaningful spatial effects, and provides the first empirical demonstration of how the collective responses of SNr pacemakers are determined by the transmission properties of their dendrites. SNr dendrites may serve to delay distal striatal inputs so that they impinge on the spike initiation zone simultaneously with pallidal and subthalamic inputs in order to guarantee a fair competition between the influence of the monosynaptic direct- and polysynaptic indirect pathways.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/CqH4TZGZ4Nc" width="1" />

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>In real-life situations, the appearance of a person’s face can vary substantially across different encounters, making face recognition a challenging task for the visual system. Recent fMRI decoding studies have suggested that face recognition is supported by identity representations located in regions of the occipitotemporal cortex. Here, we used EEG to elucidate the temporal emergence of these representations. Human participants viewed a set of highly variable face images of 4 highly familiar celebrities (2 males and 2 females), while performing an orthogonal task. Univariate analyses of event-related EEG responses revealed a pronounced differentiation between male and female faces, but not between identities of the same sex. Using multivariate representational similarity analysis, we observed a gradual emergence of face identity representations, with an increasing degree of invariance. Face identity information emerged rapidly, starting shortly after 100 ms from stimulus onset, but was modulated by sex differences and image similarities. From 400 ms after onset and predominantly in the right hemisphere, identity representations showed 2 invariance properties: 1) they equally discriminated identities of opposite sexes and of the same sex, and 2) they were tolerant to image-based variations. These invariant representations may be a crucial prerequisite for successful face recognition in everyday situations, where the appearance of a familiar person can vary drastically.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as avolition, apathy, and anhedonia, precede the onset of debilitating motor symptoms in Huntington’s disease (HD), and their development may give insight into early disease progression and treatment. However, the neuronal and circuit mechanisms of premanifest HD pathophysiology are not well-understood. Here, using a transgenic rat model expressing the full-length human mutant HD gene, we find early and profound deficits in reward motivation in the absence of gross motor abnormalities. These deficits are accompanied by significant and progressive dysfunction in corticostriatal processing and communication among brain areas critical for reward-driven behavior. Together, our results define early corticostriatal dysfunction as a possible pathogenic contributor to psychiatric disturbances and may help identify potential pharmacotherapeutic targets for the treatment of HD.</span>

Genome annotation is the process of identifying the location and function of a genome's encoded features. Improving the biological accuracy of annotation is a complex and iterative process requiring researchers to review and incorporate multiple sources of information such as transcriptome alignments, predictive models based on sequence profiles, and comparisons to features found in related organisms. Because rapidly decreasing costs are enabling an ever-growing number of scientists to incorporate sequencing as a routine laboratory technique, there is widespread demand for tools that can assist in the deliberative analytical review of genomic information. To this end, we present Apollo, an open source software package that enables researchers to efficiently inspect and refine the precise structure and role of genomic features in a graphical browser-based platform. Some of Apollo’s newer user interface features include support for real-time collaboration, allowing distributed users to simultaneously edit the same encoded features while also instantly seeing the updates made by other researchers on the same region in a manner similar to Google Docs. Its technical architecture enables Apollo to be integrated into multiple existing genomic analysis pipelines and heterogeneous laboratory workflow platforms. Finally, we consider the implications that Apollo and related applications may have on how the results of genome research are published and made accessible.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/f6P1BeFwcgE" width="1" />

<p>by Amin Allahyar, Joske Ubels, Jeroen de Ridder</p>

Robustly predicting outcome for cancer patients from gene expression is an important challenge on the road to better personalized treatment. Network-based outcome predictors (NOPs), which considers the cellular wiring diagram in the classification, hold much promise to improve performance, stability and interpretability of identified marker genes. Problematically, reports on the efficacy of NOPs are conflicting and for instance suggest that utilizing random networks performs on par to networks that describe biologically relevant interactions. In this paper we turn the prediction problem around: instead of using a given biological network in the NOP, we aim to identify the network of genes that truly improves outcome prediction. To this end, we propose SyNet, a gene network constructed ab initio from synergistic gene pairs derived from survival-labelled gene expression data. To obtain SyNet, we evaluate synergy for all 69 million pairwise combinations of genes resulting in a network that is specific to the dataset and phenotype under study and can be used to in a NOP model. We evaluated SyNet and 11 other networks on a compendium dataset of &gt;4000 survival-labelled breast cancer samples. For this purpose, we used cross-study validation which more closely emulates real world application of these outcome predictors. We find that SyNet is the only network that truly improves performance, stability and interpretability in several existing NOPs. We show that SyNet overlaps significantly with existing gene networks, and can be confidently predicted (~85% AUC) from graph-topological descriptions of these networks, in particular the breast tissue-specific network. Due to its data-driven nature, SyNet is not biased to well-studied genes and thus facilitates post-hoc interpretation. We find that SyNet is highly enriched for known breast cancer genes and genes related to e.g. histological grade and tamoxifen resistance, suggestive of a role in determining breast cancer outcome.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/e8NV-FivGl4" width="1" />

<p>Hearing depends on extracting frequency, intensity, and temporal properties from sound to generate an auditory map for acoustical signal processing. How physiology intersects with molecular specification to fine tune the developing properties of the auditory system that enable these aspects remains unclear. We made a novel conditional deletion model that eliminates the transcription factor NEUROD1 exclusively in the ear. These mice (both sexes) develop a truncated frequency range with no neuroanatomically recognizable mapping of spiral ganglion neurons onto distinct locations in the cochlea nor a cochleotopic map presenting topographically discrete projections to the cochlear nuclei. The disorganized primary cochleotopic map alters tuning properties of the inferior colliculus units, which display abnormal frequency, intensity, and temporal sound coding. At the behavioral level, animals show alterations in the acoustic startle response, consistent with altered neuroanatomical and physiological properties. We demonstrate that absence of the primary afferent topology during embryonic development leads to dysfunctional tonotopy of the auditory system. Such effects have never been investigated in other sensory systems because of the lack of comparable single gene mutation models.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> All sensory systems form a topographical map of neuronal projections from peripheral sensory organs to the brain. Neuronal projections in the auditory pathway are cochleotopically organized, providing a tonotopic map of sound frequencies. Primary sensory maps typically arise by molecular cues, requiring physiological refinements. Past work has demonstrated physiologic plasticity in many senses without ever molecularly undoing the specific mapping of an entire primary sensory projection. We genetically manipulated primary auditory neurons to generate a scrambled cochleotopic projection. Eliminating tonotopic representation to auditory nuclei demonstrates the inability of physiological processes to restore a tonotopic presentation of sound in the midbrain. Our data provide the first insights into the limits of physiology-mediated brainstem plasticity during the development of the auditory system.</p>

<p>We have identified a member of the growth arrest and DNA damage (Gadd45) protein family, Gadd45, which is known to be critically involved in DNA repair, as a key player in the regulation of immediate early gene (IEG) expression underlying the consolidation of associative fear memory in adult male C57BL/6 mice. Gadd45 temporally influences learning-induced IEG expression in the prelimbic prefrontal cortex (PLPFC) through its interaction with DNA double-strand break (DSB)-mediated changes in DNA methylation. Our findings suggest a two-hit model of experience-dependent IEG activity and learning that comprises (1) a first wave of IEG expression governed by DSBs and followed by a rapid increase in DNA methylation, and (2) a second wave of IEG expression associated with the recruitment of Gadd45 and active DNA demethylation at the same site, which is necessary for memory consolidation.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> How does the pattern of immediate early gene transcription in the brain relate to the storage and accession of information, and what controls these patterns? This paper explores how Gadd45, a gene that is known to be involved with DNA modification and repair, regulates the temporal coding of IEGs underlying associative learning and memory. We reveal that, during fear learning, Gadd45 serves to act as a coordinator of IEG expression and subsequent memory consolidation by directing temporally specific changes in active DNA demethylation at the promoter of plasticity-related IEGs.</p>

<p>TRPM8 is a polymodal, nonselective cation channel activated by cold temperature and cooling agents that plays a critical role in the detection of environmental cold. We found that TRPM8 is a pharmacological target of tacrolimus (FK506), a macrolide immunosuppressant with several clinical uses, including the treatment of organ rejection following transplants, treatment of atopic dermatitis, and dry eye disease. Tacrolimus is an inhibitor of the phosphatase calcineurin, an action shared with cyclosporine. Tacrolimus activates TRPM8 channels in different species, including humans, and sensitizes their response to cold temperature by inducing a leftward shift in the voltage-dependent activation curve. The effects of tacrolimus on purified TRPM8 in lipid bilayers demonstrates conclusively that it has a direct gating effect. Moreover, the lack of effect of cyclosporine rules out the canonical signaling pathway involving the phosphatase calcineurin. Menthol (TRPM8-Y745H)- and icilin (TRPM8-N799A)-insensitive mutants were also activated by tacrolimus, suggesting a different binding site. In cultured mouse DRG neurons, tacrolimus evokes an increase in intracellular calcium almost exclusively in cold-sensitive neurons, and these responses were drastically blunted in <i>Trpm8 KO</i> mice or after the application of TRPM8 antagonists. Cutaneous and corneal cold thermoreceptor endings are also activated by tacrolimus, and tacrolimus solutions trigger blinking and cold-evoked behaviors. Together, our results identify TRPM8 channels in sensory neurons as molecular targets of the immunosuppressant tacrolimus. The actions of tacrolimus on TRPM8 resemble those of menthol but likely involve interactions with other channel residues.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> TRPM8 is a polymodal TRP channel involved in cold temperature sensing, thermoregulation, and cold pain. TRPM8 is also involved in the pathophysiology of dry eye disease, and TRPM8 activation has antiallodynic and antipruritic effects, making it a prime therapeutic target in several cutaneous and neural diseases. We report the direct agonist effect of tacrolimus, a potent natural immunosuppressant with multiple clinical applications, on TRPM8 activity. This interaction represents a novel neuroimmune interface. The identification of a clinically approved drug with agonist activity on TRPM8 channels could be used experimentally to probe the function of TRPM8 in humans. Our findings may explain some of the sensory and anti-inflammatory effects described for this drug in the skin and the eye surface.</p>

<p>In a recent publication (Tzvetanov (2018), bioRxiv 465807), I made an
extensive analysis with computational modelling and psychophysics of the simple
experimental design of Dr. D.Tadin (Tadin, Lappin, Gilroy and Blake (2003),
Nature, 424:312-315) about motion perception changes in humans due to size and
contrast of the stimulus. This publication sparked from strong claims made in
Schallmo et al. (2018) (eLife, 7:e30334) about two important points: (1)
"divisive normalization", not inhibitory and excitatory mechanisms, creates the
observed psychophysical results and (2) drug-enhanced inhibition showed
perceptual outcomes that hint to "weaker suppression" (i.e. inhibition) not
stronger "suppression". Schallmo &amp; Murray (2018, bioRxiv, 495291) presented
concerns about my extensive publication, specifically about the parts where I
directly analysed some of their methods, results and claims. Here, I show that
their concerns do not provide clear answers to my specific points and further
do not mention other major critiques of data interpretation and modelling of
this experimental design. Therefore, I maintain all my claims that were
elaborated in details in my first publication (Tzvetanov, 2018, bioRxiv
465807): the specific ones that analyse the results of their and other studies,
but also the more broad modelling that is applicable to any study using the
simple experimental design of Dr. D.Tadin.

<p>The aim of a number of psychophysics tasks is to uncover how mammals make
decisions in a world that is in flux. Here we examine the characteristics of
ideal and near--ideal observers in a task of this type. We ask when and how
performance depends on task parameters and design, and, in turn, what observer
performance tells us about their decision-making process. In the dynamic clicks
task subjects hear two streams (left and right) of Poisson clicks with
different rates. Subjects are rewarded when they correctly identify the side
with the higher rate, as this side switches unpredictably. We show that a
reduced set of task parameters defines regions in parameter space in which
optimal, but not near-optimal observers, maintain constant response accuracy.
We also show that for a range of task parameters an approximate normative model
must be finely tuned to reach near-optimal performance, illustrating a
potential way to distinguish between normative models and their approximations.
In addition, we show that using the negative log-likelihood and the 0/1-loss
functions to fit these types of models is not equivalent: the 0/1-loss leads to
a bias in parameter recovery that increases with sensory noise. These findings
suggest ways to tease apart models that are hard to distinguish when tuned
exactly, and point to general pitfalls in experimental design, model fitting,
and interpretation of the resulting data.

<p>The design and analysis of spiking neural network algorithms will be
accelerated by the advent of new theoretical approaches. In an attempt at such
approach, we provide a principled derivation of a spiking algorithm for
unsupervised learning, starting from the nonnegative similarity matching cost
function. The resulting network consists of integrate-and-fire units and
exhibits local learning rules, making it biologically plausible and also
suitable for neuromorphic hardware. We show in simulations that the algorithm
can perform sparse feature extraction and manifold learning, two tasks which
can be formulated as nonnegative similarity matching problems.

<p>fMRI is a unique non-invasive approach for understanding the functional
organization of the human brain, and task-based fMRI promotes identification of
functionally relevant brain regions associated with a given task. Here, we use
fMRI (using the Poffenberger Paradigm) data collected in mono- and dizygotic
twin pairs to propose a novel approach for assessing similarity in functional
networks. In particular, we compared network similarity between pairs of twins
in task-relevant and task-orthogonal networks. The proposed method measures the
similarity between functional networks using a geodesic distance between graph
Laplacians. With method we show that networks are more similar in monozygotic
twins compared to dizygotic twins. Furthermore, the similarity in monozygotic
twins is higher for task-relevant, than task-orthogonal networks.

The meaning and assumptions about what can be revealed through neuroscience color our understanding and questions about the brain. Today, neuroscientists are stepping into the traditional territory of philosophers and humanists, asking questions—and often revealing insights–into the nature of reason, free will, identity, and, ultimately, the mind. As an illustration of the broad impact of neuroscience, in a world with a rapidly growing aging population, families wonder whether technology can restore an identity robbed by Alzheimer’s or enhance cognition and memory against the erosion that typically accompanies aging.

In this issue of Neuron, Neuner et al. (2019) report the generation of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) transgenic mouse models on a panel of 28 background strains, showing marked background-dependent phenotypic variability. These findings imply that analogous variation in human AD phenotypes may be due, at least in part, to subtle effects of genetic background.

<p>by Robert Marsland III, Wenping Cui, Joshua Goldford, Alvaro Sanchez, Kirill Korolev, Pankaj Mehta</p>

A fundamental goal of microbial ecology is to understand what determines the diversity, stability, and structure of microbial ecosystems. The microbial context poses special conceptual challenges because of the strong mutual influences between the microbes and their chemical environment through the consumption and production of metabolites. By analyzing a generalized consumer resource model that explicitly includes cross-feeding, stochastic colonization, and thermodynamics, we show that complex microbial communities generically exhibit a transition as a function of available energy fluxes from a “resource-limited” regime where community structure and stability is shaped by energetic and metabolic considerations to a diverse regime where the dominant force shaping microbial communities is the overlap between species’ consumption preferences. These two regimes have distinct species abundance patterns, different functional profiles, and respond differently to environmental perturbations. Our model reproduces large-scale ecological patterns observed across multiple experimental settings such as nestedness and differential beta diversity patterns along energy gradients. We discuss the experimental implications of our results and possible connections with disorder-induced phase transitions in statistical physics.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/6rGQ4SobGjM" width="1" />

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>High remnant cholesterol concentrations are associated with high risk of ischemic heart disease, but whether this is also the case for ischemic stroke is unknown. We tested the hypothesis that high remnant cholesterol concentrations are associated with increased risk of ischemic stroke in the general population.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>102,964 individuals from the Copenhagen General Population Study with information on remnant cholesterol at baseline in 2003‐15 were included in a prospective observational association study. Individuals were followed for up to 14 years, during which time 2,488 were diagnosed with an ischemic stroke. Hazard ratios were estimated using Cox proportional hazard regression models. Results were independently confirmed in 9,548 individuals enrolled in the Copenhagen City Heart Study in 1991‐94; 983 ischemic strokes developed during up to 26 years of follow‐up.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Stepwise higher remnant cholesterol concentrations were associated with stepwise higher ischemic stroke risk in the Copenhagen General Population Study, with multivariable adjusted hazard ratios up to 1.99(95%confidence interval: 1.49‐2.67) for individuals with remnant cholesterol concentrations ≥1.5mmol/L(58mg/dL), compared to individuals with remnant cholesterol &lt;0.5mmol/L(19mg/dL). Results were similar in the Copenhagen City Heart Study. Cumulative incidence of ischemic stroke at age 80 in the Copenhagen General Population Study ranged from 7.3% for individuals with remnant cholesterol &lt;0.5mmol/L(19mg/dL) to 11.5% for individuals with remnant cholesterol ≥1.5mmol/L(58mg/dL).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Individuals with high remnant cholesterol concentrations had higher risk of ischemic stroke. These results indicate that randomized clinical trials with remnant cholesterol lowering in individuals with high concentrations, with the aim of preventing ischemic strokes, are needed.</p>

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To identify shared polygenic risk and causal associations in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Linkage disequilibrium score regression and Mendelian randomization were applied in a large‐scale, data‐driven manner to explore genetic correlations and causal relationships between &gt; 700 phenotypic traits and ALS. Exposures consisted of publicly available genome‐wide association studies (GWASes) summary statistics from <i>MR Base</i> and <i>LD‐hub</i>. The outcome data came from the recently published ALS GWAS involving 20,806 cases and 59,804 controls. Multivariate analyses, genetic risk profiling and Bayesian colocalization analyses were also performed.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We have shown via linkage disequilibrium score regression that ALS shares polygenic risk genetic factors with a number of traits and conditions, including positive correlations with smoking status and moderate levels of physical activity, and negative correlations with higher cognitive performance, higher educational attainment, and light levels of physical activity. Using Mendelian randomization, we found evidence that hyperlipidemia is a causal risk factor for ALS and localized putative functional signals within loci of interest.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Here we have developed a public resource (<a href="https://lng-nia.shinyapps.io/mrshiny" target="_blank" title="Link to external resource">https://lng‐nia.shinyapps.io/mrshiny</a>) which we hope will become a valuable tool for the ALS community, and that will be expanded and updated as new data become available. Shared polygenic risk exists between ALS and educational attainment, physical activity, smoking and tenseness/restlessness. We also found evidence that elevated LDL cholesterol is a causal risk factor for ALS. Future randomized controlled trials should be considered as a proof of causality.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Postural instability and gait difficulties (PIGD) represent debilitating disturbances in Parkinson's disease (PD). Prior acetylcholinesterase PET imaging studies implicate cholinergic changes as significant contributors to PIGD features. These studies were limited in quantification of striatal cholinergic synapse integrity. Vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) PET ligands are better suited for evaluation of high binding areas. We examined associations between regional VAChT expression and freezing of gait (FoG) and falls.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Ninety‐four PD subjects underwent clinical assessment and VAChT ([<sup>18</sup>F]FEOBV) PET.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Thirty‐five subjects (37.2%) reported a history of falls and 15 (16%) had observed FoG. Univariate volume‐of‐interest analyses demonstrated significantly reduced thalamic (P=0.0016) VAChT expression in fallers compared to non‐fallers. VAChT expression was significantly reduced in the striatum (P=0.0012) and limbic archicortex (P=0.004) in freezers compared to non‐freezers. Whole brain voxel‐based analyses of FEOBV PET complemented these findings and showed more granular changes associated with falling history including the right visual thalamus (especially the right lateral geniculate nucleus, LGN), right caudate nucleus, and bilateral prefrontal regions. Freezers had prominent VAChT expression reductions in the bilateral striatum, temporal and mesiofrontal limbic regions.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings confirm and extend on previous PET findings of thalamic cholinergic deficits associated with falling history and now emphasize right visual thalamus complex changes, including the right LGN. FoG status is associated with reduced VAChT expression in striatal cholinergic interneurons and the limbic archicortex. These observations suggest different cholinergic systems changes underlying falls and FOG in PD.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To explore the association of post‐stroke baseline blood pressure with cerebral collateral flow and functional outcome in acute ischemic patients with large vessel occlusion/stenosis.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Patients identified with large vessel occlusion/stenosis with baseline multimodal computed tomography, follow‐up imaging, and complete clinical profiles were included. A 90‐day modified Rankin Scale of 0‐1 was defined as an excellent functional outcome. Cerebral collateral flow was quantified by the volume ratio of tissue within the delay time&gt;3 seconds perfusion lesion with severely delayed contrast transit (delay time&gt;3s/delay time&gt;6s).</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>There were 306 patients included in this study. With every increase of 10mmHg in baseline systolic blood pressure, the odds of achieving an excellent functional outcome decreased by 12% in multivariate analysis (odds ratio 0.88, P=0.048). Conversely, increased baseline blood pressure was associated with better collateral flow. In subgroup analysis of patients with major reperfusion, higher blood pressure was associated with decreased infarct growth and a better clinical outcome, and vice versa in patients without reperfusion.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Higher baseline blood pressure in acute ischemic stroke patients with large vessel occlusion/stenosis was associated with better collateral flow. However, for patients without reperfusion, higher baseline blood pressure was associated with increased infarct growth, leading to an unfavorable clinical outcome. The relationship between blood pressure and outcomes is highly dependent on reperfusion and active blood pressure lowering treatment may be inappropriate in acute ischemic stroke patients prior to reperfusion treatment.</p>

<p>A novel diffusion‐weighted magnetic resonance imaging protocol sensitive to contraction of individual skeletal motor units was developed. We applied this technique to the lower limb muscles of 4 patients with confirmed amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and 6 healthy controls. A 3‐minute scan revealed florid fasciculation in ALS patients, involving both superficial and deep muscles, and at a frequency higher than in healthy controls. This novel imaging technique reveals hitherto unobtainable information on human motor unit structure and function, which may allow earlier diagnosis and recruitment to clinical trials.

<p>Speech rhythms have been dealt with in three main ways: from the
introspective analyses of rhythm as a correlate of syllable and foot timing in
linguistics and applied linguistics, through analyses of durations of segments
of utterances associated with consonantal and vocalic properties, syllables,
feet and words, to models of rhythms in speech production and perception as
physical oscillations. The present study avoids introspection and
human-filtered annotation methods and extends the signal processing paradigm of
amplitude envelope spectrum analysis by adding an additional analytic step of
edge detection, and postulating the co-existence of multiple speech rhythms in
rhythm zones marked by identifiable edges (Rhythm Zone Theory, RZT). An
exploratory investigation of the utility of RZT is conducted, suggesting that
native and non-native readings of the same text are distinct sub-genres of read
speech: a reading by a US native speaker and non-native readings by relatively
low-performing Cantonese adult learners of English. The study concludes by
noting that with the methods used, RZT can distinguish between the speech
rhythms of well-defined sub-genres of native speaker reading vs. non-native
learner reading, but needs further refinement in order to be applied to the
paradoxically more complex speech of low-performing language learners, whose
speech rhythms are co-determined by non-fluency and disfluency factors in
addition to well-known linguistic factors of grammar, vocabulary and discourse
constraints.

<p>In this short communication I present a study on cortical thickness and
functional networks' coupling topology by cortical lobes. First, I demonstrated
modular organisation of these networks by the cortical surface frontal,
temporal, parietal and occipital divisions. Secondly, I mapped the coupling
topology of cortical thickness and functional networks for positive and
negative correlations. Finally, I showed that the coupled positive correlations
map onto within-lobe cortical interactions and negative onto between-lobes
interactions.

<p>by Wan Yang, Juan Li, Jeffrey Shaman</p>

Measles is a highly infectious, severe viral disease. The disease is targeted for global eradication; however, this result has proven challenging. In China, where countrywide vaccination coverage for the last decade has been above 95% (the threshold for measles elimination), measles continues to cause large epidemics. To diagnose factors contributing to the persistency of measles, here we develop a model-inference system to infer measles transmission dynamics in China. The model-inference system uses demographic and vaccination data for each year as model inputs to directly account for changing population dynamics (including births, deaths, migrations, and vaccination). In addition, it simultaneously estimates unobserved model variables and parameters based on incidence data. When fitted to yearly incidence data for the entire population, it is able to accurately estimate independent, out-of-sample age-specific incidence. Using this validated model-inference system, we are thus able to estimate epidemiological and demographical characteristics key to measles transmission during 1951–2004 for three key locations in China, including its capital Beijing. These characteristics include age-specific population susceptibility and incidence rates, the basic reproductive number (<i>R</i><sub>0</sub>), reporting rate, population mixing intensity, and amplitude of seasonality. Key differences among the three sites reveal population and epidemiological characteristics crucial for understanding the current persistence of measles epidemics in China. We also discuss the implications our findings have for future elimination strategies.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/k-kP7DF8SuQ" width="1" />

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25418?af=R">Neural function in DCC mutation carriers with and without mirror movements</a></h4>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Recently identified mutations of the axon guidance molecule receptor gene, <i>DCC,</i> present an opportunity to investigate, in living human brain, mechanisms affecting neural connectivity and the basis of mirror movements, involuntary contralateral responses that mirror voluntary unilateral actions. We hypothesized that haploinsufficient <i>DCC</i>
<sup>+/−</sup> mutation carriers with mirror movements would exhibit decreased <i>DCC</i> mRNA expression, a functional ipsilateral corticospinal tract, greater “mirroring” motor representations, and reduced interhemispheric inhibition. <i>DCC</i>
<sup>+/−</sup> mutation carriers without mirror movements might exhibit some of these features.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The participants (n = 52) included 13 <i>DCC</i>
<sup>+/−</sup> mutation carriers with mirror movements, 7 <i>DCC</i>
<sup>+/−</sup> mutation carriers without mirror movements, 13 relatives without the mutation or mirror movements, and 19 unrelated healthy volunteers. The multimodal approach comprised quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) under resting and task conditions, and measures of white matter integrity.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Mirror movements were associated with reduced <i>DCC</i> mRNA expression, increased ipsilateral TMS‐induced motor evoked potentials, increased fMRI responses in the mirroring M1 and cerebellum, and markedly reduced interhemispheric inhibition. The <i>DCC</i>
<sup>+/−</sup> mutation, irrespective of mirror movements, was associated with reduced functional connectivity and white matter integrity.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Diverse connectivity abnormalities were identified in mutation carriers with and without mirror movements, but corticospinal effects and decreased peripheral <i>DCC</i> mRNA appeared driven by the mirror movement phenotype. Ann Neurol 2019;00:1–10</p>

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Central nervous system (CNS) pathology in multiple sclerosis includes both focal inflammatory perivascular injury and injury to superficial structures, including the subpial region of the cortex, which reportedly exhibits a gradient of damage from the surface inwards. We assessed how early in the multiple sclerosis course a ‘surface‐in' process of injury suggesting progressive biology may begin.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We focused on the thalamus which notably has both a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) interface and a white matter interface. Thalamic volume trajectories were assessed in a prospectively followed cohort of children from initial presentation with either multiple sclerosis or monophasic acquired demyelination, and healthy controls. Voxel‐wise volume changes were calculated using deformation based morphometry, and analyzed in relation to distance from the CSF interface by mixed effects modeling and semiparametric smoothing methods.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Twenty‐seven children with multiple sclerosis and 73 children with monophasic demyelination were prospectively followed with yearly brain scans (mean follow‐up 4.6 years, SD 1.9). 282 healthy children with serial scans were included as controls. Relative to healthy controls, children with multiple sclerosis and children with monophasic demyelination demonstrated volume loss in thalamic regions adjacent to the white matter. However, only children with multiple sclerosis exhibited an additional ‘surface‐in' gradient of thalamic injury on the ventricular side, which was already notable in the first year of clinical disease (asymptote estimate 3.01, CI 1.44‐4.58, p = 0.0002) and worsened over time (asymptote:time estimate 0.33, CI 0.12‐0.54, p = 0.0021).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our results suggest that a multiple sclerosis‐disease specific ‘surface‐in' process of damage can manifest at the earliest stages of the disease.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The two related tumor necrosis factor members a proliferation‐inducing ligand (APRIL) and B‐cell activation factor (BAFF) are currently targeted in autoimmune diseases as B‐cell regulators. In multiple sclerosis (MS), combined APRIL/BAFF blockade led to unexpected exacerbated inflammation in the central nervous system (CNS) of patients. Here, we investigate the role of the APRIL/BAFF axis in the CNS.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>APRIL expression was analyzed in MS lesions by immunohistochemistry. The <i>in vivo</i> role of APRIL was assessed in the murine MS model, experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE). Functional <i>in vitro</i> studies were performed with human and mouse astrocytes.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>APRIL was expressed in lesions from EAE. In its absence, the disease was worst. Lesions from MS patients also showed APRIL expression upon infiltration of macrophages. Notably, all the APRIL secreted by these macrophages specifically targeted astrocytes. The upregulation of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan, sometimes bearing chondroitin sulfate of type E sugar moieties, binding APRIL, in reactive astrocytes explained the latter selectivity. Astrocytes responded to APRIL by producing a sufficient amount of IL‐10 to dampen antigen‐specific T‐cell proliferation and pathogenic cytokine secretion. Finally, an intraspinal delivery of recombinant APRIL before disease onset, shortly reduced EAE symptoms. Repeated intravenous injections of recombinant APRIL before and even at disease onset also had an effect.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our data show that APRIL mediates an anti‐inflammatory response from astrocytes in MS lesions. This protective activity is not shared with BAFF. Ann Neurol 2019;9999:1–15</p>

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25413?af=R">Cerebellar degeneration correlates with motor symptoms in Huntington disease</a></h4>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Huntington disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder characterized by variable motor and behavioral symptoms attributed to major neuropathology of mainly the basal ganglia and cerebral cortex. The role of the cerebellum, a brain region involved in the coordination of movements, in HD neuropathology has been controversial. This study utilizes postmortem human brain tissue to investigate whether Purkinje cell degeneration in the neocerebellum is present in HD, and how this relates to disease symptom profiles.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Unbiased stereological counting methods were used to quantify the total number of Purkinje cells in 15 HD cases and 8 neurologically normal control cases. Based on their predominant symptoms, the HD cases were categorized into 2 groups: “motor” or “mood.”</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The results demonstrated a significant 43% loss of Purkinje cells in HD cases with predominantly motor symptoms, and no cell loss in cases showing a major mood phenotype. There was no significant correlation between Purkinje cell loss and striatal neuropathological grade, postmortem delay, CAG repeat in the <i>IT15</i> gene, or age at death.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This study shows a compelling relationship between Purkinje cell loss in the HD neocerebellum and the HD motor symptom phenotype, which, together with our previous human brain studies on the same HD cases, provides novel perspectives interrelating and correlating the variable cerebellar, basal ganglia, and neocortical neuropathology with the variability of motor/mood symptom profiles in the human HD brain.

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To investigate the initial termination rate of status epilepticus (SE) in a large observational study and explore associated variables.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Data of adults treated for SE were collected prospectively in centers in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, during 4.5 years. Incident episodes of 1,049 patients were analyzed using uni‐ and multivariate statistics to determine factors predicting cessation of SE within 1 hour (for generalized convulsive SE [GCSE]) and 12 hours (for non‐GCSE) of initiating treatment.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Median age at SE onset was 70 years; most frequent etiologies were remote (32%) and acute (31%). GCSE was documented in 43%. Median latency between SE onset and first treatment was 30 minutes in GCSE and 150 minutes in non‐GCSE. The first intravenous compound was a benzodiazepine in 86% in GCSE and 73% in non‐GCSE. Bolus doses of the first treatment step were lower than recommended by current guidelines in 76% of GCSE patients and 78% of non‐GCSE patients. In 319 GCSE patients (70%), SE was ongoing 1 hour after initiating treatment and in 342 non‐GCSE patients (58%) 12 hours after initiating treatment. Multivariate Cox regression demonstrated that use of benzodiazepines as first treatment step and a higher cumulative dose of anticonvulsants within the first period of treatment were associated with shorter time to cessation of SE for both groups.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In clinical practice, treatment guidelines were not followed in a substantial proportion of patients. This underdosing correlated with lack of cessation of SE. Our data suggest that sufficiently dosed benzodiazepines should be used as a first treatment step. Ann Neurol 2019;00:1–12</p>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>We mapped alterations of the functional structure of the cerebral cortex using a novel imaging approach in a sample of 160 obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) patients. Whole-brain functional connectivity maps were generated using multidistance measures of intracortical neural activity coupling defined within isodistant local areas. OCD patients demonstrated neural activity desynchronization within the orbitofrontal cortex and in primary somatosensory, auditory, visual, gustatory, and olfactory areas. Symptom severity was significantly associated with the degree of functional structure alteration in OCD-relevant brain regions. By means of a novel imaging perspective, we once again identified brain alterations in the orbitofrontal cortex, involving areas purportedly implicated in the pathophysiology of OCD. However, our results also indicated that weaker intracortical activity coupling is also present in each primary sensory area. On the basis of previous neurophysiological studies, such cortical activity desynchronization may best be interpreted as reflecting deficient inhibitory neuron activity and altered sensory filtering.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Dysfunction of motor cortices is thought to contribute to motor disorders such as Parkinson’s disease (PD). However, little is known on the link between cortical dopaminergic loss, abnormalities in motor cortex neural activity and motor deficits. We address the role of dopamine in modulating motor cortical activity by focusing on the anterior lateral motor cortex (ALM) of mice performing a cued-licking task. We first demonstrate licking deficits and concurrent alterations of spiking activity in ALM of head-fixed mice with unilateral depletion of dopaminergic neurons (i.e., mice injected with 6-OHDA into the medial forebrain bundle). Hemilesioned mice displayed delayed licking initiation, shorter duration of licking bouts, and lateral deviation of tongue protrusions. In parallel with these motor deficits, we observed a reduction in the prevalence of cue responsive neurons and altered preparatory activity. Acute and local blockade of D1 receptors in ALM recapitulated some of the key behavioral and neural deficits observed in hemilesioned mice. Altogether, our data show a direct relationship between cortical D1 receptor modulation, cue-evoked, and preparatory activity in ALM, and licking initiation.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>To uncover the ontogenesis of the human indusium griseum (IG), 28 post-mortem fetal human brains, 12–40 postconceptional weeks (PCW) of age, and 4 adult brains were analyzed immunohistochemically and compared with post-mortem magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of 28 fetal brains (14–41 PCW). The morphogenesis of the IG occurred between 12 and 15 PCW, transforming the bilateral IG primordia into a ribbon-like cortical lamina. The histogenetic transition of sub-laminated zones into the three-layered cortical organization occurred between 15 and 35 PCW, concomitantly with rapid cell differentiation that occurred from 18 to 28 PCW and the elaboration of neuronal connectivity during the entire second half of gestation. The increasing number of total cells and neurons in the IG at 25 and 35 PCW confirmed its continued differentiation throughout this period. High-field 3.0 T post-mortem MRI enabled visualization of the IG at the mid-fetal stage using T2-weighted sequences. In conclusion, the IG had a distinct histogenetic differentiation pattern than that of the neighboring intralimbic areas of the same ontogenetic origin, and did not show any signs of regression during the fetal period or postnatally, implying a functional role of the IG in the adult brain, which is yet to be disclosed.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>In many species of Mammalia, the surface of the brain develops from a smooth structure to one with many fissures and folds, allowing for vast expansion of the surface area of the cortex. The importance of understanding what drives cortical folding extends beyond mere curiosity, as conditions such as preterm birth, intrauterine growth restriction, and fetal alcohol syndrome are associated with impaired folding in the infant and child. Despite being a key feature of brain development, the mechanisms driving cortical folding remain largely unknown. In this review we discuss the possible role of the subplate, a developmentally transient compartment, in directing region-dependent development leading to sulcal and gyral formation. We discuss the development of the subplate in species with lissencephalic and gyrencephalic cortices, the characteristics of the cells found in the subplate, and the possible presence of molecular cues that guide axons into, and out of, the overlying and multilayered cortex before the appearance of definitive cortical folds. An understanding of what drives cortical folding is likely to help in understanding the origins of abnormal folding patterns in clinical pathologies.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>During early development, the infant brain is highly plastic and sensory experiences modulate emerging cortical maps, enhancing processing efficiency as infants set up key linguistic precursors. Early interactive acoustic experience (IAE) with spectrotemporally-modulated non-speech has been shown to facilitate optimal acoustic processing and generalizes to novel non-speech sounds at 7-months-of-age. Here we demonstrate that effects of non-speech IAE endure well beyond the immediate training period and robustly generalize to speech processing. Infants who received non-speech IAE differed at 9-months-of-age from both naïve controls and those with only passive acoustic exposure, demonstrating broad modulation of oscillatory dynamics. For the standard syllable, increased high-gamma (&gt;70 Hz) power within auditory cortices indicates that IAE fosters native speech processing, facilitating establishment of phonemic representations. The higher left beta power seen may reflect increased linking of sensory information and corresponding articulatory patterns, while bilateral decreases in theta power suggest more mature automatized speech processing, as less neuronal resources were allocated to process syllabic information. For the deviant syllable, left-lateralized gamma (&lt;70 Hz) enhancement suggests IAE promotes phonemic-related discrimination abilities. Theta power increases in right auditory cortex, known for favoring slow-rate decoding, implies IAE facilitates the more demanding processing of the sporadic deviant syllable.</span>

Based on our recent discovery in a large GWAS dataset that suggested an association of <span style="font-style: italic;">TANK</span>, SNP rs197273, with alcohol drinking, we report that SNP rs197273 in <span style="font-style: italic;">TANK</span> is associated both with gene expression (<span style="font-style: italic;">P</span> = 1.16 × 10<sup>−19</sup>) and regional methylation (<span style="font-style: italic;">P</span> = 5.90 × 10<sup>−25</sup>). A <span style="font-style: italic;">tank</span> knock out mouse model suggests a role of TANK in alcohol drinking, anxiety-related behavior, as well as alcohol exposure induced activation of insular cortex NF-κB. Functional and structural neuroimaging studies among up to 1896 adolescents reveal that TANK is involved in the control of brain activity in areas of aversive interoceptive processing, including the insular cortex, but not in areas related to reinforcement, reward processing or impulsiveness. Our findings suggest that the cortical neuroimmune regulator TANK is associated with enhanced aversive emotional processing that better protects from the establishment of alcohol drinking behavior.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The hippocampus displays a complex organization and function that is perturbed in many neuropathologies. Histological work revealed a complex arrangement of subfields along the medial–lateral and the ventral–dorsal dimension, which contrasts with the anterior–posterior functional differentiation. The variety of maps has raised the need for an integrative multimodal view. We applied connectivity-based parcellation to 1) intrinsic connectivity 2) task-based connectivity, and 3) structural covariance, as complementary windows into structural and functional differentiation of the hippocampus. Strikingly, while functional properties (i.e., intrinsic and task-based) revealed similar partitions dominated by an anterior–posterior organization, structural covariance exhibited a hybrid pattern reflecting both functional and cytoarchitectonic subdivision. Capitalizing on the consistency of functional parcellations, we defined robust functional maps at different levels of partitions, which are openly available for the scientific community. Our functional maps demonstrated a head–body and tail partition, subdivided along the anterior–posterior and medial–lateral axis. Behavioral profiling of these fine partitions based on activation data indicated an emotion–cognition gradient along the anterior–posterior axis and additionally suggested a self-world-centric gradient supporting the role of the hippocampus in the construction of abstract representations for spatial navigation and episodic memory.</span>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Genetic modifiers in rare disease have long been suspected to contribute to the considerable variance in disease expression, including Charcot‐Marie‐Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A). To address this question the Inherited Neuropathy Consortium collected a large standardized sample of such rare CMT1A patients over a period of eight years. CMT1A is caused in most patients by a uniformly sized 1.5Mb duplication event involving the gene <i>PMP22</i>.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We genotyped DNA samples from 971 CMT1A patients on Illumina beadchips. Genome‐wide analysis was performed in a subset of 330 of these patients, who expressed the extremes of a hallmark symptom: mild and severe foot dorsiflexion strength impairment. <i>SIPA1L2</i> (signal induced proliferation associated 1 like 2), the top identified candidate modifier gene, was expressed in the peripheral nerve and our functional studies identified and confirmed interacting proteins using co‐immunoprecipitation analysis, mass spectrometry, and immunocytochemistry. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and <i>in vitro</i> siRNA experiments were used to analyze gene regulation.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We identified significant association of four SNPs (rs10910527, rs7536385, rs4649265, rs1547740) in <i>SIPA1L2</i> with foot dorsiflexion strength (P &lt; 1×10<sup>‐7</sup>). Co‐immunoprecipitation and mass‐spectroscopy studies identified β‐actin and MYH9 as SIPA1L2 binding partners. Further, we show that <i>SIPA1L2</i> is part of a myelination‐associated co‐expressed network regulated by the master transcription factor SOX10. Importantly, <i>in vitro</i> knock‐down of <i>SIPA1L2</i> in Schwannoma cells lead to a significant reduction of <i>PMP22</i> expression, hinting at a potential strategy for drug development.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>offers a new pathway to therapeutic interventions.</p>

<p>Publication date: August 2019</p><p><b>Source:</b> Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 57</p><p>Author(s): Swathi Ayloo, Chenghua Gu</p><div><p>The blood–brain barrier (BBB) is a functional interface separating the brain from the circulatory system and is essential for homeostasis of the central nervous system (CNS). The BBB regulates molecular flux to maintain an optimal environment for neuronal function and protects the brain from toxins and pathogens. Endothelial cells forming the walls of CNS blood vessels constitute the BBB. CNS endothelial cells exhibit two features that underlie the restrictive properties of the BBB: specialized tight junctions that prevent paracellular passage between the blood and the brain, and unusually low levels of vesicle trafficking that limit transcellular transport or transcytosis. While the prevailing view in the field was that specialized tight junctions contributed to CNS barrier properties, recent findings have revealed the importance of maintaining low rates of transcytosis at the BBB. It is now clear that suppression of transcytosis at the BBB is an active process and CNS-specific genetic programs inhibit this pathway to maintain a functional barrier.</p></div>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The neural substrates of intelligence represent a fundamental but largely uncharted topic in human developmental neuroscience. Prior neuroimaging studies have identified modest but highly dynamic associations between intelligence and cortical thickness (CT) in childhood and adolescence. In a separate thread of research, quantitative genetic studies have repeatedly demonstrated that most measures of intelligence are highly heritable, as are many brain regions associated with intelligence. In the current study, we integrate these 2 streams of prior work by examining the genetic contributions to CT–intelligence relationships using a genetically informative longitudinal sample of 813 typically developing youth, imaged with high-resolution MRI and assessed with Wechsler Intelligence Scales (IQ). In addition to replicating the phenotypic association between multimodal association cortex and language centers with IQ, we find that CT–IQ covariance is nearly entirely genetically mediated. Moreover, shared genetic factors drive the rapidly evolving landscape of CT–IQ relationships in the developing brain.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>In early blind individuals, brain activation by a variety of nonperceptual cognitive tasks extends to the visual cortex, while in the sighted it is restricted to supramodal association areas. We hypothesized that such activation results from the integration of different sectors of the visual cortex into typical task-dependent networks. We tested this hypothesis with fMRI in blind and sighted subjects using tasks assessing speech comprehension, incidental long-term memory and both verbal and nonverbal executive control, in addition to collecting resting-state data. All tasks activated the visual cortex in blind relative to sighted subjects, which enabled its segmentation according to task sensitivity. We then assessed the unique brain-scale functional connectivity of the segmented areas during resting state. Language-related seeds were preferentially connected to frontal and temporal language areas; the seed derived from the executive task was connected to the right dorsal frontoparietal executive network; and the memory-related seed was uniquely connected to mesial frontoparietal areas involved in episodic memory retrieval. Thus, using a broad set of language, executive, and memory tasks in the same subjects, combined with resting state connectivity, we demonstrate the selective integration of different patches of the visual cortex into brain-scale networks with distinct localization, lateralization, and functional roles.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Although the central medial nucleus (CeM) of the thalamus is an essential part of the arousal system for sleep and anesthesia initiation, the precise mechanisms that regulate its activity are not well studied. We examined the role of Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1 isoform of T-type calcium channels (T-channels) in the excitability and rhythmic activity of CeM neurons during isoflurane (ISO)-induced anesthesia by using mouse genetics and selective pharmacology. Patch-clamp recordings taken from acute brain slices revealed that Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1 channels in CeM are inhibited by prototypical volatile anesthetic ISO (250 and 500 μM) and selective T-channels blocker 3,5-dichloro-<span style="font-style: italic;">N</span>-[1-(2,2-dimethyl-tetrahydro-pyran-4-ylmethyl)-4-fluoro-piperidin-4-ylmethyl]-benzamide (TTA-P2). Both TTA-P2 and ISO attenuated tonic and burst firing modes, and hyperpolarized CeM neurons from wild type (WT) mice. These effects were greatly diminished or abolished in Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1 null mice. Our ensuing in vivo local field potential (LFP) recordings from CeM indicated that the ability of TTA-P2 and anesthetic concentrations of ISO to promote δ oscillation was substantially weakened in Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1 null mice. Furthermore, escalating ISO concentrations induced stronger burst-suppression LFP pattern in mutant than in WT mice. Our results demonstrate for the first time the importance of Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1 channels in thalamocortical oscillations from the non-specific thalamic nuclei that underlie clinically important effects of ISO.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>In Parkinson’s disease, the degeneration of the midbrain dopaminergic neurons is consistently associated with modified metabolic activity in the cerebellum. Here we examined the functional reorganization taking place in the cerebello–cerebral circuit in a murine model of Parkinson’s disease with 6-OHDA lesion of midbrain dopaminergic neurons. Cerebellar optogenetic stimulations evoked similar movements in control and lesioned mice, suggesting a normal coupling of cerebellum to the motor effectors after the lesion. In freely moving animals, the firing rate in the primary motor cortex was decreased after the lesion, while cerebellar nuclei neurons showed an increased firing rate. This increase may result from reduced inhibitory Purkinje cells inputs, since a population of slow and irregular Purkinje cells was observed in the cerebellar hemispheres of lesioned animals. Moreover, cerebellar stimulations generated smaller electrocortical responses in the motor cortex of lesioned animals suggesting a weaker cerebello–cerebral coupling. Overall these results indicate the presence of functional changes in the cerebello–cerebral circuit, but their ability to correct cortical dysfunction may be limited due to functional uncoupling between the cerebellum and cerebral cortex.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>A consensus on the number of morphologically different types of pyramidal cells (PCs) in the neocortex has not yet been reached, despite over a century of anatomical studies, due to the lack of agreement on the subjective classifications of neuron types, which is based on expert analyses of neuronal morphologies. Even for neurons that are visually distinguishable, there is no common ground to consistently define morphological types. The objective classification of PCs can be achieved with methods from algebraic topology, and the dendritic arborization is sufficient for the reliable identification of distinct types of cortical PCs. Therefore, we objectively identify 17 types of PCs in the rat somatosensory cortex. In addition, we provide a solution to the challenging problem of whether 2 similar neurons belong to different types or to a continuum of the same type. Our topological classification does not require expert input, is stable, and helps settle the long-standing debate on whether cell-types are discrete or continuous morphological variations of each other.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The mammalian cerebral cortex is divided into different areas according to their function and pattern of connections. Studies comparing primary visual (V1) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) of primates have demonstrated striking pyramidal neuron (PN) specialization not present in comparable areas of the mouse neocortex. To better understand PFC evolution and regional PN specialization, we studied the tree shrew, a species with a close phylogenetic relationship to primates. We defined the tree shrew PFC based on cytoarchitectonic borders, thalamic connectivity and characterized the morphology and electrophysiology of layer II/III PNs in V1 and PFC. Similar to primates, the PFC PNs in the tree shrew fire with a regular spiking pattern and have larger dendritic tree and spines than those in V1. However, V1 PNs showed strikingly large basal dendritic arbors with high spine density, firing at higher rates and in a more varied pattern than PFC PNs. Yet, unlike in the mouse and unreported in the primate, medial prefrontal PN are more easily recruited than either the dorsolateral or V1 neurons. This specialization of PN morphology and physiology is likely to be a significant factor in the evolution of cortex, contributing to differences in the computational capacities of individual cortical areas.</span>

The multifaceted functions of the brain are borne through seemingly infinite spatiotemporal interactions between its resident neural elements. Using a combinatorial approach, Schuman and colleagues (J. Neurosci. 2018;39:125–139) recently identify four layer 1 cortical interneuron subtypes, including a hitherto uncharacterized neuron they term the ‘canopy’ cell. Properties unique to each of the subtypes likely endow them with distinct roles in top-down processing.

<p>Publication date: August 2019</p><p><b>Source:</b> Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 57</p><p>Author(s): Diane Lipscombe, Eduardo Javier Lopez Soto</p><div><p>Dynamic changes in alternative splicing during the life cycle of neurons support development and plasticity, and are implicated in disease pathology. Cell-specific alternative splicing programs coordinate exon selection across networks of functionally connected genes. In this opinion piece, we highlight recent publications that identify some of the molecular mechanisms—RNA and DNA binding proteins and epigenetic modifications—which direct cell-specific exon selection during pre-mRNA splicing. Aberrant splicing patterns are signature features of a growing number of diseases of the nervous system. Recent publications demonstrate the value of delineating basic mechanisms that dictate exon choice to inform the development of new therapeutic strategies that correct or compensate for damaging deficits in alternative splicing.</p></div>

<p>Publication date: June 2019</p><p><b>Source:</b> Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 56</p><p>Author(s): Alexander Shakeel Bates, Jasper Janssens, Gregory SXE Jefferis, Stein Aerts</p><div><p>At around 150 000 neurons, the adult <em>Drosophila melanogaster</em> central nervous system is one of the largest species, for which a complete cellular catalogue is imminent. While numerically much simpler than mammalian brains, its complexity is still difficult to parse without grouping neurons into consistent types, which can number 1–1000 cells per hemisphere. We review how neuroanatomical and gene expression data are being used to discover neuronal types at scale. The correlation among multiple co-varying neuronal properties, including lineage, gene expression, morphology, connectivity, response properties and shared behavioral significance is essential to the definition of neuronal cell type. Initial studies comparing morphological and transcriptomic definitions of neuronal type suggest that these are highly consistent, but there is much to do to match these approaches brain-wide. Matched single-cell transcriptomic and morphological data provide an effective reference point to integrate other data types, including connectomics data. This will significantly enhance our ability to make functional predictions from brain wiring diagrams as well facilitating molecular genetic manipulation of neuronal types.</p></div>

<p>Publication date: August 2019</p><p><b>Source:</b> Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 57</p><p>Author(s): Jeremy S Dittman</p><div><p>Nervous systems are built on synaptic connections, and our understanding of these complex compartments has deepened over the past quarter century as the diverse fields of genetics, molecular biology, physiology, and biochemistry each made significant in-roads into synaptic function. On the presynaptic side, an evolutionarily conserved core fusion apparatus constructed from a handful of proteins has emerged, with Unc13 serving as a hub that coordinates nearly every aspect of synaptic transmission. This review briefly highlights recent studies on diverse aspects of Unc13 function including roles in SNARE assembly and quality control, release site building, calcium channel proximity, and short-term synaptic plasticity.</p></div>

<p>Publication date: June 2019</p><p><b>Source:</b> Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 56</p><p>Author(s): Elizabeth A Williams, Gáspár Jékely</p><div><p>The marine annelid <em>Platynereis dumerilii</em> is an invertebrate laboratory model for developmental biology and neuroscience. Its larval stages are small and transparent, enabling whole-body analyses of cell-type diversity and neuronal circuits. Here, we review the diversity of neuronal cell types in <em>Platynereis</em>. A variety of approaches have been used to identify cell types in <em>Platynereis</em> including whole-body gene expression atlases, single-cell RNA-seq and whole-body connectomics through serial EM reconstruction. The function of several cell types and neuronal circuits has also been analysed with experimental approaches. <em>Platynereis</em> has aspects of biology and cell types that are absent from the major invertebrate model organisms (<em>C. elegans</em> and <em>Drosophila</em>) including ciliary locomotion, noradrenergic neurons and ciliary photoreceptor cells.</p></div>
