              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11644">HetSyn: Versatile Timescale Integration in Spiking Neural Networks via Heterogeneous Synapses</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2508.11644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer a biologically plausible and energy-efficient framework for temporal information processing. However, existing studies overlook a fundamental property widely observed in biological neurons-synaptic heterogeneity, which plays a crucial role in temporal processing and cognitive capabilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce HetSyn, a generalized framework that models synaptic heterogeneity with synapse-specific time constants. This design shifts temporal integration from the membrane potential to the synaptic current, enabling versatile timescale integration and allowing the model to capture diverse synaptic dynamics. We implement HetSyn as HetSynLIF, an extended form of the leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) model equipped with synapse-specific decay dynamics. By adjusting the parameter configuration, HetSynLIF can be specialized into vanilla LIF neurons, neurons with threshold adaptation, and neuron-level heterogeneous models. We demonstrate that HetSynLIF not only improves the performance of SNNs across a variety of tasks-including pattern generation, delayed match-to-sample, speech recognition, and visual recognition-but also exhibits strong robustness to noise, enhanced working memory performance, efficiency under limited neuron resources, and generalization across timescales. In addition, analysis of the learned synaptic time constants reveals trends consistent with empirical observations in biological synapses. These findings underscore the significance of synaptic heterogeneity in enabling efficient neural computation, offering new insights into brain-inspired temporal modeling.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11672">Revealing Neurocognitive and Behavioral Patterns by Unsupervised Manifold Learning from Dynamic Brain Data</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2508.11672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic brain data, teeming with biological and functional insights, are becoming increasingly accessible through advanced measurements, providing a gateway to understanding the inner workings of the brain in living subjects. However, the vast size and intricate complexity of the data also pose a daunting challenge in reliably extracting meaningful information across various data sources. This paper introduces a generalizable unsupervised deep manifold learning for exploration of neurocognitive and behavioral patterns. Unlike existing methods that extract patterns directly from the input data as in the existing methods, the proposed Brain-dynamic Convolutional-Network-based Embedding (BCNE) seeks to capture the brain-state trajectories by deciphering the temporospatial correlations within the data and subsequently applying manifold learning to this correlative representation. The performance of BCNE is showcased through the analysis of several important dynamic brain datasets. The results, both visual and quantitative, reveal a diverse array of intriguing and interpretable patterns. BCNE effectively delineates scene transitions, underscores the involvement of different brain regions in memory and narrative processing, distinguishes various stages of dynamic learning processes, and identifies differences between active and passive behaviors. BCNE provides an effective tool for exploring general neuroscience inquiries or individual-specific patterns.

                arXiv:2508.12541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Insight into how information can propagate within cortical networks is essential for a more complete understanding of neural dynamics and computation in complex networks. Networks with clustered connections have previously been shown to give rise to correlated dynamics in individual clusters. However, this same model applied to a network with highly heterogeneous cluster sizes leads to a clear breakdown of the balanced state. In this article, using a formal definition of the balance matrix, we show why the balance condition breaks and propose a solution to restore balance in heterogeneous networks by reweighing the connection strengths based on community sizes. We introduce a method of partially balancing a heterogeneous network and show that the degree of spontaneous synchronization within communities can be varied using a single parameter describing the reweighing. We further show that stimuli can propagate through a hierarchically clustered network, where stimulating one cluster of neurons in a densely connected pair induces correlated firing in the other without propagating to other weakly connected clusters.

                arXiv:2508.11684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Objective: This study proposes and preliminarily validates a novel "Functional-Energetic Topology Model" to uncover neurodynamic mechanisms of Non-Suicidal Self-Injury (NSSI), using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to decode brain network patterns from single-channel EEG in real-world settings.Methods: EEG data were collected over ~1 month from three adolescents with NSSI using a smartphone app and a portable Fp1 EEG headband during impulsive and non-impulsive states. A theory-driven GNN with seven functional nodes was built. Performance was evaluated via intra-subject (80/20 split) and leave-one-subject-out cross-validation (LOSOCV). GNNExplainer was used for interpretability.Results: The model achieved high intra-subject accuracy (>85%) and significantly above-chance cross-subject performance (approximately73.7%). Explainability analysis revealed a key finding: during NSSI states, a critical feedback loop regulating somatic sensation exhibits dysfunction and directional reversal. Specifically, the brain loses its ability to self-correct via negative bodily feedback, and the regulatory mechanism enters an "ineffective idling" state.Conclusion: This work demonstrates the feasibility of applying theory-guided GNNs to sparse, single-channel EEG for decoding complex mental states. The identified "feedback loop reversal" offers a novel, dynamic, and computable model of NSSI mechanisms, paving the way for objective biomarkers and next-generation Digital Therapeutics (DTx).

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12027">Active inference for action-unaware agents</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2508.12027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active inference is a formal approach to study cognition based on the notion that adaptive agents can be seen as engaging in a process of approximate Bayesian inference, via the minimisation of variational and expected free energies. Minimising the former provides an account of perceptual processes and learning as evidence accumulation, while minimising the latter describes how agents select their actions over time. In this way, adaptive agents are able to maximise the likelihood of preferred observations or states, given a generative model of the environment. In the literature, however, different strategies have been proposed to describe how agents can plan their future actions. While they all share the notion that some kind of expected free energy offers an appropriate way to score policies, sequences of actions, in terms of their desirability, there are different ways to consider the contribution of past motor experience to the agent's future behaviour. In some approaches, agents are assumed to know their own actions, and use such knowledge to better plan for the future. In other approaches, agents are unaware of their actions, and must infer their motor behaviour from recent observations in order to plan for the future. This difference reflects a standard point of departure in two leading frameworks in motor control based on the presence, or not, of an efference copy signal representing knowledge about an agent's own actions. In this work we compare the performances of action-aware and action-unaware agents in two navigations tasks, showing how action-unaware agents can achieve performances comparable to action-aware ones while at a severe disadvantage.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12533">Defining and Benchmarking a Data-Centric Design Space for Brain Graph Construction</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2508.12533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The construction of brain graphs from functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data plays a crucial role in enabling graph machine learning for neuroimaging. However, current practices often rely on rigid pipelines that overlook critical data-centric choices in how brain graphs are constructed. In this work, we adopt a Data-Centric AI perspective and systematically define and benchmark a data-centric design space for brain graph construction, constrasting with primarily model-centric prior work. We organize this design space into three stages: temporal signal processing, topology extraction, and graph featurization. Our contributions lie less in novel components and more in evaluating how combinations of existing and modified techniques influence downstream performance. Specifically, we study high-amplitude BOLD signal filtering, sparsification and unification strategies for connectivity, alternative correlation metrics, and multi-view node and edge features, such as incorporating lagged dynamics. Experiments on the HCP1200 and ABIDE datasets show that thoughtful data-centric configurations consistently improve classification accuracy over standard pipelines. These findings highlight the critical role of upstream data decisions and underscore the importance of systematically exploring the data-centric design space for graph-based neuroimaging. Our code is available at https://github.com/GeQinwen/DataCentricBrainGraphs.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00720">Overground gait transitions are not sharp but involve gradually changing walk-run mixtures even over long distances</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2501.00720v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Humans typically walk at low speeds and run at higher speeds. Previous studies of transitions between walking and running were mostly on treadmills, but real-world locomotion allows more flexibility. Here, we study overground locomotion over long distances (800 m or 2400 m) under time constraints, simulating everyday scenarios like going to an appointment. Unlike on treadmills, participants can vary both speed and gait during this task. We find that gait transition in this overground task occurs over a broad `gait transition regime' spanning average speeds from 1.9 m/s to 3.0 m/s. In this regime, people use mixtures of walking and running: mostly walking at low average speeds (around 1.9 m/s) and mostly running at high average speeds (3.0 m/s); the walk vs run fraction gradually changes between these speed limits. Within any walk-run mixture, there is a speed gap between the walking and running. These gait mixtures and their specific structure are predicted by energy optimality. These findings extend earlier results from much shorter distance tasks, showing that similar energetic principles govern longer, more physically and cognitively demanding tasks. Overall, our results highlight the role of whole-task energy minimization including transients in shaping human locomotion.

                arXiv:2504.06255v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neurons in sensory systems encode stimulus information into their stochastic spiking response. The mutual information has been extensively applied to these systems to quantify the neurons' capacity of transmitting such information. Yet, while for discrete stimuli, like flashed images or single tones, its computation is straightforward, for dynamical stimuli it is necessary to compute a (mutual) information rate (MIR), therefore integrating over the multiple temporal correlations which characterize sensory systems. Previous methods are based on extensive sampling of the neuronal response, require large amounts of data and are therefore prone to biases and inaccuracy. Here, we develop Moba-MIRA (moment-based mutual-information-rate approximation), a computational method to estimate the mutual information rate. To derive Moba-MIRA, we use Feynman diagrams to expand the mutual information to arbitrary order in the correlations around the corresponding value for the empirical spike count distributions of single bins. As a result, only the empirical estimation of the pairwise correlations between time bins and the single-bin entropies are required, without the need for the whole joint probability distributions. We tested Moba-MIRA on synthetic data generated with generalized linear models, and showed that it requires only a few tens of stimulus repetitions to provide an accurate estimate of the information rate. Finally, we applied it to ex-vivo electrophysiological recordings of rats retina, obtaining rates ranging between 5 to 20 bits per second, consistent with earlier estimates.

                arXiv:2506.22951v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large-scale neural mass models have been widely used to simulate resting-state brain activity from structural connectivity. In this work, we extend a well-established Wilson--Cowan framework by introducing a novel hemispheric-specific coupling scheme that differentiates between intra-hemispheric and inter-hemispheric structural interactions. We apply this model to empirical cortical connectomes and resting-state fMRI data from matched control and schizophrenia groups. Simulated functional connectivity is computed from the band-limited envelope correlations of regional excitatory activity and compared against empirical functional connectivity matrices. Our results show that incorporating hemispheric asymmetries enhances the correlation between simulated and empirical functional connectivity, highlighting the importance of anatomically-informed coupling strategies in improving the biological realism of large-scale brain network models.

Abstract: Accurately characterizing higher-order interactions of brain regions and extracting interpretable organizational patterns from Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging data is crucial for brain disease diagnosis. Current graph-based deep learning models primarily focus on pairwise or triadic patterns while neglecting signed higher-order interactions, limiting comprehensive understanding of brain-wide communication. We propose HOI-Brain, a novel computational framework leveraging signed higher-order interactions and organizational patterns in fMRI data for brain disease diagnosis. First, we introduce a co-fluctuation measure based on Multiplication of Temporal Derivatives to detect higher-order interactions with temporal resolution. We then distinguish positive and negative synergistic interactions, encoding them in signed weighted simplicial complexes to reveal brain communication insights. Using Persistent Homology theory, we apply two filtration processes to these complexes to extract signed higher-dimensional neural organizations spatiotemporally. Finally, we propose a multi-channel brain Transformer to integrate heterogeneous topological features. Experiments on Alzheimer' s disease, Parkinson' s syndrome, and autism spectrum disorder datasets demonstrate our framework' s superiority, effectiveness, and interpretability. The identified key brain regions and higher-order patterns align with neuroscience literature, providing meaningful biological insights.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04065">Revisiting convolutive blind source separation for identifying spiking motor neuron activity: From theory to practice</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.04065v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Objective: Identifying the activity of motor neurons (MNs) non-invasively is possible by decomposing signals from muscles, e.g., surface electromyography (EMG) or ultrasound. The theoretical background of MN identification is convolutive blind source separation (cBSS), and different algorithms have been developed and validated. Yet, the existence and identifiability of inverse solutions and the corresponding estimation errors are not fully understood. Further, the guidelines for selecting appropriate parameters are often built on empirical observations, limiting the translation to clinical applications and other modalities. Approach: We revisited the cBSS model for MN identification, augmented it with new theoretical insights and derived a framework that can predict the existence of inverse solutions. This framework allows the quantification of estimation errors due to the imperfect inversion of the motor unit action potentials (MUAP), noise sources, and the ill-conditioning of the inverse problem. To bridge the gap between theory and practice, we used computer simulations. Main results: (1) Increasing the similarity of MUAPs or correlation between spike trains increases the bias for detecting high amplitude MUs. (2) The optimal objective function depends on the expected spike amplitude, spike amplitude statistics and the amplitude of background spikes. (3) There is some wiggle room for MN detection given non-stationary MUAPs. (4) There is no connection between MUAP duration and extension factor, in contrast to previous guidelines. (5) Source quality metrics like the silhouette score (SIL) or the pulse-to-noise ratio (PNR) are highly correlated with a source's objective function output. (6) SIL is superior to PNR. Significance: These findings will guide cBSS algorithm developments tailored to MN identification and clinical application translation.

                arXiv:2505.22146v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Flexible tool selection reflects a complex cognitive ability that distinguishes humans from other species, yet computational models that capture this ability remain underdeveloped. We developed a framework using low-dimensional attribute representations to bridge visual tool perception and linguistic task understanding. We constructed a comprehensive dataset (ToolNet) containing 115 common tools labeled with 13 carefully designed attributes spanning physical, functional, and psychological properties, paired with natural language scenarios describing tool usage. Visual encoders (ResNet or ViT) extract attributes from tool images while fine-tuned language models (GPT-2, LLaMA, DeepSeek) derive required attributes from task descriptions. Our approach achieves 74% accuracy in tool selection tasks-significantly outperforming direct tool matching (20%) and smaller multimodal models (21%-58%), while approaching performance of much larger models like GPT-4o (73%) with substantially fewer parameters. Human evaluation studies validate our framework's alignment with human decision-making patterns, and generalization experiments demonstrate effective performance on novel tool categories. Ablation studies revealed that manipulation-related attributes (graspability, elongation, hand-relatedness) consistently prove most critical across modalities. This work provides a parameter-efficient, interpretable solution that mimics human-like tool cognition, advancing both cognitive science understanding and practical applications in tool selection tasks.

                arXiv:2506.05574v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is a remarkable capability of pretrained transformers that allows models to generalize to unseen tasks after seeing only a few examples. We investigate empirically the conditions necessary on the pretraining distribution for ICL to emerge and generalize \emph{out-of-distribution}. Previous work has focused on the number of distinct tasks necessary in the pretraining dataset. Here, we use a different notion of task diversity to study the emergence of ICL in transformers trained on linear functions. We find that as task diversity increases, transformers undergo a transition from a specialized solution, which exhibits ICL only within the pretraining task distribution, to a solution which generalizes out of distribution to the entire task space. We also investigate the nature of the solutions learned by the transformer on both sides of the transition, and observe similar transitions in nonlinear regression problems. We construct a phase diagram to characterize how our concept of task diversity interacts with the number of pretraining tasks. In addition, we explore how factors such as the depth of the model and the dimensionality of the regression problem influence the transition.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11646">Memory as Structured Trajectories: Persistent Homology and Contextual Sheaves</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2508.11646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a topological framework for memory and inference grounded in the structure of spike-timing dynamics, persistent homology, and the Context-Content Uncertainty Principle (CCUP). Starting from the observation that polychronous neural groups (PNGs) encode reproducible, time-locked spike sequences shaped by axonal delays and synaptic plasticity, we construct spatiotemporal complexes whose temporally consistent transitions define chain complexes over which robust activation cycles emerge. These activation loops are abstracted into cell posets, enabling a compact and causally ordered representation of neural activity with overlapping and compositional memory traces. We introduce the delta-homology analogy, which formalizes memory as a set of sparse, topologically irreducible attractors. A Dirac delta-like memory trace is identified with a nontrivial homology generator on a latent manifold of cognitive states. Such traces are sharply localized along reproducible topological cycles and are only activated when inference trajectories complete a full cycle. They encode minimal, path-dependent memory units that cannot be synthesized from local features alone. We interpret these delta-homology generators as the low-entropy content variable, while the high-entropy context variable is represented dually as a filtration, cohomology class, or sheaf over the same latent space. Inference is recast as a dynamic alignment between content and context and coherent memory retrieval corresponds to the existence of a global section that selects and sustains a topological generator. Memory is no longer a static attractor or distributed code, but a cycle-completing, structure-aware inference process.

                arXiv:2508.12702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robust information representation and its persistent maintenance are fundamental for higher cognitive functions. Existing models employ distinct neural mechanisms to separately address noise-resistant processing or information maintenance, yet a unified framework integrating both operations remains elusive -- a critical gap in understanding cortical computation. Here, we introduce a recurrent neural circuit that combines divisive normalization with self-excitation to achieve both robust encoding and stable retention of normalized inputs. Mathematical analysis shows that, for suitable parameter regimes, the system forms a continuous attractor with two key properties: (1) input-proportional stabilization during stimulus presentation; and (2) self-sustained memory states persisting after stimulus offset. We demonstrate the model's versatility in two canonical tasks: (a) noise-robust encoding in a random-dot kinematogram (RDK) paradigm; and (b) approximate Bayesian belief updating in a probabilistic Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (pWCST). This work establishes a unified mathematical framework that bridges noise suppression, working memory, and approximate Bayesian inference within a single cortical microcircuit, offering fresh insights into the brain's canonical computation and guiding the design of biologically plausible artificial neural architectures.

                arXiv:2508.12975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have shown how spiking networks can learn complex functionality through error-correcting plasticity, but the resulting structures and dynamics remain poorly studied. To elucidate how these models may link to observed dynamics in vivo and thus how they may ultimately explain cortical computation, we need a better understanding of their emerging patterns. We train a multi-layer spiking network, as a conceptual analog of the bottom-up visual hierarchy, for visual input classification using spike-time encoding. After learning, we observe the development of distinct spatio-temporal activity patterns. While input patterns are synchronous by construction, activity in early layers first spreads out over time, followed by re-convergence into sharp pulses as classes are gradually extracted. The emergence of synchronicity is accompanied by the formation of increasingly distinct pathways, reflecting the gradual semantization of input activity. We thus observe hierarchical networks learning spike latency codes to naturally acquire activity patterns characterized by synchronicity and separability, with pronounced excitatory pathways ascending through the layers. This provides a rigorous computational hypothesis for the experimentally observed synchronicity in the visual system as a natural consequence of deep learning in cortex.

                arXiv:2508.11659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brain-like intelligent systems need brain-like learning methods. Equilibrium Propagation (EP) is a biologically plausible learning framework with strong potential for brain-inspired computing hardware. However, existing im-plementations of EP suffer from instability and prohibi-tively high computational costs. Inspired by the structure and dynamics of the brain, we propose a biologically plau-sible Feedback-regulated REsidual recurrent neural network (FRE-RNN) and study its learning performance in EP framework. Feedback regulation enables rapid convergence by reducing the spectral radius. The improvement in con-vergence property reduces the computational cost and train-ing time of EP by orders of magnitude, delivering perfor-mance on par with backpropagation (BP) in benchmark tasks. Meanwhile, residual connections with brain-inspired topologies help alleviate the vanishing gradient problem that arises when feedback pathways are weak in deep RNNs. Our approach substantially enhances the applicabil-ity and practicality of EP in large-scale networks that un-derpin artificial intelligence. The techniques developed here also offer guidance to implementing in-situ learning in physical neural networks.

                arXiv:2508.11674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces a novel approach by replacing the traditional perceptron neuron model with a biologically inspired probabilistic meta neuron, where the internal neuron parameters are jointly learned, leading to improved classification accuracy of spiking neural networks (SNNs). To validate this innovation, we implement and compare two SNN architectures: one based on standard leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons and another utilizing the proposed probabilistic meta neuron model. As a second key contribution, we present a new biologically inspired classification framework that uniquely integrates SNNs with Lempel-Ziv complexity (LZC) a measure closely related to entropy rate. By combining the temporal precision and biological plausibility of SNNs with the capacity of LZC to capture structural regularity, the proposed approach enables efficient and interpretable classification of spatiotemporal neural data, an aspect not addressed in existing works. We consider learning algorithms such as backpropagation, spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), and the Tempotron learning rule. To explore neural dynamics, we use Poisson processes to model neuronal spike trains, a well-established method for simulating the stochastic firing behavior of biological neurons. Our results reveal that depending on the training method, the classifier's efficiency can improve by up to 11.00%, highlighting the advantage of learning additional neuron parameters beyond the traditional focus on weighted inputs alone.

                arXiv:2508.11689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents ASPEN, a novel energy-aware technique for neuromorphic systems that could unleash the future of intelligent, always-on, ultra-low-power, and low-burden wearables. Our main research objectives are to explore the feasibility of neuromorphic computing for wearables, identify open research directions, and demonstrate the feasibility of developing an adaptive spiking technique for energy-aware computation, which can be game-changing for resource-constrained devices in always-on applications. As neuromorphic computing systems operate based on spike events, their energy consumption is closely related to spiking activity, i.e., each spike incurs computational and power costs; consequently, minimizing the number of spikes is a critical strategy for operating under constrained energy budgets. To support this goal, ASPEN utilizes stochastic perturbations to the neuronal threshold during training to not only enhance the network's robustness across varying thresholds, which can be controlled at inference time, but also act as a regularizer that improves generalization, reduces spiking activity, and enables energy control without the need for complex retraining or pruning. More specifically, ASPEN adaptively adjusts intrinsic neuronal parameters as a lightweight and scalable technique for dynamic energy control without reconfiguring the entire model. Our evaluation on neuromorphic emulator and hardware shows that ASPEN significantly reduces spike counts and energy consumption while maintaining accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Studies of the dynamics of nonlinear recurrent neural networks often assume independent and identically distributed couplings, but large-scale connectomics data indicate that biological neural circuits exhibit markedly different connectivity properties. These include rapidly decaying singular-value spectra and structured singular-vector overlaps. Here, we develop a theory to analyze how these forms of structure shape high-dimensional collective activity in nonlinear recurrent neural networks. We first introduce the random-mode model, a random-matrix ensemble related to the singular-value decomposition that enables control over the spectrum and right-left mode overlaps. Then, using a novel path-integral calculation, we derive analytic expressions that reveal how connectivity structure affects features of collective dynamics: the dimension of activity, which quantifies the number of high-variance collective-activity fluctuations, and the temporal correlations that characterize the timescales of these fluctuations. We show that connectivity structure can be invisible in single-neuron activities while dramatically shaping collective activity. Furthermore, despite the nonlinear, high-dimensional nature of these networks, the dimension of activity depends on just two connectivity parameters -- the variance of the couplings and the effective rank of the coupling matrix, which quantifies the number of dominant rank-one connectivity components. We contrast the effects of single-neuron heterogeneity and low-dimensional connectivity, making predictions about how z-scoring data affects the dimension of activity. Finally, we demonstrate the presence of structured overlaps between left and right modes in the \textit{Drosophila} connectome, incorporate them into the theory, and show how they further shape collective dynamics.

                arXiv:2508.11703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Algorithmic discovery has traditionally relied on human ingenuity and extensive experimentation. Here we investigate whether a prominent scientific computing algorithm, the Kalman Filter, can be discovered through an automated, data-driven, evolutionary process that relies on Cartesian Genetic Programming (CGP) and Large Language Models (LLM). We evaluate the contributions of both modalities (CGP and LLM) in discovering the Kalman filter under varying conditions. Our results demonstrate that our framework of CGP and LLM-assisted evolution converges to near-optimal solutions when Kalman optimality assumptions hold. When these assumptions are violated, our framework evolves interpretable alternatives that outperform the Kalman filter. These results demonstrate that combining evolutionary algorithms and generative models for interpretable, data-driven synthesis of simple computational modules is a potent approach for algorithmic discovery in scientific computing.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11871">LLM4CMO: Large Language Model-aided Algorithm Design for Constrained Multiobjective Optimization</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2508.11871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constrained multi-objective optimization problems (CMOPs) frequently arise in real-world applications where multiple conflicting objectives must be optimized under complex constraints. Existing dual-population two-stage algorithms have shown promise by leveraging infeasible solutions to improve solution quality. However, designing high-performing constrained multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (CMOEAs) remains a challenging task due to the intricacy of algorithmic components. Meanwhile, large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for assisting with algorithm design; however, their effective integration into such tasks remains underexplored. To address this gap, we propose LLM4CMO, a novel CMOEA based on a dual-population, two-stage framework. In Stage 1, the algorithm identifies both the constrained Pareto front (CPF) and the unconstrained Pareto front (UPF). In Stage 2, it performs targeted optimization using a combination of hybrid operators (HOps), an epsilon-based constraint-handling method, and a classification-based UPF-CPF relationship strategy, along with a dynamic resource allocation (DRA) mechanism. To reduce design complexity, the core modules, including HOps, epsilon decay function, and DRA, are decoupled and designed through prompt template engineering and LLM-human interaction. Experimental results on six benchmark test suites and ten real-world CMOPs demonstrate that LLM4CMO outperforms eleven state-of-the-art baseline algorithms. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of the LLM-aided modular design. These findings offer preliminary evidence that LLMs can serve as efficient co-designers in the development of complex evolutionary optimization algorithms. The code associated with this article is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LLM4CMO971.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12133">Improving MSA Estimation through Adaptive Weight Vectors in MOEA/D</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2508.12133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate phylogenetic inference from biological sequences depends critically on the quality of multiple sequence alignments, yet optimal alignment for many sequences is computationally intractable and sensitive to scoring choices. In this work we introduce MOEA/D-ADF, a novel variant of MOEA/D that adaptively adjusts subproblem weight vectors based on fitness variance to improve the exploration-exploitation trade-off. We combine MOEA/D-ADF with PMAO (PASTA with many application-aware optimization criteria) to form PMAO++, where PMAO-generated solutions are used to seed MOEA/D-ADF, which then evolves a population using 30 weight vectors to produce a diverse ensemble of alignment-tree pairs. PMAO++ outperforms the original PMAO on a majority of benchmark cases, achieving better false-negative (FN) rates on 12 of 17 BAliBASE-derived datasets and producing superior best-case trees, including several instances with zero FN rate. Beyond improving single best alignments, the rich set of alignment-tree pairs produced by PMAO++ is especially valuable for downstream summary methods (for example, consensus and summary-tree approaches), allowing more robust phylogenetic inference by integrating signal across multiple plausible alignments and trees. Certain dataset features, such as large terminal N/C extensions found in the RV40 group, remain challenging, but overall PMAO++ demonstrates clear advantages for sequence-based phylogenetic analysis. Future work will explore parameter tuning, larger benchmark suites, and tighter integration with summary-tree pipelines to further enhance applicability for biological sequence studies.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12609">A Self-Ensemble Inspired Approach for Effective Training of Binary-Weight Spiking Neural Networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2508.12609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are a promising approach to low-power applications on neuromorphic hardware due to their energy efficiency. However, training SNNs is challenging because of the non-differentiable spike generation function. To address this issue, the commonly used approach is to adopt the backpropagation through time framework, while assigning the gradient of the non-differentiable function with some surrogates. Similarly, Binary Neural Networks (BNNs) also face the non-differentiability problem and rely on approximating gradients. However, the deep relationship between these two fields and how their training techniques can benefit each other has not been systematically researched. Furthermore, training binary-weight SNNs is even more difficult. In this work, we present a novel perspective on the dynamics of SNNs and their close connection to BNNs through an analysis of the backpropagation process. We demonstrate that training a feedforward SNN can be viewed as training a self-ensemble of a binary-activation neural network with noise injection. Drawing from this new understanding of SNN dynamics, we introduce the Self-Ensemble Inspired training method for (Binary-Weight) SNNs (SEI-BWSNN), which achieves high-performance results with low latency even for the case of the 1-bit weights. Specifically, we leverage a structure of multiple shortcuts and a knowledge distillation-based training technique to improve the training of (binary-weight) SNNs. Notably, by binarizing FFN layers in a Transformer architecture, our approach achieves 82.52% accuracy on ImageNet with only 2 time steps, indicating the effectiveness of our methodology and the potential of binary-weight SNNs.

                arXiv:2508.12846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Network processing promises to provide high energy efficiency due to the sparsity of the spiking events. However, when realized on general-purpose hardware -- such as a RISC-V processor -- this promise can be undermined and overshadowed by the inefficient code, stemming from repeated usage of basic instructions for updating all the neurons in the network. One of the possible solutions to this issue is the introduction of a custom ISA extension with neuromorphic instructions for spiking neuron updating, and realizing those instructions in bespoke hardware expansion to the existing ALU. In this paper, we present the first step towards realizing a large-scale system based on the RISC-V-compliant processor called IzhiRISC-V, supporting the custom neuromorphic ISA extension.

                arXiv:2508.11805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) read neural signals directly from the brain to infer motor planning and execution. However, the implementation of this technology has been largely limited to laboratory settings, with few real-world applications. We developed a bimanual BCI system to drive a vehicle in both simulated and real-world environments. We demonstrate that an individual with tetraplegia, implanted with intracortical BCI electrodes in the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) and the hand knob region of the motor cortex (MC), reacts at least as fast and precisely as motor intact participants, and drives a simulated vehicle as proficiently as the same control group. This BCI participant, living in California, could also remotely drive a Ford Mustang Mach-E vehicle in Michigan. Our first teledriving task relied on cursor control for speed and steering in a closed urban test facility. However, the final BCI system added click control for full-stop braking and thus enabled bimanual cursor-and-click control for both simulated driving through a virtual town with traffic and teledriving through an obstacle course without traffic in the real world. We also demonstrate the safety and feasibility of BCI-controlled driving. This first-of-its-kind implantable BCI application not only highlights the versatility and innovative potentials of BCIs but also illuminates the promising future for the development of life-changing solutions to restore independence to those who suffer catastrophic neurological injury.

                arXiv:2508.12571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) show enormous potential for advancing personalized medicine. However, BCIs also introduce new avenues for cyber-attacks or security compromises. In this article, we analyze the problem and make recommendations for device manufacturers to better secure devices and to help regulators understand where more guidance is needed to protect patient safety and data confidentiality. Device manufacturers should implement the prior suggestions in their BCI products. These recommendations help protect BCI users from undue risks, including compromised personal health and genetic information, unintended BCI-mediated movement, and many other cybersecurity breaches. Regulators should mandate non-surgical device update methods, strong authentication and authorization schemes for BCI software modifications, encryption of data moving to and from the brain, and minimize network connectivity where possible. We also design a hypothetical, average-case threat model that identifies possible cybersecurity threats to BCI patients and predicts the likeliness of risk for each category of threat. BCIs are at less risk of physical compromise or attack, but are vulnerable to remote attack; we focus on possible threats via network paths to BCIs and suggest technical controls to limit network connections.

                arXiv:2508.12637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Event cameras offer significant advantages for edge robotics applications due to their asynchronous operation and sparse, event-driven output, making them well-suited for tasks requiring fast and efficient closed-loop control, such as gesture-based human-robot interaction. Despite this potential, existing event processing solutions remain limited, often lacking complete end-to-end implementations, exhibiting high latency, and insufficiently exploiting event data sparsity. In this paper, we present HOMI, an ultra-low latency, end-to-end edge AI platform comprising a Prophesee IMX636 event sensor chip with an Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+MPSoC FPGA chip, deploying an in-house developed AI accelerator. We have developed hardware-optimized pre-processing pipelines supporting both constant-time and constant-event modes for histogram accumulation, linear and exponential time surfaces. Our general-purpose implementation caters to both accuracy-driven and low-latency applications. HOMI achieves 94% accuracy on the DVS Gesture dataset as a use case when configured for high accuracy operation and provides a throughput of 1000 fps for low-latency configuration. The hardware-optimised pipeline maintains a compact memory footprint and utilises only 33% of the available LUT resources on the FPGA, leaving ample headroom for further latency reduction, model parallelisation, multi-task deployments, or integration of more complex architectures.

Abstract: Continual learning is a key feature of biological neural systems, but artificial neural networks often suffer from catastrophic forgetting. Instead of backpropagation, biologically plausible learning algorithms may enable stable continual learning. This study proposes columnar-organized spiking neural networks (SNNs) with local learning rules for continual learning and catastrophic forgetting. Using CoLaNET (Columnar Layered Network), we show that its microcolumns adapt most efficiently to new tasks when they lack shared structure with prior learning. We demonstrate how CoLaNET hyperparameters govern the trade-off between retaining old knowledge (stability) and acquiring new information (plasticity). We evaluate CoLaNET on two benchmarks: Permuted MNIST (ten sequential pixel-permuted tasks) and a two-task MNIST/EMNIST setup. Our model learns ten sequential tasks effectively, maintaining 92% accuracy on each. It shows low forgetting, with only 4% performance degradation on the first task after training on nine subsequent tasks.

                arXiv:2505.02369v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks achieve high performance across many domains but can still face challenges in generalization when optimization is influenced by small or noisy gradient components. Sharpness-Aware Minimization improves generalization by perturbing parameters toward directions of high curvature, but it uses the entire gradient vector, which means that small or noisy components may affect the ascent step and cause the optimizer to miss optimal solutions. We propose Z-Score Filtered Sharpness-Aware Minimization, which applies Z-score based filtering to gradients in each layer. Instead of using all gradient components, a mask is constructed to retain only the top percentile with the largest absolute Z-scores. The percentile threshold $Q_p$ determines how many components are kept, so that the ascent step focuses on directions that stand out most compared to the average of the layer. This selective perturbation refines the search toward flatter minima while reducing the influence of less significant gradients. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet with architectures including ResNet, VGG, and Vision Transformers show that the proposed method consistently improves test accuracy compared to Sharpness-Aware Minimization and its variants.

Abstract: Physical reservoir computing is an innovative idea for using physical phenomena as computational resources. Recent research has revealed that information processing techniques can improve the performance, but for practical applications, it is equally important to study the level of performance with a simple design that is easy to construct experimentally. We focus on a reservoir composed of independent hysteretic systems as a model suitable for the practical implementation of physical reservoir computing. In this paper, we discuss the appropriate design of this reservoir, its performance, and its limitations. This research will serve as a practical guideline for constructing hysteresis-based reservoirs.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06347">Structural Equation-VAE: Disentangled Latent Representations for Tabular Data</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2508.06347v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning interpretable latent representations from tabular data remains a challenge in deep generative modeling. We introduce SE-VAE (Structural Equation-Variational Autoencoder), a novel architecture that embeds measurement structure directly into the design of a variational autoencoder. Inspired by structural equation modeling, SE-VAE aligns latent subspaces with known indicator groupings and introduces a global nuisance latent to isolate construct-specific confounding variation. This modular architecture enables disentanglement through design rather than through statistical regularizers alone. We evaluate SE-VAE on a suite of simulated tabular datasets and benchmark its performance against a series of leading baselines using standard disentanglement metrics. SE-VAE consistently outperforms alternatives in factor recovery, interpretability, and robustness to nuisance variation. Ablation results reveal that architectural structure, rather than regularization strength, is the key driver of performance. SE-VAE offers a principled framework for white-box generative modeling in scientific and social domains where latent constructs are theory-driven and measurement validity is essential.

                Objective: SCN2A pathogenic mutations, such as the recurrent heterozygous Nav1.2-L1342P, are monogenic causes of epilepsy. In this human-induced pluripotent stem cell model system, we aim to investigate the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the SCN2A-L1342P-associated pathology. Methods: Using a human male iPSC reference line (KOLF) carrying the Nav1.2-L1342P mutation, we generated 3D cortical organoids for functional studies. Patch clamp and multi-electrode array (MEA) recordings, immunocytochemistry, and RNA sequencing were used to characterize the disease phenotypes. Results: Nav1.2-L1342P organoid neurons displayed increased intrinsic excitability, and amplified excitatory post-synaptic currents, which are consistent with an increase in excitatory synapse formation revealed by PSD95/SYN1 immunostaining. Moreover, elevated network firing activity, as demonstrated by MEA, indicates a pronounced network hyperexcitability. Transcriptomic profiling of organoids carrying the Nav1.2-L1342P mutation further revealed significant alterations in synaptic, glutamatergic, and developmental pathways. Significance: Our findings demonstrate that the Nav1.2-L1342P mutation drives a multifaceted disease phenotype, including network hyperexcitability and disruption of pathways related to neuronal and synaptic functions. These results advance our understanding of SCN2A-related Developmental and Epileptic Encephalopathy (DEE), laying a foundation for personalized interventions.

">Learning Amidst Noise: The Complementary Roles of Neural Predictive Activity and Representational Changes</a></h4>

              
                The ability to extract structured patterns from a noisy environment is fundamental to cognition, yet how the brain learns complex, non-adjacent regularities remains unclear. Using magnetoencephalography (MEG) during a visuomotor task, we tracked the neural dynamics as humans learned non-adjacent dependencies embedded in noise. We reveal that learning is supported by two temporally dissociable mechanisms. A rapid emergence of predictive activity, where neural patterns of expected stimuli appear before their onset, precedes measurable behavioral improvements. This is followed by a much slower representational change, characterized by an increased neural pattern similarity between linked, non-adjacent elements. Both processes are supported by a distributed consortium of sensorimotor, dorsal attention, salience, central executive, and cerebellar networks. These findings establish a temporal hierarchy for the neural mechanisms of learning, suggesting that fast predictions guide online behavior, which in turn facilitates the gradual consolidation of knowledge into stable neural representations.

">Brain functional connectivity initiates structured reorganization at a critical oxygen threshold during hypoxia</a></h4>

              
                The human brain dynamically adapts to hypoxia, a reduction in oxygen essential for metabolism. The brain's adaptive response to hypoxia, however, remains unclear. We investigated dynamic functional connectivity (FC) in healthy adults under acute hypoxia (FiO2 = 7.7%, 11.8%) using BOLD fMRI, physiological monitoring (PetO2, PetCO2, SpO2), and a Go/No-Go task. Principal component analysis identified a hypoxia-responsive FC component involving 400 cerebral parcels. This component emerged with a critical drop in PetO2 (~53 mmHg), preceding changes in SpO2, BOLD signals, and behavior. These FC changes were network-specific and centered on the default mode network (DMN), which selectively synchronized with other high-level cognitive networks. In contrast, visual networks remained stable and segregated from the DMN. These results suggest that the brain proactively reorganizes its functional architecture in anticipation of oxygen decline, rather than in response to it. FC-based markers may offer early indicators of vulnerability in neurological or neurodegenerative conditions.

">Competitive pre-ordering during planning persists in kinematically fused sequential movements</a></h4>

              
                Results in human and non-human primates have shown that elements of a movement sequence are pre-ordered in parallel competitively before execution, a process known as competitive queueing (CQ). However, it is unclear whether the preplanning of individual movements persists in continuous skilled actions that involve greater biomechanical integration and is associated with the formation of new motor primitives (neural fusion). We investigated how kinematics impact sequence planning in a handwriting-like task asking whether fusing velocity curves between adjacent movements affects movement preparation. Participants were trained and tested for two days to perform two sequences of four sequential centre-out-and-back movements from memory in a delayed sequence production task using a stylus on a Wacom tablet. To manipulate kinematic fusion between subsequent strokes, participants were assigned to one of three groups that were trained to perform the sequences either with acute, right or obtuse angles between sequential targets. Probe trials assessed the availability of constituent movement elements for fast and accurate execution towards each target during planning. Movement elements associated with later sequence positions were less available than earlier movements, regardless of kinematic fusion, in line with CQ findings for discrete typing sequences in humans. Importantly, a more pronounced CQ gradient was associated with higher fusion, faster initiation and greater accuracy of sequence production. These findings indicate that kinematically fused sequential actions do not result in the formation of new movement primitives (neural fusion) with a single movement plan. Instead, they continue to be planned separately and are associated with skilled performance.

In a consortium effort analyzing 40 fMRI datasets (N=2,175), we examined the relationship between neural activation during reappraisal tasks and three core individual difference indices of reappraisal capabilities: (1) trait questionnaires, (2) task-based affective ratings, and (3) amygdala down-regulation. Strikingly, there was no shared overlap across these three common indices. Only a very weak correlation emerged between amygdala down-regulation and task-based affective ratings. Whole-brain analyses revealed no reliable neural associations with trait questionnaires, and associations with task-based affective ratings fell outside canonical emotion regulation networks (e.g., prefrontal circuitry). Moreover, amygdala down-regulation, often interpreted as a stable individual marker, was confounded by person-specific whole-brain responses - a limitation extending to fMRI research beyond the emotion regulation domain. These findings challenge the assumption that an individual's prefrontal activity is a valid indicator of their reappraisal capabilities and suggest that common trait, behavioral, and neural measures might capture distinct facets of emotion regulation. More broadly, our results highlight concrete methodological challenges for fMRI research on individual differences, with implications extending beyond emotion regulation to the neuroscience of personality, psychopathology, and general well-being.

">Proteasome mutations associated with CANDLE syndrome cause altered neuronal development by dysregulating polyamine synthesis</a></h4>

              
                Genetic mutations affecting proteasome function can result in multi-organ diseases, such as Chronic atypical neutrophilic dermatosis with lipodystrophy and elevated temperature (CANDLE) syndrome. Neurological symptoms associated with CANDLE suggest that proteasomal mutations may impact neuronal development and/or function. We generated cerebral organoids (COs) from CANDLE patient induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), which exhibited impaired neuronal development when compared to COs from healthy control iPSCs. Impaired neuronal maturation in CANDLE COs was correlated with increased polyamines, which were also elevated in CANDLE patient CSF. The proteasome-regulated Ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), a rate limiting enzyme for polyamines, was elevated in CANDLE neurons. Inhibition of ODC reversed polyamine overproduction and repaired neuronal maturation in CANDLE COs, suggesting a potential therapeutic avenue for intervention. These findings demonstrate that dysfunction of the proteasome affects neuronal development through overproduction of polyamines via dysregulation of ODC and offer insight into potential therapeutic strategies for CNS-related proteasomal dysfunction.

">Medial prefrontal cortex input to lateral entorhinal cortex supports both encoding and retrieval of associative recognition memory</a></h4>

              
                Associative recognition memory allows us to form representations of items and their environment and to judge the novelty of such representations. This memory is dependent on a brain circuit that includes interactions between medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC); however it is unknown whether the interaction of these brain areas is required for memory encoding, retrieval or both processes. Furthermore, little is known as to whether indirect or direct mPFC-LEC connections are critical for associative recognition memory and, if the latter, in which direction information travels. To address these questions, we first performed pharmacological disconnection of mPFC and LEC, finding that mPFC-LEC interaction is required for both memory encoding and retrieval. Next, we optogenetically inhibited projections from mPFC to LEC, showing that this projection was crucial for both encoding and retrieval of both object-in-place and object-in-context recognition memory when a 1 h, but not a 5 min, memory retention delay was used. These data show that a direct connection from mPFC to LEC is critical for associative recognition memory, in a delay-dependent manner.

                <p>The two main cell types in the striatum, dopamine receptor 1 and adenosine receptor 2a spiny projection neurons (D1-SPNs and A2A-SPNs), have distinct roles in regulating motor- and reward-related behaviors. Cre-selective CRISPR-dCas9 systems allow for cell-type specific, epigenomic-based manipulation of gene expression with gene-specific single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) and have potential to elucidate molecular mechanisms underlying striatal subtype mediated behaviors. Conditional transgenic Rosa26:LSL-dCas9-p300 mice were recently generated to allow for robust expression of dCas9-p300 expression with Cre-driven cell-type specificity. This system utilizes p300, a histone acetyltransferase which regulates gene expression by unwinding chromatin and making that region of the genome more accessible for transcription. Rosa26-LSL-dCas9-p300 mice were paired with Drd1-Cre and Ador2a-Cre mice to generate Drd1-Cre:dCas9-p300 and Ador2a-Cre:dCas9-p300 mouse lines and underwent behavioral phenotyping when sgRNAs were not present. Both Drd1-Cre:dCas9-p300 and Ador2a-Cre:dCas9-p300 have cell-type&ndash;specific expression of spCas9 mRNA. Baseline behavioral assessments revealed that, under a sgRNA absent nontargeted state, Drd1-Cre:dCas9-p300 mice display repetitive spinning behavior, hyperlocomotion, and enhanced acquisition of reward learning in comparison with all genotypic littermates. In contrast, Ador2a-Cre:dCas9-p300 do not exhibit any changes in behavior in comparison with their littermates. Electrophysiological recordings of dorsal striatum D1-SPNs revealed that Drd1-Cre:dCas9-p300 mice have increased input resistance and increased spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic current amplitude, together suggesting greater excitatory drive of D1-SPNs. Overall, these data demonstrate the necessity to validate CRISPR-dCas9 lines for research investigations. Additionally, the Drd1-Cre:dCas9-p300 line has the potential to be used to study underlying mechanisms of stereotypy and reward learning.</p>

                <p>The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) plays a pivotal role in processing pain and emotion, communicating with both cortical and subcortical regions involved in these functions. The claustrum (CLA), a subcortical region with extensive connectivity to the ACC, also plays a critical role in pain perception and consciousness. Both ACC and CLA express Kappa (KOR), Mu (MOR), and Delta (DOR) opioid receptors, yet whether and how opioid receptors modulate this circuit are poorly understood. This study investigates the effects of opioid receptor activation on glutamatergic signaling in CLA-&gt;ACC circuitry using spatial transcriptomics, brain slice electrophysiology, optogenetics, and pharmacological approaches in mice of both sexes. Our results demonstrated that excitatory synaptic transmission generated by the CLA onto Layer 5 pyramidal (L5 PYR) cells in the ACC are reduced by KOR, MOR, and DOR agonists. However, only KOR agonists reduce monosynaptic transmission from the CLA onto L5 ACC PYR cells, highlighting the unique role of KOR in modulating the CLA-&gt;ACC pathway. MOR and DOR agonists only reduced slower, longer-latency recurrent excitatory responses. These findings provide new insights into how opioid receptors regulate the claustrocingulate circuit and demonstrate the distinct, receptor-specific modulation of synaptic transmission within this network.</p>

                <p>by Farhad Razi, Belén Sancristóbal</p>

Perceptual awareness of auditory stimuli decreases from wakefulness to sleep, largely due to reduced cortical responsiveness. During wakefulness, neural responses to external stimuli in most cortical areas exhibit a broader spatiotemporal propagation pattern compared to deep sleep. A potential mechanism for this phenomenon is the synaptic upscaling of cortical excitatory connections during wakefulness, as posited by the synaptic homeostasis hypothesis. However, we argue that uniform synaptic upscaling alone cannot fully account for this observation. We propose a novel mechanism suggesting that the upscaling of excitatory connections between different cortical areas exceeds that within individual cortical areas during wakefulness. Our computational results demonstrate that the former promotes the transfer of neural responses and information, whereas the latter has diminishing effects. These findings highlight the necessity of heterogeneous synaptic upscaling and suggest the presence of heterogeneity in receptor expression for neuromodulators involved in synaptic modulation along the dendrite.

                <p>by Fenil R. Doshi, Talia Konkle, George A. Alvarez</p>

Deep neural network models provide a powerful experimental platform for exploring core mechanisms underlying human visual perception, such as perceptual grouping and contour integration—the process of linking local edge elements to arrive at a unified perceptual representation of a complete contour. Here, we demonstrate that feedforward convolutional neural networks (CNNs) fine-tuned on contour detection show this human-like capacity, but without relying on mechanisms proposed in prior work, such as lateral connections, recurrence, or top-down feedback. We identified two key properties needed for ImageNet pre-trained, feed-forward models to yield human-like contour integration: first, progressively increasing receptive field structure served as a critical architectural motif to support this capacity; and second, biased fine-tuning for contour-detection specifically for gradual curves (~20 degrees) resulted in human-like sensitivity to curvature. We further demonstrate that fine-tuning ImageNet pretrained models uncovers other hidden human-like capacities in feed-forward networks, including uncrowding (reduced interference from distractors as the number of distractors increases), which is considered a signature of human perceptual grouping. Thus, taken together these results provide a computational existence proof that purely feedforward hierarchical computations are capable of implementing gestalt “good continuation” and perceptual organization needed for human-like contour-integration and uncrowding. More broadly, these results raise the possibility that in human vision, later stages of processing play a more prominent role in perceptual-organization than implied by theories focused on recurrence and early lateral connections.

                <p>by Hui Yuan, Mingzhu Liu, Yushan Qiu, Wai-Ki Ching, Quan Zou</p>

The development of single-cell multi-omics sequencing technologies has enabled the simultaneous analysis of multi-omics data within the same cell. Accurate clustering of these cells is crucial for downstream analyses of complex biological functions. Despite significant advances in multi-omics integration approaches, current methodologies exhibit two major limitations. First, they inadequately incorporate prior biological knowledge from various omic layers. Second, these methods often conduct independent dimensionality reduction on individual omic datasets, thereby failing to capture the intrinsic complementary information and potentially overlooking crucial cross-platform interactions. Motivated by these, this study investigates a non-negative matrix factorization model called PLNMFG, which integrates the unified latent representation learning that retains the features between and within omics and the cluster structure learning that retains the intrinsic structure of the data into one joint framework. Specially, PLNMFG performs adaptive imputation to handle dropout events and uses prior pseudo-labels as constraints during the process of collective non-negative matrix factorization, as a result, a more robust latent representation that preserves the double similarity information is obtained. Graph Laplacian constraint is applied during clustering which further preserves structure characteristic of multi-omics data. In addition, the weight of each omic is adaptively learned based on the omic contribution. A series of experiments on 8 benchmark datasets show that our model performs well in terms of clustering accuracy and computational efficiency.

                <p>by Thien-Minh Le, Jukka-Pekka Onnela</p>

Infectious disease modeling is used to forecast epidemics and assess the effectiveness of intervention strategies. Although the core assumption of mass-action models of homogeneously mixed population is often implausible, they are nevertheless routinely used in studying epidemics and provide useful insights. Network models can account for the heterogeneous mixing of populations, which is especially important for studying sexually transmitted diseases. Despite the abundance of research on mass-action and network models, the relationship between them is not well understood. Here, we attempt to bridge the gap by first identifying a spreading rule that results in an exact match between disease spreading on a fully connected network and the classic mass-action models. We then propose a method for mapping epidemic spread on arbitrary networks to a form similar to that of mass-action models. We also provide a theoretical justification for the procedure. Finally, we demonstrate the application of the proposed method in the theoretical analysis of reproduction numbers and the estimation of model parameters using synthetic data based on an empirical network. The method proves advantageous in explicitly handling both finite and infinite networks, significantly reducing the computation time required to estimate model parameters for spreading processes on networks. These findings help us understand when mass-action models and network models are expected to provide similar results and identify reasons when they do not.

                <p>by Francesca Mastrogiuseppe, Joana Carmona, Christian K. Machens</p>

The geometrical and statistical properties of brain activity depend on the way neurons connect to form recurrent circuits. However, the link between connectivity structure and emergent activity remains incompletely understood. We investigate this relationship in recurrent neural networks with additive stochastic inputs. We assume that the synaptic connectivity can be expressed in a low-rank form, parameterized by a handful of connectivity vectors, and examine how the geometry of emergent activity relates to these vectors. Our findings reveal that this relationship critically depends on the dimensionality of the external stochastic inputs. When inputs are low-dimensional, activity remains low-dimensional, and recurrent dynamics influence it within a subspace spanned by a subset of the connectivity vectors, with dimensionality equal to the rank of the connectivity matrix. In contrast, when inputs are high-dimensional, activity also becomes potentially high-dimensional. The contribution of recurrent dynamics is apparent within a subspace spanned by the totality of the connectivity vectors, with dimensionality equal to twice the rank of the connectivity matrix. Applying our formalism to excitatory-inhibitory networks, we discuss how the input configuration also plays a crucial role in determining the amount of amplification generated by non-normal dynamics. Our work provides a foundation for studying activity in structured brain circuits under realistic noise conditions, and offers a framework for interpreting stochastic models inferred from experimental data.

                <p>by Rongxin Zhang, Wenyong Zhu, Ke Xiao, Jean-Louis Mergny, Xiao Sun</p>

G-quadruplexes (G4s) are nucleic acid secondary structures with important regulatory functions. Single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), one of the most common forms of genetic variation, can potentially impact the formation of G4 structures if they occur within G4 regions. However, there is currently a lack of software tools specifically designed to assess such effects. Here, we present an R/Bioconductor package named G4SNVHunter, which enables rapid detection of variants that may disrupt G4 structures. This tool, based on the core principles of the G4Hunter algorithm, can provide precise quantitative assessment of the propensity for G4 formation within genomic sequences. Specialized experimental methods can then be designed based on the results provided by G4SNVHunter to further verify the specific functions of the affected G4 structures, facilitating deeper insights into the biological impacts of genetic variants from the perspective of G4 structures. To showcase the functionality of the G4SNVHunter package, we analyzed the Neandertal and Denisovan archaic introgressed variants detected by the Sprime software, and identified approximately 5,800 variants located within G4 regions, among which around 230 may impair G4 structure formation propensity. The source code for the G4SNVHunter package has been publicly released under the MIT license at https://github.com/rongxinzh/G4SNVHunter and https://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/html/G4SNVHunter.html.

                <p>by Xunxun Wang, Ya-Zhou Shi</p>

Understanding the three-dimensional (3D) structure and stability of DNA is essential for elucidating its biological functions and advancing structure-based drug design. Here, we present an improved coarse-grained (CG) model for <i>ab initio</i> prediction of DNA folding, integrating a refined electrostatic potential, replica-exchange Monte Carlo simulations, and weighted histogram analysis. The model accurately predicts the 3D structures of DNA with multi-way junctions (e.g., achieving a mean RMSD of ~8.8 Å for top-ranked structures across four DNAs with three- or four-way junctions) from sequence, outperforming existing fragment-assembly and AI-based approaches. The model also reproduces the thermal stability of junctions across diverse sequences and lengths, with predicted melting temperatures deviating by less than 5 °C from experimental values, under both monovalent (Na⁺) and divalent (Mg<sup>2</sup>⁺) ionic conditions. Furthermore, analysis of the thermal unfolding pathways reveals that the overall stability of multi-way junctions is primarily determined by the relative free energies of key intermediate states. These results provide a robust framework for predicting complex DNA architectures and offer mechanistic insights into DNA folding and function.

                <p>by Amy Gill, Karina Kinghorn, Victoria L. Bautch, Feilim Mac Gabhann</p>

Constitutively secreted by endothelial cells, soluble FLT1 (sFLT1 or sVEGFR1) binds and sequesters extracellular vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF), thereby reducing VEGF binding to VEGF receptor tyrosine kinases and their downstream signaling. In doing so, sFLT1 plays an important role in vascular development and in the patterning of new blood vessels in angiogenesis. Here, we develop multiple mechanistic models of sFLT1 secretion and identify a minimal mechanistic model that recapitulates key qualitative and quantitative features of temporal experimental datasets of sFLT1 secretion from multiple studies. We show that the experimental data on sFLT1 secretion is best represented by a delay differential equation (DDE) system including a maturation term, reflecting the time required between synthesis and secretion. Using optimization to identify appropriate values for the key mechanistic parameters in the model, we show that two model parameters (extracellular degradation rate constant and maturation time) are very strongly constrained by the experimental data, and that the remaining parameters are related by two strongly constrained constants. Thus, only one degree of freedom remains, and measurements of the intracellular levels of sFLT1 would fix the remaining parameters. Comparison between simulation predictions and additional experimental data of the outcomes of chemical inhibitors and genetic perturbations suggest that intermediate values of the secretion rate constant best match the simulation with experiments, which would completely constrain the model. However, some of the inhibitors tested produce results that cannot be reproduced by the model simulations, suggesting that additional mechanisms not included here are required to explain those inhibitors. Overall, the model reproduces most available experimental data and suggests targets for further quantitative investigation of the sFLT1 system.

                <p>by Isaac J. Stopard, Ellie Sherrard-Smith, Hilary Ranson, Kobié Hyacinthe Toe, Jackie Cook, Joseph Biggs, Ben Lambert, Thomas S. Churcher</p>

Entomological surveillance is an important component of mosquito-borne disease control. Mosquito abundance, infection prevalence and the entomological inoculation rate are the most widely reported entomological metrics, although these data are notoriously noisy and difficult to interpret. For many infections, only older mosquitoes are infectious, which is why, in part, vector control tools that reduce mosquito life expectancy have been so successful. The age structure of wild mosquitoes has been proposed as a metric to assess the effectiveness of interventions that kill adult mosquitoes, and age grading tools are becoming increasingly advanced. Mosquito populations show seasonal dynamics with temporal fluctuations. How seasonal changes in adult mosquito emergence and vector control could affect the mosquito age distribution or other important metrics is unclear. We develop stochastic mathematical models of mosquito population dynamics to show how variability in mosquito emergence causes substantial heterogeneity in the mosquito age distribution, with low frequency, positively autocorrelated changes in emergence being the most important driver of this variability. Fitting a population model to mosquito abundance data collected in experimental hut trials indicates these dynamics are likely to exist in wild <i>Anopheles gambiae</i> populations. Incorporating age structuring into an established compartmental model of mosquito dynamics and vector control, indicates that the use of mosquito age as a metric to assess the efficacy of vector-control tools will require an understanding of underlying variability in mosquito ages, with the mean age and other entomological metrics affected by short-term and seasonal fluctuations in mosquito emergence.

                <p>by Lianxia Li, Unimunkh Uriyanghai, Christine Wai, Hong Yuan, Eric W. Livingston, Edward M. Bahnson, Vinay Sudarsanam, Samuel Haddad, Prabir Roy-Chaudhury, Boyce E. Griffith, Gang Xi</p>

In this study, we investigated the hemodynamic characteristics of arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) in murine models using micro-CT based computational fluid dynamics (CFD). By combining high-resolution micro-CT imaging with ultrasound flow measurements, our methodology offers a cost-effective and efficient alternative to traditional MRI-based approaches. CFD simulations performed at 7 and 21 days post-surgery revealed significant temporal changes in both geometry and hemodynamics. Geometric analysis showed that the proximal artery diameter increased from 0.29 mm to 0.38 mm, whereas the initial 2 mm fistula segment showed a 21.6% decrease (0.74 mm to 0.58 mm). Blood flow through the AVF nearly doubled from 1.33 mL/min to 2.57 mL/min. Time-averaged wall shear stress (TAWSS) peak values and locations changed from 142 Pa (day 7) within the proximal artery to 200 Pa (day 21) in the stenotic region. The oscillatory shear index (OSI) showed marked elevation at the anastomosis (increasing from 0.22 to 0.48), indicating disturbed flow development. An inverse relationship between TAWSS and OSI was identified, consistent with previous studies. Our methodology demonstrates the capability to analyze relationships between early hemodynamics and subsequent geometric changes. This approach could enable identification of regions susceptible to stenosis development and monitoring of AVF maturation, which could ultimately lead to quantitative metrics to evaluate surgical outcomes and early therapeutic interventions.

                <p>by Farzaneh Darki, James Rankin, Piotr Słowiński</p>

Auditory stream segregation plays a crucial role in understanding the auditory scene. This study investigates the role of tactile stimulation in auditory stream segregation through psychophysics experiments and a computational model of audio-tactile interactions. We examine how tactile pulses, synchronized with one group of tones (high- or low-frequency tones) in a sequence of interleaved high- and low-frequency tones (ABA- triplets), influence the likelihood of perceiving integrated or segregated auditory streams. Our findings reveal that tactile pulses synchronized with a single tone sequence (either the A-tone or B-tone sequence) enhance perceptual segregation, while pulses synchronized with both tone sequences promote integration. Based on these findings, we developed a dynamical model that captures interactions between auditory and tactile neural circuits, including recurrent excitation, mutual inhibition, adaptation, and noise. The proposed model shows excellent agreement with the experiment. Model predictions are validated through psychophysics experiments. In the model, we assume that selective tactile stimulation dynamically modulates the tonotopic organization within the auditory cortex. This modulation facilitates segregation by reinforcing specific tonotopic responses through single-tone synchronization while smoothing neural activity patterns with dual-tone alignment to promote integration. The model offers a robust computational framework for exploring cross-modal effects on stream segregation and predicts neural behavior under varying tactile conditions. Our findings imply that cross-modal synchronization, with carefully timed tactile cues, could improve auditory perception with potential applications in auditory assistive technologies aimed at enhancing speech recognition in noisy settings.

                <p>by Sakurako Tanida, Kana Fuji, Linjie Lu, Tristan Guyomar, Byung Ho Lee, Alf Honigmann, Anne Grapin-Botton, Daniel Riveline, Tetsuya Hiraiwa, Makiko Nonomura, Masaki Sano</p>

Organoids are ideal systems to predict the phenotypes of organs. However, there is currently a lack of understanding regarding the generalized rules that enable use of simple cellular principles to make morphological predictions of entire organoids. Therefore, we employed a phase field model with the following basic components: the minimum conditions for the timing and volume of cell division, lumen nucleation rules, and lumenal pressure. Through our model, we could compute and generate a myriad of organoid phenotypes observed till date. We propose morphological indices necessary to characterize the shapes and construct phase diagrams and show their dependencies on proliferation time and lumen pressure. Additionally, we introduced the lumen-index parameter, which helped in examining the criteria to maintain organoids as spherical structures comprising a single layer of cells and enclosing an intact lumen. Finally, we predict a star-like organoid phenotype that did not undergo differentiation, suggesting that the volume constraint during cell division may determine the final phenotype. In summary, our approach provides researchers with guidelines to test the mechanisms of self-organization and predict the shape of organoid.

                Macrophages respond to bacteria at compromised intestinal barriers. Here, Jones et al. exposed macrophages to 15 commensal species and performed single-cell RNA sequencing to better understand their responses to individual bacteria. They find that macrophage responses vary within a population and that these responses are specific to individual organisms.

                Rennen et al. provide methods to distinguish homeostatic from immunogenic mature cDC1s, based on lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-induced maturation. Only the uptake of TLR ligand- or mRNA-encapsulated LNPs induces immunogenic maturation in DCs, while empty LNPs induce homeostatic maturation, revealing that empty LNPs are not sufficient to provide adjuvant activity.

                Chuard et al. show that GIV-derived viral insulin/IGF1-like peptides (VILPs) inhibit IGF-1 signaling by competing for IGF1R, reducing cell proliferation, and enhancing viral replication. VILPs are secreted early in infection and expressed in zebrafish, revealing a viral mimicry strategy that subverts host IGF-1 signaling for a replication advantage.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/107114">Structural mechanism of strand exchange by the RAD51 filament</a></h4>

              
                Homologous recombination (HR) preserves genomic stability by repairing double-strand DNA breaks and ensuring efficient DNA replication. Central to HR is the strand-exchange reaction taking place within the three-stranded synapsis wherein a RAD51 nucleoprotein filament binds to a donor DNA. Here, we present the cryoEM structure of a displacement loop of human RAD51 that captures the synaptic state when the filament has become tightly bound to the donor DNA. The structure elucidates the mechanism of strand exchange by RAD51, including the filament engagement with the donor DNA, the strand invasion and pairing with the complementary sequence of the donor DNA, the capture of the non-complementary strand and the polarity of the strand-exchange reaction. Our findings provide fundamental mechanistic insights into the biochemical reaction of eukaryotic HR.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104302">A pair of congenic mice for imaging of transplants by positron emission tomography using anti-transferrin receptor nanobodies</a></h4>

              
                Two anti-transferrin receptor (TfR) nanobodies, V<sub>H</sub>H123 specific for mouse TfR and V<sub>H</sub>H188 specific for human TfR, were used to track transplants non-invasively by PET/CT in mouse models, without the need for genetic modification of the transferred cells. We provide a comparison of the specificity and kinetics of the PET signals acquired when using nanobodies radiolabeled with <sup>89</sup>Zr, <sup>64</sup>Cu, and <sup>18</sup>F, and find that the chelation of the <sup>89</sup>Zr and <sup>64</sup>Cu radioisotopes to anti-TfR nanobodies results in radioisotope release upon endocytosis of the radiolabeled nanobodies. We used a knock-in mouse that expresses a TfR with a human ectodomain (Tfrc<i><sup>hu/hu</sup></i>) as a source of bone marrow for transplants into C57BL/6 recipients and show that V<sub>H</sub>H188 detects such transplants by PET/CT. Conversely, C57BL/6 bone marrow and B16.F10 melanoma cell line transplanted into Tfrc<i><sup>hu/hu</sup></i> recipients can be imaged with V<sub>H</sub>H123. In C57BL/6 mice impregnated by Tfrc<i><sup>hu/hu</sup></i> males, we saw an intense V<sub>H</sub>H188 signal in the placenta, showing that TfR-specific V<sub>H</sub>Hs accumulate at the placental barrier but do not enter the fetal tissue. We were unable to observe accumulation of the anti-TfR radiotracers in the central nervous system (CNS) by PET/CT but showed evidence of CNS accumulation by radiospectrometry. The model presented here can be used to track many transplanted cell types by PET/CT, provided cells express TfR, as is typically the case for proliferating cells such as tumor lines.

">Neuroanatomical Basis of Coma in Acute Ischemic Stroke</a></h4>

              
                Background: Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) can lead to profound disturbances in consciousness, including coma, which is associated with poor prognosis and increased mortality. Clarifying the lesion patterns that precipitate loss of consciousness can refine pathophysiological models and guide prognosis. Objectives: In this study, we aim to identify the brain regions most commonly affected in comatose AIS and determine whether specific combinations of lesions are necessary and sufficient to produce coma. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 476 AIS patients (52 comatose) using diffusion-weighted imaging. Infarcts were automatically segmented, manually verified, and normalized to MNI space. Support vector regression lesion-symptom mapping (SVR-LSM) quantified voxel-wise associations with coma, controlling for lesion volume. To assess the necessity and sufficiency of lesion combinations, we employed permutation-based nested logistic regression models comparing all subsets of four anatomical predictors: brainstem, thalamus, cerebellum, and the rest of brain lesions. Results: SVR-LSM revealed that coma was strongly associated with lesions involving the brainstem, thalamus, and cerebellum, whereas non-comatose patients exhibited predominantly cortical infarcts. Nested model comparisons showed that concurrent lesions to both the brainstem and thalamus were necessary and sufficient for coma. Additional involvement of the cerebellum or cerebral cortex did not improve predictive performance. Conclusions: Coma after AIS results from a dual-node subcortical lesion pattern involving both the brainstem and thalamus. Cerebellar and cortical lesions, even when extensive, did not induce coma in the absence of the dual-brainstem and thalamic lesions. These observations emphasize the predominant role of lesion location over lesion volume in the pathogenesis of coma. They also support mechanistic models that position the brainstem and thalamic hubs as central to the neural circuitry underlying arousal. Furthermore, these findings delineate a specific anatomical substrate that may serve as a strategic target for circuit-based neuroprotective and neuromodulatory therapies.

">A Toolkit for In Vivo Mapping and Modulating Neurotransmission at Single-Cell Resolution</a></h4>

              
                Understanding the organization and regulation of neurotransmission at the level of individual neurons and synapses requires tools that can track and manipulate transmitter-specific vesicles in vivo. Here, we present a suite of genetic tools in Caenorhabditis elegans to fluorescently label and conditionally ablate the vesicular transporters for glutamate, GABA, acetylcholine, and monoamines. Using a structure-guided approach informed by protein topology and evolutionary conservation, we engineered endogenously tagged versions for each transporter that maintain their physiological function while allowing for cell-specific, bright, and stable visualization. We also developed conditional knockout strains that enable targeted disruption of neurotransmitter synthesis or packaging in single neurons. We applied this toolkit to map co-expression of vesicular transporters across the C. elegans nervous system, revealing that over 10% of neurons exhibit co-transmission. Using the ADF sensory neuron as a case study, we demonstrate that serotonin and acetylcholine are trafficked in partially distinct vesicle pools. Our approach provides a powerful platform for mapping, monitoring, and manipulating neurotransmitter identity and use in vivo. The molecular strategies described here are likely applicable across species, offering a generalizable approach to dissect synaptic communication in vivo.

">Aging of the blood-brain barrier: Metabolic signatures of mouse brain endothelial cell senescence</a></h4>

              
                The blood-brain barrier (BBB) serves as a critical boundary between the peripheral circulation and the brain. Brain endothelial cells (BECs), which form the inner lining of cerebral blood vessels, play a key role in maintaining this barrier. They express tight junction proteins that prevent molecules from leaking between cells into the brain and efflux transporters that actively remove substances from the brain. As we age, the BBB becomes leaky and dysfunctional, leading to cerebrovascular diseases and dementia. Here, we investigated how BECs become senescent, a major feature of aging, and change their metabolic profile. First, we demonstrate that both the chemotherapeutic doxorubicin, a known inducer of cellular senescence, as well as hydrogen peroxide, a mediator of oxidative stress, induce BEC senescence. This was indicated by positive senescence-associated {beta}-galactosidase staining (P = 0.002 and P = 0.001 for doxorubicin and H2O2, respectively) and increased P16 gene expression (both P = 0.004). Next, we analyzed the metabolic profile of the senescent cells using mass spectrometry. We identified 47 significantly altered metabolites (P < 0.05) in cells and 65 in the supernatant samples of doxorubicin-induced senescent cells, as well as, 53 significantly altered metabolites in cells and 82 in the supernatant samples of H2O2-induced senescent cells. There was an overlap of 10 and 44 metabolites between both treatments in the cell and supernatant samples, respectively. Of those, 9 cellular and 12 supernatant metabolites have already been reported in the literature to be changed during senescence in the brain or other organs. We also identified new metabolites and provide pathway analyses of the significantly altered metabolites. These analyses are the first to characterize BBB cell senescence at a metabolite level and provide the basis for the development of novel therapeutic interventions for age-related neurological disorders.

">Measuring Joint Pain Through Tibio-Femoral Flexion: technique validation and assessment of behavior in response to different analgesics in rats</a></h4>

              
                Background: Assessing knee joint pain in experimental OA (EOA) models remains a significant challenge. Our study demonstrates that the use of an adapted electronic von Frey (aVF) device, featuring a modified tip, surpasses the standard von Frey (sVF) in detecting knee joint pain behavior and evaluating the efficacy of analgesic treatments in OA model induced by monoiodine acetate (MIA). Results: The sVF was able to induce a behavior profile in naive animals characterized by a hind paw flinching and withdrawal reflex. This behavioral response was affected by intraplantar lidocaine, which prone to the increase in mechanical thresholds related to sVF and validate it as pain related behavior. On the aVF method, the animals displayed no alterations at their mechanical thresholds in presence or absence of lidocaine, suggesting minimal stimulation of hind paw by the modified methodology. In animals where an osteoarthritic phenotype was induced by MIA, the aVF was able to detect a significant reduction on joint mechanical thresholds. The behavior linked to aVF was significantly affected by systemic delivery of morphine, confirming a nociceptive-like phenotype and suggesting a pain behavior predominantly triggered by joint flexion. The aVF was also able to detect an analgesic profile in MIA-OA rats treated with dexamethasone, LPS-RS, fucoidan, and morphine, indicating effectiveness in measure different the response profile triggered by analgesic drugs that affect joint pain perception. Conclusions: Our results suggest aVF as a more appropriate method to evaluate joint pain in rats.

">Semi-Automated Detection, Annotation, and Prognostic Assessment of Ictal Chirps in Intracranial EEG from Patients with Epilepsy</a></h4>

              
                We analyzed the spectro-temporal characteristics of ictal chirp events in intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings from 13 epilepsy patients, using a custom derivative dataset of 22,721 spectrograms that we generated from the Epilepsy-iEEG-Multicenter Dataset. Ictal chirps, transient frequency-modulated patterns, were semi-automatically annotated to assess their relationship with seizure onset zones (SOZs) and surgical outcomes. Preprocessing included notch filtering (60 Hz, 120 Hz) and bandpass filtering (1-60 Hz), followed by segmentation into 60-second windows. Spectrograms were generated via Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) with a Hann window (87.5% overlap) and converted to dB scale. Chirps were annotated by manually drawing bounding boxes, followed by automated ridge detection, model fitting, and feature extraction (start/end time-frequency, duration, direction, RMSE, R2). Spatial, Spectro-temporal, and clinical features were analyzed using heatmaps, hierarchical clustering, statistical tests (Mann-Whitney U), and outcome prediction models. Patient-channel mappings revealed clustering of chirp patterns among specific patient pairs, correlating with shared clinical profiles. Flow-based analysis demonstrated prognostic value: very high spectral durations in SOZ regions were associated with favorable surgical outcomes (80.43% success rate), whereas very high temporal durations in SOZ correlated with poorer outcomes (51.35% risk). Statistical comparisons showed significant differences between SOZ and non-SOZ chirps: SOZ chirps exhibited longer spectral durations (*p* < 0.001), shorter temporal durations (*p* = 0.006), and higher spectro-temporal ratios (*p* < 0.001). Distribution analyses further indicated that prolonged temporal chirps were more prevalent in non-SOZ regions.

">Distinct Electrophysiological Signatures Define Neuronal Subtypes in the Fasciola Cinereum</a></h4>

              
                The fasciola cinereum (FC) is a small, conserved hippocampal subregion whose function has remained largely unexplored. Anatomically situated between dorsal CA1 and the third ventricle in rodents, the FC receives diverse cortical and subcortical inputs yet is often omitted from hippocampal circuit models. There remains a fundamental knowledge gap regarding the cell types and intrinsic properties of neurons in FC and whether they are distinct from neighboring hippocampal subregions. Here, we performed ex vivo whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in mouse hippocampal slices to characterize FC neurons. We found that FC cells are functionally distinct from neighboring CA1 pyramidal cells, exhibiting significantly reduced excitability, delayed spike initiation, and enhanced afterhyperpolarization (AHP) currents, consistent with strong potassium conductance. Notably, we identified two electrophysiologically distinguishable FC neuron excitatory cell subtypes, differing in excitability and potassium channel activity. Pharmacological analyses demonstrated that Kv2.1 and Kv7 potassium channels play a key role in shaping the intrinsic properties of FC neurons, underlying their reduced excitability. These findings suggest that the FC is a heterogeneous structure, molecularly and functionally specialized for gating excitability within the hippocampal circuit.

">Cerebrovascular Claudin-5 Isoform Expression Correlates with Worsened Stroke Outcomes Following Thromboembolic Stroke</a></h4>

              
                Background and Purpose: Claudin-5 plays a crucial role in the maintenance of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity through its role in endothelial tight junction formation. Alternative splicing of claudin-5 within the microvascular endothelium may modulate BBB structural and functional dynamics, potentially influencing neuronal damage and recovery following ischemic stroke. We hypothesized that ischemic stroke induces temporal changes in claudin-5 protein isoform expression that correlates with worsened neurological outcomes. Methods: Male Wistar rats underwent thromboembolic stroke. Claudin-5 isoform expression was assessed at 3, 6, and 24h post-stroke onset, with additional groups receiving recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) at 4 hours post-stroke. Brain edema, infarct volume, hemorrhage, and cerebral blood flow was evaluated using 9.4T MRI. Ipsilateral and contralateral cerebrovascular claudin-5 expression was quantified via western blotting while neurological function was assessed by 28-point neuroscore. In addition, RNA sequencing analysis was performed to identify novel splice variants. Results: A time-dependent increase in claudin-5 isoform 1 (35kDa) expression levels in the ipsilateral cerebrovasculature at 6 h was observed. Isoform 2 (25kDa) and fragment (10kDa) isoforms of claudin-5 remain unchanged. Treatment with rt-PA maintained the elevated levels of isoform 1 claudin-5 protein expression within the ipsilateral hemisphere. Increased claudin-5 isoform 1 expression within the ipsilateral hemisphere correlated with increased brain edema, hemorrhage, and worsened neurological function at 24h post-stroke onset. RNA sequencing revealed novel CLDN5 splice isoforms in post-stroke rat brain tissue which resemble structural similarity to known human CLDN5 isoforms. Conclusion: These findings demonstrate that ischemic stroke induces temporal, hemisphere-specific alterations in claudin-5 isoform expression that correlate with BBB dysfunction and poor neurological outcomes. The potential indication of novel alternative splice variants suggests that post-transcriptional regulation of claudin-5 represents a previously unrecognized mechanism contributing to endothelial tight junction dysfunction and stroke pathophysiology. These results highlight claudin-5 isoform expression as a potential therapeutic target for preserving BBB integrity following cerebral ischemia.

">A Practical Preprocessing Pipeline for Concurrent TMS-iEEG: Critical Steps and Methodological Considerations</a></h4>

              
                Transcranial magnetic stimulation combined with intracranial EEG (TMS-iEEG) has emerged as a powerful approach for probing the causal organization and dynamics of the human brain. Despite its promise, the presence of TMS-induced artifacts poses significant challenges for accurately characterizing and interpreting evoked neural responses. In this study, we present a practical preprocessing pipeline for single pulse TMS-iEEG data, incorporating key steps of re-referencing, filtering, artifact interpolation, and detrending. Using both real and simulated data, we systematically evaluated the effects of each step and compared alternative methodological choices. Our results demonstrate that this pipeline effectively attenuated various types of artifacts and noise, yielding cleaner signals for the subsequent analysis of intracranial TMS-evoked potentials (iTEPs). Moreover, we showed that methodological choices can substantially influence iTEPs outcomes. In particular, referencing methods might strongly affect iTEP morphology and amplitude, underscoring the importance of tailoring the referencing strategy to specific signal characteristics and research objectives. For filtering, we recommend a segment-based strategy, i.e., applying filters to data segments excluding the artifact window, to minimize distortion from abrupt TMS-related transients. Overall, this work represents an important step toward establishing a general preprocessing framework for TMS-iEEG data. We hope it encourages broader adoption and methodological development in concurrent TMS-iEEG research, ultimately advancing our understanding of brain organization and TMS mechanisms.

">Older Adults Show Altered Network Connectivity during Fairness Decisions with Similar and Dissimilar Partners</a></h4>

              
                Objectives: The ability to navigate diverse social contexts, such as interacting with different individuals, is crucial across the lifespan and has implications for fraud susceptibility. However, the neural mechanisms supporting social decisions in older adults within varied social contexts remain largely unknown. This study investigated how age and partner similarity modulate neural activation and network connectivity during fairness-related decision making and whether individual differences in behavioral sensitivity to fairness norm violations correlate with neural activities. Methods: Younger (18-35) and older (65-80) adults underwent fMRI while playing an ultimatum game with ostensible partners of a similar or dissimilar age. We used regression to model choice behavior and whole-brain fMRI analyses to examine functional activation and connectivity of the Default Mode (DMN) and Executive Control (ECN) networks. Results: Behaviorally, choices did not differ by age, partner similarity, or their interactions. In contrast, neuroimaging revealed interactions between age, partner similarity, and individual sensitivity to norm violation. Younger adults exhibited positive DMN-anterior cingulate connectivity when interacting with a similar-aged partner, whereas older adults showed a negative connectivity. Furthermore, younger adults demonstrated a negative correlation between their sensitivity to norm violation and the partner-identity effect in ECN-medial prefrontal cortex connectivity, whereas older adults showed a positive correlation. Discussion: Our findings indicate a brain-behavior dissociation where different neural mechanisms support similar behavioral outcomes across age groups. These opposing patterns of neural responses suggest age-related functional reorganizations, which may represent compensatory strategies that enable older adults to preserve behaviors similar to that of their younger counterparts.

">Dominant MLC-causing mutations alter hepaCAM subcellular localization and protein interactome in astrocytes of the developing mouse cortex</a></h4>

              
                Megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy with subcortical cysts (MLC) is a rare leukodystrophy characterized by early-onset macrocephaly, white matter edema, seizures, and motor and cognitive decline. Missense mutations to hepatic and glial cell adhesion molecule (hepaCAM), also known as GlialCAM, are responsible for approximately twenty-five percent of MLC cases. HepaCAM is highly enriched in astrocytes and plays important roles in astrocyte territory establishment, gap junction coupling, branching organization, synaptic function, and development of the gliovascular unit. The molecular mechanisms through which MLC-causing missense mutations alter hepaCAM function in vivo and facilitate MLC pathogenesis during brain development remain largely unknown. Here, we used new viral tools and proximity-based proteomics to examine how three different dominant MLC-causing mutations impact hepaCAM subcellular localization and protein interactome in astrocytes of the developing mouse cortex. We found dramatic defects in hepaCAM distribution throughout the astrocyte, which were common to all mutants tested. We also observed significant changes in protein interactome between wild type and mutant hepaCAM, including decreased association with previously described hepaCAM-interacting proteins Connexin 43 and CLC-2. Moreover, we identified changes in association between hepaCAM and a number of previously undescribed potential hepaCAM-interaction partners, including the epilepsy-associated potassium channel KCNQ2. Collectively, our data provide new insights into hepaCAM function in astrocytes during brain development, reveal altered hepaCAM protein dynamics with MLC missense mutations, and provide a new resource to explore the molecular underpinnings of MLC pathogenesis.

">Open-source modular FPGA system for two-photon mesoscope enabling multi-layer, multi-depth neural activity recording and lifetime imaging</a></h4>

              
                Large field-of-view (FOV) two-photon microscopy makes it possible to record a large number of neural activities from multiple brain regions simultaneously. However, the larger the field of view, the longer it takes to scan the entire FOV. To increase imaging speed, we have developed open-source software to digitize analogue signals from a photomultiplier tube using a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) at a rate of 3.2 GS/s. By combining this with a newly developed a circular delay-path module for a custom two-photon mesoscope (Diesel2p), we succeeded in simultaneous recording of >10,000 neurons from the entire bilateral dorsal cortex at up to four depths. We also demonstrated large FOV lifetime imaging using the same system. Our modular, open-source FPGA system can be readily integrated into any type of two-photon microscope and will accelerate the biomedical application of multi-scale two-photon imaging in a wide range of pathophysiological investigations.

">Helix-to-Beta-Sheet Transition Drives Self-Assembly of Glutamate Transporter EAA1 Splice Peptides</a></h4>

              
                Truncated isoforms play a critical role in understanding the structural and functional properties of membrane proteins, including glutamate transporters. Here, we molecularly characterize two helical truncated isoforms of the human glutamate transporter EAA1. Using an integrative multi-omics and computational approach, we show that these isoforms, particularly one derived from the N-terminus, do not adopt the canonical transporter fold. Instead, they self-assemble into stable, {beta}-sheet-enriched oligomers, a structure previously unobserved for this protein family. Furthermore, we identified a water-soluble truncated isoform (A0A7P0TAF5) of the membranous canonical EAA1, revealing that self-assembly is not confined to membranous isoforms of EAA1. This finding uncovers a previously unrecognized functional class of truncated isoforms capable of initiating assembly in the soluble state. Our 500ns molecular dynamics simulations further reveal that the N-terminal truncation alters the native conformational dynamics, promoting a transition into semi-helical {beta}-structures over time. In a model bilayer, {beta}-Sheet-driven octamerization of the helical EAA1 isoform A0A7P0Z4F7 induces localized upper leaflet membrane pitting during 250ns all-atom simulation. Helix to {beta}-sheet oligomer transitions is a known pathological hallmark of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. Our findings thus uncover a potential new mechanism for glutamate transporter involvement in neurodegeneration and identify the N-terminal domain as a promising therapeutic target. This work highlights how alternative splicing can generate isoforms with novel interaction patterns and distinct molecular conformations.

">Temporal Deconvolution of Mesoscale Recordings</a></h4>

              
                Mesoscale calcium imaging techniques, such as wide-field imaging, enable high temporal resolution recordings of extensive neuronal activity across one or more brain regions. However, since the recordings capture light emission generated by the fluorescence of the calcium indicator, the neural activity that drives the calcium changes is masked by the dynamics of the calcium indicator. In this study, we develop and evaluate new methods to deconvolve fluorescence traces into the underlying neuronal spiking rates driving them. Our new inference methods take into account both the noise in the recordings and the temporal dynamics of the calcium indicator response. Our first proposed method, termed 'Dynamical-Binning', estimates spiking rates that are constant over discrete time bins. The size of each time bin depends on the data and is determined dynamically. Our second method, 'Continuously-Varying,' estimates the spiking rate as a continuous function. This method aims at studies seeking to find slow rate fluctuations rather than identifying abrupt changes in the spiking rate. The third method, 'First-Differences', aims to give a quick estimate of the spiking rates, which is beneficial for exceptionally large datasets, typical of mesoscale recordings. Our fourth method, is a modified 'Weiner Filter.' It estimates spiking rates by efficiently removing noise with a fixed ratio compared to the signal. This approach is beneficial for datasets exhibiting large fluctuations in fluorescence magnitudes. We compare the accuracy of our methods against the existing 'Lucy-Richardson' image recovery algorithm in its adapted form to recover temporal dynamics. Our results demonstrate that all our proposed methods surpass the performance of 'Lucy-Richardson' on both synthetic and recording datasets, including concurrent recordings of fluorescence and spike counts from the exact origin by multichannel silicon probes. Furthermore, we illustrate that our findings are indifferent to the choice of removing hemodynamic signals. Lastly, we demonstrate that the reliance on calcium signals for advanced analytical approaches can lead to distorted results. For example, they can show correlations between the activity of different brain regions that are unrealistically high compared to the correlations of the underlying spiking rate between the same areas. This highlights the critical importance of temporal inference for further accurate and reliable analysis in understanding the complexities of brain activity.

">Reduced TRPC3 conductance underlies altered SNr activity under dopamine depletion: predictions from data-driven network models</a></h4>

              
                Sufficient loss of dopamine within the basal ganglia (BG) leads to neuronal activity changes, including altered firing rates and firing patterns, thought to underlie parkinsonian motor symptoms. Yet, within BG neuronal populations, baseline activity and responses to inputs are highly variable, complicating efforts to identify key factors associated with pathological changes. We introduce a novel approach to constructing a computational neuron population model that, when applied to the mouse substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr), captures the firing heterogeneity observed across slice and in vivo recordings. This model reproduces the diversity of SNr neuron responses to stimulation of GABAergic input terminals, yielding new insights into the mechanisms underlying this variability. Moreover, our modeling pinpoints significant decreases in TRPC3 conductance in SNr dendrites as a key determinant of altered SNr activity in the dopamine depleted state, with important implications for efforts to restore functional SNr activity in this condition.

">Distinct developmental changes in linear and nonlinear neural interactions across infancy and adulthood</a></h4>

              
                The development of functional brain connectivity during early life depends on social experience and is best understood in the context of interactions with a caregiver. It is still an open question to what extent distinct modes of functional connectivity dominate in different stages of human brain development, and whether cognitive tasks can differentially modulate them. Using electroencephalography (EEG), we investigated the development of linear and nonlinear functional brain connectivity in infants and adults while they socially interacted. Using simultaneous EEG recordings in parent-infant dyads performing two different experiments (N = 160; 80 adults and 80 infants), we computed functional connectivity capturing distinct dynamics: a linear measure capturing phase synchronization (weighted phase lag index; WPLI), and a nonlinear measure capturing information sharing (weighted symbolic mutual information; WSMI). In both tasks, adults showed higher WSMI than infants, whereas infants showed higher WPLI than adults. Moreover, infant age predicted only task-related connectivity values computed with the nonlinear measure and not with its linear counterpart, suggesting that the information-theoretic measure was more sensitive to developmental changes in task-relevant neural processing. These findings suggest that over development, a shift in dominance from linear to nonlinear modes of brain communication may be essential for supporting emerging higher cognitive abilities, such as precursors to executive function (here, attention shifting) and social decision-making. Further, this work highlights the importance of using nonlinear measures in addition to traditional linear ones, which collectively permit a more robust capture of maturational changes.

">Regional patterns of neurodegeneration in a mouse model of proteinopathy</a></h4>

              
                The aggregation of misfolded proteins is a hallmark of many neurodegenerative diseases, suggesting shared pathological mechanisms. However, the pathways by which protein misfolding in these proteinopathies lead to neuronal death remain unclear. Proteinopathies can be modelled in transgenic animals by expressing disease-causing mutations that promote protein aggregation, or in wild-type animals by injecting misfolded proteins (e.g. RML scrapie) that spread in a prion-like manner and recapitulate key neurodegenerative features, including gliosis, ER stress, and neuronal loss. Here, we map region-specific histopathological features of scrapie-induced neurodegeneration in the hippocampus, thalamus, cortex, and cerebellum during early (12 weeks post-inoculation) and late (20 weeks) stages of disease. Using a streamlined time-efficient protocol, we achieve reproducible paired sample collection and high-quality immunohistochemistry that is compatible with best practice in decontamination and containment. We found that among the tested markers of early pathology, thalamic astrocytic activation and spongiform degeneration were the most sensitive. By the late stage, there was widespread upregulation of IBA1+ microglia and GFAP+ astrocytes, accompanied by strong immunoreactivity of lysosomal marker LAMP1. LAMP1 expression in healthy brains was largely neuronal, but by 20 weeks it was significantly upregulated in astrocytes, suggesting their involvement in lysosomal pathology. The ER stress marker p-PERK was elevated in CA1/CA3 pyramidal neurons but minimal in the thalamus and cerebellum, where neuronal loss was most pronounced, suggesting region-specific mechanisms of degeneration. Overall, the thalamus and hippocampal CA1/CA3 areas exhibited the greatest pathological burden. Our shorter time-course, new pathological insights and safe handling protocols, and improved welfare, supports broader adoption of the RML scrapie model for resource-efficient studies of neurodegeneration and its prevention.

">Functional muscle networks reveal the mechanistic effects of post-stroke rehabilitation on motor impairment and therapeutic responsiveness</a></h4>

              
                Standardised assessment of post-stroke motor impairment and treatment responsiveness remains a major clinical challenge. In this study, we tackle this challenge by applying a novel muscle network analysis framework to stroke survivors undergoing intensive upper-limb motor training. Our approach revealed distinct patterns of redundant and synergistic muscle interactions, collectively reflecting the diverse biomechanical roles of flexor- and extensor-driven networks. From these patterns, we derived new biomarkers that stratified patients by impairment severity and therapeutic responsiveness, each associated with unique physiological signatures. Notably, we identified a shift from redundancy to synergy in muscle coordination as a hallmark of effective rehabilitation--a transformation supported by a more precise quantification of treatment outcomes. These findings offer an in-depth mechanistic account of post-stroke motor recovery and establish a robust, independent tool for evaluating rehabilitation efficacy.

">Dpp6 Homozygous Knockout Mice Exhibit Increased Ethanol Conditioned Place Preference and Acute Ethanol-Induced Anxiolytic Behavior</a></h4>

              
                The gene DPP6 has been associated with behavioral phenotypes of alcohol use disorder (AUD) in recent human genome wide association studies. To further assess the role of this gene in ethanol-related traits, we tested Dpp6 knockout (KO) mice for ethanol conditioned place preference (CPP), locomotor activity, and ethanol-induced anxiolysis. Male homozygous KO mice (HOM) showed greater preference for the ethanol-paired context compared to wild type littermates (WT) and heterozygous KO mice (HET), while female mice showed no genotypic difference. HOM of both sexes exhibited greater novelty-induced hyperactivity in the CPP apparatus than HET and WT mice in the first two minutes. In a separate experiment, HOM mice showed enhanced locomotor activity following a 1.5 g/kg ethanol injection; however, they also displayed greater locomotor activity during habituation, suggesting basal locomotor differences. Following 1.5 and 2 g/kg injections, HOM mice exhibited EtOH-induced anxiolysis in the first 5 minutes, while the HET and WT mice did not. Lastly, HOM mice displayed a significant sedative response compared to WT animals following a 2 g/kg injection of ethanol. Ultimately, these findings validate a role for Dpp6 in modulating ethanol's rewarding, anxiolytic, and sedative effects in a sex-dependent manner.

">Scratcher: An automated machine-vision tool for dissecting the neural basis of itch</a></h4>

              
                Itch or pruritus invokes a specific reflexive and repetitive directed nocifensive behavioural response, known as scratching. Recent decades have revealed neural circuits that are involved in the sensory and affective-motivational aspects of itch-induced scratching. However, most of these studies relied on manual subjective methods of quantifying scratching in laboratory mice and rats. Recent advances in deep learning have opened avenues for the development of computational tools to analyze animal behaviour in a reliable and automated manner. Further, combined with optogenetic and chemogenetic strategies, these tools can accelerate our understanding of neural circuits underlying itch and scratching. To that end, we have developed Scratcher, a GUI-based computational tool based on a real-time object detection algorithm that allows semi-supervised automated analysis of scratching behaviour in mice in a computationally inexpensive manner. We recorded chloroquine-induced acute itch as it developed, and determined the consequence of nail-trimming on acute-itch induced scratching with Scratcher. To probe the neural mechanisms underlying itch, we combined Scratcher with genetic circuit dissection using the Fos-TRAP mouse line. By targeting itch-activated neurons in the lateral parabrachial nucleus (LPBN) - a key brainstem hub for pruritic signal transmission - we demonstrated that LPBN activity modulates itch-evoked scratching. Together, we present a novel, easy-to-use computational tool to dissect molecular, cellular, and circuit mechanisms of itch and scratching.

">Cortical GABAergic inhibition dynamics around hippocampal sharp-wave ripples</a></h4>

              
                Cortical inhibition, mediated by GABA, is essential in balancing excitation and modulating neural processing, but it is unclear to what extent inhibitory dynamics are responsive to internally generated hippocampal activity, such as sharp-wave ripples (SWRs). Employing widefield imaging of extracellular GABA with iGABASnFR2 and hippocampal recordings, we characterized cortical inhibition during sleep and awake states and in the neighborhood of SWRs. Sleep and awake transitions drastically reorganized cortical levels of GABA, with increased inhibition in wakefulness and decreased upon entering NREM sleep. In the neighborhood of SWRs, inhibition was state- and region-specific: during NREM, medial cortices (e.g., retrosplenial) increased GABA before SWRs, whereas sensory areas in the lateral cortices decreased it; during wake, GABA increased in lateral cortices after SWRs. These findings reveal that cortical inhibition is not static and ubiquitous but instead is dynamically characterized by brain state, orchestrating the flow of hippocampal outputs to the rest of the cortex. Inhibitory modulation, as our data reveal, forms a mechanism allowing selective gating of memory-related activity during wakefulness and sleep.

                RatDISCO is a simple, cost-effective, and reproducible tissue-clearing protocol optimised for immunolabeling in adult rat brains. It enables robust detection of diverse neuronal subtypes, glial populations, and vasculature, overcoming key limitations in antibody penetration and optical transparency. It is compatible with virally labelled- and transgenic mice, as well as human-derived brain organoids, highlighting its versatility across species and models. Functionally, it enables the detection of activity-dependent markers after behaviour, verified in a rat model of neurodevelopmental disorders, the Fragile X syndrome. These findings highlight RatDISCO as a broadly applicable tool for investigating neuroanatomical and functional alterations in rat models of disorders.

">The Latency of a Domain-General Visual Surprise Signal is Attribute Dependent</a></h4>

              
                Predictions concerning upcoming visual input play a key role in resolving percepts. Sometimes input is surprising, under which circumstances the brain must calibrate erroneous predictions so that perception is veridical. Despite the extensive literature investigating the nature of prediction error signalling, it is still unclear how this process interacts with the functionally segregated nature of the visual cortex, particularly within the temporal domain. Here, we recorded electroencephalography (EEG) from humans whilst they viewed static image trajectories containing a bound object that sequentially changed along different visual attribute dimensions (shape and colour). Crucially, the context of this change was designed to appear random (and unsurprising) or violate the established trajectory (and cause a surprise). Event-related potential analysis found no effects of surprise after controlling for cortical adaptation. However, multivariate pattern analyses found whole-brain neural representations of visual surprise that overlapped between attributes, albeit at distinct, attribute-specific latencies. These findings suggest that visual surprise results in whole-brain, generalised (i.e., attribute-agnostic) prediction error responses that conform to an attribute-dependent temporal hierarchy.

">Non-neuronal, TGF-β- extracellular matrix restructuring promotes neurodegeneration in a PSP-Richardson syndrome model</a></h4>

              
                Progressive supranuclear palsy-Richardson syndrome (PSP-RS) is a rapidly progressive tauopathy lacking effective therapies. Although tau aggregation is a defining feature, the initiating mechanisms remain elusive. Here we used patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cell midbrain organoids, integrating single-cell transcriptomics, bulk RNA profiling, and quantitative proteomics, to dissect early pathogenic events. We identified vascular leptomeningeal-like cells (VLMCs) as the first altered population, exhibiting TGF-{beta}-driven extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling enriched in collagens, integrins, and TGFBI. The resulting pathological ECM increased stiffness, induced integrin clustering, and activated RhoA-ROCK-mediated cytoskeletal disorganization. These changes sustained PI3K-AKT and MAPK-ERK signaling, suppressed PP2A, hyperactivated mTOR, and impaired autophagy, culminating in tau hyperphosphorylation and mislocalization. Pharmacological inhibition of TGF{beta}, AKT, ERK, or mTORC1 restored autophagic flux, reduced tau burden, and rescued neuronal architecture. Our findings establish non-neuronal, matrix-producing niche cells as upstream drivers of tauopathy and reveal TGF-{beta}-mediated ECM restructuring as a mechanochemical trigger of neurodegeneration, opening multiple therapeutic avenues for PSP-RS and related tauopathies.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Intracranial language localization with electrical stimulation mapping (ESM) and high-gamma modulation (HGM) mapping relies on artificial, repetitive tasks, requiring sustained cooperation from patients. Herein, we tested the validity of unstructured, interpersonal, naturalistic conversation for language localization, using a novel methodology: Behavior-iEEG-Spectral-Power correlation (BESPoC). We first validated BESPoC against ESM, HGM, and neuropsychological outcomes using well-established language tasks, then demonstrated the validity of naturalistic conversation.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We included 134 patients (59 females), aged 2–29 years, undergoing standard-of-care stereo-electroencephalography monitoring who engaged in picture naming, auditory naming, story listening, and conversed with a family member. ESM and HGM analysis were performed using established methods. BESPoC methodology quantified correlation between stereo-electroencephalography spectral power from task recordings, obviating the need for any trial-based epochs, and behavioral markers. The large sample size allowed mixed-effects modeling to compare BESPoC with HGM and ESM.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>BESPoC showed high specificity (0.79–0.83) and sensitivity (0.64–0.86) for localizing HGM language sites across the tasks. BESPoC also compared well with HGM across all language tasks for localizing ESM speech/language sites. With conventional tasks, BESPoC was superior to HGM for modeling neuropsychological deficits seen, despite preserving ESM speech/language sites. Naturalistic conversation compared well with standard tasks for localization of HGM and ESM language sites, and determined neuropsychological outcomes better than conventional tasks.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Using BESPoC methodology naturalistic conversation is shown to produce valid cortical language maps of both expressive and receptive language, and determine neuropsychological outcomes after epilepsy surgery. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Previous research has shown that transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (tVNS) promotes declarative fear extinction, but its neural mechanisms in this process are still unclear. This study aimed to explore tVNS’s impacts on physiological (skin conductance response [SCR]) and neural (event-related potentials, ERP) fear-related responses. Forty healthy participants were randomly assigned to the tVNS or Sham group. During a fear-conditioned memory paradigm, electroencephalograph (EEG) and SCR were measured. We analyzed SCR amplitude, ERP components, EEG signal spectral analysis, and the correlation between SCR and EEG metrics. Results showed that compared with the Sham group, the tVNS group had a remarkable decrease in SCR amplitudes for conditioned stimuli (CS+) during retrieval and recall, suggesting reduced sympathetic arousal. ERP analysis revealed a notable decline in late positive potential (LPP) (400–800 ms) amplitudes for CS+ in the tVNS group during these phases, indicating weakened neural reactivity. A significant group-by-phase interaction showed that tVNS effectively suppressed immediate and sustained fear responses, maintaining lower fear-related physiological and neural activity levels. These findings suggest that tVNS modulates neural circuits involved in fear processing, clarifies the mechanisms underlying fear extinction, and highlights its therapeutic potential for fear-related disorders.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Biological motion (BM) perception is crucial for survival and social interaction. Previous studies have shown that form structure influences the perception of walking direction and body orientation. However, the neural mechanisms underlying how form modulates the processing of these features remain unclear. To investigate how form is encoded and its interaction with the processing of walking direction and body orientation, we combined EEG and multivariate pattern analyses. Participants viewed classic point-light displays with different forms, walking directions, and body orientations. The decoding results revealed that form information was significantly decoded starting around 85 ms, peaking at 275 ms. The time generalization analysis revealed that the neural representation of form was transient before ~ 200 ms, and became stable thereafter. Importantly, decoding accuracy became significant at 100 ms for both body orientation and walking direction when form was intact, but remained at chance level for walking direction and was reduced for body orientation when form was scrambled. These results indicate that form structure influences the time course of body orientation and walking direction processing. These findings shed light on the encoding of form structure and its role in shaping the neural representation of other BM features.</span>

<p>
</p>
<br/>
<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Charcot–Marie–Tooth (CMT) disease is a heterogeneous group of genetic neuropathies, with &gt;90 genes identified. Several aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases have been linked to CMT. <i>DARS2</i>, encoding the mitochondrial aspartyl-tRNA synthetase, has been typically associated with leukoencephalopathy with brainstem and spinal cord involvement and lactate elevation. This study aimed to investigate the association between biallelic <i>DARS2</i> variants and axonal CMT.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We investigated 5 individuals from 3 unrelated families with axonal CMT and biallelic <i>DARS2</i> variants. Functional studies in fibroblasts assessed their effects on DARS2 expression, localization, and mitochondrial function. Enzymatic activity was evaluated in HEK293 cells.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The 5 individuals, including 4 adults, presented with childhood-onset progressive axonal CMT. None had leukoencephalopathy, but one showed central nervous system involvement, with intellectual disability and epilepsy. Genetic analysis identified compound heterozygous <i>DARS2</i> variants: family A, p.Ser238Phe and p.Arg336Cys; family B, p.Ser238Phe and p.Ile25Thrfs*38; family C, c.492+2T&gt;C and p.Pro503Leu. Functional studies revealed reduced DARS2 protein levels, mitochondrial network abnormalities, and impaired mitochondrial function. p.Ser238Phe behaves as a hypomorphic allele, whereas p.Pro503Leu reduced DARS2 enzymatic activity by 75%.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings expand the <i>DARS2</i>-related disease spectrum, establishing a novel association with axonal CMT. Hypomorphic variants, such as p.Ser238Phe, when paired with more deleterious variants, result in isolated axonal CMT, whereas more severe combinations—although not as deleterious as those seen in leukoencephalopathy with brainstem and spinal cord involvement and lactate elevation—result in axonal CMT with central nervous system involvement, albeit without leukoencephalopathy. These observations raise the possibility that <i>DARS2</i>-associated diseases form a continuum rather than representing strictly distinct central or peripheral nervous system disorders.

                The brain regulates breathing in response to changes in CO2/H+ by a process referred to as respiratory chemoreception. The retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN) is essential for this function. RTN neurons are intrinsically activated by CO2/H+. Astrocytes contribute as well, by providing a CO2/H+-dependent purinergic drive to augment neural activity directly and indirectly by causing vasoconstriction. Here, we summarize preclinical studies in rodents that identify: (i) mechanisms of CO2/H+ detection by RTN neurons; (ii) how this information is integrated at the neural network level; and (iii) how RTN neural activity is shaped by CO2/H+ sensitive astrocytes. We also discuss how disruption of RTN chemoreception might contribute to breathing problems in disease, and highlight the therapeutic potential of targeting CO2/H+-dependent and -independent regulatory elements of RTN neurons.

                Lo et al. show that binge feeding suppresses piriform (olfactory) cortex activity, reducing the brain’s representation of food flavor. This suppression is driven by the olfactory tubercle and promotes continued eating by decreasing sensory satiation. The findings link sensory suppression to overeating and highlight a cortical mechanism regulating appetite.

                The sauropod hind limb was the main support that allowed their gigantic body masses and a wide range of dynamic stability adaptations. It was closely related to the position of the center of masses of their multi-ton barrel-shaped bodies and experienced one of the most noticeable posture changes during macronarian evolution. Deeply branched macronarians achieved increasingly arched hind limbs in what is known as wide-gauge posture. However, it is not clear if this evolutionary trend is related to the evolutionary cascade toward gigantism even though some titanosaurians were the largest terrestrial vertebrates that ever existed. We tested evolutionary changes in hind limb morphology in the Macronaria phylogenetic tree by 3D geometric morphometrics. The macronarian hind limb does become progressively more arched toward deeply branched groups, specifically Saltasauridae. However, there is morphological convergence between different macronarian subclades. Wide-gauge posture does not correlate with changes in body size deeper in the macronarian evolutionary tree and acted as an exaptation to gigantism. Despite some titanosaurian subclades becoming some of the largest vertebrates, there is not a statistically significant trend toward a particular body size, but we identify a phyletic body size decrease in Macronaria.

                The CA3 region of the hippocampus is the major site of sharp wave initiation, and a brain region crucially involved in learning and memory. Highly recurrent connectivity within its excitatory network is thought to underlie processes involved in memory formation. Recent work has indicated that distinct subpopulations of pyramidal neurons within this region may contribute differently to network activity, including sharp waves, in CA3. Exactly how these contributions may arise is not yet known. Here, we disentangle the local connectivity between two distinct CA3 cell types in mice: thorny and athorny pyramidal cells. We find an asymmetry in the connectivity between these two populations, with athorny cells receiving strong input from both athorny and thorny cells. Conversely, the thorny cell population receives very little input from the athorny population. Computational modeling suggests that this connectivity scheme may determine the sequential activation of these cell types during large network events such as sharp waves.

                <p>Fiber photometry is a neuroscience technique that can continuously monitor in vivo fluorescence to assess population neural activity or neuropeptide/transmitter release in freely behaving animals. Despite the widespread adoption of this technique, methods to statistically analyze data in an unbiased, objective, and easily adopted manner are lacking. Various pipelines for data analysis exist, but they are often system specific, are only for preprocessing data, and/or lack usability. Current post hoc statistical approaches involve inadvertently biased user-defined time-binned averages or area under the curve analysis. To date, no post hoc user-friendly tool with few assumptions for a standardized unbiased analysis exists, yet such a tool would improve reproducibility and statistical reliability for all users. Hence, we have developed a user-friendly post hoc statistical analysis package in Python that is easily downloaded and applied to data from any fiber photometry system. This Fiber Photometry Post Hoc Analysis (FiPhoPHA) package incorporates a variety of tools, a downsampler, bootstrapped confidence intervals (CIs) for analyzing peri-event signals between groups and compared with baseline, and permutation tests for comparing peri-event signals across comparison periods. We also include the ability to quickly and efficiently sort the data into mean time bins, if desired. This provides an open-source, user-friendly Python package for unbiased and standardized post hoc statistical analysis to improve reproducibility using data from any fiber photometry system.</p>

Tractometry uses diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) to assess physical properties of brain connections. Here, we present an integrative ecosystem of software that performs all steps of tractometry: post-processing of dMRI data, delineation of major white matter pathways, and modeling of the tissue properties within them. This ecosystem also provides a set of interoperable and extensible tools for visualization and interpretation of the results that extract insights from these measurements. These include novel machine learning and statistical analysis methods adapted to the characteristic structure of tract-based data. We benchmark the performance of these statistical analysis methods in different datasets and analysis tasks, including hypothesis testing on group differences and predictive analysis of subject age. We also demonstrate that computational advances implemented in the software offer orders of magnitude of acceleration. Taken together, these open-source software tools—freely available at https://tractometry.org—provide a transformative environment for the analysis of dMRI data.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1013319">IonBench: A benchmark of optimisation strategies for mathematical models of ion channel currents</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Matt J. Owen, Gary R. Mirams</p>

Ion channel models present many challenging optimisation problems. These include unidentifiable parameters, noisy data, unobserved states, and a combination of both fast and slow timescales. This can make it difficult to choose a suitable optimisation routine <i>a priori</i>. Nevertheless, many attempts have been made to design optimisation routines specifically for ion channel models, however, little work has been done to compare these optimisation approaches. We have developed ionBench, an open-source optimisation benchmarking framework, to evaluate and compare these approaches against a standard set of ion channel optimisation problems. We included implementations of thirty-four unique optimisation approaches that have been previously applied to ion channel models and evaluated them against the ionBench test suite, consisting of five parameter optimisation problems derived from the cardiac ion channel literature. Each optimisation approach was initiated from multiple starting parameters and tasked with reproducing a problem-specific simulated dataset. Through ionBench, we tracked and evaluated the performance of these optimisations, identifying the expected run time until a successful optimisation for each approach, which was used for comparisons. Finally, we used these results, in addition to other literature results, to identify a new efficient approach. Its use could reduce computation time by multiple orders of magnitude, while also improving the reliability of ion channel parameter optimisation.

Many-author non-empirical papers include “how to” articles, recommendations or consensus statements, roadmaps for future research, catalogs of ideas, or calls to action. These papers benefit the research community and broader academic ecosystem by addressing unmet needs or introducing new perspectives and approaches. Large, diverse authorship teams that examine an issue from many different perspectives can create valuable resources that individual co-authors could not develop independently, or in smaller groups. Realizing the potential of many-author non-empirical papers, however, requires very different strategies than researchers would typically use to write papers with fewer authors. In our process, a core team of lead writers typically works together to lead the content generation and writing processes, while many co-authors collaboratively create content and provide feedback on outlines and drafts. Challenges for co-authors may include learning to write a different type of paper, adapting to high-volume feedback, and understanding the very diverse perspectives shared by fellow co-authors. This paper outlines ten simple rules for being a co-author on a many-author non-empirical paper. Although the rules were developed for papers with at least 30 authors, some rules may be useful for many-author research papers or for non-empirical papers with fewer authors. Co-authors may also want to consult our companion paper on ten simple rules for leading a many-author non-empirical paper, as understanding the challenges faced by lead writers will help co-authors to contribute more efficiently and effectively.

Many-author non-empirical papers include recommendations or consensus statements, catalogs of ideas, roadmaps for future research, calls to action, or “how to” articles. These papers have great potential to change the conversation or address unmet needs within research communities. Large, diverse authorship teams can create valuable resources that no individual co-author could create independently. Achieving these goals, however, requires a very different approach than researchers typically use to prepare papers with fewer authors. In the process we describe, a small team of lead writers typically leads the content generation and writing processes. Many co-authors collaborate to create content and provide feedback throughout the writing process. Lead writers face many challenges, including defining the content and structure of the paper, coordinating complex logistics, preparing themselves and co-authors for a unique writing experience, and managing high-volume feedback. Here, we outline ten simple rules for leading a many-author non-empirical paper. These rules guide readers through the content generation and writing processes and highlight practical solutions to common challenges. While these rules were developed by preparing non-empirical papers with at least 30 authors, some rules may apply to research papers or non-empirical papers with fewer authors. Lead writers can also use our companion paper, which shares ten simple rules for being a co-author on a many-author non-empirical paper, to prepare co-authors for an efficient and effective collaborative process.

                <p>by Antoinette Fang, Lakshin Kumar, Kate E. Creevy, Daniel E.L. Promislow, Jing Ma, the Dog Aging Project Consortium </p>

Comorbidity and its association with age are of great interest in geroscience. However, there are few model organisms that are well-suited to study comorbidities that will have high relevance to humans. In this light, we turn our attention to the companion dog. The companion dog shares many morbidities with humans. Thus, a better understanding of canine comorbidity relationships could benefit both humans and dogs. We present an analysis of canine comorbidity networks from the Dog Aging Project, a large epidemiological cohort study of companion dogs in the United States. We included owner-reported health conditions that occurred in at least 60 dogs (n = 160) and included only dogs that had at least one of those health conditions (n = 26,614). We constructed an undirected comorbidity network using a Poisson binomial test, adjusting for age, sex, sterilization status, breed background (i.e., purebred vs. mixed-breed), and weight. The comorbidity network reveals well-documented comorbidities, such as diabetes with cataracts and blindness, and hypertension with chronic kidney disease (CKD). In addition, this network also supports less well-studied comorbidity relationships, such as proteinuria with anemia. A directed comorbidity network accounting for time of reported condition onset suggests that diabetes precedes cataracts, elbow/hip dysplasia before osteoarthritis, and keratoconjunctivitis sicca before corneal ulcer, which are consistent with the canine literature. Analysis of age-stratified networks reveals that global centrality measures increase with age and are the highest in the Senior group compared to the Young Adult and Mature Adult groups. Only the Senior group identified the association between hypertension and CKD. Our results suggest that comorbidity network analysis is a promising method to enhance clinical knowledge and canine healthcare management.

                <p>by Marco Ghibaudi, Chiara La Rosa, Nikita Telitsyn, Jean-Marie Graїc, Chris G. Faulkes, Chet C. Sherwood, Luca Bonfanti</p>

Structural changes involving new neurons can occur through stem cell-driven neurogenesis, and through incorporation of late-maturing “immature” neurons into networks, namely undifferentiated neuronal precursors frozen in a state of arrested maturation. The latter have been found in the cerebral cortex and are particularly abundant in large-brained mammals, covarying with the size of the brain and cortex. Similar cells have been described in the amygdala of some species, although their features and interspecies variation remain poorly understood. Here, their occurrence, number, morphology, molecular expression, age-related changes, and anatomical distribution in amygdala subdivisions were systematically analyzed in eight diverse mammalian species (including mouse, naked mole rat, rabbit, marmoset, cat, sheep, horse, and chimpanzee) widely differing in neuroanatomy, brain size, life span, and socioecology. We identify converging evidence that these amygdala cells are immature neurons and show marked phylogenetic variation, with a significantly greater prevalence in primates. The immature cells are largely located within the amygdala’s basolateral complex, a region that has expanded in primate brain evolution in conjunction with cortical projections. In addition, amygdala immature neurons also appear to stabilize in number through adulthood and old age, unlike other forms of plasticity that undergo marked age-related reduction. These results support the emerging view that large brains performing complex socio-cognitive functions rely on wide reservoirs of immature neurons.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3003280">Plants respond to herbivory through sequential induction of cheaper defenses before more costly ones</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jinlong Wan, Jiahui Yi, Xiao Sun, Evan Siemann, Matthias Erb, Wei Huang</p>

Plants encounter natural antagonist threats of varying intensity and respond by activating multiple defense traits. Due to the fitness costs associated with producing defense traits, plants are expected to activate less costly traits first, reserving more costly defenses for potentially more severe damage (“cheaper first hypothesis”), but evidence to date is scarce. Here, we tested this hypothesis by measuring six putative defense traits in the annual plant <i>Ambrosia artemisiifolia</i>. We found that all traits were effective against insect herbivores, but production of three of them more strongly reduced plant growth, suggesting higher growth costs. When plants were attacked by insect herbivores, less costly traits were induced first, even at the lowest levels of damage, while more costly traits were activated only after higher damage thresholds. This cost-dependent sequential pattern was consistently observed in plants when challenged by 12 different herbivore species from three insect orders. These findings demonstrate that plants can employ the “cheaper first” sequential induction defense strategy, potentially allowing them to reduce defense costs and maximize fitness. Our study provides new insights into how plants fine-tune their defense responses under variable antagonistic pressures.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3003268">Transfer of motor learning is associated with patterns of activity in the default mode network</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Ali Rezaei, Corson N. Areshenkoff, Daniel J. Gale, Anouk J. De Brouwer, Joseph Y. Nashed, J. Randall Flanagan, Jason P. Gallivan</p>

An often-desired feature of motor learning is that it generalizes to untrained scenarios. Yet, how this is supported by brain activity remains poorly understood. Here we show, using human functional MRI and a sensorimotor adaptation task involving the transfer of learning from the trained to untrained hand, that the transfer phase of adaptation re-instantiates a highly similar large-scale pattern of brain activity to that observed during initial adaptation. Notably, we find that these neural changes, rather than occurring at the level of sensorimotor regions, predominantly occur across distributed areas of higher-order transmodal cortex, specifically in regions of the default mode network (DMN). Moreover, we show that these learning-related neural changes relate to the structural properties of transmodal cortex (its myelin content and neurotransmitter receptor density), and that intersubject differences in DMN activity relate to both adaptation- and transfer-phase task performance. Together, these findings suggest that the transfer of learning across the hands is supported by the re-expression of the same activity patterns in the DMN as those that support initial learning. Collectively, these results offer a unique characterization of the whole-brain macroscale changes associated with sensorimotor learning and generalization, and establish a key role for higher-order brain areas, such as the DMN, in the transfer of learning to untrained scenarios.

                <p>by Burcu Tepekule, Ai Ing Lim, Charlotte Jessica E. Metcalf</p>

To achieve immune and microbial homeostasis during adulthood, the developing immune system must learn to identify which microbes to tolerate and which to defend against. How such ‘immune education’ unfolds remains a major knowledge gap. We address this gap by synthesizing existing literature to develop a mechanistic mathematical model representing the interplay between gut ecology and adaptive immunity in humans during early life. Our results indicate that the inflammatory tone of the microenvironment is the mediator of information flow from pre- to post-weaning periods. We evaluate the power of postnatal fecal samples for predicting immunological trajectories and explore breastfeeding scenarios when maternal immunological conditions affect breastmilk composition. Our work establishes a quantitative basis for ‘immune education’, yielding insights into questions of applied relevance.

                <p>by Romain Strock, Valerie W.C. Soo, Pauline Misson, Georgia Roumelioti, Pavel V. Shliaha, Antoine Hocher, Tobias Warnecke</p>

The social life of archaea is poorly understood. In particular, even though competition and conflict are common themes in microbial communities, there is scant evidence documenting antagonistic interactions between archaea and their abundant prokaryotic brethren: bacteria. Do archaea specifically target bacteria for destruction? If so, what molecular weaponry do they use? Here, we present an approach to infer antagonistic interactions between archaea and bacteria from genome sequence. We show that a large and diverse set of archaea encode peptidoglycan hydrolases, enzymes that recognize and cleave a structure—peptidoglycan—that is a ubiquitous component of bacterial cell walls but absent from archaea. We predict the bacterial targets of archaeal peptidoglycan hydrolases using a structural homology approach and demonstrate that the predicted target bacteria tend to inhabit a similar niche to the archaeal producer, indicative of ecologically relevant interactions. Using a heterologous expression system, we demonstrate that two peptidoglycan hydrolases from the halophilic archaeaon <i>Halogranum salarium</i> B-1 kill the halophilic bacterium <i>Halalkalibacterium halodurans,</i> a predicted target, and do so in a manner consistent with peptidoglycan hydrolase activity. Our results suggest that, even though the tools and rules of engagement remain largely unknown, archaeal-bacterial conflicts are likely common, and we present a roadmap for the discovery of additional antagonistic interactions between these two domains of life. Our work has implications for understanding mixed microbial communities that include archaea and suggests that archaea might represent a large untapped reservoir of novel antibacterials.

                <p>by Ayaka Watanabe, Shoshiro Hirayama, Itsuki Kominato, Sybille Marchese, Pietro Esposito, Vanya Metodieva, Taeko Kimura, Hiroshi Kameda, Terunori Sano, Masaki Takao, Sho Takatori, Masato Koike, Juan Alberto Varela, Taisuke Tomita, Shigeo Murata</p>

Protein aggregation is a hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases and is also observed in the brains of elderly individuals without such conditions, suggesting that aging drives the accumulation of protein aggregates. However, the comprehensive understanding of age-dependent protein aggregates involved in brain aging remains unclear. Here, we investigated proteins that become sarkosyl-insoluble with age and identified hyaluronan and proteoglycan link protein 2 (HAPLN2), a hyaluronic acid-binding protein of the extracellular matrix at the nodes of Ranvier, as an age-dependent aggregating protein in mouse brains. Elevated hyaluronic acid levels and impaired microglial function reduced the clearance of HAPLN2, leading to its accumulation. HAPLN2 oligomers induced microglial inflammatory responses both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. Furthermore, age-associated HAPLN2 aggregation was also observed in the human cerebellum. These findings suggest that HAPLN2 aggregation results from age-related decline in brain homeostasis and may exacerbate the brain environment by activating microglia. This study provides new insights into the mechanisms underlying cerebellar aging and highlights the role of HAPLN2 in age-associated changes in the brain.
