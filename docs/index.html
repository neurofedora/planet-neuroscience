	<p>BACKGROUND: Over the past few years, there has been an increasing interest in viewing the diagnosis of familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) through the lens of the biopsychosocial model. However, other than a few epidemiological surveys, there is a dearth of studies from emerging economies that have examined FH using the biological, psychological, and socio-environmental facets of the aforementioned model. AIM. The three aims of the current study were as follows: (i) to examine the psychosocial status among patients with genetically confirmed FH, (ii) to compare their intellectual capacity and cognitive outcomes with a reference group, and (iii) to examine the relationship between health literacy and cognitive functioning. METHOD: Consecutive FH patients referred to the lipid clinic at a tertiary care center for an expert opinion were recruited into this study conducted from September 2019 to March 2020. Information regarding psychosocial functioning, health literacy, quality of life, and affective ranges was surveyed. Indices of current reasoning ability and cognition (attention and concentration, memory, and executive functioning) were compared with a socio-demographically-matched reference group. The current hypothesis also explored the impact of FH on health literacy and cognition. RESULT: A total of 70 participants out of 106 (response rate: 66.0%) initially agreed to participate. However, 18 out of 70 dropped out of the study, yielding a final total of 52 FH patients. With 27 (51.9%) males and 25 (48.1%) females, the mean participant age stood at 37.2 years (SD = 9.2), ranging from 21 to 52 years of age. In the psychosocial data, thirty-two percent (n = 17) of them had anxiety (HADS &amp;amp;ge; 8), and twenty-five percent (n = 13) had depressive symptoms (HADS &amp;amp;ge; 8). The performance of the FH patients was significantly impaired compared to the control group on the indices of current reasoning ability and all domains of cognitive functioning. In the univariate analysis conducted to compare cognitive functioning with health literacy status, only indices of attention and concentration emerged as being significant. CONCLUSION: The current study indicates that the FH population is marked with impediments in biopsychosocial functioning, including indices tapping into the integrity of health literacy, quality of life, affective ranges, and higher functioning such as cognition and current reasoning ability when compared with a socio-demographically-matched reference group. The present results support the hypothesis that chronic diseases vis-&amp;amp;agrave;-vis the sequelae of coronary artery disease can potentially impede biopsychosocial functioning.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Neurofilament Transport Is Bidirectional In Vivo</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Neurofilaments are abundant space-filling cytoskeletal polymers that are transported into and along axons. During postnatal development, these polymers accumulate in myelinated axons causing an expansion of axon caliber, which is necessary for rapid electrical transmission. Studies on cultured nerve cells have shown that axonal neurofilaments move rapidly and intermittently along microtubule tracks in both anterograde and retrograde directions. However, it is unclear whether neurofilament transport is also bidirectional <I>in vivo</I>. Here, we describe a pulse-spread fluorescence photoactivation method to address this in peripheral nerves dissected from <I>hThy1-paGFP-NFM</I> transgenic mice, which express a photoactivatable fluorescent neurofilament protein. Neurofilaments were photoactivated in short segments of myelinated axons in tibial nerves at 2, 4, 8, and 16 weeks of age. The proximal and distal spread of the fluorescence due to the movement of the fluorescent neurofilaments was measured over time. We show that the directional bias and velocity of neurofilament transport can be calculated from these measurements. The directional bias was ~60% anterograde and 40% retrograde and did not change significantly with age or distance along the nerve. The net velocity decreased with age and distance along the nerve, which is consistent with previous studies using radioisotopic pulse labeling. This decrease in velocity was caused by a decrease in both anterograde and retrograde movement. Thus, neurofilament transport is bidirectional <I>in vivo</I>, with a significant fraction of the filaments moving retrogradely in both juvenile and adult mice.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Multiple Calcium Channel Types with Unique Expression Patterns Mediate Retinal Signaling at Bipolar Cell Ribbon Synapses</a></h4>

              
                <p>Retinal bipolar cells (BCs) compose the canonical vertical excitatory pathway that conveys photoreceptor output to inner retinal neurons. Although synaptic transmission from BC terminals is thought to rely almost exclusively on Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> (Ca<SUB>V</SUB>) channels mediating L-type currents, the molecular identity of Ca<SUB>V</SUB> channels in BCs is uncertain. Therefore, we combined molecular and functional analyses to determine the expression profiles of Ca<SUB>V</SUB> &alpha;<SUB>1</SUB>, &beta;, and &alpha;<SUB>2</SUB> subunits in mouse rod bipolar (RB) cells, BCs from which the dynamics of synaptic transmission are relatively well-characterized. We found significant heterogeneity in Ca<SUB>V</SUB> subunit expression within the RB population from mice of either sex, and significantly, we discovered that transmission from RB synapses was mediated by Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through P/Q-type (Ca<SUB>V</SUB>2.1) and N-type (Ca<SUB>V</SUB>2.2) conductances as well as the previously-described L-type (Ca<SUB>V</SUB>1) and T-type (Ca<SUB>V</SUB>3) conductances. Furthermore, we found both Ca<SUB>V</SUB>1.3 and Ca<SUB>V</SUB>1.4 proteins located near presynaptic ribbon-type active zones in RB axon terminals, indicating that the L-type conductance is mediated by multiple Ca<SUB>V</SUB>1 subtypes. Similarly, Ca<SUB>V</SUB>3 &alpha;<SUB>1</SUB>, &beta;, and &alpha;<SUB>2</SUB> subunits also appear to obey a "multisubtype" rule, i.e., we observed a combination of multiple subtypes, rather than a single subtype as previously thought, for each Ca<SUB>V</SUB> subunit in individual cells.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">JUN Regulation of Injury-Induced Enhancers in Schwann Cells</a></h4>

              
                <p>Schwann cells play a critical role after peripheral nerve injury by clearing myelin debris, forming axon-guiding bands of Bu&#x0308;ngner, and remyelinating regenerating axons. Schwann cells undergo epigenomic remodeling to differentiate into a repair state that expresses unique genes, some of which are not expressed at other stages of Schwann cell development. We previously identified a set of enhancers that are activated in Schwann cells after nerve injury, and we determined whether these enhancers are preprogrammed into the Schwann cell epigenome as poised enhancers before injury. Poised enhancers share many attributes of active enhancers, such as open chromatin, but are marked by repressive histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27) trimethylation rather than H3K27 acetylation. We find that most injury-induced enhancers are not marked as poised enhancers before injury indicating that injury-induced enhancers are not preprogrammed in the Schwann cell epigenome. Injury-induced enhancers are enriched with AP-1 binding motifs, and the c-JUN subunit of AP-1 had been shown to be critical to drive the transcriptional response of Schwann cells after injury. Using <I>in vivo</I> chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing analysis in rat, we find that c-JUN binds to a subset of injury-induced enhancers. To test the role of specific injury-induced enhancers, we focused on c-JUN-binding enhancers upstream of the <I>Sonic hedgehog</I> (<I>Shh</I>) gene, which is only upregulated in repair Schwann cells compared with other stages of Schwann cell development. We used targeted deletions in male/female mice to show that the enhancers are required for robust induction of the <I>Shh</I> gene after injury.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The proregenerative actions of Schwann cells after nerve injury depends on profound reprogramming of the epigenome. The repair state is directed by injury-induced transcription factors, like JUN, which is uniquely required after nerve injury. In this study, we test whether the injury program is preprogrammed into the epigenome as poised enhancers and define which enhancers bind JUN. Finally, we test the roles of these enhancers by performing clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)&ndash;mediated deletion of JUN-bound injury enhancers in the <I>Sonic hedgehog</I> gene. Although many long-range enhancers drive expression of <I>Sonic hedgehog</I> at different developmental stages of specific tissues, these studies identify an entirely new set of enhancers that are required for <I>Sonic hedgehog</I> induction in Schwann cells after injury.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">An ErbB4-Positive Neuronal Network in the Olfactory Bulb for Olfaction</a></h4>

              
                <p>Olfactory information is relayed and processed in the olfactory bulb (OB). Mitral cells, the principal output excitatory neurons of the OB, are controlled by multiple types of interneurons. However, mechanisms that regulate the activity of OB interneurons are not well understood. We provide evidence that the transmembrane tyrosine kinase ErbB4 is selectively expressed in subsets of OB inhibitory neurons in both male and female mice. ErbB4-positive (ErbB4<sup>+</sup>) neurons are mainly located in the glomerular layer (GL) and granule cell layer (GCL) and do not express previously defined markers. Optogenetic activation of GL-ErbB4<sup>+</sup> neurons promotes theta oscillation, whereas activation of those in the GCL generates  oscillations. Stimulation of OB slices with NRG1, a ligand that activates ErbB4, increases GABA transmission onto mitral cells, suggesting a role of OB NRG1-ErbB4 signaling in olfaction. In accord, ErbB4 mutant mice or acute inhibition of ErbB4 by a chemical genetic approach diminishes GABA transmission, reduces bulbar local field potential power, increases the threshold of olfactory sensitivity, and impairs odor discrimination. Together, these results identified a bulbar inhibitory network of ErbB4<sup>+</sup> neurons for olfaction. Considering that both <I>Nrg1</I> and <I>Erbb4</I> are susceptibility genes for neuropsychiatric disorders, our study provides insight into pathologic mechanisms of olfactory malfunctions in these disorders.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> This study demonstrates that ErbB4<sup>+</sup> neurons are a new subset of olfactory bulb inhibitory neurons in the glomerular layer and granule cell layer that innervate mitral cells and ErbB4<sup>&ndash;</sup> cells. They regulate olfaction by controlling local synchrony and distinct oscillations. ErbB4 inhibition diminishes GABA transmission, reduces bulbar local field potential power, increases the threshold of olfactory sensitivity, and impairs odor discrimination. Our results provide insight into pathophysiological mechanism of olfaction deficits in brain disorders associated with <I>Nrg1</I> or <I>Erbb4</I> mutations.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Synaptic Mechanisms Underlying Temporally Precise Information Processing in the VNLL, an Auditory Brainstem Nucleus</a></h4>

              
                <p>Large glutamatergic, somatic synapses mediate temporally precise information transfer. In the ventral nucleus of the lateral lemniscus, an auditory brainstem nucleus, the signal of an excitatory large somatic synapse is sign inverted to generate rapid feedforward inhibition with high temporal acuity at sound onsets, a mechanism involved in the suppression of spurious frequency information. The mechanisms of the synaptically driven input&ndash;output functions in the ventral nucleus of the lateral lemniscus are not fully resolved. Here, we show in Mongolian gerbils of both sexes that, for stimulation frequencies up to 200 Hz, the EPSC kinetics together with short-term plasticity allow for faithful transmission with only a small increase in latency. Glutamatergic currents are exclusively mediated by AMPARs and NMDARs. Short-term plasticity is frequency-dependent and composed of an initial facilitation followed by depression. Physiologically relevant output generation is limited by the decrease in synaptic conductance through short-term plasticity (STP). At this endbulb synapse, STP acts as a low pass filter and increases the dynamic range of the conductance dependent input&ndash;output relation, while NMDAR signaling slightly increases the sensitivity of the input&ndash;output function. Our computational model shows that STP-mediated filtering limits the intensity dependence of the spike output, thus maintaining selectivity to sound transients. Our results highlight the interaction of cellular features that together give rise to the computations in the circuit.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Auditory information processing in the brainstem is a prerequisite for generating our auditory representation of the environment. Thereby, many processing steps rely on temporally precise filtering. Precise feedforward inhibition is a key motif in auditory brainstem processing and produced through sign inversion at several large somatic excitatory synapses. A particular feature of the ventral nucleus of the lateral lemniscus is to produce temporally precise onset inhibition with little temporal variance independent of sound intensity. Our cell-physiology and modeling data explain how the synaptic characteristics of different current components and their short-term plasticity are tuned to establish sound intensity-invariant onset inhibition that is crucial for filtering out spurious frequency information.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">State-Dependent Modulation of Activity in Distinct Layer 6 Corticothalamic Neurons in Barrel Cortex of Awake Mice</a></h4>

              
                <p>Layer 6 corticothalamic (L6 CT) neurons are in a strategic position to control sensory input to the neocortex, yet we understand very little about their functions. Apart from studying their anatomic, physiological, and synaptic properties, most recent efforts have focused on the activity-dependent influences CT cells can exert on thalamic and cortical neurons through causal optogenetic manipulations. However, few studies have attempted to study them during behavior. To address this gap, we performed juxtacellular recordings from optogenetically identified CT neurons in whisker-related primary somatosensory cortex (wS1) of awake, head-fixed mice (either sex) free to rest quietly or self-initiate bouts of whisking and locomotion. We found a rich diversity of response profiles exhibited by CT cells. Their spiking patterns were either modulated by whisking-related behavior (~28%) or not (~72%). Whisking-responsive neurons exhibited both increases (activated-type) and decreases in firing rates (suppressed-type) that aligned with whisking onset better than locomotion. We also encountered responsive neurons with preceding modulations in firing rate before whisking onset. Overall, whisking better explained these changes in rates than overall changes in arousal. Whisking-unresponsive CT cells were generally quiet, with many having low spontaneous firing rates (sparse-type) and others being completely silent (silent-type). Remarkably, the sparse firing CT population preferentially spiked at the state transition point when pupil diameter constricted, and the mouse entered quiet wakefulness. Thus, our results demonstrate that L6 CT cells in wS1 show diverse spiking patterns, perhaps subserving distinct functional roles related to precisely timed responses during complex behaviors and transitions between discrete waking states.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Layer 6 corticothalamic neurons provide a massive input to the sensory thalamus and local connectivity within cortex, but their role in thalamocortical processing remains unclear because of difficulty accessing and isolating their activity. Although several recent optogenetic studies reveal that the net influence of corticothalamic actions, suppression versus enhancement, depends critically on the rate these neurons fire, the factors that influence their spiking are poorly understood, particularly during wakefulness. Using the well-established <I>Ntsr1-Cre</I> line to target this elusive population in the whisker somatosensory cortex of awake mice, we found that corticothalamic neurons show diverse state-related responses and modulations in firing rate. These results suggest separate corticothalamic populations can differentially influence thalamocortical excitability during rapid state transitions in awake, behaving animals.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Left-Right Locomotor Coordination in Human Neonates</a></h4>

              
                <p>Terrestrial locomotion requires coordinated bilateral activation of limb muscles, with left&ndash;right alternation in walking or running, and synchronous activation in hopping or skipping. The neural mechanisms involved in interlimb coordination at birth are well known in different mammalian species, but less so in humans. Here, 46 neonates (of either sex) performed bilateral and unilateral stepping with one leg blocked in different positions. By recording EMG activities of lower-limb muscles, we observed episodes of left&ndash;right alternating or synchronous coordination. In most cases, the frequency of EMG oscillations during sequences of consecutive steps was approximately similar between the two sides, but in some cases it was considerably different, with episodes of 2:1 interlimb coordination and episodes of activity deletions on the blocked side. Hip position of the blocked limb significantly affected ipsilateral, but not contralateral, muscle activities. Thus, hip extension backward engaged hip flexor muscle, and hip flexion engaged hip extensors. Moreover, the sudden release of the blocked limb in the posterior position elicited the immediate initiation of the swing phase of the limb, with hip flexion and a burst of an ankle flexor muscle. Extensor muscles showed load responses at midstance. The variable interlimb coordination and its incomplete sensory modulation suggest that the neonatal locomotor networks do not operate in the same manner as in mature locomotion, also because of the limited cortical control at birth. These neonatal mechanisms share many properties with spinal mammalian preparations (i.e., independent pattern generators for each limb, and for flexor and extensor muscles, load, and hip position feedback).</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Bilateral coupling and reciprocal activation of flexor and extensor burst generators represent the fundamental mechanisms used by mammalian limbed locomotion. Considerable progress has been made in deciphering the early development of the spinal networks and left&ndash;right coordination in different mammals, but less is known about human newborns. We compared bilateral and unilateral stepping in human neonates, where cortical control is still underdeveloped. We found neonatal mechanisms that share many properties with spinal mammalian preparations (i.e., independent pattern generators for each limb, the independent generators for flexor and extensor muscles, load, and hip-position feedback. The variable interlimb coordination and its incomplete sensory modulation suggest that the human neonatal locomotor networks do not operate in the same manner as in mature locomotion.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Contingent Amygdala Inputs Trigger Heterosynaptic LTP at Hippocampus-To-Accumbens Synapses</a></h4>

              
                <p>The nucleus accumbens shell (NAcSh) is a key brain region where environmental cues acquire incentive salience to reinforce motivated behaviors. Principal medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the NAcSh receive extensive glutamatergic projections from limbic regions, among which, the ventral hippocampus (vH) transmits information enriched in contextual cues, and the basolateral amygdala (BLA) encodes real-time arousing states. The vH and BLA project convergently to NAcSh MSNs, both activated in a time-locked manner on a cue-conditioned motivational action. In brain slices prepared from male and female mice, we show that co-activation of the two projections induces long-term potentiation (LTP) at vH-to-NAcSh synapses without affecting BLA-to-NAcSh synapses, revealing a heterosynaptic mechanism through which BLA signals persistently increase the temporally contingent vH-to-NAcSh transmission. Furthermore, this LTP is more prominent in dopamine D1 receptor-expressing (D1) MSNs than D2 MSNs and can be prevented by inhibition of either D1 receptors or dopaminergic terminals in NAcSh. This heterosynaptic LTP may provide a dopamine-guided mechanism through which vH-encoded cue inputs that are contingent to BLA activation acquire increased circuit representation to reinforce behavior.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> In motivated behaviors, environmental cues associated with arousing stimuli acquire increased incentive salience, processes mediated in part by the nucleus accumbens (NAc). NAc principal neurons receive glutamatergic projections from the ventral hippocampus (vH) and basolateral amygdala (BLA), which transmit information encoding contextual cues and affective states, respectively. Our results show that co-activation of the two projections induces long-term potentiation (LTP) at vH-to-NAc synapses without affecting BLA-to-NAc synapses, revealing a heterosynaptic mechanism through which BLA signals potentiate the temporally contingent vH-to-NAc transmission. Furthermore, this LTP is prevented by inhibition of either D1 receptors or dopaminergic axons.

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Hippocampal Threat Reactivity Interacts with Physiological Arousal to Predict PTSD Symptoms</a></h4>

              
                <p>Hippo campal impairments are reliably associated with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD); however, little research has characterized how increased threat sensitivity may interact with arousal responses to alter hippocampal reactivity, and further how these interactions relate to the sequelae of trauma-related symptoms. In a sample of individuals recently exposed to trauma (<I>N</I> = 116, 76 female), we found that PTSD symptoms at 2 weeks were associated with decreased hippocampal responses to threat as assessed with fMRI. Further, the relationship between hippocampal threat sensitivity and PTSD symptomology only emerged in individuals who showed transient, high threat-related arousal, as assayed by an independently collected measure of fear potentiated startle. Collectively, our finding suggests that development of PTSD is associated with threat-related decreases in hippocampal function because of increases in fear-potentiated arousal.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Alterations in hippocampal function linked to threat-related arousal are reliably associated with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD); however, how these alterations relate to the sequelae of trauma-related symptoms is unknown. Prior models based on nontrauma samples suggest that arousal may impact hippocampal neurophysiology leading to maladaptive behavior. Here we show that decreased hippocampal threat sensitivity interacts with fear-potentiated startle to predict PTSD symptoms. Specifically, individuals with high fear-potentiated startle and low, transient hippocampal threat sensitivity showed the greatest PTSD symptomology. These findings bridge literatures of threat-related arousal and hippocampal function to better understand PTSD risk.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">The Neurotrophic Receptor Tyrosine Kinase in MEC-mPFC Neurons Contributes to Remote Memory Consolidation</a></h4>

              
                <p>The PFC is thought to be the region where remote memory is recalled. However, the neurotrophic receptors that underlie the remote memory remain largely unknown. Here, we benefited from auto-assembly split Cre to accomplish the neural projection-specific recombinase activity without spontaneous leakage. Deletion of tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) in neurons projecting from the medial entorhinal cortex to the mPFC displayed reduced remote memory recall from the male mice, but the recent recall was intact. We found that the TrkB deletion attenuates the participation of mPFC cells in the remote fear memory recall. The disruption of remote recall was attributed to reduced reactivation of cells in the mPFC. Notably, TrkB deletion seriously inhibited experience-dependent maturation of oligodendroglia in the PFC, resulting in defects in remote recall that were rescued by clemastine administration. Together, our data suggest that TrkB in intercortical circuits functions in remote memory consolidation.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Retrieving the past experiences or events is essential for the ones to lead life. The investigations performed in the rodent model have disclosed that the systems consolidation of memory accompanying changes of cortical circuits and transcriptome is required for maintaining the memory for a long time. In this study, the split Cre with TrkB<sup>flox/flox</sup> mice were subjected to discover that TrkB in the neurons plays a role in remote memory consolidation. We evaluated the contextual fear memory and labeled cells, which revealed deletion of TrkB interrupts newborn oligodendrocyte and reactivation of cells in mPFC at remote recall. Our data provide the implication that remote memory is relevant to neurotrophic receptor signaling as well as its influence on non-neuronal cells.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Dopamine Modulates Adaptive Forgetting in Medial Prefrontal Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>Active forgetting occurs in many species, but how behavioral control mechanisms influence which memories are forgotten remains unknown. We previously found that when rats need to retrieve a memory to guide exploration, it reduces later retention of other competing memories encoded in that environment. As with humans, this retrieval-induced forgetting relies on prefrontal control processes. Dopaminergic input to the prefrontal cortex is important for executive functions and cognitive flexibility. We found that, in a similar way, retrieval-induced forgetting of competing memories in male rats requires prefrontal dopamine signaling through D<SUB>1</SUB> receptors. Blockade of medial prefrontal cortex D<SUB>1</SUB> receptors as animals encountered a familiar object impaired active forgetting of competing object memories as measured on a later long-term memory test. Inactivation of the ventral tegmental area produced the same pattern of behavior, a pattern that could be reversed by concomitant activation of prefrontal D<SUB>1</SUB> receptors. We observed a bidirectional modulation of retrieval-induced forgetting by agonists and antagonists of D<SUB>1</SUB> receptors in the medial prefrontal cortex. These findings establish the essential role of prefrontal dopamine in the active forgetting of competing memories, contributing to the shaping of retention in response to the behavioral goals of an organism.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Forgetting is a ubiquitous phenomenon that is actively promoted in many species. The very act of remembering some experiences can cause forgetting of others, in both humans and rats. This retrieval-induced forgetting process is thought to be driven by inhibitory control signals from the prefrontal cortex that target areas where the memories are stored. Here we started disentangling the neurochemical signals in the prefrontal cortex that are essential to retrieval-induced forgetting. We found that, in rats, the release of dopamine in this area, acting through D<SUB>1</SUB> receptors, was essential to causing active forgetting of competing memories. Inhibition of D<SUB>1</SUB> receptors impaired forgetting, while activation increased forgetting. These findings are important, because the mechanisms of active forgetting and their linkage to goal-directed behavior are only beginning to be understood.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Deletion of the P/Q-Type Calcium Channel from Serotonergic Neurons Drives Male Aggression in Mice</a></h4>

              
                <p>Aggressive behavior is one of the most conserved social interactions in nature and serves as a crucial evolutionary trait. Serotonin (5-HT) plays a key role in the regulation of our emotions, such as anxiety and aggression, but which molecules and mechanisms in the serotonergic system are involved in violent behavior are still unknown. In this study, we show that deletion of the P/Q-type calcium channel selectively from serotonergic neurons in the dorsal raphe nuclei (DRN) augments aggressive behavior in male mice, while anxiety is not affected. These mice demonstrated increased induction of the immediate early gene <I>c-fos</I> and <I>in vivo</I> serotonergic firing activity in the DRN. The ventrolateral part of the ventromedial hypothalamus is also a prominent region of the brain mediating aggression. We confirmed a monosynaptic projection from the DRN to the ventrolateral part of the ventromedial hypothalamus, and silencing these projections with an inhibitory designer receptor exclusively activated by a designer drug effectively reduced aggressive behavior. Overall, our findings show that deletion of the P/Q-type calcium channel from DRN neurons is sufficient to induce male aggression in mice and regulating its activity may serve as a therapeutic approach to treat violent behavior.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> In this study, we show that P/Q-type calcium channel is mediating aggression in serotonergic neurons from the dorsal raphe nucleus via monosynaptic projections to the ventrolateral part of the ventromedial hypothalamus. More importantly, silencing these projections reduced aggressive behavior in mice and may serve as a therapeutic approach for treating aggression in humans.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Enhanced Feedback Inhibition Due to Increased Recruitment of Somatostatin-Expressing Interneurons and Enhanced Cortical Recurrent Excitation in a Genetic Mouse Model of Migraine</a></h4>

              
                <p>Migraine is a complex brain disorder, characterized by attacks of unilateral headache and global dysfunction in multisensory information processing, whose underlying cellular and circuit mechanisms remain unknown. The finding of enhanced excitatory, but unaltered inhibitory, neurotransmission at cortical synapses between pyramidal cells (PCs) and fast-spiking interneurons (FS INs) in mouse models of familial hemiplegic migraine (FHM) suggested the hypothesis that dysregulation of the excitatory-inhibitory (E/I) balance in specific circuits is a key pathogenic mechanism. Here, we investigated the cortical layer 2/3 (L2/3) feedback inhibition microcircuit involving somatostatin-expressing (SOM) INs in FHM1 mice of both sexes carrying a gain-of-function mutation in Ca<SUB>V</SUB>2.1. Unitary inhibitory neurotransmission at SOM IN-PC synapses was unaltered while excitatory neurotransmission at both PC-SOM IN and PC-PC synapses was enhanced, because of increased probability of glutamate release, in FHM1 mice. Short-term synaptic depression was enhanced at PC-PC synapses while short-term synaptic facilitation was unaltered at PC-SOM IN synapses during 25-Hz repetitive activity. The frequency-dependent disynaptic inhibition (FDDI) mediated by SOM INs was enhanced, lasted longer and required shorter high-frequency bursts to be initiated in FHM1 mice. These findings, together with previous evidence of enhanced disynaptic feedforward inhibition by FS INs, suggest that the increased inhibition may effectively counteract the increased recurrent excitation in FHM1 mice and may even prevail in certain conditions. Considering the involvement of SOM INs in  oscillations, surround suppression and context-dependent sensory perception, the facilitated recruitment of SOM INs, together with the enhanced recurrent excitation, may contribute to dysfunctional sensory processing in FHM1 and possibly migraine.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Migraine is a complex brain disorder, characterized by attacks of unilateral headache and global dysfunction in multisensory information processing, whose underlying cellular and circuit mechanisms remain unknown, although dysregulation of the excitatory-inhibitory (E/I) balance in specific circuits could be a key pathogenic mechanism. Here, we provide insights into these mechanisms by investigating the cortical feedback inhibition microcircuit involving somatostatin-expressing interneurons (SOM INs) in a mouse model of a rare monogenic migraine. Despite unaltered inhibitory synaptic transmission, the disynaptic feedback inhibition mediated by SOM INs was enhanced in the migraine model because of enhanced recruitment of the INs. Recurrent cortical excitation was also enhanced. These alterations may contribute to context-dependent sensory processing dysfunctions in migraine.</p>

                Background: The study aimed to examine the effect of administering CHAGURO (a product of the combination of siamese pumpkin and tuna-based powder) on the lipid profile in prediabetes individuals with dyslipidemia. Methods: The experimental trial was conducted with two intervention groups, with each group receiving a dose of 7.5g/70kg body weight (BW)/day (low dose) and 15g/70kg BW/day (high dose) for 60 days. Respondents in each group ranged in age from 30 to 60 years old. Prediabetes was defined as fasting blood sugar levels of 100-125 mg/dL, while cholesterol levels of 200 mg/dL was considered dyslipidemia. The mean baseline HbA1c level for all subjects was 5.5%. Respondents were randomized into intervention groups using simple randomization. Pre-test and post-test measurements were performed for body mass index (BMI), physical activity (using IPAQ-SF), hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), lipid profile, blood pressure, and food intake (using SQ-FFQ). Statistical analyses performed included descriptive tests, independent and paired T-tests, and analysis of variance (ANOVA). Results: Compared to the baseline, HbA1c, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglycerides in the two groups did not improve significantly by 60 days. For lipid variables, a significant improvement in the cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein (chol/HDL) ratios were observed when compared against the baseline for the two groups. When comparing the changes between groups, 7.5 g of CHAGURO showed a larger improvement in HDL-C (mean differences: 1.86 mg/dL; 95% CI: -0.86-4.59), compared to 15 g of CHAGURO (mean differences: -3.62 mg/dL; 95% CI: -7.53-0.28). A significant (p<0.05) decrease in the chol/HDL ratio was observed in the 7.5 g CHAGURO group (mean differences: -0.20 mg/dL; 95% CI: -0.39-(-0.01)). Conclusions: CHAGURO can be a functional food alternative to improve the condition of prediabetes people with dyslipidemia.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Computer simulations of Template-Directed RNA Synthesis driven by temperature cycling in diverse sequence mixtures</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Pouyan Chamanian, Paul G. Higgs</p>

We present simulations of non-enzymatic template-directed RNA synthesis that incorporate primer extension, ligation, melting, and reannealing. Strand growth occurs over multiple heating/cooling cycles, producing strands of several hundred nucleotides in length, starting with random oligomers of 4 to 10 nucleotides. A strand typically grows by only 1 or 2 nucleotides in each cycle. Therefore, a strand is copied from many different templates, not from one specific complementary strand. A diverse sequence mixture is produced, and there is no exact copying of sequences, even if single base additions are fully accurate (no mutational errors). It has been proposed that RNA systems may contain a virtual circular genome, in which sequences partially overlap in a way that is mutually catalytic. We show that virtual circles do not emerge naturally in our simulations, and that a system initiated with a virtual circle can only maintain itself if there are no mutational errors and there is no input of new sequences formed by random polymerization. Furthermore, if a virtual sequence and its complement contain repeated short words, new sequences can be produced that were not on the original virtual circle. Therefore the virtual circle sequence cannot maintain itself. Functional sequences with secondary structures contain complementary words on opposite sides of stem regions. Both these words are repeated in the complementary sequence; hence, functional sequences cannot be encoded on a virtual circle. Additionally, we consider sequence replication in populations of protocells. We suppose that functional ribozymes benefit the cell which contains them. Nevertheless, scrambling of sequences occurs, and the functional sequence is not maintained, even when under positive selection.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">VGsim: Scalable viral genealogy simulator for global pandemic</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Vladimir Shchur, Vadim Spirin, Dmitry Sirotkin, Evgeni Burovski, Nicola De Maio, Russell Corbett-Detig</p>

Accurate simulation of complex biological processes is an essential component of developing and validating new technologies and inference approaches. As an effort to help contain the COVID-19 pandemic, large numbers of SARS-CoV-2 genomes have been sequenced from most regions in the world. More than 5.5 million viral sequences are publicly available as of November 2021. Many studies estimate viral genealogies from these sequences, as these can provide valuable information about the spread of the pandemic across time and space. Additionally such data are a rich source of information about molecular evolutionary processes including natural selection, for example allowing the identification of new variants with transmissibility and immunity evasion advantages. To our knowledge, there is no framework that is both efficient and flexible enough to simulate the pandemic to approximate world-scale scenarios and generate viral genealogies of millions of samples. Here, we introduce a new fast simulator VGsim which addresses the problem of simulation genealogies under epidemiological models. The simulation process is split into two phases. During the forward run the algorithm generates a chain of population-level events reflecting the dynamics of the pandemic using an hierarchical version of the Gillespie algorithm. During the backward run a coalescent-like approach generates a tree genealogy of samples conditioning on the population-level events chain generated during the forward run. Our software can model complex population structure, epistasis and immunity escape.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A general hypothesis of multistable systems in pathophysiology [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Despite intensive investigations numerous diseases remain etiologically puzzling and recalcitrant to treatments. A hypothesis is proposed here assuming that these difficulties are due to an unsuitable approach to the mechanisms of life, which is subjugated by an apparent complexity and fails to grasp the uniformity that lays behind. The stability of metabolism, despite the enormous complex of chemical reactions, suggests that reciprocal control is a prerequisite of life. Negative feedback loops have been known for a long time to maintain homeostasis, while more recently, different life processes involved in transitions or changes have been modeled by positive loops giving rise to bistable switches, also including various diseases. The present hypothesis makes a generalization, by assuming that any functional element of a biological system is involved in a positive or a negative feedback loop. Consequently, the hypothesis holds that the starting mechanism of any disease that affects a healthy human can be conceptually reduced to a bistable or multistationary loop system, thus providing a unifying model leading to the discovery of critical therapeutic targets.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: Transient cortical blindness following coronary angiography [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Temporary blindness, also known as transient cortical blindness, is an uncommon impediment of contrast agent usage during angiography procedures. The occurrence of blindness after a cardiac catheterization procedure is rare and its pathophysiology remains largely speculative. The most probable mechanism seems to be contrast agent-related disruption of the blood–brain barrier, possibly initiated by several predisposing factors. This case reports a 52-year-old man with transient vision loss that occurred following coronary angiography. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed no acute pathology and his vision spontaneously returned within approximately 15 hours post-procedure without any requirement of specific therapy. Suggesting that transient cortical blindness may have occurred following coronary angiography which subsequently self-resolved.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">What can we experience and report on a rapidly presented image? Intersubjective measures of specificity of freely reported contents of consciousness [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: A majority of previous studies appear to support a view that human observers can only perceive coarse information from a natural scene image when it is presented rapidly (<100ms, masked). In these studies, participants were often forced to choose an answer from options that experimenters preselected. These options can underestimate what participants experience and can report on it. The current study aims to introduce a novel methodology to investigate how detailed information participants can report after briefly seeing a natural scene image.     Methods: We used a novel free-report paradigm to examine what people can freely report following a rapidly presented natural scene image (67/133/267ms, masked). N = 600 online participants typed up to five words to report what they saw in the image together with confidence of the respective responses. We developed a novel index, Intersubjective Agreement (IA). IA quantifies how specifically the response words were used to describe the target image, with a high value meaning the word is not often reported for other images. Importantly, IA eliminates the need for experimenters to preselect response options. Results: The words with high IA values are often something detailed (e.g., a small object) in a particular image. With IA, unlike commonly believed, we demonstrated that participants reported highly specific and detailed aspects of the briefly (even at 67ms, masked) shown image. Further, IA is positively correlated with confidence, indicating metacognitive conscious access to the reported aspects of the image. Conclusion: These new findings challenge the dominant view that the content of rapid scene experience is limited to global and coarse gist. Our novel paradigm opens a door to investigate various contents of consciousness with a free-report paradigm.

                TBK1 is a serine-threonine protein kinase that has been linked to a number of diseases including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia. Reproducible research on TBK1 has been hampered by the lack of well characterized antibodies. In this study, we characterized 11 commercial antibodies for TBK1 for use in immunoblot, immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation, using an isogeneic knock-out cell line as a control. We identify antibodies that appear specific for all three applications but invite the readers to interpret the present findings based on their own scientific expertise and use this report as a guide to select the most appropriate antibody for their specific needs.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/neuron/inpress.rss">In vivo nanoscopic landscape of neurexin ligands underlying anterograde synapse specification</a></h4>

              
                Synaptic organizers, such as neuroligin1, LRRTM1, and Cbln1, commonly target neurexin. Using X10 expansion microscopy, Nozawa et al. revealed that presynaptic neurexin isoforms regulated nanoclusters of postsynaptic neurexin ligands and glutamate receptor subtypes. Their findings provide models of how neurexin ligands coordinate or compete to organize excitatory synapses in vivo.

                The developing neocortex exhibits spontaneous network activity with various synchrony levels, which has been implicated in the formation of cortical circuits. We previously reported that the development of callosal axon projections, one of the major long-range axonal projections in the brain, is activity dependent. However, what sort of activity and when activity is indispensable are not known. Here, using a genetic method to manipulate network activity in a stage-specific manner, we demonstrated that network activity contributes to callosal axon projections in the mouse visual cortex during a ‘critical period’: restoring neuronal activity during that period resumed the projections, whereas restoration after the period failed. Furthermore, in vivo Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging revealed that the projections could be established even without fully restoring highly synchronous activity. Overall, our findings suggest that spontaneous network activity is selectively required during a critical developmental time window for the formation of long-range axonal projections in the cortex.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Single-molecule analysis of the entire perfringolysin O pore formation pathway</a></h4>

              
                The cholesterol-dependent cytolysin perfringolysin O (PFO) is secreted by <i>Clostridium perfringens</i> as a bacterial virulence factor able to form giant ring-shaped pores that perforate and ultimately lyse mammalian cell membranes. To resolve the kinetics of all steps in the assembly pathway, we have used single-molecule fluorescence imaging to follow the dynamics of PFO on dye-loaded liposomes that lead to opening of a pore and release of the encapsulated dye. Formation of a long-lived membrane-bound PFO dimer nucleates the growth of an irreversible oligomer. The growing oligomer can insert into the membrane and open a pore at stoichiometries ranging from tetramers to full rings (~35-mers), whereby the rate of insertion increases linearly with the number of subunits. Oligomers that insert before the ring is complete continue to grow by monomer addition post insertion. Overall, our observations suggest that PFO membrane insertion is kinetically controlled.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">An amphipathic helix in Brl1 is required for nuclear pore complex biogenesis in S. cerevisiae</a></h4>

              
                The nuclear pore complex (NPC) is the central portal for macromolecular exchange between the nucleus and cytoplasm. In all eukaryotes, NPCs assemble into an intact nuclear envelope (NE) during interphase, but the process of NPC biogenesis remains poorly characterized. Furthermore, little is known about how NPC assembly leads to the fusion of the outer and inner NE, and no factors have been identified that could trigger this event. Here, we characterize the transmembrane protein Brl1 as an NPC assembly factor required for NE fusion in budding yeast. Brl1 preferentially associates with NPC assembly intermediates and its depletion halts NPC biogenesis, leading to NE herniations that contain inner and outer ring nucleoporins but lack the cytoplasmic export platform. Furthermore, we identify an essential amphipathic helix in the luminal domain of Brl1 that mediates interactions with lipid bilayers. Mutations in this amphipathic helix lead to NPC assembly defects, and cryo-electron tomography analyses reveal multilayered herniations of the inner nuclear membrane with NPC-like structures at the neck, indicating a failure in NE fusion. Taken together, our results identify a role for Brl1 in NPC assembly and suggest a function of its amphipathic helix in mediating the fusion of the inner and outer nuclear membranes.

                Priority maps are winner-take-all neural mechanisms that are thought to guide the allocation of attention. Within these maps, attentional priority is coded as weights on a topographic representation of physical space. Research has shown that these weights are not just influenced by the current stimuli presented but also by selection episodes that occurred in the past - called selection history. The current study demonstrates, for the first time, that these latent, implicitly-learned spatial biases can be visualized by "pinging" the brain (a technique previously used to study activity-silent working memory). By briefly flashing high-contrast, task-irrelevant visual stimuli in the inter-stimulus interval between searches, participants current history-trained latent attentional priority could be decoded via scalp encephalography. Our findings not only offer a novel method of visualising this latent attentional priority map, but also shed light on the underlying mechanisms allowing our past experiences to influence future behaviour.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The role of the parietal lobe in task-irrelevant suppression during learning</a></h4>

              
                Background: Attention optimizes the selection of visual information, while suppressing irrelevant visual input through cortical mechanisms that are still unclear. We set to investigate these processes using an attention task with an embedded to-be-ignored interfering visual input. Objective: We delivered electrical stimulation to attention-related brain areas to modulate these facilitatory/inhibitory attentional mechanisms. We asked whether training on a task while being simultaneously exposed to visual features from a different task tested at baseline and post-training might influence performance on the baseline task. Methods: In Experiment one, subjects performed an orientation discrimination (OD) task using a pair of gratings presented at individual's psychophysical threshold. We then trained participants over multiple sessions on a temporal order judgment task (TOJ), using the exact same gratings but presented with different time offsets. On the last session we re-tested OD. We coupled training with transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS) over the parietal cortex, the human middle temporal area or sham, in three separate groups. In Experiment two, subjects performed the same OD task at baseline and post-training, while tRNS was delivered at rest during training. Results: Results showed that tRNS over parietal cortex facilitated learning of the trained task. Moreover, we found a detrimental effect on OD when subjects received parietal tRNS coupled with training, but a benefit on OD when subjects received stimulation while at rest. Conclusions: These results clearly indicate that task-irrelevant information is actively suppressed during learning, and that this prioritization mechanism of selection likely resides in the parietal cortex.

                Using a neurometric approach, we identify and validate a neural signature of reward encoded in a distributed pattern of brain activity using data collected from 21 different studies (N = 2,691). Our model can discriminate between receiving rewards from punishments in completely independent data with 99% accuracy and includes weights located in regions containing a high density of D2/D3 receptors. The model exhibits strong generalizability across a range of tasks probing reward, and a high degree of specificity for reward compared to non-reward constructs. We demonstrate several applications of how this model can infer psychological states of positive affect in the absence of self report. The model is sensitive to changes in brain activity following causal manipulations of homeostatic states, can uncover individual preferences for loss-aversion, and can be used to identify positive affective experiences when watching a television show. Our results suggest that there is a shared neural signature of reward elicited across these different task contexts.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Individual differences in information processing predict sleep-based memory consolidation of complex rules</a></h4>

              
                Memory is critical for many cognitive functions, from remembering facts, to learning complex environmental rules. While memory encoding occurs during wake, memory consolidation is associated with sleep-related neural activity. Further, research suggests that individual differences in the alpha frequency band (~ 7 - 13 Hz) modulate memory processes, with higher individual alpha frequency (IAF) associated with greater memory performance. However, the relationship between wake-related EEG individual differences, such as IAF, and sleep-related neural correlates of memory consolidation has been largely unexplored, particularly in a complex rule-based memory context. Here, we aimed to investigate whether IAF and sleep neurophysiology interact to influence rule learning in a sample of 36 healthy adults (16 male; mean age = 25.4, range: 18 - 40). Participants learned rules of a modified miniature language prior to either 8hrs of sleep or wake, after which they were tested on their knowledge of the rules in a grammaticality judgement task. Results indicated that sleep and IAF modulate memory for complex linguistic rules. Phase-amplitude coupling between slow oscillations and spindles during non-rapid eye-movement (NREM) sleep also promoted memory for rules that were analogous to the canonical English word order. As an exploratory analysis, we found that theta activity during rapid eye-movement (REM) sleep predicted rule learning. Taken together, the current study provides behavioural and electrophysiological evidence for a complex role of NREM and REM sleep neurophysiology and IAF in the consolidation of rule-based information.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Bringing language to dynamic brain states: the default network dominates neural responses to evolving movie stories</a></h4>

              
                Naturalistic neuroscience opened the door to new insights into neural circuits that serve real-world dynamic perception. Such studies have often neglected the rich texture of the movie narrative itself, but semantic content can be used to contextualize the induced neural responses. Here, we translated natural language processing tools from machine learning to characterize brain states estimated from hidden Markov models. Our analytical strategy allowed pitting shallow unimodal against the deep associative brain network layers in explaining how semantic content of the movie links to observed neural activity. Pooling information across >53,000 brain image time points watching Forrest Gump, we could show that distinct dynamic brain states capture unique semantic facets along the unfolding movie narrative. The spatiotemporal dynamics of brain states explicitly captured subject-level responses throughout the brain network hierarchy. Across all analyses, the default network was most intimately linked to semantic information integration, and this neural system switched online for longest durations during movie watching. Further, we identified and described two mechanisms of how the default network liaises dynamically with microanatomically defined subregion partners: the amygdala and the hippocampus. Our study thus unlocks the potential of natural language processing to explore neural processes in everyday life situations that engage key aspects of conscious awareness.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dynamic Control of Eye-Head Gaze Shifts by a Spiking Neural Network Model of the Superior Colliculus</a></h4>

              
                To reorient gaze (the eye in space) towards a target can be achieved by infinitely many combinations of eye- and head movements. However, behavioral measurements show that the primate gaze-control system selects specific contributions of eye- and head to the saccade, which depend on the initial eye-in-head orientation. Single-unit recordings in the primate superior colliculus (SC) during head-unrestrained gaze shifts have further suggested that cells may encode the instantaneous trajectory of a desired straight gaze path in a feedforward way by the total cumulative number of spikes in the neural population, and that the instantaneous gaze kinematics are determined by the neural firing rates. The recordings also indicated that the latter depended strongly on the initial eye position as well. We recently proposed a conceptual model that accounts for many of the observed properties of eye-head gaze shifts and on the potential role of the SC. Here, we extend and test the model by incorporating a spiking neural network of the SC motor map, the output of which drives the eye-head motor control circuitry by linear cumulative summation of individual spike effects of each recruited SC neuron. We propose a simple neural mechanism on SC cells that explains the modulatory influence of feedback from an initial eye-in-head position signal on their spiking activity. The same signal also determines the onset delay of the head movement with respect to the eye. The downstream eye- and head burst generators were taken to be linear, as our earlier work had suggested that much of the nonlinear kinematics of saccadic eye movements may be due to neural encoding at the collicular level, rather than at the brainstem. We show that the spiking activity of the SC population drives gaze to the intended target location within a dynamic local gaze-velocity feedback circuit that yields realistic eye- and head-movement kinematics and dynamic SC gaze-movement fields.

	<p>Tropomyosin 4 (TPM4) has been reported as an oncogenic gene across different malignancies. However, the role of TPM4 in glioma remains unclear. This study aimed to determine the clinical characterization and prognostic value of TPM4 in gliomas. Transcriptome expression and clinical information were collected from the CGGA and TCGA datasets, which included 998 glioma patients. ScRNA-seq data were obtained from CGGA. R software was utilized for statistical analyses. There was a positive correlation between TPM4 and WHO grades. IDH-wildtype and mesenchymal subtype gliomas were accompanied by TPM4 upregulation. GO and GSEA analysis suggested that TPM4 was profoundly associated with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Subsequent GSVA revealed a robust correlation between TPM4 and three signaling pathways of EMT (hypoxia, TGF-&amp;amp;beta;, PI3K/AKT). Furthermore, TPM4 showed a synergistic effect with mesenchymal biomarkers, particularly with N-cadherin, Slug, Snail, TWIST1, and vimentin. ScRNA-seq analysis suggested that higher TPM4 was mainly attributed to tumor cells and macrophages and associated with tumor cell progression and macrophage polarization. Finally, high TPM4 was significantly associated with unfavorable outcomes. In conclusion, our findings indicate that TPM4 is significantly correlated with more malignant characteristics of gliomas, potentially through involvement in EMT. TPM4 could predict worse survival for patients with glioma.</p>

	<p>Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is a rare and fatal neurodegenerative movement disorder and no disease modifying therapy (DMT) is currently available. This study aims to assess the epidemiology of PSP in Israel and to describe its clinical features. This retrospective analysis identified patients with PSP between 2000 and 2018 over the age of 40 years at first diagnosis (index date). We identified 209 patients with &amp;amp;ge;1 diagnosis of PSP. Of those, 88 patients satisfied the inclusion criteria with a mean age at diagnosis of 72 years (SD = 8) and 53% were female. The 2018 prevalence and incidence rates were 5.3 and 1 per 100,000 persons, respectively. Median survival time was 4.9 years (95% CI 3.6&amp;amp;ndash;6.1) and median time from initial symptom to diagnosis was 4.2 years. The most common misdiagnoses were Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease, cognitive disorder and depression. The present study demonstrates that the clinic-epidemiological features of PSP in Israel are similar to PSP worldwide. In light of PSP&amp;amp;rsquo;s rarity, investigation of PSP cohorts in different countries may create a proper platform for upcoming DMT trials.</p>

	<p>One of the most surprising features of our brain is the fact that it is extremely plastic. Among the various plastic processes supported by our brain, there is the neural representation of the space surrounding our body, the peripersonal space (PPS). The effects of real-world tool use on the PPS are well known in cognitive neuroscience, but little is still known whether similar mechanisms also govern virtual tool use. To this purpose, the present study investigated the plasticity of the PPS before and after a real (Experiment 1) or virtual motor training with a tool (Experiment 2). The results show the expansion of the PPS only following real-world tool use but not virtual use, highlighting how the two types of training potentially rely on different processes. This study enriches the current state of the art on the plasticity of PPS in real and virtual environments. We discuss our data with respect to the relevance for the development of effective immersive environment for trainings, learning and rehabilitation.</p>

	<p>Autoantibodies against nodal and paranodal proteins, specifically anti-neurofascin antibodies (ANFAs), have been recently described in central and peripheral nervous system demyelinating disorders. We retrospectively reviewed the charts of six individuals evaluated at our Multiple Sclerosis Program who tested positive for serum ANFAs on Western blot. We describe these patients&amp;amp;rsquo; clinical and diagnostic findings and attempt to identify features that might guide clinicians in checking for ANFAs. In our series, the women-to-men ratio was 2:1. At presentation, the median age was 60 years (range 30&amp;amp;ndash;70). The clinical presentation was pleiotropic and included incomplete transverse myelitis (n = 3), progressive myelopathy (n = 1), recurrent symmetric polyneuropathy (n = 1), and nonspecific neurological symptoms (n = 1). Atypical features prompting further workup included coexisting upper and lower motor neuron features, older age at presentation with active disease, atypical spinal cord MRI features, and unusual cerebrospinal fluid findings. The serum ANFAs panel was positive for the NF-155 isoform in five patients (IgM n = 2; IgG n = 2; both n = 1) and the NF-140 isoform in two (IgG n = 2). Larger studies are needed to assess the relevance of ANFAs in demyelinating nervous system diseases, their impact on long-term clinical outcomes, and associated therapeutic implications.</p>

	<p>Little is known about the mental health impact of having a family member or friend infected with COVID-19. Thus, the purpose of this study was to conduct a comprehensive national assessment of the psychological impact of COVID-19 infection, hospitalization, or death among family members and friends. A multi-item valid and reliable questionnaire was deployed online to recruit adults in the U.S. A total of 2797 adult Americans without a history of COVID-19 infection participated in the study and reported that they had a family member or friend infected with (54%), hospitalized due to (48%), or die (36%) of COVID-19 infection. Symptoms of depression, anxiety, or both (i.e., psychological distress) were statistically significantly higher among those who had family members/friends infected, hospitalized, or die due to COVID-19. Also, this study found that the greater the number of family members/friends affected by COVID-19, or the more severe the COVID-19 infection outcome (i.e., hospitalization vs. death), the higher the odds of symptoms of depression, anxiety, or both. There is an urgent need to develop educational interventions and implement policy measures that address the growing mental health needs of this subgroup of the population that was not infected but indirectly affected by COVID-19 infections among social networks.</p>

	<p>The aim of the current paper was to present important factors for keeping the basic structures of a person&amp;amp;rsquo;s brain function, i.e., the grey and white matter, intact. Several lines of evidence have shown that motion, relation, and passion are central factors for preserving the neural system in the grey and white matter during ageing. An active lifestyle has shown to contribute to the development of the central nervous system and to contrast brain ageing. Interpersonal relationships, and interactions, have shown to contribute to complex biological factors that benefit the cognitive resilience to decline. Furthermore, the current scientific literature suggests that passion, strong interest, could be the driving factor motivating individuals to learn new things, thus influencing the development and maintenance of the neural functional network over time. The present theoretical perspective paper aims to convey several key messages: (1) brain development is critically affected by lifestyle; (2) physical training allows one to develop and maintain brain structures during ageing, and may be one of the keys for good quality of life as an older person; (3) diverse stimuli are a key factor in maintaining brain structures; (4) motion, relation, and passion are key elements for contrasting the loss of the grey and white matter of the brain.</p>

	<p>Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) was used to investigate the effects of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) causing brain function changes in adolescents who suffered from depression and suicidal ideation (SI). A total of 30 patients (MDDs) and 25 healthy controls (HCs) matched by gender, age, and education level were enrolled. The amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) and regional homogeneity (ReHo) were used to compare differences between HCs and MDDs at baseline, and differences in ALFF and ReHo pre/post ECT in MDDs. Pearson correlation analysis was used to evaluate the relationship between altered brain function and clinical symptoms. At baseline, MDDs showed decreased ALFF in the left inferior temporal gyrus and right amygdala, decreased ReHo in left inferior temporal gyrus, and increased ReHo in the right inferior frontal gyrus, opercular part and left middle occipital gyrus. After ECT, MDDs showed increased ALFF in the right middle occipital gyrus, decreased ALFF in left temporal pole, left inferior frontal gyrus, opercular part, and right frontal middle gyrus, increased ReHo in the right middle occipital gyrus, and left inferior temporal gyrus. Pearson correlation found HAMD scores at baseline were negatively correlated with ALFF in the left inferior temporal gyrus, and HAMD and BSSI scores after ECT were negatively correlated with ALFF in the right middle occipital gyrus. The abnormal activities of amygdala, inferior temporal gyrus and middle occipital gyrus might be related to depressive and suicidal symptoms in adolescents.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Midbrain dopaminergic (mDA) neurons are generated from a ventral midbrain progenitor zone over a time span of several days [embryonic day 10.0 (E10.0) to E14.5 in mouse]. Within this neurogenic period, a progressively changing fate potential of mDA progenitors could contribute to the generation of diverse mDA neuronal subpopulations. To test this idea, we combined inducible genetic fate mapping and intersectional labeling approaches to trace the lineage of cells expressing the chemokine receptor CXCR4. The <I>Cxcr4</I> transcript is expressed in mDA progenitors and precursors, but not in differentiated mDA neurons. <I>Cxcr4</I>-expressing mDA progenitors/precursors labeled at E11.5 develop into a broad range of mDA neurons, whereas labeling of the <I>Cxcr4</I> lineage at later time points (E12.5&ndash;E15.5) results in an increasingly restricted contribution to mDA neurons proceeding from lateral to medial in the substantia nigra and from dorsal to ventral in the ventral tegmental area. In parallel, the innervation of dopaminergic projection targets by mDA neurons derived from <I>Cxcr4</I>-expressing cells is becoming more restricted: the late-generated mDA neurons innervate only the medial&ndash;rostral regions in the dorsal striatum and only the medial shell in the nucleus accumbens. Our results suggest that mDA progenitor cells become increasingly restricted in their cell fate potential over time.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Dynamics of Temporal Integration in the Lateral Geniculate Nucleus</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Before visual information from the retina reaches primary visual cortex (V1), it is dynamically filtered by the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of the thalamus, the first location within the visual hierarchy at which nonretinal structures can significantly influence visual processing. To explore the form and dynamics of geniculate filtering we used data from monosynpatically connected pairs of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and LGN relay cells in the cat that, under anesthetized conditions, were stimulated with binary white noise and/or drifting sine-wave gratings to train models of increasing complexity to predict which RGC spikes were relayed to cortex, what we call "relay status." In addition, we analyze and compare a smaller dataset recorded in the awake state to assess how anesthesia might influence our results. Consistent with previous work, we find that the preceding retinal interspike interval (ISI) is the primary determinate of relay status with only modest contributions from longer patterns of retinal spikes. Including the prior activity of the LGN cell further improved model predictions, primarily by indicating epochs of geniculate burst activity in recordings made under anesthesia, and by allowing the model to capture gain control-like behavior within the awake LGN. Using the same modeling framework, we further demonstrate that the form of geniculate filtering changes according to the level of activity within the early visual circuit under certain stimulus conditions. This finding suggests a candidate mechanism by which a stimulus specific form of gain control may operate within the LGN.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">DLBS3233 reduces inflammatory marker on kidney by increasing expression GLUT1 and GLUT2 in diabetic rats [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Diabetic kidney disease (DKD), as a diabetes mellitus type 2 (DMT2) complications, is getting more prevalent nowadays. Inflammation is one of the renal injury mechanisms evaluated through the surge in in TNF-α and NF-κβ expression. Impaired expression of gluten transporter 1 (GLUT1) and GLUT2 reduces glucose uptake. DBLS3233 is a novel anti-diabetes agent and Indonesian herbal product responsible for glucose control and upregulation of insulin signal transduction. We performed an experiment on DLBS3233 to examine the response of TNF-α and NF-κβ and the expression of GLUT 1 and GLUT2. Methods: A total of 30 adult male Wistar rats were randomly divided into six groups (n=5 per group): nondiabetic rats in the control group (group 1); untreated diabetic rats (group 2); diabetic rats treated with DLBS3233 4,5mg/kgBW (group 3); 9mg/kgBW (group 4); 18mg/kgBW (group 5), and diabetic rats treated with pioglitazone (group 6). Immunohistochemistry was performed to examine the expression of GLUT1 and GLUT2 in the pancreas and expression of TNF-α and NF-κβ in the kidney. The data was then analyzed by ANOVA. Results: In the DBLS3233 group, reduced expression of both TNF-α and NF-κβ was seen through immunohistochemistry, whereas GLUT1 and GLUT2 were intensified compared to untreated groups. From statistical analysis, we obtained significantly lower expression of TNF-α and NF-κβ, as well as enhanced GLUT1 and GLUT2 expression compared to untreated groups (p<0.05). Conclusions: DBLS3233 significantly reduces the inflammatory process and enhances the expression of GLUT1 and GLUT2 diabetic rats.

[version 4; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Nanoparticles are globally synthesized for their antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, wound healing, catalytic, magnetic, optical, and electronic properties that have put them at the forefront of a wide variety of studies. Among them, zinc oxide (ZnO) has received much consideration due to its technological and medicinal applications. In this study, we report on the synthesis process of ZnO nanoparticles using Athrixia phylicoides DC natural extract as a reducing agent.   Methods: Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was used to identify the compounds responsible for the synthesis of ZnO nanoparticles. Structural, morphological and optical properties of the synthesized nanoparticles have been characterized through X-ray diffraction (XRD), Ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS).   Results: LC-MS results showed that different flavonoids and polyphenols, as well as Coumarin, an aromatic compound, reacted with the precursor to form ZnO nanoparticles. XRD and UV-Vis analysis confirmed the synthesis of ZnO nanoparticles, with a spherical shape showed in SEM images. The quasi-spherical ZnO crystals had an average crystallite size of 24 nm. EDS and FTIR analysis confirmed that the powders were pure with no other phase or impurity.   Conclusions: This study successfully demonstrated that the natural plant extract of A. phylicoides DC. can be used in the bio-reduction of zinc nitrate hexahydrate to prepare pure ZnO nanoparticles, thus, extending the use of this plant to an industrial level.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Cross-cultural adaptation and validation of the 5C scale to identify factors associated with COVID-19 and influenza vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers in Cape Town, South Africa – a protocol [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Healthcare workers are at an increased risk of acquiring vaccine-preventable diseases and are known to be reliable sources of information for the patients and their relatives. Knowledge and attitudes of healthcare workers about vaccines are thus important determinants of their own vaccination uptake and their intention to recommend vaccinations to their patients. However, culturally adapted tools and studies to address vaccine uptake and hesitancy as well as related behaviors among healthcare workers in the Global South are limited. Methods: We propose a mixed methods project to understand the extent and determinants of vaccination hesitancy among healthcare workers and construct a validated scale to measure this complex and context-specific phenomenon in Cape Town. We will summarize responses as counts and percentages for categorical variables and means with standard deviations (or medians with inter quartile ranges) for continuous variables. We will run the Shapiro-Wilks test to assess the normality. Analysis of the variance, chi-square tests, and equivalents will be conducted as appropriate for group comparisons. Logistic regression models will also be performed to assess association between variables. We will focus on the seasonal influenza and COVID-19 vaccines. We will use an existing tool developed and validated in Germany and the United States of America to measure five psychological determinants of vaccination (referred to as the 5C scale), as the basis to develop and validate a scale to measure the scope and determinants of vaccine hesitancy and acceptance among healthcare workers in Cape Town. Discussion and conclusion: Through this study, we hope to expand the scientific evidence base on vaccination acceptance and demand among healthcare workers in South Africa and build resources to enable better understanding of, detection, and response to vaccination hesitancy in Cape Town.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Subunit promotion energies for channel opening in heterotetrameric olfactory CNG channels</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jana Schirmeyer, Thomas Eick, Eckhard Schulz, Sabine Hummert, Christian Sattler, Ralf Schmauder, Klaus Benndorf</p>

Cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) ion channels of olfactory sensory neurons contain three types of homologue subunits, two CNGA2 subunits, one CNGA4 subunit and one CNGB1b subunit. Each subunit carries an intracellular cyclic nucleotide binding domain (CNBD) whose occupation by up to four cyclic nucleotides evokes channel activation. Thereby, the subunits interact in a cooperative fashion. Here we studied 16 concatamers with systematically disabled, but still functional, binding sites and quantified channel activation by systems of intimately coupled state models transferred to 4D hypercubes, thereby exploiting a weak voltage dependence of the channels. We provide the complete landscape of free energies for the complex activation process of heterotetrameric channels, including 32 binding steps, in both the closed and open channel, as well as 16 closed-open isomerizations. The binding steps are specific for the subunits and show pronounced positive cooperativity for the binding of the second and the third ligand. The energetics of the closed-open isomerizations were disassembled to elementary subunit promotion energies for channel opening, ΔΔGfpn, adding to the free energy of the closed-open isomerization of the empty channel, <i>E</i><sub>0</sub>. The ΔΔGfpn values are specific for the four subunits and presumably invariant for the specific patterns of liganding. In conclusion, subunit cooperativity is confined to the CNBD whereas the subunit promotion energies for channel opening are independent.

We propose a novel, non-discriminatory classification of monkeypox virus. Together with the World Health Organization, we named three clades (I, IIa and IIb) in order of detection. Within IIb, the cause the current global outbreak, we identified multiple lineages (A.1, A.2, A.1.1 and B.1) to support real-time genomics surveillance.

The current nomenclature for monkeypox virus is stigmatising and misleading. This Perspective article proposes a practical and neutral system of nomenclature that will allow efficient communication without the risk of further misconceptions, discrimination and stigmatisation.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Individuality and ethnicity eclipse a short-term dietary intervention in shaping microbiomes and viromes</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Junhui Li, Robert H. George Markowitz, Andrew W. Brooks, Elizabeth K. Mallott, Brittany A. Leigh, Timothy Olszewski, Hamid Zare, Minoo Bagheri, Holly M. Smith, Katie A.

Many diseases linked with ethnic health disparities associate with changes in microbial communities in the United States, but the causes and persistence of ethnicity-associated microbiome variation are not understood. For instance, microbiome studies that strictly control for diet across ethnically diverse populations are lacking. Here, we performed multiomic profiling over a 9-day period that included a 4-day controlled vegetarian diet intervention in a defined geographic location across 36 healthy Black and White females of similar age, weight, habitual diets, and health status. We demonstrate that individuality and ethnicity account for roughly 70% to 88% and 2% to 10% of taxonomic variation, respectively, eclipsing the effects a short-term diet intervention in shaping gut and oral microbiomes and gut viromes. Persistent variation between ethnicities occurs for microbial and viral taxa and various metagenomic functions, including several gut KEGG orthologs, oral carbohydrate active enzyme categories, cluster of orthologous groups of proteins, and antibiotic-resistant gene categories. In contrast to the gut and oral microbiome data, the urine and plasma metabolites tend to decouple from ethnicity and more strongly associate with diet. These longitudinal, multiomic profiles paired with a dietary intervention illuminate previously unrecognized associations of ethnicity with metagenomic and viromic features across body sites and cohorts within a single geographic location, highlighting the importance of accounting for human microbiome variation in research, health determinants, and eventual therapies.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Sleep loss leads to the withdrawal of human helping across individuals, groups, and large-scale societies</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Eti Ben Simon, Raphael Vallat, Aubrey Rossi, Matthew P. Walker</p>

Humans help each other. This fundamental feature of homo sapiens has been one of the most powerful forces sculpting the advent of modern civilizations. But what determines whether humans choose to help one another? Across 3 replicating studies, here, we demonstrate that sleep loss represents one previously unrecognized factor dictating whether humans choose to help each other, observed at 3 different scales (within individuals, across individuals, and across societies). First, at an individual level, 1 night of sleep loss triggers the withdrawal of help from one individual to another. Moreover, fMRI findings revealed that the withdrawal of human helping is associated with deactivation of key nodes within the social cognition brain network that facilitates prosociality. Second, at a group level, ecological night-to-night reductions in sleep across several nights predict corresponding next-day reductions in the choice to help others during day-to-day interactions. Third, at a large-scale national level, we demonstrate that 1 h of lost sleep opportunity, inflicted by the transition to Daylight Saving Time, reduces real-world altruistic helping through the act of donation giving, established through the analysis of over 3 million charitable donations. Therefore, inadequate sleep represents a significant influential force determining whether humans choose to help one another, observable across micro- and macroscopic levels of civilized interaction. The implications of this effect may be non-trivial when considering the essentiality of human helping in the maintenance of cooperative, civil society, combined with the reported decline in sufficient sleep in many first-world nations.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A potential role of arcadia in conditioned media - umbilical cord derived mesenchymal stem cell on  cartilage repair [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background. Certain conditions can stimulate stem cells to produce secretory factors that differ from each condition, such as hypoxia. Umbilical Cord-derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells have been known to have higher proliferation rates, plasticity, and better self-improvement ability than MSCs from other sources.  The objective was to analyze the secreting proteins in the Conditioned Medium - Umbilical cord-derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells (CM-UCMSCs) which potentially has a role in the chondrogenesis of cartilage defect.  Methods. We used SDS PAGE combined with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry using mass spectrometer to perform a proteomic analysis of CM-UCMSCs which conditioned in a state of fasting (without serum albumin). Then, we continue to analyze to identify proteins of interest using Mascot sequence matching software. Then Analyzed using in silico / molecular docking to know the interaction of each protein with the cartilage repair factor.  Results. SDS PAGE performed on all secreted products in CM-UCMSCs. We found one dominant band, then we used Mass Spectrometry continued Mascot sequencing protein that band, conclude that the protein was a D4A9T1/ RNF-111/ Arkadia Protein. And then using in silico/ molecular docking method analyzed that Arkadia Protein worked synergistically with TGF-β1 Protein through activation of TGF-β1 receptors to induce the chondrogenesis.  Conclusions. Our results show that the fasting state on CM-UCMSCs promoted secreted Arkadia protein. From in silico model prediction, this protein suspects to have an important role in the process of repairing cartilage defects. However, further research is needed before feasible and safe for the clinical application of CM-UCMSCs in cartilage repair.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A systematic literature review on cybercrime legislation [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Cybercrime is a fast-growing digital crime and legislation falling behind with the fast-moving advancement of technology. One important factor projected by literature in combating cybercrime is legislation. In order to combat cybercrime, the role of cybercrime legislation is a challenge that has not been clearly studied before. This paper thus aims to recapitulate the literature on cybercrime legislation in combating cybercrime. The literature in this context emphasises on existing studies relating to cybercrime legislation and addressing the importance of adequate and efficient responses in place in order to combat cybercrime efficiently. Methods: This paper finds an extensive literature review using the “Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis” method based on legislation to combat cybercrime and explains a systematic analysis of the legislation in most advanced countries in both technology and legal framework. The study was done by selecting keywords, validated by the experts to discover research trends of cybercrime legislation. A search was then run across seven academic databases, including the ACM Digital Library, Emerald, Hein Online, ProQuest, ScienceDirect, Scopus, and Westlaw Asia. Initially, five hundred and forty-eight articles were retrieved and out of which seventy-two studies met the inclusion criteria and were fully reviewed. Results: The findings of the study revealed that comprehensive cybercrime legislation plays a vital role in combating cybercrime and cybercrime legislation should be strengthened, enhanced, and made up to date with the rapid advancement of technology in order to address the rising number of cybercrime. Discussion: This systematic review is timely and highlights future research directions to improve a comprehensive legal framework to combat the rising of cybercrime effectively. To fill the research gap, the findings also have fundamental practical implications for the policy makers, in enacting an up to date cybercrime legislation by highlighting the role of legislation in combating cybercrime.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Assessment of medication-related burden among a sample of Iraqi patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and its relationship with disease activity: a cross-sectional study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease with high morbidity and disability. The routines involved in taking medications, side effects, the nature of medicines, difficulties with the healthcare system, and disruptions to social activities all contribute to patients frequently experiencing medication-related burdens (MRB). The current study aimed to assess the perceived MRB among a sample of SLE patients from Iraq and to look for any possible relationship between MRB and disease activity. Methods: The current study was cross-sectional on diagnosed SLE patients who arrived at Baghdad Teaching Hospital/Medical City/Rheumatology department from September 2021 to January 2022. MRB was measured using the Living with Medicines Questionnaire (LMQ). Results: The study recruited 156 SLE patients. The patients were 35.8 ±11.7 years old on average. Great majority of them were women (96.8 %). The average LMQ score was 117.30± 18.37. The results showed that most patients (69.87%) experienced a moderate level of burden, followed by a low level (19.87%), high level (7.69%), and no burden at all (2.56%). No patients experienced an extremely high level of burden (0.0%). The mean burden scores for two LMQ domains—relationships with health care professionals (HCPs) and effectiveness of prescription medications—were the lowest (below average). Conclusions: Many of the SLE patients in this study reported experiencing MRB. Healthcare professionals should implement strategies to reduce this burden, particularly for low-income patients.

                Stem-cell-derived islets can reverse diabetes, but off-target populations that arise during differentiation and after transplantation remain the major limitations for transition into the clinic. Cuesta-Gomez et al. describe these off-target cell populations and identify quality control criteria to ensure product safety.

Joshi et al. reported that look-alike pairs identified by facial recognition algorithms share genotypes but not DNA methylomes and microbiomes. The identified SNPs also provide a readout of other anthropomorphic and behavioral characteristics.

                Activating the GDF15 receptor, GFRAL, can reduce food intake. Klein et al. demonstrate that the widely prescribed anti-diabetic medication metformin lowers body weight independently of the GDF15-GFRAL pathway in mice. In humans with BMI >25 and prediabetes, metformin increases circulating levels of GFD15, but this increase is not associated with weight loss.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">The Bruce effect: Representational stability and memory formation in the accessory olfactory bulb of the female mouse</a></h4>

              
                Studying the neuronal correlates of the Bruce effect, Yoles-Frenkel et al. record neuronal responses to chemosensory cues in the accessory olfactory bulb (AOB) of female mice. They find that, while immediate neuronal representations of multiple stimuli remain stable following mating, extended presentation of the stud stimulus leads to attenuated responses.

                Valero et al. examine the influence of inhibition on place fields. They show that hippocampal neurons are dominated by inhibitory conductances during theta oscillations. A transient increase of excitation and drop of inhibition mediates place field emergence in simulations. Consistently, chemogenetic activation of interneurons deteriorates place cell properties in vivo.

                Mukherjee et al. show that during WNT-induced differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells, SOX transcription factors can recruit β-catenin to lineage-specific enhancers independent of TCFs, the commonly accepted β-catenin binding partner. This helps explain how WNT signaling can regulate different transcriptional programs in different biological contexts.

                Chromatin accessibility in yeast is regulated by nucleosome-displacing-factors (NDFs) and chromatin remodelers (CRs). Chen et al. show that NDFs first invade into nucleosomes and then recruit CRs to modulate the NDR length. NDF-specific and NDR length-dependent recruitment of CRs allow partitioned usage of CRs by NDFs.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Alternation emerges as a multi-modal strategy for turbulent odor navigation</a></h4>

              
                Foraging mammals exhibit a familiar yet poorly characterized phenomenon, 'alternation', a pause to sniff in the air preceded by the animal rearing on its hind legs or raising its head. Rodents spontaneously alternate in the presence of airflow, suggesting that alternation serves an important role during plume-tracking. To test this hypothesis, we combine fully-resolved simulations of turbulent odor transport and Bellman optimization methods for decision-making under partial observability. We show that an agent trained to minimize search time in a realistic odor plume exhibits extensive alternation together with the characteristic cast-and-surge behavior observed in insects. Alternation is linked with casting and occurs more frequently far downwind of the source, where the likelihood of detecting airborne cues is higher relative to ground cues. Casting and alternation emerge as complementary tools for effective exploration with sparse cues. A model based on marginal value theory captures the interplay between casting, surging and alternation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Polycomb-mediated repression of paternal chromosomes maintains haploid dosage in diploid embryos of Marchantia</a></h4>

              
                Complex mechanisms regulate gene dosage throughout eukaryotic life cycles. Mechanisms controlling gene dosage have been extensively studied in animals, however it is unknown how generalizable these mechanisms are to diverse eukaryotes. Here, we use the haploid plant <i>Marchantia polymorpha</i> to assess gene dosage control in its short-lived diploid embryo. We show that throughout embryogenesis, paternal chromosomes are repressed resulting in functional haploidy. The paternal genome is targeted for genomic imprinting by the Polycomb mark H3K27me3 starting at fertilization, rendering the maternal genome in control of embryogenesis. Maintaining haploid gene dosage by this new form of imprinting is essential for embryonic development. Our findings illustrate how haploid-dominant species can regulate gene dosage through paternal chromosome inactivation and initiates the exploration of the link between life cycle history and gene dosage in a broader range of organisms.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">BehaviorDEPOT is a simple, flexible tool for automated behavioral detection based on markerless pose tracking</a></h4>

              
                Quantitative descriptions of animal behavior are essential to study the neural substrates of cognitive and emotional processes. Analyses of naturalistic behaviors are often performed by hand or with expensive, inflexible commercial software. Recently, machine learning methods for markerless pose estimation enabled automated tracking of freely moving animals, including in labs with limited coding expertise. However, classifying specific behaviors based on pose data requires additional computational analyses and remains a significant challenge for many groups. We developed BehaviorDEPOT (DEcoding behavior based on POsitional Tracking), a simple, flexible software program that can detect behavior from video timeseries and can analyze the results of experimental assays. BehaviorDEPOT calculates kinematic and postural statistics from keypoint tracking data and creates heuristics that reliably detect behaviors. It requires no programming experience and is applicable to a wide range of behaviors and experimental designs. We provide several hard-coded heuristics. Our freezing detection heuristic achieves above 90% accuracy in videos of mice and rats, including those wearing tethered head-mounts. BehaviorDEPOT also helps researchers develop their own heuristics and incorporate them into the software’s graphical interface. Behavioral data is stored framewise for easy alignment with neural data. We demonstrate the immediate utility and flexibility of BehaviorDEPOT using popular assays including fear conditioning, decision-making in a T-maze, open field, elevated plus maze, and novel object exploration.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Satellite glia modulate sympathetic neuron survival, activity, and autonomic function</a></h4>

              
                Satellite glia are the major glial cells in sympathetic ganglia, enveloping neuronal cell bodies. Despite this intimate association, the extent to which sympathetic functions are influenced by satellite glia <i>in vivo</i> remains unclear. Here, we show that satellite glia are critical for metabolism, survival, and activity of sympathetic neurons and modulate autonomic behaviors in mice. Adult ablation of satellite glia results in impaired mTOR signaling, soma atrophy, reduced noradrenergic enzymes, and loss of sympathetic neurons. However, persisting neurons have elevated activity, and satellite glia-ablated mice show increased pupil dilation and heart rate, indicative of enhanced sympathetic tone. Satellite glia-specific deletion of Kir4.1, an inward-rectifying potassium channel, largely recapitulates the cellular defects observed in glia-ablated mice, suggesting that satellite glia act in part via K<sup>+</sup>-dependent mechanisms. These findings highlight neuron-satellite glia as functional units in regulating sympathetic output, with implications for disorders linked to sympathetic hyper-activity such as cardiovascular disease and hypertension.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">β-cell deletion of the PKm1 and PKm2 isoforms of pyruvate kinase in mice reveal their essential role as nutrient sensors for the KATP channel</a></h4>

              
                Pyruvate kinase (PK) and the phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) cycle play key roles in nutrient-stimulated K<sub>ATP</sub> channel closure and insulin secretion. To identify the PK isoforms involved, we generated mice lacking β-cell PKm1, PKm2, and mitochondrial PEP carboxykinase (PCK2) that generates mitochondrial PEP. Glucose metabolism generates both glycolytic and mitochondrially-derived PEP, which triggers K<sub>ATP</sub> closure through local PKm1 and PKm2 signaling at the plasma membrane. Amino acids, which generate mitochondrial PEP without producing glycolytic fructose 1,6-bisphosphate to allosterically activate PKm2, signal through PKm1 to raise ATP/ADP, close K<sub>ATP</sub> channels, and stimulate insulin secretion. Raising cytosolic ATP/ADP with amino acids is insufficient to close K<sub>ATP</sub> channels in the absence of PK activity or PCK2, indicating that K<sub>ATP</sub> channels are primarily regulated by PEP that provides ATP via plasma membrane-associated PK, rather than mitochondrially-derived ATP. Following membrane depolarization, the PEP cycle is also involved in an 'off-switch' that facilitates K<sub>ATP</sub> channel reopening and Ca<sup>2+</sup> extrusion, as shown by PK activation experiments and β-cell PCK2 deletion, which prolongs Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations and increases insulin secretion. In conclusion, the differential response of PKm1 and PKm2 to the glycolytic and mitochondrial sources of PEP influences the β-cell nutrient response, and controls the oscillatory cycle regulating insulin secretion.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Identification of putative enhancer-like elements predicts regulatory networks active in planarian adult stem cells</a></h4>

              
                Planarians have become an established model system to study regeneration and stem cells, but the regulatory elements in the genome remain almost entirely undescribed. Here, by integrating epigenetic and expression data we use multiple sources of evidence to predict enhancer elements active in the adult stem cell populations that drive regeneration. We have used ChIP-seq data to identify regions with histone modifications consistent with enhancer identity and activity, and ATAC-seq data to identify accessible chromatin. Overlapping these signals allowed for the identification of a set of high confidence candidate enhancers predicted to be active in planarian adult stem cells. These enhancers are enriched for predicted transcription factor (TF) binding sites for TFs and TF families expressed in planarian adult stem cells. Foot-printing analyses provided further evidence that these potential TF binding sites are potentially occupied in adult stem cells. We integrated these analyses to build testable hypotheses for the regulatory function of transcription factors in stem cells, both with respect to how pluripotency might be regulated, and to how lineage differentiation programs are controlled. We found that our predicted GRNs were independently supported by existing TF RNAi/RNA-seq data sets, providing further evidence that our work predicts active enhancers regulating adult stem cells and regenerative mechanisms.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Automated systematic evaluation of cryo-EM specimens with SmartScope</a></h4>

              
                Finding the conditions to stabilize a macromolecular target for imaging remains the most critical barrier to determining its structure by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). While automation has significantly increased the speed of data collection, specimens are still screened manually, a laborious and subjective task that often determines the success of a project. Here, we present SmartScope, the first framework to streamline, standardize, and automate specimen evaluation in cryo-EM. SmartScope employs deep-learning-based object detection to identify and classify features suitable for imaging, allowing it to perform thorough specimen screening in a fully automated manner. A web interface provides remote control over the automated operation of the microscope in real time and access to images and annotation tools. Manual annotations can be used to re-train the feature recognition models, leading to improvements in performance. Our automated tool for systematic evaluation of specimens streamlines structure determination and lowers the barrier of adoption for cryo-EM.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Species-specific chromatin landscape determines how transposable elements shape genome evolution</a></h4>

              
                Transposable elements (TEs) are selfish genetic parasites that increase their copy number at the expense of host fitness. The ‘success’, or genome-wide abundance, of TEs differs widely between species. Deciphering the causes for this large variety in TE abundance has remained a central question in evolutionary genomics. We previously proposed that species-specific TE abundance could be driven by the inadvertent consequences of host-direct epigenetic silencing of TEs—the spreading of repressive epigenetic marks from silenced TEs into adjacent sequences. Here, we compared this TE-mediated local enrichment of repressive marks, or ‘the epigenetic effect of TEs’, in six species in the <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> subgroup to dissect step-by-step the role of such effect in determining genomic TE abundance. We found that TE-mediated local enrichment of repressive marks is prevalent and substantially varies across and even within species. While this TE-mediated effect alters the epigenetic states of adjacent genes, we surprisingly discovered that the transcription of neighboring genes could reciprocally impact this spreading. Importantly, our multi-species analysis provides the power and appropriate phylogenetic resolution to connect species-specific host chromatin regulation, TE-mediated epigenetic effects, the strength of natural selection against TEs, and genomic TE abundance unique to individual species. Our findings point toward the importance of host chromatin landscapes in shaping genome evolution through the epigenetic effects of a selfish genetic parasite.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Infrared videography of a subcutaneous knee tattoo as a simple and inexpensive method to overcome skin motion artifact in rodent kinematics</a></h4>

              
                Kinematic analyses of rodent behavior are frequently used in neuroscience research, and commonly in spinal cord injury (SCI) studies. Unfortunately, skin motion artifact introduces significant errors into these data, because the skin is only loosely coupled to the underlying skeleton by connective tissue. In rats, these errors can be as large as 50-75%, as quantified by past work using x-ray fluoroscopy. Here we show that infrared videography of a subcutaneous tattoo can overcome skin motion artifact in rodent kinematics. The method yields data similar to gold standard x-ray fluoroscopy systems at a fraction of the cost, does not affect the animals' locomotion, and results in markers that persist for at least 10 weeks. We found that, compared to a gold-standard x-ray fluoroscopy study that directly tracked the skeleton, our method reduced the error in mean hip angle from 17 {+/-} 6.0 to 3.1 {+/-} 2.4 degrees (mean {+/-} SEM), and the root-mean-square (RMS) error across the mean hip angle waveform from 20 to 5.3 degrees (n=4 rats). The knee joint angle waveform derived from infra-red imaging tightly matched the shape of the x-ray waveform after allowing for a constant offset, having RMS error reduced from 8.1 to 1.2 degrees. The method stands to significantly reduce between-animal errors, and hence between laboratory errors, in these ubiquitous model systems, especially important in SCI studies where individuals are assigned to different treatments.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A layered, hybrid machine learning analytic workflow for mouse risk assessment behavior</a></h4>

              
                Accurate and efficient quantification of animal behavior facilitates the understanding of the brain. An emerging approach within machine learning (ML) field is to combine multiple ML-based algorithms to quantify animal behavior. These so-called hybrid models have emerged because of limitations associated with supervised (e.g., random forest, RF) and unsupervised (e.g., hidden Markov model, HMM) ML classifiers. For example, RF models lack temporal information across video frames, and HMM latent states are often difficult to interpret. We sought to develop a hybrid model, and did so in the context of a study of mouse risk assessment behavior. We utilized DeepLabCut to estimate the positions of mouse body parts. Positional features were calculated using DeepLabCut outputs and were used to train RF and HMM models with equal number of states, separately. The per-frame predictions from RF and HMM models were then passed to a second HMM model layer ("reHMM"). The outputs of the reHMM layer showed improved interpretability over the initial HMM output. Finally, we combined predictions from RF and HMM models with selected positional features to train a third HMM model ("reHMM+"). This reHMM+ layered hybrid model unveiled distinctive temporal and human-interpretable behavioral patterns. We applied this workflow to investigate risk assessment to trimethylthiazoline and snake feces odor, finding unique behavioral patterns to each that were separable from attractive and neutral stimuli. We conclude that this layered, hybrid machine learning workflow represents a balanced approach for improving the depth and reliability of ML classifiers in chemosensory and other behavioral contexts.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Identification of a cardiac glycoside exhibiting favorable brain bioavailability and potency for reducing levels of the cellular prion protein</a></h4>

              
                Several strands of investigation have established that a reduction in the levels of the cellular prion protein (PrPC) is a promising avenue for the treatment of prion diseases. We recently described an indirect approach for reducing PrPC levels that targets Na,K-ATPases (NKAs) with cardiac glycosides (CGs), causing cells to respond with the degradation of these pumps and nearby molecules, including PrPC. Because the therapeutic window of widely used CGs is narrow and their brain bioavailability is low, we set out to identify a CG with improved pharmacological properties for this indication. Starting with the CG known as oleandrin, we combined in silico modeling of CG binding poses within human NKA folds, CG structure-activity relationship (SAR) data, and predicted blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetrance scores to identify CG derivatives with improved characteristics. Focusing on C4-dehydro-oleandrin as a chemically accessible shortlisted CG derivative, we show that it reaches four times higher levels in the brain than in the heart one day after subcutaneous administration, exhibits promising pharmacological properties, and suppresses steady-state PrPC levels by 84% in immortalized human cells that have been differentiated to acquire neural or astrocytic characteristics. Finally, we validate that the mechanism of action of this approach for reducing cell surface PrPC levels requires C4-dehydro-oleandrin to engage with its cognate binding pocket within the NKA  subunit. The improved brain bioavailability of C4-dehydro-oleandrin, combined with its relatively low toxicity, make this compound an attractive lead for brain CG indications and recommends its further exploration for the treatment of prion diseases.

AUTHOR SUMMARYPrion diseases are fatal neurodegenerative diseases for which there is no effective treatment. An abundance of data indicates that reducing the levels of a specific protein, termed the cellular prion protein (PrPC), would not only be safe but would delay disease onset and extend prion disease survival. This project builds on our recent discovery that PrPC binds to NKAs, specific cellular transport proteins that use energy to electrify cellular membranes by pumping charged potassium and sodium metals in and out of cells. We showed that targeting NKAs with their natural inhibitors, cardiac glycosides (CGs), causes brain cells to internalize and degrade NKAs, and that PrPC, on account of residing next to NKAs, gets co-degraded. Natural CGs act primarily on the heart. Here, we used computational modeling to identify a CG, termed KDC203, that is predicted to have favorable characteristics for brain applications. We show that KDC203 reduces PrPC levels by 84% in immortalized human brain-like cells grown in the dish. Moreover, we show that KDC203 exhibits relatively low toxicity, predominantly targets the brain when subcutaneously injected into mice, and has other promising pharmacological characteristics that recommend it for further evaluation for the treatment of prion diseases.
