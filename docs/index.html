	<p>Verbal Fluency Tests (VFT) are one of the most common neuropsychological tasks used in bipolar disorder (BD) and schizophrenia (SZ) research. Recently, a new VFT analysis method based on graph theory was developed. Interpreting spoken words as nodes and every temporal connection between consecutive words as edges, researchers created graph structures, allowing the extraction of more data from participants&amp;amp;rsquo; speech, called Speech Graph Attributes (SGA). The aim of our study was to compare speech graphs, derived from Phonemic and Semantic VFT, between SZ, BD, and healthy controls (HC). Twenty-nine SZ patients, twenty-nine BD patients, and twenty-nine HC performed Semantic and Phonemic VFT. Standard measures (SM) and 13 SGA were analyzed. SZ patients&amp;amp;rsquo; Semantic VFT graphs showed lower total word count and correct responses. Their graphs presented less nodes and edges, higher density, smaller diameter, average shortest path (ASP), and largest strongly connected component than the HC group. SM did not differentiate BD and HC groups, and patients&amp;amp;rsquo; Semantic VFT graphs presented smaller diameter and ASP than HC. None of the parameters differentiated BD and SZ patients. Our results encourage the use of speech graph analysis, as it reveals verbal fluency alterations that remained unnoticed in the routine comparisons of groups with the use SM.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Protein hyperdeimination and deficiency of lyso-phospholipids (LPC 18:1) has been associated with the pathology of demyelinating disease in both humans and mice. We uncovered interesting biology of LPC 18:1, in which LPC 18:1 induced optic nerve function restoration through oligodendrocyte maturation and remyelination in mouse model systems. Our <I>in vitro</I> studies show LPC 18:1 protection against neuron-ectopic hyperdeimination and stimulation of oligodendrocyte maturation, while <I>in vivo</I> investigations recorded optic nerve function improvement following optic nerve injections of LPC 18:1, in contrast with LPC 18:0. Thus, just a change in a single bond renders a dramatic alternation in biological function. The incorporation of isobaric C13-histidine in newly synthesized myelin proteins and quantitative proteome shifts are consistent with remyelination underlying restoration in optic nerve function. These results suggest that exogenous LPC 18:1 may provide a therapeutic avenue for stemming vision loss in demyelinating diseases.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">DSCAM Deficiency Leads to Premature Spine Maturation and Autism-like Behaviors</a></h4>

              
                <p>Mutations in some cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) cause abnormal synapse formation and maturation, and serve as one of the potential mechanisms of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). Recently, <I>DSCAM</I> (Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule) was found to be a high-risk gene for autism. However, it is still unclear how DSCAM contributes to ASD. Here, we show that DSCAM expression was downregulated following synapse maturation, and that DSCAM deficiency caused accelerated dendritic spine maturation during early postnatal development. Mechanistically, the extracellular domain of DSCAM interacts with neuroligin1 (NLGN1) to block the NLGN1-neurexin1&beta; (NRXN1&beta;) interaction. DSCAM extracellular domain was able to rescue spine overmaturation in <I>DSCAM</I> knockdown neurons. Precocious spines in DSCAM-deficient mice showed increased glutamatergic transmission in the developing cortex and induced autism-like behaviors, such as social novelty deficits and repetitive behaviors. Thus, DSCAM might be a repressor that prevents premature spine maturation and excessive glutamatergic transmission, and its deficiency could lead to autism-like behaviors. Our study provides new insight into the potential pathophysiological mechanisms of ASDs.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> <I>DSCAM</I> is not only associated with Down syndrome but is also a strong autism risk gene based on large-scale sequencing analysis. However, it remains unknown exactly how DSCAM contributes to autism. In mice, either neuron- and astrocyte-specific or pyramidal neuron-specific DSCAM deficiencies resulted in autism-like behaviors and enhanced spatial memory. In addition, DSCAM knockout or knockdown in pyramidal neurons led to increased dendritic spine maturation. Mechanistically, the extracellular domain of DSCAM binds to NLGN1 and inhibits NLGN1-NRXN1&beta; interaction, which can rescue abnormal spine maturation induced by DSCAM deficiency. Our research demonstrates that DSCAM negatively modulates spine maturation, and that DSCAM deficiency leads to excessive spine maturation and autism-like behaviors, thus providing new insight into a potential pathophysiological mechanism of autism.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Rapid Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Reveals That TRPV4 Channels Promote Dysregulation of Neuronal Na+ in Ischemia</a></h4>

              
                <p>Fluorescence imaging is an indispensable method for analysis of diverse cellular and molecular processes, enabling, for example, detection of ions, second messengers, or metabolites. Intensity-based approaches, however, are prone to artifacts introduced by changes in fluorophore concentrations. This drawback can be overcome by fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) based on time-correlated single-photon counting. FLIM often necessitates long photon collection times, resulting in strong temporal binning of dynamic processes. Recently, rapidFLIM was introduced, exploiting ultra-low dead-time photodetectors together with rapid electronics. Here, we demonstrate the applicability of rapidFLIM, combined with new and improved correction schemes, for spatiotemporal fluorescence lifetime imaging of low-emission fluorophores in a biological system. Using tissue slices of hippocampi of mice of either sex, loaded with the Na<sup>+</sup> indicator ING2, we show that improved rapidFLIM enables quantitative, dynamic imaging of neuronal Na<sup>+</sup> signals at a full-frame temporal resolution of 0.5 Hz. Induction of transient chemical ischemia resulted in unexpectedly large Na<sup>+</sup> influx, accompanied by considerable cell swelling. Both Na<sup>+</sup> loading and cell swelling were dampened on inhibition of TRPV4 channels. Together, rapidFLIM enabled the spatiotemporal visualization and quantification of neuronal Na<sup>+</sup> transients at unprecedented speed and independent from changes in cell volume. Moreover, our experiments identified TRPV4 channels as hitherto unappreciated contributors to neuronal Na<sup>+</sup> loading on metabolic failure, suggesting this pathway as a possible target to ameliorate excitotoxic damage. Finally, rapidFLIM will allow faster and more sensitive detection of a wide range of dynamic signals with other FLIM probes, most notably those with intrinsic low-photon emission.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> FLIM is an indispensable method for analysis of cellular processes. FLIM often necessitates long photon collection periods, requiring the sacrifice of temporal resolution at the expense of spatial information. Here, we demonstrate the applicability of the recently introduced rapidFLIM for quantitative, dynamic imaging with low-emission fluorophores in brain slices. RapidFLIM, combined with improved correction schemes, enabled intensity-independent recording of neuronal Na<sup>+</sup> transients at unprecedented full-frame rates of 0.5 Hz. It also allowed quantitative imaging independent from changes in cell volume, revealing a surprisingly strong and hitherto uncovered contribution of TRPV4 channels to Na<sup>+</sup> loading on energy failure. Collectively, our study thus provides a novel, unexpected insight into the mechanisms that are responsible for Na<sup>+</sup> changes on energy depletion.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Lunatic Fringe-GFP Marks Lamina-Specific Astrocytes That Regulate Sensory Processing</a></h4>

              
                <p>Astrocytes are the most abundant glial cell in the brain and perform a wide range of tasks that support neuronal function and circuit activities. There is emerging evidence that astrocytes exhibit molecular and cellular heterogeneity; however, whether distinct subpopulations perform these diverse roles remains poorly defined. Here we show that the Lunatic Fringe-GFP (Lfng-GFP) bacteria artificial chromosome mouse line from both sexes specifically labels astrocyte populations within lamina III and IV of the dorsal spinal cord. Transcriptional profiling of Lfng-GFP<sup>+</sup> astrocytes revealed unique molecular profiles, featuring an enriched expression of Notch- and Wnt- pathway components. Leveraging CRE-DOG viral tools, we ablated Lfng-GFP<sup>+</sup> astrocytes, which decreased neuronal activity in lamina III and IV and impaired mechanosensation associated with light touch. Together, our findings identify Lfng-GFP<sup>+</sup> astrocytes as a unique subpopulation that occupies a distinct anatomic location in the spinal cord and directly contributes to neuronal function and sensory responses.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Astrocytes are the most abundant glial cell in the CNS, and their interactions with neurons are essential for brain function. However, understanding the functional diversity of astrocytes has been hindered because of the lack of reporters that mark subpopulations and genetic tools for accessing them. We discovered that the Lfng-GFP reporter mouse labels a laminae-specific subpopulation of astrocytes in the dorsal spinal cord and that ablation of these astrocytes reduces glutamatergic synapses. Further analysis revealed that these astrocytes have a role in maintaining sensory-processing circuity related to light touch.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Structure of Long-Range Direct and Indirect Spinocerebellar Pathways as Well as Local Spinal Circuits Mediating Proprioception</a></h4>

              
                <p>Proprioception, the sense of limb and body position, generates a map of the body that is essential for proper motor control, yet we know little about precisely how neurons in proprioceptive pathways are wired. Defining the anatomy of secondary neurons in the spinal cord that integrate and relay proprioceptive and potentially cutaneous information from the periphery to the cerebellum is fundamental to understanding how proprioceptive circuits function. Here, we define the unique anatomic trajectories of long-range direct and indirect spinocerebellar pathways as well as local intersegmental spinal circuits using genetic tools in both male and female mice. We find that Clarke's column neurons, a major contributor to the direct spinocerebellar pathway, has mossy fiber terminals that diversify extensively in the cerebellar cortex with axons terminating bilaterally, but with no significant axon collaterals within the spinal cord, medulla, or cerebellar nuclei. By contrast, we find that two of the indirect pathways, the spino-lateral reticular nucleus and spino-olivary pathways, are in part, derived from cervical <I>Atoh1</I>-lineage neurons, whereas thoracolumbar <I>Atoh1</I>-lineage neurons project mostly locally within the spinal cord. Notably, while cervical and thoracolumbar <I>Atoh1</I>-lineage neurons connect locally with motor neurons, no Clarke's column to motor neuron connections were detected. Together, we define anatomic differences between long-range direct, indirect, and local proprioceptive subcircuits that likely mediate different components of proprioceptive-motor behaviors.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We define the anatomy of long-range direct and indirect spinocerebellar pathways as well as local spinal proprioceptive circuits. We observe that mossy fiber axon terminals of Clarke's column neurons diversify proprioceptive information across granule cells in multiple lobules on both ipsilateral and contralateral sides, sending no significant collaterals within the spinal cord, medulla, or cerebellar nuclei. Strikingly, we find that cervical spinal cord <I>Atoh1</I>-lineage neurons form mainly the indirect spino-lateral reticular nucleus and spino-olivary tracts and thoracolumbar <I>Atoh1</I>-lineage neurons project locally within the spinal cord, whereas only a few <I>Atoh1</I>-lineage neurons form a direct spinocerebellar tract.</p>

                <p>Precise information flow from the hippocampus (HP) to prefrontal cortex (PFC) emerges during early development and accounts for cognitive processing throughout life. On flip side, this flow is selectively impaired in mental illness. In mouse models of psychiatric risk mediated by gene-environment interaction (GE), the prefrontal-hippocampal coupling is disrupted already shortly after birth. While this impairment relates to local miswiring in PFC and HP, it might be also because of abnormal connectivity between the two brain areas. Here, we test this hypothesis by combining <I>in vivo</I> electrophysiology and optogenetics with in-depth tracing of projections and monitor the morphology and function of hippocampal afferents in the PFC of control and GE mice of either sex throughout development. We show that projections from the hippocampal CA1 area preferentially target layer 5/6 pyramidal neurons and interneurons, and to a lesser extent layer 2/3 neurons of prelimbic cortex (PL), a subdivision of PFC. In neonatal GE mice, sparser axonal projections from CA1 pyramidal neurons with decreased release probability reach the PL. Their ability to entrain layer 5/6 oscillatory activity and firing is decreased. These structural and functional deficits of hippocampal-prelimbic connectivity persist, yet are less prominent in prejuvenile GE mice. Thus, besides local dysfunction of HP and PL, weaker connectivity between the two brain areas is present in GE mice throughout development.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Poor cognitive performance in mental disorders comes along with prefrontal-hippocampal dysfunction. Recent data from mice that model the psychiatric risk mediated by gene-environment (GE) interaction identified the origin of deficits during early development, when the local circuits in both areas are compromised. Here, we show that sparser and less efficient connectivity as well as cellular dysfunction are the substrate of the weaker excitatory drive from hippocampus (HP) to prefrontal cortex (PFC) as well as of poorer oscillatory coupling between the two brain areas in these mice. While the structural and functional connectivity deficits persist during the entire development, their magnitude decreases with age. The results add experimental evidence for the developmental miswiring hypothesis of psychiatric disorders.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Effects of Light Isoflurane Anesthesia on Organization of Direction and Orientation Selectivity in the Superficial Layer of the Mouse Superior Colliculus</a></h4>

              
                <p>The superior colliculus (SC) is the midbrain center for integrating visual and multimodal sensory information. Neurons in the SC exhibit direction and orientation selectivity. Recent studies reported that neurons with similar preferences formed clusters in the mouse SC (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B2">Ahmadlou and Heimel, 2015</cross-ref>; <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B22">Feinberg and Meister, 2015</cross-ref>; <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B20">de Malmazet et al., 2018</cross-ref>; <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B38">Li et al., 2020</cross-ref>). However, it remains controversial as to how these clusters are organized within the SC (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B31">Inayat et al., 2015</cross-ref>; <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B16">Chen et al., 2021</cross-ref>). Here, we found that different brain states (i.e., awake or anesthetized with isoflurane) changed the selectivity of individual SC neurons and organizations of the neuronal population in both male and female mice. Using two-photon Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging, we examined both individual neuronal responses and the spatial patterns of their population responses. Under isoflurane anesthesia, orientation selectivity increased and a larger number of orientation-selective cells were observed when compared with the awake condition, whereas the proportions of direction-selective cells were similar in both conditions. Furthermore, direction- and orientation-selective cells located at closer positions showed more similar preferences, and cluster-like spatial patterns were enhanced. Inhibitory responses of direction-selective neurons were also reduced under isoflurane anesthesia. Thus, the changes in the spatial organization of response patterns were considered to be because of changes in the balance of excitation and inhibition, with excitation dominance, in the local circuits. These results provide new insights into the possibility that the functional organization of feature selectivity in the brain is affected by brain state.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Recent large-scale recording studies are changing our view of visual maps in the superior colliculus (SC), including findings of cluster-like localizations of direction- and orientation-selective neurons. However, results from several laboratories are conflicting regarding the presence of cluster-like organization. Here, we demonstrated that light isoflurane anesthesia affected the direction- and orientation-tuning properties in the mouse superficial SC and that their cluster-like localization pattern was enhanced by the anesthesia. Furthermore, the effect of anesthesia on direction selectivity appeared to be different in the excitatory and inhibitory populations in the SC. Our results suggest that the functional organization of direction and orientation selectivity might be regulated by the excitation&ndash;inhibition balance that depends on the brain state.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Perceptual Texture Dimensions Modulate Neuronal Response Dynamics in Visual Cortical Area V4</a></h4>

              
                <p>Texture is an important visual attribute for surface pattern discrimination and therefore object segmentation, but the neural bases of texture perception are largely unknown. Previously, we demonstrated that the responses of V4 neurons to naturalistic texture patches are sensitive to four key features of human texture perception: coarseness, directionality, regularity, and contrast. To begin to understand how distinct texture perception emerges from the dynamics of neuronal responses, in 2 macaque monkeys (1 male, 1 female), we investigated the relative contribution of the four texture attributes to V4 responses in terms of the strength and timing of response modulation. We found that the different feature dimensions are associated with different temporal dynamics. Specifically, the response modulation associated with directionality and regularity was significantly delayed relative to that associated with coarseness and contrast, suggesting that the latter are fundamentally simpler feature dimensions. The population of texture-selective neurons could be grouped into multiple clusters based on the combination of feature dimensions encoded, and those subpopulations displayed distinct temporal dynamics characterized by the weighted combinations of multiple features. Finally, we applied a population decoding approach to demonstrate that texture category information can be obtained from short temporal windows across time. These results demonstrate that the representation of different perceptually relevant texture features emerge over time in the responses of V4 neurons. The observed temporal organization provides a framework to interpret how the processing of surface features unfolds in early and midlevel cortical stages, and could ultimately inform the interpretation of perceptual texture dynamics.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> To delineate how neuronal responses underlie our ability to perceive visual textures, we related four key perceptual dimensions (coarseness, directionality, regularity, and contrast) of naturalistic textures to the strength and timing of modulation of neuronal responses in area V4, an intermediate stage in the form-processing, ventral visual pathway. Our results provide the first characterization of V4 temporal dynamics for texture encoding along perceptually defined axes.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Respiration, Heartbeat, and Conscious Tactile Perception</a></h4>

              
                <p>Previous studies have shown that timing of sensory stimulation during the cardiac cycle interacts with perception. Given the natural coupling of respiration and cardiac activity, we investigated here their joint effects on tactile perception. Forty-one healthy female and male human participants reported conscious perception of finger near-threshold electrical pulses (33% null trials) and decision confidence while electrocardiography, respiratory activity, and finger photoplethysmography were recorded. Participants adapted their respiratory cycle to expected stimulus onsets to preferentially occur during late inspiration/early expiration. This closely matched heart rate variation (sinus arrhythmia) across the respiratory cycle such that most frequent stimulation onsets occurred during the period of highest heart rate probably indicating highest alertness and cortical excitability. Tactile detection rate was highest during the first quadrant after expiration onset. Interindividually, stronger respiratory phase-locking to the task was associated with higher detection rates. Regarding the cardiac cycle, we confirmed previous findings that tactile detection rate was higher during diastole than systole and newly specified its minimum at 250&ndash;300 ms after the R-peak corresponding to the pulse wave arrival in the finger. Expectation of stimulation induced a transient heart deceleration which was more pronounced for unconfident decision ratings. Interindividually, stronger poststimulus modulations of heart rate were linked to higher detection rates. In summary, we demonstrate how tuning to the respiratory cycle and integration of respiratory-cardiac signals are used to optimize performance of a tactile detection task.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Mechanistic studies on perception and cognition tend to focus on the brain neglecting contributions of the body. Here, we investigated how respiration and heartbeat influence tactile perception: respiration phase-locking to expected stimulus onsets corresponds to highest heart rate (and presumably alertness/cortical excitability) and correlates with detection performance. Tactile detection varies across the heart cycle with a minimum when the pulse reaches the finger and a maximum in diastole. Taken together with our previous finding of unchanged early event-related potentials across the cardiac cycle, we conclude that these effects are not a peripheral physiological artifact but a result of cognitive processes that model our body's internal state, make predictions to guide behavior, and might also tune respiration to serve the task.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Language Recovery after Brain Injury: A Structural Network Control Theory Study</a></h4>

              
                <p>Aphasia recovery after stroke depends on the condition of the remaining, extralesional brain network. Network control theory (NCT) provides a unique, quantitative approach to assess the interaction between brain networks. In this longitudinal, large-scale, whole-brain connectome study, we evaluated whether controllability measures of language-related regions are associated with treated aphasia recovery. Using probabilistic tractography and controlling for the effects of structural lesions, we reconstructed whole-brain diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) connectomes from 68 individuals (20 female, 48 male) with chronic poststroke aphasia who completed a three-week language therapy. Applying principles of NCT, we computed regional (1) average and (2) modal controllability, which decode the ability of a region to (1) spread control input through the brain network and (2) to facilitate brain state transitions. We tested the relationship between pretreatment controllability measures of 20 language-related left hemisphere regions and improvements in naming six months after language therapy using multiple linear regressions and a parsimonious elastic net regression model with cross-validation. Regional controllability of the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) pars opercularis, pars orbitalis, and the anterior insula were associated with treatment outcomes independently of baseline aphasia severity, lesion volume, age, education, and network size. Modal controllability of the IFG pars opercularis was the strongest predictor of treated aphasia recovery with cross-validation and outperformed traditional graph theory, lesion load, and demographic measures. Regional NCT measures can reflect the status of the residual language network and its interaction with the remaining brain network, being able to predict language recovery after aphasia treatment.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Predicting and understanding language recovery after brain injury remains a challenging, albeit a fundamental aspect of human neurology and neuroscience. In this study, we applied network control theory (NCT) to fully harness the concept of brain networks as dynamic systems and to evaluate their interaction. We studied 68 stroke survivors with aphasia who underwent imaging and longitudinal behavioral assessments coupled with language therapy. We found that the controllability of the inferior frontal regional network significantly predicted recovery in language production six months after treatment. Importantly, controllability outperformed traditional demographic, lesion, and graph-theoretical measures. Our findings shed light on the neurobiological basis of human language and can be translated into personalized rehabilitation approaches.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Increasing Central Serotonin with 5-hydroxytryptophan Disrupts the Inhibition of Social Gaze in Nonhuman Primates</a></h4>

              
                <p>To competently navigate the world, individuals must flexibly balance distinct aspects of social gaze, orienting toward others and inhibiting orienting responses, depending on the context. These behaviors are often disrupted amongst patient populations treated with serotonergic drugs. However, those in the field lack a clear understanding of how the serotonergic system mediates social orienting and inhibiting behaviors. Here, we tested how increasing central concentrations of serotonin with the direct precursor 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) would modulate the ability of rhesus macaques (both sexes) to use eye movements to flexibly orient to, or inhibit orienting to, faces. Systemic administrations of 5-HTP effectively increased central serotonin levels and impaired flexible orientation and inhibition. Critically, 5-HTP selectively impaired the ability of monkeys to inhibit orienting to face images, whereas it similarly impaired orienting to face and control images. 5-HTP also caused monkeys to perseverate on their gaze responses, making them worse at flexibly switching between orienting and inhibiting behaviors. Furthermore, the effects of 5-HTP on performance correlated with a constriction of the pupil, an increased time to initiate trials, and an increased reaction time, suggesting that the disruptive effects of 5-HTP on social gaze behaviors are likely driven by a downregulation of arousal and motivational states. Together, these findings provide causal evidence for a modulatory relationship between 5-HTP and social gaze behaviors in nonhuman primates and offer translational insights for the role of the serotonergic system in social gaze.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Behavioral changes arising from pharmacological agents that target serotonergic functions are complex and difficult to predict. Here, we examined the causal impacts of administering the direct precursor of serotonin, 5-HTP, on orienting and inhibiting social gaze in nonhuman primates. 5-HTP increased central concentrations of serotonin and selectively impaired the ability of monkeys to inhibit orienting to faces while similarly impairing the ability of monkeys to orient to face and control images. These behavioral gaze impairments were systematically associated with a downregulation of arousal and motivational states, indexed by pupil constriction, increased time to initiate trials, and increased reaction time. These findings provide a causal link between 5-HTP and social gaze behaviors in nonhuman primates and provide translational insights about serotonergic interventions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Attention Differentially Affects Acoustic and Phonetic Feature Encoding in a Multispeaker Environment</a></h4>

              
                <p>Humans have the remarkable ability to selectively focus on a single talker in the midst of other competing talkers. The neural mechanisms that underlie this phenomenon remain incompletely understood. In particular, there has been longstanding debate over whether attention operates at an early or late stage in the speech processing hierarchy. One way to better understand this is to examine how attention might differentially affect neurophysiological indices of hierarchical acoustic and linguistic speech representations. In this study, we do this by using encoding models to identify neural correlates of speech processing at various levels of representation. Specifically, we recorded EEG from fourteen human subjects (nine female and five male) during a "cocktail party" attention experiment. Model comparisons based on these data revealed phonetic feature processing for attended, but not unattended speech. Furthermore, we show that attention specifically enhances isolated indices of phonetic feature processing, but that such attention effects are not apparent for isolated measures of acoustic processing. These results provide new insights into the effects of attention on different prelexical representations of speech, insights that complement recent anatomic accounts of the hierarchical encoding of attended speech. Furthermore, our findings support the notion that, for attended speech, phonetic features are processed as a distinct stage, separate from the processing of the speech acoustics.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Humans are very good at paying attention to one speaker in an environment with multiple speakers. However, the details of how attended and unattended speech are processed differently by the brain is not completely clear. Here, we explore how attention affects the processing of the acoustic sounds of speech as well as the mapping of those sounds onto categorical phonetic features. We find evidence of categorical phonetic feature processing for attended, but not unattended speech. Furthermore, we find evidence that categorical phonetic feature processing is enhanced by attention, but acoustic processing is not. These findings add an important new layer in our understanding of how the human brain solves the cocktail party problem.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Feeling of Ownership over an Embodied Avatar's Hand Brings About Fast Changes of Fronto-Parietal Cortical Dynamics</a></h4>

              
                <p>When we look at our body parts, we are immediately aware that they belong to us and we rarely doubt about the integrity, continuity, and sense of ownership of our body. Despite this certainty, immersive virtual reality (IVR) may lead to a strong feeling of embodiment over an artificial body part seen from a first-person perspective (1PP). Although such feeling of ownership (FO) has been described in different situations, it is not yet understood how this phenomenon is generated at neural level. To track the real-time brain dynamics associated with FO, we delivered transcranial magnetic stimuli over the hand region in the primary motor cortex (M1) and simultaneously recorded electroencephalography (EEG) in 19 healthy volunteers (11 male/8 female) watching IVR renderings of anatomically plausible (full-limb) versus implausible (hand disconnected from the forearm) virtual limbs. Our data show that embodying a virtual hand is temporally associated with a rapid drop of cortical activity of the onlookers' hand region in the M1 contralateral to the observed hand. Spatiotemporal analysis shows that embodying the avatar's hand is also associated with fast changes of activity within an interconnected fronto-parietal circuit ipsilateral to the brain stimulation. Specifically, an immediate reduction of connectivity with the premotor area is paralleled by an enhancement in the connectivity with the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) which is related to the strength of ownership illusion ratings and thus likely reflects conscious feelings of embodiment. Our results suggest that changes of bodily representations are underpinned by a dynamic cross talk within a highly-plastic, fronto-parietal network.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Observing an avatar's body part from a first-person perspective (1PP) induces an illusory embodiment over it. What remains unknown are the cortical dynamics underpinning the embodiment of artificial agents. To shed light on the physiological mechanisms of embodiment we used a novel approach that combines noninvasive stimulation of the cortical motor-hand area and whole-scalp electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings in people observing an embodied artificial limb. We found that just before the illusion started, there is a decrease of activity of the motor-hand area accompanied by an increase of connectivity with the parietal region ipsilateral to the stimulation that reflects the ratings of the embodiment illusion. Our results suggest that changes of bodily representations are underpinned by a dynamic cross talk within a fronto-parietal circuit.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">GCH1 Deficiency Activates Brain Innate Immune Response and Impairs Tyrosine Hydroxylase Homeostasis</a></h4>

              
                <p>The Parkinson's disease (PD) risk gene GTP cyclohydrolase 1 (GCH1) catalyzes the rate-limiting step in tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) synthesis, an essential cofactor in the synthesis of monoaminergic neurotransmitters. To investigate the mechanisms by which GCH1 deficiency may contribute to PD, we generated a loss of function zebrafish <I>gch1</I> mutant (<I>gch1</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup>), using CRISPR/Cas technology. <I>gch1</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> zebrafish develop marked monoaminergic neurotransmitter deficiencies by 5 d postfertilization (dpf), movement deficits by 8 dpf and lethality by 12 dpf. Tyrosine hydroxylase (Th) protein levels were markedly reduced without loss of ascending dopaminergic (DAergic) neurons. L-DOPA treatment of <I>gch1</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> larvae improved survival without ameliorating the motor phenotype. RNAseq of <I>gch1</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> larval brain tissue identified highly upregulated transcripts involved in innate immune response. Subsequent experiments provided morphologic and functional evidence of microglial activation in <I>gch1</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup>. The results of our study suggest that GCH1 deficiency may unmask early, subclinical parkinsonism and only indirectly contribute to neuronal cell death via immune-mediated mechanisms. Our work highlights the importance of functional validation for genome-wide association studies (GWAS) risk factors and further emphasizes the important role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of PD.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Genome-wide association studies have now identified at least 90 genetic risk factors for sporadic Parkinson's disease (PD). Zebrafish are an ideal tool to determine the mechanistic role of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) risk genes in a vertebrate animal model. The discovery of GTP cyclohydrolase 1 (GCH1) as a genetic risk factor for PD was counterintuitive, GCH1 is the rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of dopamine (DA), mutations had previously been described in the non-neurodegenerative movement disorder dopa-responsive dystonia (DRD). Rather than causing DAergic cell death (as previously hypothesized by others), we now demonstrate that GCH1 impairs tyrosine hydroxylase (Th) homeostasis and activates innate immune mechanisms in the brain and provide evidence of microglial activation and phagocytic activity.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Students’ Satisfaction Of Online Learning In Oman [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Due to the development facilitated by modern technology, the world has become a small village with instantly changing methods of education. Online education has become an alternative method for course delivery used by colleges and universities globally.   Methods: The population of this study was N=564 students enrolled in asynchronous online learning at the College of Sharia Sciences in the Sultanate of Oman for the academic year 2020-2021. The survey instruments from “The Student Satisfaction Survey” developed by Strachota (2006) were utilized in this study. The survey included items in the following categories: demographics, learner instructor's interaction, learner-peer interaction, and lastly general satisfaction. The researcher reformulated the questions to suit the target group and some questions were changed to suit the target audience.  Results: Remarkably, the data show that there is no direct relationship between demographic factors and student satisfaction with asynchronous online learning. On the other hand, there is a strong and noticeable relationship between students' satisfaction with asynchronous online learning and student-instructor interaction. There is also a correlation between students' satisfaction with asynchronous online learning and student-peer interaction.   Conclusions: The students of the College of Sharia Sciences are on the whole very satisfied with asynchronous online learning; they consider it a very successful experience and recommend its use by students in other educational institutions.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The effect of betel habits on blood glucose levels in the Karo ethnic community, Karo district [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Betel is a hereditary tradition from the ancestors of the Batak-Karo tribe, Indonesia. Karo people believe that betel is their unifier. The betel process begins with concocting a mixture of ingredients such as betel leaf, lime, gambier, areca nut, and with/without tobacco addition, then chewed slowly. Our previous study showed that gambier extracts (Uncaria gambier Roxb), can reduce blood glucose levels (BGL) in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients. This study aimed to analyze whether the habit of chewing betel can affect BGL in the Karo ethnic community in the Karo district. Methods: In total, 48 participants from the Karo community were divided into 4 groups (n=12 per group), namely: I. non-T2DM participants without betel habits; II. non-T2DM participants with betel habit; III. T2DM participants without betel habit and IV. T2DM participants with betel habit. The sampling technique was consecutive sampling. Data were collected by interviews and blood sampling (fasted and 2 hours postprandial (2hPP)). The collected data were analyzed by ANOVA then post hoc Bonferroni with a significance level of p-value <0.05. Results: This study showed that fasting BGL had no difference in non-T2DM participants without betel habit (group-I) compared to non-T2DM participants with betel habit (group-II) (84.33±12.32 vs 81.00± 4,84), and T2DM participants without betel habit (group-III) compared to T2DM participants with betel habit (group-IV) (196.25± 104.81 vs 150.00 ± 42.45), p>0.05. On the other hand, there was a significant difference in BGL 2hPP in group T2DM participants with betel habit compared to all groups (p<0.05). T2DM participants without betel habit group had the highest BGL levels compared to other groups. Conclusions: This study concluded that the habit of chewing betel containing gambier is effective in restraining the rate of increase in blood glucose levels. Further research is needed to see the mechanism.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">AIME: Autoencoder-based integrative multi-omics data embedding that allows for confounder adjustments</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Tianwei Yu</p>

In the integrative analyses of omics data, it is often of interest to extract data representation from one data type that best reflect its relations with another data type. This task is traditionally fulfilled by linear methods such as canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and partial least squares (PLS). However, information contained in one data type pertaining to the other data type may be complex and in nonlinear form. Deep learning provides a convenient alternative to extract low-dimensional nonlinear data embedding. In addition, the deep learning setup can naturally incorporate the effects of clinical confounding factors into the integrative analysis. Here we report a deep learning setup, named Autoencoder-based Integrative Multi-omics data Embedding (AIME), to extract data representation for omics data integrative analysis. The method can adjust for confounder variables, achieve informative data embedding, rank features in terms of their contributions, and find pairs of features from the two data types that are related to each other through the data embedding. In simulation studies, the method was highly effective in the extraction of major contributing features between data types. Using two real microRNA-gene expression datasets, one with confounder variables and one without, we show that AIME excluded the influence of confounders, and extracted biologically plausible novel information. The R package based on Keras and the TensorFlow backend is available at https://github.com/tianwei-yu/AIME.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Machine learning-driven identification of drugs inhibiting cytochrome P450 2C9</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Elodie Goldwaser, Catherine Laurent, Nathalie Lagarde, Sylvie Fabrega, Laure Nay, Bruno O. Villoutreix, Christian Jelsch, Arnaud B. Nicot, Marie-Anne Loriot, Maria A. Miteva</p>

Cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP2C9) is a major drug-metabolizing enzyme that represents 20% of the hepatic CYPs and is responsible for the metabolism of 15% of drugs. A general concern in drug discovery is to avoid the inhibition of CYP leading to toxic drug accumulation and adverse drug–drug interactions. However, the prediction of CYP inhibition remains challenging due to its complexity. We developed an original machine learning approach for the prediction of drug-like molecules inhibiting CYP2C9. We created new predictive models by integrating CYP2C9 protein structure and dynamics knowledge, an original selection of physicochemical properties of CYP2C9 inhibitors, and machine learning modeling. We tested the machine learning models on publicly available data and demonstrated that our models successfully predicted CYP2C9 inhibitors with an accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of approximately 80%. We experimentally validated the developed approach and provided the first identification of the drugs vatalanib, piriqualone, ticagrelor and cloperidone as strong inhibitors of CYP2C9 with IC values <18 μM and sertindole, asapiprant, duvelisib and dasatinib as moderate inhibitors with IC50 values between 40 and 85 μM. Vatalanib was identified as the strongest inhibitor with an IC50 value of 0.067 μM. Metabolism assays allowed the characterization of specific metabolites of abemaciclib, cloperidone, vatalanib and tarafenacin produced by CYP2C9. The obtained results demonstrate that such a strategy could improve the prediction of drug-drug interactions in clinical practice and could be utilized to prioritize drug candidates in drug discovery pipelines.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Dose-dependent thresholds of dexamethasone destabilize CAR T-cell treatment efficacy</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Alexander B. Brummer, Xin Yang, Eric Ma, Margarita Gutova, Christine E. Brown, Russell C. Rockne</p>

Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy is potentially an effective targeted immunotherapy for glioblastoma, yet there is presently little known about the efficacy of CAR T-cell treatment when combined with the widely used anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressant glucocorticoid, dexamethasone. Here we present a mathematical model-based analysis of three patient-derived glioblastoma cell lines treated <i>in vitro</i> with CAR T-cells and dexamethasone. Advanced <i>in vitro</i> experimental cell killing assay technologies allow for highly resolved temporal dynamics of tumor cells treated with CAR T-cells and dexamethasone, making this a valuable model system for studying the rich dynamics of nonlinear biological processes with translational applications. We model the system as a nonautonomous, two-species predator-prey interaction of tumor cells and CAR T-cells, with explicit time-dependence in the clearance rate of dexamethasone. Using time as a bifurcation parameter, we show that (1) dexamethasone destabilizes coexistence equilibria between CAR T-cells and tumor cells in a dose-dependent manner and (2) as dexamethasone is cleared from the system, a stable coexistence equilibrium returns in the form of a Hopf bifurcation. With the model fit to experimental data, we demonstrate that high concentrations of dexamethasone antagonizes CAR T-cell efficacy by exhausting, or reducing the activity of CAR T-cells, and by promoting tumor cell growth. Finally, we identify a critical threshold in the ratio of CAR T-cell death to CAR T-cell proliferation rates that predicts eventual treatment success or failure that may be used to guide the dose and timing of CAR T-cell therapy in the presence of dexamethasone in patients.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Glial immune-related pathways mediate effects of closed head traumatic brain injury on behavior and lethality in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Bart van Alphen, Samuel Stewart, Marta Iwanaszko, Fangke Xu, Keyin Li, Sydney Rozenfeld, Anujaianthi Ramakrishnan, Taichi Q. Itoh, Shiju Sisobhan, Zuoheng Qin, Bridget C. Lear, Ravi Allada</p>

In traumatic brain injury (TBI), the initial injury phase is followed by a secondary phase that contributes to neurodegeneration, yet the mechanisms leading to neuropathology in vivo remain to be elucidated. To address this question, we developed a <i>Drosophila</i> head-specific model for TBI termed <i>Drosophila</i> Closed Head Injury (dCHI), where well-controlled, nonpenetrating strikes are delivered to the head of unanesthetized flies. This assay recapitulates many TBI phenotypes, including increased mortality, impaired motor control, fragmented sleep, and increased neuronal cell death. TBI results in significant changes in the transcriptome, including up-regulation of genes encoding antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). To test the in vivo functional role of these changes, we examined TBI-dependent behavior and lethality in mutants of the master immune regulator NF-κB, important for AMP induction, and found that while sleep and motor function effects were reduced, lethality effects were enhanced. Similarly, loss of most AMP classes also renders flies susceptible to lethal TBI effects. These studies validate a new <i>Drosophila</i> TBI model and identify immune pathways as in vivo mediators of TBI effects.

                Introduction: The impact of PM2.5 ambient air pollution exposure on morbimortality has been documented; however, for Latin American cities, there are no calculations of the economic burden. The objective of the study was to estimate the costs of attributable burden disease to PM2.5 ambient air pollution exposure in Medellín, Colombia. Methods: The costs were assessed using the cost-of-illness approach and the human capital approach, which include direct medical costs and indirect costs due to loss of productivity. To estimate the value of the lost years of production the salaries established in the Great Integrated Household Survey carried out in September 2016 by the National Administrative Department of Statistics of Colombia were used. The PYWL were calculated taking as a reference the 57 years to age of death for female and 62 years for male. For both, an alternative scenario was proposed to account for the cost of working years by changing the reference age to 80 years. Results: A total of 5540 potential years of working life lost due to premature deaths attributed to exposure to PM2.5 was calculated. The costs of attributable morbimortality to PM2.5 exposure in Medellín totaled 86,0 million dollars in baseline scenario and 281,2 million dollars in alternative scenario. Which represented 0.091% of the gross domestic product of Colombia and 0.627% of that from the Department of Antioquia. The highest percentage of the costs associated with the loss of productivity originated in the premature death of the population over 50 years of age, both due to chronic and acute events. Discussion: The costs of mortality represented 80% of the total. PM2.5 ambient air pollution exposure generates significant costs associated with the loss of years of working life, due to acute infections and chronic diseases of respiratory tract and ischemic heart diseases

                Background: Holter electrocardiogram (ECG) is the gold standard for ambulatory monitoring of atrial fibrillation (AF) but it is insufficient because of its limited recording time. A wearable ECG with a medical-grade dry textile electrode is a promising technology to remedy this limitation. This pilot study aimed to simultaneously compare the wearable and Holter ECGs for ambulatory monitoring in a clinical setting. Methods: This prospective observational study enrolled 18 patients who underwent AF ablation. One day after AF ablation, ambulatory ECG was obtained for three hours simultaneously using both the wearable and Holter ECG devices. Automatic ECG interpretations between devices were compared with correlation and agreement analyses. Results: Simultaneous ECG monitoring demonstrated a comparable analysis time and total heart beats between the two devices. Almost complete correlation and agreement were also demonstrated in all clinically relevant testing aspects except in R-wave amplitude (r = 0.743, p < .001). AF was detected in three patients. AF duration was the same in both ECG devices in two patients with continuous AF. In the remaining patient with intermittent AF, AF duration was shortened by 0.6% with the wearable ECG as compared to that with the Holter ECG. Conclusions: Simultaneous ECG comparison revealed a high consistency between the wearable and Holter ECG devices. The results of this study warrant further clinical studies for long-term monitoring of ambulatory ECG after AF ablation.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Sonification of weather data as a non-human-centric artistic approach [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background - In the mid-20th century, the emergence of sound studies demonstrated a shift of research interest in sonic practitioners. This field gains its prevalence by expanding the boundaries of prevailing conception through proposing alternative creative approaches in sound art practices. Methods – Two methods were presented – listening and sounding to promote creative sound making. The first method, listening involves soundwalking and recording sound from the external environments. These recordings were then re-evaluated and post-processed in audio editing software. The second method, sounding involves the creation of a weather data sonification system in Pure Data environment, in which the perceptual experience from the first method was taken into consideration. Result – First method enables the genesis of creative idiosyncrasies, such as preferences and ideas through the sonic perception of environmental events. In this process, noise and weather were identified as environmental components that share similar sensible qualities. Thus, noise is a prevalent medium that inspires the creation of sound generators in the sonification system presented in this paper. The sonic output of data sonification reveals an analogical connection between weather data and sonic parameters, in which changes in data values result in changes in acoustic properties. These outputs deliver different sensibilities based on their data parameters; sonification of temperature data might suggest an alarming effect to the listener. Conclusion – The proposed methods were intricately linked, suggesting environmental events to be perceived and realized through a non-scientific perspective. By highlighting aesthetic possibilities of environmental components, this paper presents an alternative perspective in contrast with the human-centric worldview through the creation of sonic works.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">‘The great publication race’ vs ‘abandon paper counting’: Benchmarking ECR publication and co-authorship rates over past 50 years to inform research evaluation [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Publication and co-authorship rates have been increasing over decades. In response, calls are being made to restrict the number of publications included in research evaluations. Yet there is little evidence to guide publication expectations and inform research evaluation for early career researchers (ECRs). Methods: Here we examine the early career publication and co-authorship records between 1970 and 2019 of >140,000 authors of 2.8 million publications, to identify how publication and co-authorship rates have changed over the last 50 years. This examination is conducted in order to develop benchmarks of median publication rates for sensibly evaluating ECR research productivity, and to explore success in meeting these benchmarks with different co-authorship strategies using regression models. Results: Publication rates of multidisciplinary ECRs publishing in Nature, Science and PNAS have increased by 46% over the last 50 years and that publications rates in a set of disciplinary journals have increased by 105%. Co-authorship rates have increased even more, particularly for the multidisciplinary sample which now has 572% more co-authors per publication. Benchmarks based on median publication rates for all authors increased from one publication per year at the start of a career, to four publications per year after 10 years of publishing, and one first-author publication across all years. The probability of meeting these benchmarks increases when authors publish with different co-authors, and first authorship rates decrease for ECRs with many co-authors per publication. Conclusion: This evidence could be used to inform sensible publishing expectations for ECRs and the institutions they work for, and to inform calls to limit the number of publications produced by researchers and those used in research evaluations.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Personality typologies of smokers and excessive drinkers: a cross-sectional survey of respondents in the BBC Lab UK Study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Several personality traits have been linked to addictive behaviours, including smoking and excessive drinking. We hypothesised that the combination of low conscientiousness, high extraversion and high neuroticism would be synergistically associated with smoking, excessive drinking and both behaviours combined. Methods: Respondents aged 16+ years (N=363,454) were surveyed between 2009-2013 as part of the BBC Lab UK Study, with no restrictions on geographical location. Respondents provided information about sociodemographic characteristics, personality traits, and smoking and alcohol consumption. A series of multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted. Results: No significant three-way but significant two-way interactive effects were observed. The association of high extraversion with smoking was more pronounced in those with high (vs. low) conscientiousness (ORadj=1.51, 95% CI=1.46, 1.56, p<.001; ORadj=1.38, 95% CI=1.35, 1.42, p<.001). The association of high extraversion with excessive drinking was more pronounced in those with low (vs. high) conscientiousness (ORadj=1.70, 95% CI=1.67, 1.74, p<.001; ORadj=1.60, 95% CI=1.56, 1.63, p<.001). The association of high extraversion with both behaviours combined was more pronounced in those with high (vs. low) conscientiousness (ORadj=1.74, 95% CI=1.65, 1.83, p<.001; ORadj=1.62, 95% CI= 1.56, 1.68, p<.001). Results remained largely robust in sensitivity analyses. Conclusions: In a large international survey, we identified two-way ‘personality typologies’ that are associated with greater odds of smoking, excessive drinking and both behaviours combined. The results may be useful for the tailoring of behaviour change interventions to at-risk individuals.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Parkinson Disease and Subthalamic Nucleus Deep Brain Stimulation: Cognitive Effects in GBA Mutation Carriers</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>This study was undertaken to compare the rate of change in cognition between glucocerebrosidase (<i>GBA</i>) mutation carriers and noncarriers with and without subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) in Parkinson disease.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Clinical and genetic data from 12 datasets were examined. Global cognition was assessed using the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale (MDRS). Subjects were examined for mutations in <i>GBA</i> and categorized as <i>GBA</i> carriers with or without DBS (<i>GBA</i>+DBS+, <i>GBA</i>+DBS-), and noncarriers with or without DBS (<i>GBA</i>-DBS+, <i>GBA</i>-DBS-). <i>GBA</i> mutation carriers were subcategorized according to mutation severity (risk variant, mild, severe). Linear mixed modeling was used to compare rate of change in MDRS scores over time among the groups according to <i>GBA</i> and DBS status and then according to <i>GBA</i> severity and DBS status.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Data were available for 366 subjects (58 <i>GBA</i>+DBS+, 82 <i>GBA</i>+DBS-, 98 <i>GBA</i>-DBS+, and 128 <i>GBA</i>-DBS- subjects), who were longitudinally followed (range = 36–60 months after surgery). Using the MDRS, <i>GBA</i>+DBS+ subjects declined on average 2.02 points/yr more than <i>GBA</i>-DBS- subjects (95% confidence interval [CI] = −2.35 to −1.69), 1.71 points/yr more than <i>GBA</i>+DBS- subjects (95% CI = −2.14 to −1.28), and 1.49 points/yr more than <i>GBA</i>-DBS+ subjects (95% CI = −1.80 to −1.18).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Although not randomized, this composite analysis suggests that the combined effects of <i>GBA</i> mutations and STN-DBS negatively impact cognition. We advise that DBS candidates be screened for <i>GBA</i> mutations as part of the presurgical decision-making process. We advise that <i>GBA</i> mutation carriers be counseled regarding potential risks associated with STN-DBS so that alternative options may be considered. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

                How do brains represent multiple tasks? The authors use artificial neural networks to derive a computational theory of neural coding and validate its predictions in recordings of human and macaque brains. The findings suggest that task-specific information is represented along orthogonal coding axes, which minimizes interference and maximizes robustness to noise.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Predicting bacterial promoter function and evolution from random sequences</a></h4>

              
                Predicting function from sequence is a central problem of biology. Currently, this is possible only locally in a narrow mutational neighborhood around a wildtype sequence rather than globally from any sequence. Using random mutant libraries, we developed a biophysical model that accounts for multiple features of σ<sup>70</sup> binding bacterial promoters to predict constitutive gene expression levels from any sequence. We experimentally and theoretically estimated that 10–20% of random sequences lead to expression and ~80% of non-expressing sequences are one mutation away from a functional promoter. The potential for generating expression from random sequences is so pervasive that selection acts against σ<sup>70</sup>-RNA polymerase binding sites even within inter-genic, promoter-containing regions. This pervasiveness of σ<sup>70</sup>-binding sites implies that emergence of promoters is not the limiting step in gene regulatory evolution. Ultimately, the inclusion of novel features of promoter function into a mechanistic model enabled not only more accurate predictions of gene expression levels, but also identified that promoters evolve more rapidly than previously thought.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Simultaneous brain, brainstem and spinal cord pharmacological-fMRI reveals involvement of an endogenous opioid network in attentional analgesia</a></h4>

              
                Pain perception is decreased by shifting attentional focus away from a threatening event. This attentional analgesia engages parallel descending control pathways from anterior cingulate (ACC) to locus coeruleus, and ACC to periaqueductal grey (PAG) - rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM), indicating possible roles for noradrenergic or opioidergic neuromodulators. To determine which pathway modulates nociceptive activity in humans we used simultaneous whole brain-spinal cord pharmacological-fMRI (N=39) across three sessions. Noxious thermal forearm stimulation generated somatotopic-activation of dorsal horn (DH) whose activity correlated with pain report and mirrored attentional pain modulation. Activity in an adjacent cluster reported the interaction between task and noxious stimulus. Effective connectivity analysis revealed that ACC interacts with PAG and RVM to modulate spinal cord activity. Blocking endogenous opioids with Naltrexone impairs attentional analgesia and disrupts RVM-spinal and ACC-PAG connectivity. Noradrenergic augmentation with Reboxetine did not alter attentional analgesia. Cognitive pain modulation involves opioidergic ACC-PAG-RVM descending control which suppresses spinal nociceptive activity.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Juxtacellular opto-tagging of hippocampal CA1 neurons in freely moving mice</a></h4>

              
                Neural circuits are made of a vast diversity of neuronal cell types. While immense progress has been made in classifying neurons based on morphological, molecular, and functional properties, understanding how this heterogeneity contributes to brain function during natural behavior has remained largely unresolved. In the present study, we combined the juxtacellular recording and labeling technique with optogenetics in freely moving mice. This allowed us to selectively target molecularly defined cell classes for in vivo single-cell recordings and morphological analysis. We validated this strategy in the CA1 region of the mouse hippocampus by restricting Channelrhodopsin expression to Calbindin-positive neurons. Directly versus indirectly light-activated neurons could be readily distinguished based on the latencies of light-evoked spikes, with juxtacellular labeling and post hoc histological analysis providing ‘ground-truth’ validation. Using these opto-juxtacellular procedures in freely moving mice, we found that Calbindin-positive CA1 pyramidal cells were weakly spatially modulated and conveyed less spatial information than Calbindin-negative neurons – pointing to pyramidal cell identity as a key determinant for neuronal recruitment into the hippocampal spatial map. Thus, our method complements current in vivo techniques by enabling optogenetic-assisted structure–function analysis of single neurons recorded during natural, unrestrained behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Clp protease and antisense RNA jointly regulate the global regulator CarD to mediate mycobacterial starvation response</a></h4>

              
                Under starvation conditions, bacteria tend to slow down their translation rate by reducing rRNA synthesis, but the way they accomplish that may vary in different bacteria. In <i>Mycobacterium</i> species, transcription of rRNA is activated by the RNA polymerase (RNAP) accessory transcription factor CarD, which interacts directly with RNAP to stabilize the RNAP-promoter open complex formed on rRNA genes. The functions of CarD have been extensively studied, but the mechanisms that control its expression remain obscure. Here, we report that the level of CarD was tightly regulated when mycobacterial cells switched from nutrient-rich to nutrient-deprived conditions. At the translational level, an antisense RNA of <i>carD</i> (AscarD) was induced in a SigF-dependent manner to bind with <i>carD</i> mRNA and inhibit CarD translation, while at the post-translational level, the residual intracellular CarD was quickly degraded by the Clp protease. AscarD thus worked synergistically with Clp protease to decrease the CarD level to help mycobacterial cells cope with the nutritional stress. Altogether, our work elucidates the regulation mode of CarD and delineates a new mechanism for the mycobacterial starvation response, which is important for the adaptation and persistence of mycobacterial pathogens in the host environment.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Binocular visual experience and sleep promote visual cortex plasticity and restore binocular vision in a mouse model of amblyopia</a></h4>

              
                Amblyopia arises from an altered balance of input from the two eyes to the binocular zone of primary visual cortex (bV1) during childhood, causing long-lasting visual impairment. Amblyopia is commonly treated by patching the dominant eye, however, the relative impacts of monocular vs. binocular visual experiences on restoration of bV1 function remains unclear. Moreover, while sleep has been implicated in V1 plasticity in response to vision loss, its role in recovery from amblyopia is unknown. We used monocular deprivation (MD) in juvenile mice to model amblyopia in bV1. We compared recovery of visual responses for the two eyes among bV1 regular spiking (RS, putative principal) neurons and fast-spiking (FS, putative parvalbumin-expressing [PV+]) interneurons after identical-duration, identical-quality binocular recovery (BR) or monocular, reverse occlusion (RO) experiences. We find that BR is quantitatively superior to RO with respect to renormalizing both bV1 populations visual responses. However, this recovery was seen only in freely-sleeping mice; post-BR sleep deprivation prevented functional recovery. Thus, both binocular visual experience and subsequent sleep are required to optimally renormalize bV1 responses in a mouse model of amblyopia.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Abnormal CCK/CB1R axon targeting in mouse models of dystroglycanopathy</a></h4>

              
                Dystroglycan (Dag1) is a cell adhesion molecule that links the extracellular matrix to the actin cytoskeleton, and is critical for normal muscle and brain development. Mutations in Dag1 or the genes required for its functional glycosylation result in dystroglycanopathy, which is characterized by a wide range of phenotypes including muscle weakness, brain defects, and cognitive impairments. Whereas Dystroglycans role in muscle and early brain development are well defined, much less is known about its role at later stages of neural circuit development including synapse formation and refinement. Recent work has found that selective deletion of Dag1 from pyramidal neurons leads to a loss of presynaptic CCK+ inhibitory neurons (INs) early in development. In this study, we investigated how IN development is affected in multiple mouse models of dystroglycanopathy. Widespread forebrain deletion of Dag1 or Pomt2, which is required for Dystroglycan glycosylation, recapitulates brain phenotypes seen in severe forms of dystroglycanopathy. CCK+ INs were present in Dag1 and Pomt2 mutant mice, but their axons failed to properly target the somatodendritic compartment of pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus. In contrast, CCK+ IN axon targeting was largely normal in mouse models of mild dystroglycanopathy with partially reduced Dystroglycan glycosylation (B4Gat1,Fkrp). Furthermore, the intracellular domain of Dystroglycan appears to be dispensable for CCK+ IN axon targeting. Collectively, these data show that synaptic defects are a hallmark of severe dystroglycanopathy.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cognitive Deficits and Altered Cholinergic Innervation in Young Adult Mice Carrying a Parkinson's Disease LRRK2-G2019S Knockin Mutation</a></h4>

              
                Impaired executive function is a common and debilitating non-motor symptom of idiopathic and hereditary Parkinson's disease (PD), but there is little understanding of the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms and circuits. The G2019S mutation in the kinase domain of leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) greatly increases risk for late-onset PD, and non-manifesting LRRK2-G2019S carriers also exhibit early and significant cognitive impairment. Here, we subjected young adult mice carrying a Lrrk2-G2019S knockin mutation to touchscreen-based operant tasks that measure attention, goal-directed learning and cognitive flexibility, all of which rely on prefrontal-striatal connectivity and are strongly modulated by cholinergic innervation. In a visuospatial attention task, mutant mice exhibited significantly more omissions and longer response latencies than controls that could not be attributed to deficits in motivation, visual sensory perception per se or locomotion, thereby suggesting impairment in divided attention and slower information processing speed. Pretreating mice with the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor donepezil normalized both higher omission rates and longer reward latencies in the mutants, but did not affect any performance metric in controls. Strikingly, cholinergic fiber density in mPFC and dorsomedial striatum was significantly sparser in mutants than in controls, while further behavioral interrogation of the mutants revealed significant impairments in action-outcome associations but preserved cognitive flexibility. These data suggest that the G2019S mutation impacts cholinergic innervation and impairs corticostriatal network function in young adulthood that may contribute to early PD-associated cognitive deficits.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">CGRP Administration into the Cerebellum Evokes Migraine-like Behaviors Predominately in Female Mice</a></h4>

              
                The neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is a major player in migraine pathophysiology. Previous preclinical studies demonstrated that intracerebroventricular administration of CGRP caused migraine-like behaviors in mice, but the sites of action in the brain remain unidentified. The cerebellum has the most CGRP binding sites in the central nervous system and is increasingly recognized as both a sensory and motor integration center. The objective of this study was to test whether the cerebellum, particularly the medial cerebellar nuclei (MN), might be a site of CGRP action. In this study, CGRP was directly injected into the right MN of C57BL/6J mice via a cannula. A battery of behavioral tests was done to assess migraine-like behaviors. CGRP caused light aversion measured as decreased time in the light zone even with dim light. The mice also spent more time resting in the dark zone, but not the light, along with decreased rearing and transitions between zones. These behaviors were similar for both sexes. In contrast, significant responses to CGRP were seen only with female mice in the open field assay, von Frey test, and automated squint assay, indicating anxiety, tactile hypersensitivity, and spontaneous pain, respectively. In male mice, the responses had the same trend as females but did not reach statistical significance. No detectable effect of CGRP on gait was observed in either sex. These results suggest that CGRP in the MN causes light aversion in males, while in females, light aversion is accompanied by increased anxiety, tactile hypersensitivity, and spontaneous pain. A caveat is that we cannot exclude contributions from other cerebellar regions in addition to the MN due to diffusion of the injected peptide. These results reveal the cerebellum as a new site of CGRP actions that may contribute to migraine pathophysiology and possibly its prevalence in females.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">No evidence from complementary data sources of a direct projection from the mouse anterior cingulate area to the hippocampal formation</a></h4>

              
                The connectivity and interplay between the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus underpin a number of key cognitive processes, with changes in these interactions being implicated in both neurodevelopmental as well as neurodegenerative conditions. Understanding the precise cellular connections through which this circuit is organised is, therefore, vital for understanding these same processes. Overturning earlier findings, a recent study described a novel excitatory projection from anterior cingulate cortex to hippocampus. We sought to validate this unexpected finding using multiple, complementary methods: anterograde and retrograde anatomical tracing, using both anterograde and retrograde AAVs and monosynaptic rabies tracing. Additionally, an extensive data search of the Allen Projection Brain Atlas database was conducted to find the stated projection within any of the deposited anatomical studies, as an independent verification of our own results. However, we failed to find any evidence of a direct, monosynaptic projection from mouse anterior cingulate cortex to the hippocampus proper.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The role of the orbitofrontal cortex in creating cognitive maps</a></h4>

              
                We use internal models of the external world to guide behavior, but little is known about how these cognitive maps are created. The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is typically thought to access these maps to support model-based decision-making, but it has recently been proposed that its critical contribution may be instead to integrate information into existing and new models. We tested between these alternatives using an outcome-specific devaluation task and a high-potency chemogenetic approach. We found that selectively inactivating OFC principal neurons when rats learned distinct cue-outcome associations, but prior to outcome devaluation, disrupted subsequent model-based inference, confirming that the OFC is critical for creating new cognitive maps. However, OFC inactivation surprisingly led to generalized devaluation. Using a novel reinforcement learning framework, we demonstrate that this effect is best explained not by a switch to a model-free system, as would be traditionally assumed, but rather by a circumscribed deficit in defining credit assignment precision during model construction. We conclude that the critical contribution of the OFC to learning is regulating the specificity of associations that comprise cognitive maps.

	<p>Stroke is one of the leading causes of human disability globally. Motor function deficits resulting from a stroke affect the entire body, but relatively often it is the upper limbs that remain ineffective, which is very limiting in everyday life activities. The finding in neurorehabilitation that trunk control contributes to upper limb function is relatively common but has not been confirmed in clinical trials. This observational prospective study aims to analyze the effect of the position of the trunk and the affected upper limb on the coordination and grip strength of the affected dominant and non-dominant hand and wrist in people after ischemic stroke. The research was carried out at the Department of Neurological Rehabilitation, on a group of 60 patients with acute ischemic stroke. A Hand Tutor device and a hand dynamometer were used for the main measurements of the motor coordination parameters (maximum range of motion, frequency of movement) and the grip strength of the dominant and non-dominant upper limb. The patients were examined in two positions: sitting without back support and lying on the back with stabilization of the upper limb. Higher and relevant results were observed in the non-dominant hand, in the supine position in terms of motor coordination parameters of the fingers (p = 0.019; p = 0.011) and wrist (p = 0.033), and grip strength (p = 0.017). Conclusions: The laying position and stabilization of the affected upper limb in the acute phase following ischemic stroke is more beneficial for the coordination of movements and grip strength of the non-dominant hand.</p>

	<p>Background: The study provides real-world data on the impact of Huntington&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (HD) from the perspective of individuals with HD (IHD) and care partners (HD-CP) and contextualizes these results relative to Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) and the general population (GP). Methods: Cross-sectional survey of IHD and HD-CP in the US (July 2019&amp;amp;ndash;August 2019) conducted using the Rare Patient Voice panel. Data for individuals with Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s Disease (IPD), the general population (GP), and respective care partners (PD-CP; GP-CP) came from the 2018 US National Health and Wellness Survey. Outcomes included demographics, mental health, clinical characteristics, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Results: IHD had greater comorbid anxiety (IHD = 51.2%, IPD = 28.8%, GP = 2.0%), and HD-CP had greater comorbid anxiety (HD-CP = 52.5%, PD-CP = 28.6%, GP-CP = 19.6%) and depression (HD-CP = 65.0%, PD-CP = 29.9%, GP-CP = 19.6%), relative to other cohorts (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). Respective of their GP cohorts, IHD exhibited lower HRQoL (EQ-5D: 0.66 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.21 vs. 0.81 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.17) and greater depression (PHQ-9: 11.59 &amp;amp;plusmn; 7.20 vs. 5.85 &amp;amp;plusmn; 6.71), whereas HD-CP exhibited greater depression only (PHQ-9: 6.84 &amp;amp;plusmn; 6.38 vs. 4.15 &amp;amp;plusmn; 5.58) (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). No differences were observed between HD/HD-CP and PD/PD-CP cohorts on PHQ-9 or HRQoL. Conclusions: HD has a significant burden on patients and care partners, which is higher than GP. Notably, anxiety and depression were greater among HD vs. PD, despite similar HRQoL.</p>

	<p>Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is caused by the rupture of blood vessels in the brain. The excessive activation of glial cells and the infiltration of numerous inflammatory cells are observed during bleeding. Thrombin is a key molecule that triggers neuroinflammation in the ICH brain. In this study, we focused on lipoxin A4 (LXA4), an arachidonic acid metabolite that has been reported to suppress inflammation and cell migration. LXA4 and BML-111, an agonist of the LXA4 receptor/formyl peptide receptor 2 (ALX/FPR2), suppressed microglial activation; LXA4 strongly inhibited the migration of neutrophil-like cells in vitro. ALX/FPR2 was expressed on neutrophils in the ICH mouse brain and the daily administration of BML-111 attenuated the motor coordination dysfunction and suppressed the production of proinflammatory cytokines in the ICH mouse brain. On the other hand, BML-111 did not show a significant reduction in the number of microglia and neutrophils. These results suggest that systemic administration of ALX/FPR2 agonists may suppress the neuroinflammatory response of microglia and neutrophils without a change in cell numbers. Additionally, their combination with molecules that reduce cell numbers, such as modulators of leukotriene B4 signaling, may be required in future studies.</p>

	<p>Infection can be a common complication following bifrontal craniotomy with skull base osteotomies given the potential violation of sinuses and entry into the nasal structures. Our objective was to examine our series of patients who underwent a bifrontal craniotomy with skull base osteotomies and describe the infection rate. We propose the bifrontal osteoplastic flap as an adjunct to infection prevention. A retrospective single-center study of a patient database was performed. Twenty patients were identified. Fifty-five percent were male. The mean age was 55.7 &amp;amp;plusmn; 13.9 years. The most common indications for surgery were esthesioneuroblastomas (35%) and anterior skull base meningiomas (30%). Six patients (30%) developed an infection, 1 patient (5%) developed a CSF leak, and no patients developed a mucocele. All 6 infected cases had nasal pathology with intracranial extension, they all received chemoradiation post-operatively and were all combined cases with otorhinolaryngology. Eighty-three percent of these patients required a craniectomy and all of them required long-term IV antibiotics. Infection is not uncommon after a bifrontal craniotomy with skull base osteotomies and the use of the bifrontal osteoplastic flap in cases where the risk of infection is high, i.e., esthesioneuroblastomas surgery, may help reduce said risk and lead to better patient outcomes.</p>

	<p>Background: Whether gender differences exist in late-onset of Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (LOAD) treated with cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs) is not fully understood. This study investigated demographic and pharmacological characteristics in LOAD patients to determine gender differences in LOAD patients treated with ChEIs alone and ChEIs with other medications. Methods: This 5-year retrospective data analysis included 9290 LOAD AD patients with 2949 men patients and 6341 women. Potential predictors of demographic and pharmacological characteristics associated gender differences in patients treated with and without ChEIs therapy were determined using univariate analysis, while multivariable models adjusted for demographic and pharmacological variables. Results: In the adjusted analysis, men patients with LOAD that presented with a history of alcohol use (ETOH) (OR = 1.339, 95% CI, 1.072&amp;amp;ndash;1.672, p = 0.010), treated with second generation antipsychotics (SGAs) (OR = 1.271, 95% CI, 1.003&amp;amp;ndash;1.610, p = 0.047), citalopram (OR = 5.103, 95% CI, 3.423&amp;amp;ndash;7.607, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), memantine (OR = 4.409, 95% CI, 3.704&amp;amp;ndash;5.249, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), and buspirone (OR = 2.166, 95% CI, 1.437&amp;amp;ndash;3.264, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) were more likely to receive ChEIs therapy, whereas older men were less likely to be treated with ChEIs therapy. Women who were African Americans (OR = 1.387, 95% CI, 1.168&amp;amp;ndash;1.647, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), that received memantine (OR = 3.412, 95% CI, 3.034&amp;amp;ndash;3.837, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRIs) (OR = 1.143, 95% CI, 1.016&amp;amp;ndash;1.287, p = 0.026), and a history of ETOH (OR = 2.109, 95% CI, 1.724&amp;amp;ndash;2.580, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) were more likely to receive ChEIs therapy, whereas older women were less likely to receive ChEIs therapy. Conclusion: In both men and women patients, those with increasing age were less likely to be treated with ChEI therapy, while patients treated with memantine were also likely to receive ChEI therapy. Our findings highlight the importance for clinicians to optimize ChEI in LOAD to improve treatment effectiveness and eliminate gender differences in ChEI therapy.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Mechanism of miR-132-3p Promoting Neuroinflammation and Dopaminergic Neurodegeneration in Parkinsons Disease</a></h4>

              
                <p>The major pathology in Parkinson&rsquo;s disease (PD) is neuron injury induced by degeneration of dopaminergic neurons and the activation of microglial cells. The objective of this study is to determine the effect and mechanism of miR-132-3p in regulating neuroinflammation and the degeneration of dopaminergic neuron in PD. The expressions of miR-132-3p in brain tissues of PD patients, lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced BV-2 cells and 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD mouse models were detected. The effect of miR-132-3p and GLRX in cell viability, apoptosis and inflammation was verified in BV-2 cells. The activation of Iba1 in substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) and the loss of tyrosine hydroxylase were detected in PD mouse models and the mobility of mouse models was assessed as well. The targeting relationship between miR-132-3p and GLRX was confirmed by RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) and dual luciferase reporter gene assay. Elevated expression of miR-132-3p and decreased expression of GLRX were found in PD patients and cells models. Overexpression of miR-132-3p can induce activation of microglial cells, which can be reversed by GLRX overexpression. Collected evidence in both cell model and mouse models showed the effect of miR-132-3p in enhancing the activation of microglial cells and the loss of microglia cells, which was achieved by mediating GLRX.</p>

                Mass spectrometry imaging is a promising tool complement to the histology study for evaluation of presence of different tissue types in the sample. To make this method faster, more accurate and precise we have presented earlier the cosine similarity measure maps (CSMM). The method provides the spatial distribution of cosine similarity measure metrics between chosen MSI pixel and the rest of the image. In cases when samples under test are heterogeneous and not guaranteed to have clear clusters with distinct borders, it is interesting to analyze the heterogeneity, area borders and their sensitivity to reference CSMM pixel selection. Here we present the software for interactive building of CSMM for different parameters, their visual analysis and saving such CSMM in publication-ready quality without additional programming. Source code, example datasets, binaries, and other information are available at https://github.com/EvgenyZhvansky/Interactive_CSMM.

                Cow's milk is currently the most consumed product worldwide. However, due to various direct and indirect contamination sources, different chemical and microbiological contaminants have been found in cow's milk. This review details the main contaminants found in cow's milk, referring to the sources of contamination and their impact on human health. A comparative approach highlights the poor efficacy and effects of the pasteurization process with other methods used in the treatment of cow's milk. Despite pasteurization and related techniques being the most widely applied to date, they have not demonstrated efficacy in eliminating contaminants. New technologies have appeared as alternative treatments to pasteurization. However, in addition to causing physicochemical changes in the raw material, their efficacy is not total in eliminating chemical contaminants, suggesting the need for new research to find a solution that contributes to improving food safety.

     alt="High associative neuron numbers could drive cognitive performance in corvid species"/>
<p>Corvids possess cognitive skills, matching those of nonhuman primates. Here we investigated the number of neurons and their distribution over six telencephalic areas in three corvid and three non-corvid species to check, if higher amounts of neurons in associative areas could drive cognitive performance in corvids. Indeed, neuron numbers in the associative mesopallium and nidopallium were twice as high in corvids in comparison to non-corvids possibly contributing to cognitive flexibility and complexity in these species.

</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Corvids possess cognitive skills, matching those of nonhuman primates. However, how these species with their small brains achieve such feats remains elusive. Recent studies suggest that cognitive capabilities could be based on the total numbers of telencephalic neurons. Here we extend this hypothesis further and posit that especially high neuron counts in associative pallial areas drive flexible, complex cognition. If true, avian species like corvids should specifically accumulate neurons in the avian associative areas meso- and nidopallium. To test the hypothesis, we analyzed the neuronal composition of telencephalic areas in corvids and noncorvids (chicken, pigeons, and ostriches—the species with the largest bird brain). The overall number of pallial neurons in corvids was much higher than in chicken and pigeons and comparable to those of ostriches. However, neuron numbers in the associative mesopallium and nidopallium were twice as high in corvids and, in correlation with these associative areas, the corvid subpallium also contained high neuron numbers. These findings support our hypothesis that large absolute numbers of associative pallial neurons contribute to cognitive flexibility and complexity and are key to explain why crows are smart. Since meso-/nidopallial and subpallial areas scale jointly, it is conceivable that associative pallio-striatal loops play a similar role in executive decision making as described in primates.</p>

     alt="Neural organization of the third optic neuropil, the lobula, in the highly visual semiterrestrial crab Neohelice granulata"/>
<p>The manuscript presents a detailed description, derived from Golgi-impregnated preparations, of the layered organization and the small columnar elements that compose the third optic neuropil, the lobula of a semiterrestrial crab.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The visual neuropils (lamina, medulla, and lobula complex) of malacostracan crustaceans and hexapods have many organizational principles, cell types, and functional properties in common. Information about the cellular elements that compose the crustacean lobula is scarce especially when focusing on small columnar cells. Semiterrestrial crabs possess a highly developed visual system and display conspicuous visually guided behaviors. In particular, <i>Neohelice granulata</i> has been previously used to describe the cellular components of the first two optic neuropils using Golgi impregnation technique. Here, we present a comprehensive description of individual elements composing the third optic neuropil, the lobula, of that same species. We characterized a wide variety of elements (140 types) including input terminals and lobula columnar, centrifugal, and input columnar elements. Results reveal a very dense and complex neuropil. We found a frequently impregnated input element (suggesting a supernumerary cartridge representation) that arborizes in the third layer of the lobula and that presents four variants each with ramifications organized following one of the four cardinal axes suggesting a role in directional processing. We also describe input elements with two neurites branching in the third layer, probably connecting with the medulla and lobula plate. These facts suggest that this layer is involved in the directional motion detection pathway in crabs. We analyze and discuss our findings considering the similarities and differences found between the layered organization and components of this crustacean lobula and the lobula of insects.</p>

                Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) requires mass immunization to control the symptoms and global spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Data from developed countries reported a high prevalence of parental COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. However, parental vaccine hesitancy data in countries with low and middle income are scarce. The goal of this study was to assess the prevalence of parental vaccine hesitancy and identify subgroups with higher odds of vaccine hesitancy. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted on parents of children aged <18 years from October 10, 2021, to October 31, 2021. Parents aged ≥18 years underwent face-to-face interviews in randomly selected places in Bangladesh using a vaccine hesitancy questionnaire. Predictors were identified using binary logistic regression analysis. Results: Data from 2633 eligible parents were analyzed. Overall, 42.8% reported COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy for their youngest child. The final model suggested that children's age, parent's age, religion, occupation, monthly household income, permanent address, living location, the status of tobacco use, adherence with the regular government vaccination programs (other than COVID-19), perception about COVID-19 vaccine efficacy among Bangladeshi children, self-vaccination intention, report about family members' illness or death from COVID-19, and perceived COVID-19 threat were the independent predictors of parental vaccine hesitancy. Conclusions: Vaccine hesitation varied based on sociodemographic characteristics, religion, behavior, and perceived COVID-19 threat. Therefore, interventions focused on addressing vaccine hesitancy among subgroups are warranted.

Although these therapies often result in remarkable improvements in infants and children, benefits in adults are modest and treatment is not curative. Concerns have been raised about the enormous costs of these medications, the ultimate burden to taxpayers, and the costs to society of withholding treatments and sacrificing or disadvantaging some individuals.

The new normal era has exposed many people to subscribe to what they could afford based on length of time and limited resources. Unexpected daily economic challenges emerged, and people relocated to affordable places which led to rent default, rent arrears, and refund requests. This paper focused on how to solve rent default, rent arrears, and refund request problems in the public and private housing sector. Methods: Relying on this, we proposed recursive-adaptive rental subscription models (R-ARSM) that could allow tenants options to subscribe for house rent with available resources. The R-ARSM concept mimics the internet subscription, mobile phone subscription, and satellite television subscription models whereby services to customers on annually, monthly, weekly, daily, and hourly rates are terminated when the subscribed amount elapses. Results: The model based on the penalty constant showed that it is a balanced model for both landlords and tenants in the housing sector. The R-ARSM showed promising results, it is time-dependent and indicates the tenant's available balance per period. Conclusions: The analysis revealed that the R-ARSM concept would solve refund requests and rent default problems if implemented.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10969861/most-recent">Cross‐hierarchical plasticity of corticofugal projections to dLGN after neonatal monocular enucleation</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Perception is the result of interactions between the sensory periphery, thalamus, and cerebral cortex. Inputs from the retina project to the first-order dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN), which projects to the primary visual cortex (V1). In return, the cortex innervates the thalamus. While layer 6 projections innervate all thalamic nuclei, cortical layer 5 neurons selectively project to the higher-order lateral posterior nucleus (LP) and not to dLGN. It has been demonstrated that a subpopulation of layer 5 (Rbp4-Cre+) projections rewires to dLGN after monocular (Grant et al., 2016) or binocular enucleation (Frangeul et al., 2016) in young postnatal mice. However, the exact cortical regional origin of these projections was not fully determined, and it remained unclear whether these changes persisted into adulthood. In this study, we report gene expression changes observed in the dLGN after monocular enucleation at birth using microarray, qPCR at P6 and in situ hybridisation at P8. We report that genes that are normally enriched in dLGN, but not LP during development are preferentially downregulated in dLGN following monocular enucleation. Comparisons with developmental gene expression patters in dLGN suggest more immature and delayed gene expression in enucleated dLGN. Combined tracing and immuno-histochemical analysis revealed that the induced layer 5 fibres that innervate enucleated dLGN originate from putative primary visual cortex and they retain increased VGluT1+ synapse formation into adulthood. Our results indicate a new form of plasticity when layer 5 driver input takes over the innervation of an originally first order thalamic nucleus after early sensory deficit.</p>

Lutas et al. find that dopamine-triggered molecular signals in amygdala facilitate learning of the motivational salience of stimuli. Dopamine release weakens when salient events occur in rapid succession, limiting molecular signaling in amygdala neurons.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Disrupted autophagy and neuronal dysfunction in C. elegans knockin models of FUS amyotrophic lateral sclerosis</a></h4>

              
                Baskoylu et al. generate C. elegans ALS knockin models for FUS and find impaired autophagy in neurons and muscles. Stress drives accumulation of the C. elegans SQSTM1/p62 ortholog in motor neurons. Loss of this protein suppresses neuromuscular and locomotion defects but does not suppress neuronal autophagy defects.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Selective autophagy controls innate immune response through a TAK1/TAB2/SH3PX1 axis</a></h4>

              
                Tsapras et al. perform a yeast-two-hybrid screen to identify Atg8a-interacting proteins in Drosophila. They show that Atg8a interacts with TAK1 via an LIR motif. Atg8a also interacts with TAB2. TAB2 interacts with SH3PX1. Selective autophagic degradation of TAK1/TAB2 complex is fine-tuned by SH3PX1 to control innate immune responses.

                Li et al. show that HBV can stimulate macrophages to undergo M1- or M2-like polarization and reprogram mitochondrial metabolism. Both M1- and M2-like macrophages can suppress HBV gene expression and viral replication, with the former exhibiting a stronger effect, by releasing IL-1β to downregulate the transcription factors PPARα and FOXO3.

                Yang et al. show that HDAC3 and FOXK1 form a transcriptional complex to positively regulate STAT1/2 expression, which is required for the cascade activation of type I interferon response. Lysosomal degradation of FOXK1, reduction of type I interferon response, and impaired antiviral immunity are observed in HDAC3 knockout macrophages.

                H2-M is an MHCII peptide editor that selects for stable peptide-MHCII complexes. Ghosh et al. show that H2-M loss reduces plasma membrane p/MHCII:BCR association and BCR signal strength, highlighting a mechanism by which B-1a cell clonal selection and development directly depend on the functional association of H2-M with MHCII.

                Hunziker et al. reveal that, within minutes, influenza viruses reprogram host cells for infection by unraveling the global changes to the cellular phosphoproteome. These virus-induced changes result in formation of filopodia that enhance virus uptake. However, host cells can counteract this via the actin-remodeling protein cortactin to limit virus endocytosis.

                Antigen recognition through the T cell receptor (TCR) αβ heterodimer is one of the primary determinants of the adaptive immune response. Vaccines activate naïve T cells with high specificity to expand and differentiate into memory T cells. However, antigen-specific memory CD4 T cells exist in unexposed antigen-naïve hosts. In this study, we use high-throughput sequencing of memory CD4 TCRβ repertoire and machine learning to show that individuals with preexisting vaccine-reactive memory CD4 T cell clonotypes elicited earlier and higher antibody titers and mounted a more robust CD4 T cell response to hepatitis B vaccine. In addition, integration of TCRβ sequence patterns into a hepatitis B epitope-specific annotation model can predict which individuals will have an early and more vigorous vaccine-elicited immunity. Thus, the presence of preexisting memory T cell clonotypes has a significant impact on immunity and can be used to predict immune responses to vaccination.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A low-tech, cost-effective and efficient method for safeguarding genetic diversity by direct cryopreservation of poultry embryonic reproductive cells</a></h4>

              
                Chickens are an important resource for smallholder farmers who raise locally adapted, genetically distinct breeds for eggs and meat. The development of efficient reproductive technologies to conserve and regenerate chicken breeds safeguards existing biodiversity and secures poultry genetic resources for climate resilience, biosecurity, and future food production. The majority of the over 1600 breeds of chicken are raised in low and lower to middle income countries under resource-limited, small-scale production systems, which necessitates a low-tech, cost-effective means of conserving diversity is needed. Here, we validate a simple biobanking technique using cryopreserved embryonic chicken gonads. The gonads are quickly isolated, visually sexed, pooled by sex, and cryopreserved. Subsequently, the stored material is thawed and dissociated before injection into sterile host chicken embryos. By using pooled GFP and RFP-labelled donor gonadal cells and Sire Dam Surrogate mating, we demonstrate that chicks deriving entirely from male and female donor germ cells are hatched. This technology will enable ongoing efforts to conserve chicken genetic diversity for both commercial and smallholder farmers, and to preserve existing genetic resources at poultry research facilities.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A genetic compensatory mechanism regulated by Jun and Mef2d modulates the expression of distinct class IIa Hdacs to ensure peripheral nerve myelination and repair</a></h4>

              
                The class IIa histone deacetylases (HDACs) have pivotal roles in the development of different tissues. Of this family, Schwann cells express <i>Hdac4</i>, <i>5</i> and <i>7</i> but not <i>Hdac9</i>. Here we show that a transcription factor regulated genetic compensatory mechanism within this family of proteins, blocks negative regulators of myelination ensuring peripheral nerve developmental myelination and remyelination after injury. Thus, when <i>Hdac4</i> and <i>5</i> are knocked-out from Schwann cells in mice, a JUN-dependent mechanism induces the compensatory overexpression of <i>Hdac7</i> permitting, although with a delay, the formation of the myelin sheath. When <i>Hdac4,5</i> and <i>7</i> are simultaneously removed, the Myocyte-specific enhancer-factor d (MEF2D) binds to the promoter and induces the <i>de novo</i> expression of <i>Hdac9</i>, and although several melanocytic lineage genes are misexpressed and Remak bundle structure is disrupted, myelination proceeds after a long delay. Thus, our data unveil a finely tuned compensatory mechanism within the class IIa <i>Hdac</i> family, coordinated by distinct transcription factors, that guarantees the ability of Schwann cells to myelinate during development and remyelinate after nerve injury.

                Basement membranes (BMs) are complex macromolecular networks underlying all continuous layers of cells. Essential components include collagen IV and laminins, which are affected by human genetic variants leading to a range of debilitating conditions including kidney, muscle, and cerebrovascular phenotypes. We investigated the dynamics of BM assembly in human pluripotent stem cell-derived kidney organoids. We resolved their global BM composition and discovered a conserved temporal sequence in BM assembly that paralleled mammalian fetal kidneys. We identified the emergence of key BM isoforms, which were altered by a pathogenic variant in <i>COL4A5</i>. Integrating organoid, fetal and adult kidney proteomes we found dynamic regulation of BM composition through development to adulthood, and with single-cell transcriptomic analysis we mapped the cellular origins of BM components. Overall, we define the complex and dynamic nature of kidney BM assembly and provide a platform for understanding its wider relevance in human development and disease.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Native proline-rich motifs exploit sequence context to target actin-remodeling Ena/VASP protein ENAH</a></h4>

              
                The human proteome is replete with short linear motifs (SLiMs) of four to six residues that are critical for protein-protein interactions, yet the importance of the sequence surrounding such motifs is underexplored. We devised a proteomic screen to examine the influence of SLiM sequence context on protein-protein interactions. Focusing on the EVH1 domain of human ENAH, an actin regulator that is highly expressed in invasive cancers, we screened 36-residue proteome-derived peptides and discovered new interaction partners of ENAH and diverse mechanisms by which context influences binding. A pocket on the ENAH EVH1 domain that has diverged from other Ena/VASP paralogs recognizes extended SLiMs and favors motif-flanking proline residues. Many high-affinity ENAH binders that contain two proline-rich SLiMs use a noncanonical site on the EVH1 domain for binding and display a thermodynamic signature consistent with the two-motif chain engaging a single domain. We also found that photoreceptor cilium actin regulator (PCARE) uses an extended 23-residue region to obtain a higher affinity than any known ENAH EVH1-binding motif. Our screen provides a way to uncover the effects of proteomic context on motif-mediated binding, revealing diverse mechanisms of control over EVH1 interactions and establishing that SLiMs can’t be fully understood outside of their native context.

                Fertility in female mammals, including mice and humans, is dependent on the presence of a zona pellucida (ZP) around growing oocytes and unfertilized eggs. A ZP is required to stabilize contacts between oocyte microvilli and follicle cell projections that traverse the ZP to form gap junctions that support the health of growing oocytes and developing follicles. In the absence of a ZP, due to inactivation or mutation of genes encoding ZP proteins, there is a loss of contacts between growing oocytes and neighboring follicle cells and a concomitant reduction in the production of ovulated eggs that results in female infertility.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Intrinsic mechanisms in the gating of resurgent Na+ currents</a></h4>

              
                The resurgent component of the voltage-gated sodium current (I<sub>NaR</sub>) is a depolarizing conductance, revealed on membrane hyperpolarizations following brief depolarizing voltage steps, which has been shown to contribute to regulating the firing properties of numerous neuronal cell types throughout the central and peripheral nervous systems. Although mediated by the same voltage-gated sodium (Nav) channels that underlie the transient and persistent Nav current components, the gating mechanisms that contribute to the generation of I<sub>NaR</sub> remain unclear. Here, we characterized Nav currents in mouse cerebellar Purkinje neurons, and used tailored voltage-clamp protocols to define how the voltage and the duration of the initial membrane depolarization affect the amplitudes and kinetics of I<sub>NaR</sub>. Using the acquired voltage-clamp data, we developed a novel Markov kinetic state model with parallel (fast and slow) inactivation pathways and, we show that this model reproduces the properties of the resurgent, as well as the transient and persistent, Nav currents recorded in (mouse) cerebellar Purkinje neurons. Based on the acquired experimental data and the simulations, we propose that resurgent Na<sup>+</sup> influx occurs as a result of fast inactivating Nav channels transitioning into an open/conducting state on membrane hyperpolarization, and that the decay of I<sub>NaR</sub> reflects the slow accumulation of recovered/opened Nav channels into a second, alternative and more slowly populated, inactivated state. Additional simulations reveal that extrinsic factors that affect the kinetics of fast or slow Nav channel inactivation and/or impact the relative distribution of Nav channels in the fast- and slow-inactivated states, such as the accessory Navβ4 channel subunit, can modulate the amplitude of I<sub>NaR</sub>.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Urinary metabolic biomarkers of diet quality in European children are associated with metabolic health</a></h4>

              
                Urinary metabolic profiling is a promising powerful tool to reflect dietary intake and can help understand metabolic alterations in response to diet quality. Here, we used <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectroscopy in a multicountry study in European children (1147 children from 6 different cohorts) and identified a common panel of 4 urinary metabolites (hippurate, <i>N</i>-methylnicotinic acid, urea, and sucrose) that was predictive of Mediterranean diet adherence (KIDMED) and ultra-processed food consumption and also had higher capacity in discriminating children’s diet quality than that of established sociodemographic determinants. Further, we showed that the identified metabolite panel also reflected the associations of these diet quality indicators with C-peptide, a stable and accurate marker of insulin resistance and future risk of metabolic disease. This methodology enables objective assessment of dietary patterns in European child populations, complementary to traditional questionary methods, and can be used in future studies to evaluate diet quality. Moreover, this knowledge can provide mechanistic evidence of common biological pathways that characterize healthy and unhealthy dietary patterns, and diet-related molecular alterations that could associate to metabolic disease.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Structure of the human ATM kinase and mechanism of Nbs1 binding</a></h4>

              
                DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) can lead to mutations, chromosomal rearrangements, genome instability, and cancer. Central to the sensing of DSBs is the ATM (Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated) kinase, which belongs to the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related protein kinase (PIKK) family. In response to DSBs, ATM is activated by the MRN (Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1) protein complex through a poorly-understood process that also requires double-stranded DNA. Previous studies indicate that the FxF/Y motif of Nbs1 directly binds to ATM, and is required to retain active ATM at sites of DNA damage. Here we report the 2.5 Å resolution cryo-EM structures of human ATM and its complex with the Nbs1 FxF/Y motif. In keeping with previous structures of ATM and its yeast homolog Tel1, the dimeric human ATM kinase adopts a symmetric, butterfly-shaped structure. The conformation of the ATM kinase domain is most similar to the inactive states of other PIKKs, suggesting that activation may involve an analogous realigning the N and C lobes along with relieving the blockage of the substrate-binding site. We also show that the Nbs1 FxF/Y motif binds to a conserved hydrophobic cleft within the Spiral domain of ATM, suggesting an allosteric mechanism of activation. We evaluate the importance of these structural findings with mutagenesis and biochemical assays.

                Stable adherence to epithelial surfaces is required for colonization by diverse host-associated microbes. Successful attachment of pathogenic microbes to host cells via adhesin molecules is also the first step in many devastating infections. Despite the primacy of epithelial adherence in establishing host-microbe associations, the evolutionary processes that shape this crucial interface remain enigmatic. Carcinoembryonic antigen associated cell adhesion molecules (CEACAMs) encompass a multifunctional family of vertebrate cell surface proteins which are recurrent targets of bacterial adhesins at epithelial barriers. Here we show that multiple members of the primate CEACAM family exhibit evidence of repeated natural selection at protein surfaces targeted by bacteria, consistent with pathogen-driven evolution. Divergence of CEACAM proteins between even closely related great apes is sufficient to control molecular interactions with a range of bacterial adhesins. Phylogenetic analyses further reveal that repeated gene conversion of CEACAM extracellular domains during primate divergence plays a key role in limiting bacterial adhesin host tropism. Moreover, we demonstrate that gene conversion has continued to shape CEACAM diversity within human populations, with abundant human CEACAM1 variants mediating evasion of adhesins from pathogenic <i>Neisseria</i>. Together this work reveals a mechanism by which gene conversion shapes first contact between microbes and animal hosts.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Protein visualization and manipulation in Drosophila through the use of epitope tags recognized by nanobodies</a></h4>

              
                Expansion of the available repertoire of reagents for visualization and manipulation of proteins will help understand their function. Short epitope tags linked to proteins of interest and recognized by existing binders such as nanobodies facilitate protein studies by obviating the need to isolate new antibodies directed against them. Nanobodies have several advantages over conventional antibodies, as they can be expressed and used as tools for visualization and manipulation of proteins <i>in vivo</i>. Here, we characterize two short (&lt;15 aa) NanoTag epitopes, 127D01 and VHH05, and their corresponding high-affinity nanobodies. We demonstrate their use in <i>Drosophila </i>for <i>in vivo</i> protein detection and re-localization, direct and indirect immunofluorescence, immunoblotting, and immunoprecipitation. We further show that CRISPR-mediated gene targeting provides a straightforward approach to tagging endogenous proteins with the NanoTags. Single copies of the NanoTags, regardless of their location, suffice for detection. This versatile and validated toolbox of tags and nanobodies will serve as a resource for a wide array of applications, including functional studies in <i>Drosophila</i> and beyond.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">iMyoblasts for ex vivo and in vivo investigations of human myogenesis and disease modeling</a></h4>

              
                Skeletal muscle myoblasts (iMyoblasts) were generated from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) using an efficient and reliable transgene-free induction and stem cell selection protocol. Immunofluorescence, flow cytometry, qPCR, digital RNA expression profiling, and scRNA-Seq studies identify iMyoblasts as a <i>PAX3+/MYOD1+</i> skeletal myogenic lineage with a fetal-like transcriptome signature, distinct from adult muscle biopsy myoblasts (bMyoblasts) and iPSC-induced muscle progenitors. iMyoblasts can be stably propagated for &gt;12 passages or 30 population doublings while retaining their dual commitment for myotube differentiation and regeneration of reserve cells. iMyoblasts also efficiently xenoengrafted into irradiated and injured mouse muscle where they undergo differentiation and fetal-adult MYH isoform switching, demonstrating their regulatory plasticity for adult muscle maturation in response to signals in the host muscle. Xenograft muscle retains PAX3+ muscle progenitors and can regenerate human muscle in response to secondary injury. As models of disease, iMyoblasts from individuals with Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy revealed a previously unknown epigenetic regulatory mechanism controlling developmental expression of the pathological <i>DUX4</i> gene. iMyoblasts from Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy R7 and R9 and Walker Warburg Syndrome patients modeled their molecular disease pathologies and were responsive to small molecule and gene editing therapeutics. These findings establish the utility of iMyoblasts for ex vivo and in vivo investigations of human myogenesis and disease pathogenesis and for the development of muscle stem cell therapeutics.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Personalized computational heart models with T1-mapped fibrotic remodeling predict sudden death risk in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</a></h4>

              
                Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is associated with risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD) due to ventricular arrhythmias (VAs) arising from the proliferation of fibrosis in the heart. Current clinical risk stratification criteria inadequately identify at-risk patients in need of primary prevention of VA. Here, we use mechanistic computational modeling of the heart to analyze how HCM-specific remodeling promotes arrhythmogenesis and to develop a personalized strategy to forecast risk of VAs in these patients. We combine contrast-enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and T1 mapping data to construct digital replicas of HCM patient hearts that represent the patient-specific distribution of focal and diffuse fibrosis and evaluate the substrate propensity to VA. Our analysis indicates that the presence of diffuse fibrosis, which is rarely assessed in these patients, increases arrhythmogenic propensity. In forecasting future VA events in HCM patients, the imaging-based computational heart approach achieved 84.6%, 76.9%, and 80.1% sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy, respectively, and significantly outperformed current clinical risk predictors. This novel VA risk assessment may have the potential to prevent SCD and help deploy primary prevention appropriately in HCM patients.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Topoisomerase VI is a chirally-selective, preferential DNA decatenase</a></h4>

              
                DNA topoisomerase VI (topo VI) is a type IIB DNA topoisomerase found predominantly in archaea and some bacteria, but also in plants and algae. Since its discovery, topo VI has been proposed to be a DNA decatenase, however robust evidence and a mechanism for its preferential decatenation activity was lacking. Using single-molecule magnetic tweezers measurements and supporting ensemble biochemistry, we demonstrate that <i>Methanosarcina mazei</i> topo VI preferentially unlinks, or decatenates DNA crossings, in comparison to relaxing supercoils, through a preference for certain DNA crossing geometries. In addition, topo VI demonstrates a significant increase in ATPase activity, DNA binding and rate of strand passage, with increasing DNA writhe, providing further evidence that topo VI is a DNA crossing sensor. Our study strongly suggests that topo VI has evolved an intrinsic preference for the unknotting and decatenation of interlinked chromosomes by sensing and preferentially unlinking DNA crossings with geometries close to 90°.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Whole-brain in vivo base editing reverses autistic-like behaviors in mice</a></h4>

              
                Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a highly heritable neurodevelopmental disorder associated with deficits in social communication and stereotypical behaviors. Numerous ASD-related genetic mutations have been identified and genome editing methods have been developed but successful genome editing in the whole-brain scale to alleviate autistic-like behaviors in animal models has not been achieved. Here we report the development of a new CRISPR-mediated cytidine base editor (CBE) system, which converts C/G base pairs to T/A. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this system by targeting an ASD-associated de novo mutation in the MEF2C gene (c.104T>C, p.L35P). We constructed a Mef2c L35P knock-in mouse and observed that Mef2c L35P heterozygous mice displayed autistic-like behaviors, including deficits in social behaviors and repetitive behaviors. We programmed the CBE to edit the C/G base pairs of the mutated Mef2c gene (c.104T>C, p.L35P) to T/A base pairs and delivered it via a single dose intravenous injection of blood brain barrier (BBB)-crossing AAV-PHPeB vector into the mouse brain. This treatment restored MEF2C protein levels and reversed impairments in social interactions and repetitive behaviors in Mef2c L35P heterozygous mice. Together, this work presents an in vivo gene editing strategy in which correcting a single nucleotide mutation in the whole-brain scale could be successfully achieved, further providing a new therapeutic framework for neurodevelopmental disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Aβ/APP-induced hyperexcitability and dysregulation of homeostatic synaptic plasticity in models of Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                The proper function of the nervous system is dependent on the appropriate timing of neuronal firing. Synapses continually undergo rapid activity-dependent modifications that require feedback mechanisms to maintain network activity within a window in which communication is energy efficient and meaningful. Homeostatic synaptic plasticity (HSP) and homeostatic intrinsic plasticity (HIP) are such negative feedback mechanisms. Accumulating evidence implicates that Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related amyloid precursor protein (APP) and its cleavage product amyloid-beta (A{beta}) play a role in the regulation of neuronal network activity, and in particular HSP. AD features impaired neuronal activity with regional early hyper-activity and A{beta}-dependent hyperexcitability has also been demonstrated in AD transgenic mice. We demonstrate similar hyper-activity in AD transgenic neurons in culture that have elevated levels of both human APP and A{beta}. To examine the individual roles of APP and A{beta} in promoting hyperexcitability we used an APP construct that does not generate A{beta}, or elevated A{beta} levels independently of APP. Increasing either APP or A{beta} in wild type (WT) neurons leads to increased frequency and amplitude of calcium transients. Since HSP/HIP mechanisms normally maintain a setpoint of activity, we examined whether homeostatic synaptic/intrinsic plasticity was altered in AD transgenic neurons. Using methods known to induce HSP/HIP, we demonstrate that APP protein levels are regulated by chronic modulation of activity and show that AD transgenic neurons have an impaired response to global changes in activity. Further, AD transgenic compared to WT neurons failed to adjust the length of their axon initial segments (AIS), an adaptation known to alter excitability. Thus, we present evidence that both APP and A{beta} influence neuronal activity and that mechanisms of HSP/HIP are disrupted in neuronal models of AD.
