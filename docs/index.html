              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17888">Seizure duration is associated with multiple timescales in interictal iEEG band power</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2504.17888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background Seizure severity can change from one seizure to the next within individual people with epilepsy. It is unclear if and how seizure severity is modulated over longer timescales. Characterising seizure severity variability over time could lead to tailored treatments. In this study, we test if continuously-recorded interictal intracranial EEG (iEEG) features encapsulate signatures of such modulations.
  Methods We analysed 20 subjects with iEEG recordings of at least one day. We identified cycles on timescales of hours to days embedded in long-term iEEG band power and associated them with seizure severity, which we approximated using seizure duration. In order to quantify these associations, we created linear-circular statistical models of seizure duration that incorporated different band power cycles within each subject.
  Findings In most subjects, seizure duration was weakly to moderately correlated with individual band power cycles. Combinations of multiple band power cycles significantly explained most of the variability in seizure duration. Specifically, we found 70% of the models had a higher than 60% adjusted $R^2$ across all subjects. From these models, around 80% were deemed to be above chance-level (p-value < 0.05) based on permutation tests. Models included cycles of ultradian, circadian and slower timescales in a subject-specific manner.
  Interpretation These results suggest that seizure severity, as measured by seizure duration, may be modulated over timescales of minutes to days by subject-specific cycles in interictal iEEG signal properties. These cycles likely serve as markers of seizure modulating processes. Future work can investigate biological drivers of these detected fluctuations and may inform novel treatment strategies that minimise seizure severity.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17939">A computational model of infant sensorimotor exploration in the mobile paradigm</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2504.17939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a computational model of the mechanisms that may determine infants' behavior in the "mobile paradigm". This paradigm has been used in developmental psychology to explore how infants learn the sensory effects of their actions. In this paradigm, a mobile (an articulated and movable object hanging above an infant's crib) is connected to one of the infant's limbs, prompting the infant to preferentially move that "connected" limb. This ability to detect a "sensorimotor contingency" is considered to be a foundational cognitive ability in development. To understand how infants learn sensorimotor contingencies, we built a model that attempts to replicate infant behavior. Our model incorporates a neural network, action-outcome prediction, exploration, motor noise, preferred activity level, and biologically-inspired motor control. We find that simulations with our model replicate the classic findings in the literature showing preferential movement of the connected limb. An interesting observation is that the model sometimes exhibits a burst of movement after the mobile is disconnected, casting light on a similar occasional finding in infants. In addition to these general findings, the simulations also replicate data from two recent more detailed studies using a connection with the mobile that was either gradual or all-or-none. A series of ablation studies further shows that the inclusion of mechanisms of action-outcome prediction, exploration, motor noise, and biologically-inspired motor control was essential for the model to correctly replicate infant behavior. This suggests that these components are also involved in infants' sensorimotor learning.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16940">Better artificial intelligence does not mean better models of biology</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2504.16940v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) once showed increasing alignment with primate perception and neural responses as they improved on vision benchmarks, raising hopes that advances in AI would yield better models of biological vision. However, we show across three benchmarks that this alignment is now plateauing - and in some cases worsening - as DNNs scale to human or superhuman accuracy. This divergence may reflect the adoption of visual strategies that differ from those used by primates. These findings challenge the view that progress in artificial intelligence will naturally translate to neuroscience. We argue that vision science must chart its own course, developing algorithms grounded in biological visual systems rather than optimizing for benchmarks based on internet-scale datasets.

                arXiv:2504.17794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the use of an extended neuroevolutionary approach, based on NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT), for autonomous robots in dynamic environments associated with hazardous tasks like firefighting, urban search-and-rescue (USAR), and industrial inspections. Building on previous research, it expands the simulation environment to larger and more complex settings, demonstrating NEAT's adaptability across different applications. By integrating recent advancements in NEAT and reinforcement learning, the study uses modern simulation frameworks for realism and hybrid algorithms for optimization. Experimental results show that NEAT-evolved controllers achieve success rates comparable to state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning methods, with superior structural adaptability. The agents reached ~80% success in outdoor tests, surpassing baseline models. The paper also highlights the benefits of transfer learning among tasks and evaluates the effectiveness of NEAT in complex 3D navigation. Contributions include evaluating NEAT for diverse autonomous applications and discussing real-world deployment considerations, emphasizing the approach's potential as an alternative or complement to deep reinforcement learning in autonomous navigation tasks.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17799">Subfunction Structure Matters: A New Perspective on Local Optima Networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2504.17799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Local optima networks (LONs) capture fitness landscape information. They are typically constructed in a black-box manner; information about the problem structure is not utilised. This also applies to the analysis of LONs: knowledge about the problem, such as interaction between variables, is not considered. We challenge this status-quo with an alternative approach: we consider how LON analysis can be improved by incorporating subfunction-based information - this can either be known a-priori or learned during search. To this end, LONs are constructed for several benchmark pseudo-boolean problems using three approaches: firstly, the standard algorithm; a second algorithm which uses deterministic grey-box crossover; and a third algorithm which selects perturbations based on learned information about variable interactions. Metrics related to subfunction changes in a LON are proposed and compared with metrics from previous literature which capture other aspects of a LON. Incorporating problem structure in LON construction and analysing it can bring enriched insight into optimisation dynamics. Such information may be crucial to understanding the difficulty of solving a given problem with state-of-the-art linkage learning optimisers. In light of the results, we suggest incorporation of problem structure as an alternative paradigm in landscape analysis for problems with known or suspected subfunction structure.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17801">Evolution of Optimization Algorithms for Global Placement via Large Language Models</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2504.17801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimization algorithms are widely employed to tackle complex problems, but designing them manually is often labor-intensive and requires significant expertise. Global placement is a fundamental step in electronic design automation (EDA). While analytical approaches represent the state-of-the-art (SOTA) in global placement, their core optimization algorithms remain heavily dependent on heuristics and customized components, such as initialization strategies, preconditioning methods, and line search techniques. This paper presents an automated framework that leverages large language models (LLM) to evolve optimization algorithms for global placement. We first generate diverse candidate algorithms using LLM through carefully crafted prompts. Then we introduce an LLM-based genetic flow to evolve selected candidate algorithms. The discovered optimization algorithms exhibit substantial performance improvements across many benchmarks. Specifically, Our design-case-specific discovered algorithms achieve average HPWL improvements of \textbf{5.05\%}, \text{5.29\%} and \textbf{8.30\%} on MMS, ISPD2005 and ISPD2019 benchmarks, and up to \textbf{17\%} improvements on individual cases. Additionally, the discovered algorithms demonstrate good generalization ability and are complementary to existing parameter-tuning methods.

Abstract: This paper explores the application of genetic fuzzy systems to efficiently generate schedules for a team of part-time student workers at a university. Given the preferred number of working hours and availability of employees, our model generates feasible solutions considering various factors, such as maximum weekly hours, required number of workers on duty, and the preferred number of working hours. The algorithm is trained and tested with availability data collected from students at the University of Cincinnati. The results demonstrate the algorithm's efficiency in producing schedules that meet operational criteria and its robustness in understaffed conditions.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17827">Evolution Meets Diffusion: Efficient Neural Architecture Generation</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2504.17827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has gained widespread attention for its transformative potential in deep learning model design. However, the vast and complex search space of NAS leads to significant computational and time costs. Neural Architecture Generation (NAG) addresses this by reframing NAS as a generation problem, enabling the precise generation of optimal architectures for specific tasks. Despite its promise, mainstream methods like diffusion models face limitations in global search capabilities and are still hindered by high computational and time demands. To overcome these challenges, we propose Evolutionary Diffusion-based Neural Architecture Generation (EDNAG), a novel approach that achieves efficient and training-free architecture generation. EDNAG leverages evolutionary algorithms to simulate the denoising process in diffusion models, using fitness to guide the transition from random Gaussian distributions to optimal architecture distributions. This approach combines the strengths of evolutionary strategies and diffusion models, enabling rapid and effective architecture generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EDNAG achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in architecture optimization, with an improvement in accuracy of up to 10.45%. Furthermore, it eliminates the need for time-consuming training and boosts inference speed by an average of 50 times, showcasing its exceptional efficiency and effectiveness.

                arXiv:2504.18241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces decentralized and modular neural network framework designed to enhance the scalability, interpretability, and performance of artificial intelligence (AI) systems. At the heart of this framework is a dynamic switch mechanism that governs the selective activation and training of individual neurons based on input characteristics, allowing neurons to specialize in distinct segments of the data domain. This approach enables neurons to learn from disjoint subsets of data, mimicking biological brain function by promoting task specialization and improving the interpretability of neural network behavior. Furthermore, the paper explores the application of federated learning and decentralized training for real-world AI deployments, particularly in edge computing and distributed environments. By simulating localized training on non-overlapping data subsets, we demonstrate how modular networks can be efficiently trained and evaluated. The proposed framework also addresses scalability, enabling AI systems to handle large datasets and distributed processing while preserving model transparency and interpretability. Finally, we discuss the potential of this approach in advancing the design of scalable, privacy-preserving, and efficient AI systems for diverse applications.

Abstract: Three-factor learning rules in Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have emerged as a crucial extension to traditional Hebbian learning and Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP), incorporating neuromodulatory signals to improve adaptation and learning efficiency. These mechanisms enhance biological plausibility and facilitate improved credit assignment in artificial neural systems. This paper takes a view on this topic from a machine learning perspective, providing an overview of recent advances in three-factor learning, discusses theoretical foundations, algorithmic implementations, and their relevance to reinforcement learning and neuromorphic computing. In addition, we explore interdisciplinary approaches, scalability challenges, and potential applications in robotics, cognitive modeling, and AI systems. Finally, we highlight key research gaps and propose future directions for bridging the gap between neuroscience and artificial intelligence.

Abstract: We study the expressive power of deep polynomial neural networks through the geometry of their neurovariety. We introduce the notion of the activation degree threshold of a network architecture to express when the dimension of the neurovariety achieves its theoretical maximum. We prove the existence of the activation degree threshold for all polynomial neural networks without width-one bottlenecks and demonstrate a universal upper bound that is quadratic in the width of largest size. In doing so, we prove the high activation degree conjecture of Kileel, Trager, and Bruna. Certain structured architectures have exceptional activation degree thresholds, making them especially expressive in the sense of their neurovariety dimension. In this direction, we prove that polynomial neural networks with equi-width architectures are maximally expressive by showing their activation degree threshold is one.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16005">CAPO: Cost-Aware Prompt Optimization</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2504.16005v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing by solving a wide range of tasks simply guided by a prompt. Yet their performance is highly sensitive to prompt formulation. While automated prompt optimization addresses this challenge by finding optimal prompts, current methods require a substantial number of LLM calls and input tokens, making prompt optimization expensive. We introduce CAPO (Cost-Aware Prompt Optimization), an algorithm that enhances prompt optimization efficiency by integrating AutoML techniques. CAPO is an evolutionary approach with LLMs as operators, incorporating racing to save evaluations and multi-objective optimization to balance performance with prompt length. It jointly optimizes instructions and few-shot examples while leveraging task descriptions for improved robustness. Our extensive experiments across diverse datasets and LLMs demonstrate that CAPO outperforms state-of-the-art discrete prompt optimization methods in 11/15 cases with improvements up to 21%p. Our algorithm achieves better performances already with smaller budgets, saves evaluations through racing, and decreases average prompt length via a length penalty, making it both cost-efficient and cost-aware. Even without few-shot examples, CAPO outperforms its competitors and generally remains robust to initial prompts. CAPO represents an important step toward making prompt optimization more powerful and accessible by improving cost-efficiency.

<p>This study revealed the unprecedented complexity of dopaminergic peripheral neural systems in gastropod molluscs, with lineage-specific diversification of sensory and modulatory functions.

<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>In Euthyneuran molluscs, the distribution and plethora of dopamine (DA) functions are likely coupled to the feeding ecology with a broad spectrum of modifications both in the central and peripheral neural systems. However, studies of benthic grazers currently dominate the analysis of DA-mediated signaling, whereas adaptations to pelagic lifestyles and other feeding strategies are unknown. Here, we characterize the distribution of central and peripheral neurons in representatives of distinct ecological groups: the pelagic predatory pteropod <i>Clione limacina</i> (Pteropoda, Gymnosomata) and its prey — <i>Limacina helicina</i> (Pteropoda, Thecosomata), as well as the plankton eater <i>Melibe leonina</i> (Nudipleura, Nudibranchia). By using tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity as a reporter, we mapped their dopaminergic systems. Across all studied species, despite their differences in ecology, small numbers of dopaminergic neurons in the central ganglia contrast to an incredible density of these neurons in the peripheral nervous system, primarily representing sensory-like cells, which are predominantly concentrated in the chemotactic areas and project afferent axons to the central nervous system. Combined with tubulin immunoreactivity, this study illuminates the complexity of sensory signaling and peripheral neural systems in Euthyneuran molluscs with lineage-specific adaptations across different taxonomical and ecological groups.</p>

                <p>Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by α-synuclein aggregation in neurons. Recent advances suggest α-synuclein aggregates could serve as a biomarker for PD and related synucleinopathies. This study used surface-based fluorescence intensity distribution analysis (sFIDA) to measure α-synuclein aggregates in urine. Patients with PD and isolated rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, a precursor to PD, had elevated concentrations compared with healthy controls. Sensitivity and specificity were 83% and 65% for PD versus controls and 89% and 62% for isolated rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder versus controls. The findings highlight sFIDA's potential for diagnosing synucleinopathies. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27252?af=R">Phosphatemia is an Independent Prognostic Factor in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective of this study was to evaluate the prognostic value of several muscle damage biomarkers.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Data from Piemonte and Valle d'Aosta Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (PARALS) were considered for this study. Survival was defined as the time from diagnosis to death, tracheostomy, or the censoring date. Blood levels of potassium, creatinine, creatine kinase, phosphorus, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) diagnosis were evaluated as potential prognostic biomarkers. A Cox model was developed for each biomarker and adjusted for sex, onset age, onset site, and diagnostic delay. Significant findings from PARALS were evaluated in the Pooled Resource Open-Access Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Clinical Trials (PRO-ACT) database. Additionally, a joint model was constructed to evaluate the prognostic role of phosphatemia slope over time using longitudinal data from PRO-ACT.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 1,444 and 1,023 patients were included in the PARALS and PRO-ACT cohorts, respectively. Only creatinine (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.65, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.50–0.85) and phosphorus (HR = 1.14, 95% CI = 1.04–1.24) showed a significant association with survival in the PARALS cohort. These findings were further validated in the PRO-ACT cohort (creatinine HR = 0.21, 95% CI = 0.13–0.35, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001; phosphorus HR = 2.35, 95% CI = 1.13–4.88, <i>p</i> = 0.02). Longitudinal data from the PRO-ACT database showed that an increase of 0.1 mmol/l per month in phosphate levels was also associated with a HR of 8.26 (95% CI = 1.07–96.6, <i>p</i> = 0.044).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Creatininemia was confirmed as a prognostic marker in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Additionally, both phosphatemia levels at diagnosis and its rate of change over time were identified as a potential prognostic marker for ALS. As with other blood biomarkers, phosphate levels are cost-effective and minimally invasive to measure, supporting their potential use in clinical trials. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                The functions of intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) in basal transcription complexes remain poorly understood. Bhuiyan et al. find that the basal transcription factor TFIID contains an IDR that drives the subunit TAF2 to nuclear speckles to influence RNA splicing. Thus, TAF2 links the basal transcription machinery to RNA splicing factors.

                Introduction Psoriasis is a chronic skin disease affecting quality of life and causing pruritus. The factors influencing itch and its impact on the quality of life in Thai psoriasis patients are unknown. We aimed to identify these factors and their effect on quality of life. Methods In this questionnaire-based cross-sectional study, we included patients with psoriasis who received treatment at Chulabhorn Hospital in Thailand from January 2019 to July 2021. Interviewer is the non-dermatologist practician. The patient’s information was collected, including demographic data, Itch Numeric Rating Scale (Itch NRS) score, factors affecting itch, and score on the Thai version of the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI). We performed descriptive statistics and logistic regression analysis. Results Of 100 participants, most (99%) experienced itching, with a moderate degree of pruritus (mean Itch NRS score 6.5 ± 2.6) and a moderate effect on quality of life (mean DLQI score 9.4 ± 6.2). Factors associated with itch aggravation were dry skin (p-value = 0.003) and heat and humidity (p-value = 0.042). The results of binary logistic regression revealed that factors associated with moderate-to-extremely large DLQI scores were itch intensity (no-to-mild vs. moderate-to-severe itch: odds ratio [OR] = 13.33; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.72–65.32, p < 0.001; and adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 31.17; 95% CI = 4.55–213.36; p < 0.001. Conclusions Our findings revealed that the quality of life among patients with psoriasis is their greatest concern. Eliminating the itch intensity that affects their quality of life is crucial but remains challenging in Thailand.

                <p>by Matthew T. Parker, Samija Amar, José A. Campoy, Kristin Krause, Sergio Tusso, Magdalena Marek, Bruno Huettel, Korbinian Schneeberger</p>

Phenotypic differences between individuals of a species are often caused by differences in gene expression, which are in turn caused by genetic variation. Expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis is a methodology by which we can identify such causal variants. Scaling eQTL analysis is costly due to the expense of generating mapping populations, and the collection of matched transcriptomic and genomic information. We developed a rapid eQTL analysis approach using single-cell/nucleus RNA sequencing of gametes from a small number of heterozygous individuals. Patterns of inherited polymorphisms are used to infer the recombinant genomes of thousands of individual gametes and identify how different haplotypes correlate with variation in gene expression. Applied to Arabidopsis pollen nuclei, our approach uncovers both <i>cis</i>- and <i>trans</i>-eQTLs, ultimately mapping variation in a master regulator of sperm cell development that affects the expression of hundreds of genes. This establishes snRNA-sequencing as a powerful, cost-effective method for the mapping of meiotic recombination, addressing the scalability challenges of eQTL analysis and enabling eQTL mapping in specific cell-types.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Neuroimaging is routinely utilized to identify new inflammatory activity in multiple sclerosis (MS). A large language model to classify narrative magnetic resonance imaging reports in the electronic health record (EHR) as discrete data could provide significant benefits for MS research. The objectives of the current study were to develop such a prompt and to illustrate its research applications through a common clinical scenario: monitoring response to B-cell depleting therapy (BCDT).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>An institutional ecosystem that securely connects healthcare data with ChatGPT4 was applied to clinical MS magnetic resonance imaging reports in a single institutional EHR (2000–2022). A prompt (msLesionprompt) was developed and iteratively refined to classify the presence or absence of new T2-weighted lesions (newT2w) and contrast-enhancing lesions (CEL). The multistep validation included evaluating efficiency (time and cost), comparison with manually annotated reports using standard confusion matrix, and application to identifying predictors of newT2w/CEL after BCDT start.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Accuracy of msLesionprompt was high for detection of newT2w (97%) and CEL (96.8%). All 14,888 available reports were categorized in 4.13 hours ($28); 79% showed no newT2w or CEL. Data extracted showed expected suppression of new activity by BCDT (&gt;97% monitoring magnetic resonance images after an initial “rebaseline” scan). Neighborhood poverty (Area Deprivation Index) was identified as a predictor of inflammatory activity (newT2w: OR 1.69, 95% CI 1.10–2.59, <i>p</i> = 0.017; CEL: OR 1.54, 95% CI 1.01–2.34, <i>p</i> = 0.046).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Extracting discrete information from narrative imaging reports using an large language model is feasible and efficient. This approach could augment many real-world analyses of MS disease evolution and treatment response. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                Dhar et al. show that heterozygous loss of the frequently mutated epigenetic modifier KMT2D downregulates NCOR2 expression to promote medulloblastoma (MB) genesis and that KMT2D-deficient MB can be impeded by combinatory pharmacological inhibition of the enhancer-decommissioning lysine demethylase LSD1 and OXPHOS.

                Weissenrieder et al. show that mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter (MCU) deletion reduces growth and metastasis of murine KPCY cells by reducing cell-autologous induction of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Induction of EMT with Snail expression or TGF-β treatment rescues growth and metastatic deficits. These findings have implications for therapeutic development in PDAC.

                The role of peroxisomes in tissue-resident macrophages remains unclear. Matsushita et al. reveal that peroxisomes are essential for alveolar macrophage (AM) development by preventing lipotoxicity and maintaining mitochondrial fitness. Our findings highlight a metabolic dependency of peroxisomes on homeostatic AM survival and bioenergetics.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88794">Barcode-free multiplex plasmid sequencing using Bayesian analysis and nanopore sequencing</a></h4>

              
                Plasmid construction is central to life science research, and sequence verification is arguably its costliest step. Long-read sequencing has emerged as a competitor to Sanger sequencing, with the principal benefit that whole plasmids can be sequenced in a single run. Nevertheless, the current cost of nanopore sequencing is still prohibitive for routine sequencing during plasmid construction. We develop a computational approach termed Simple Algorithm for Very Efficient Multiplexing of Oxford Nanopore Experiments for You (SAVEMONEY) that guides researchers to mix multiple plasmids and subsequently computationally de-mixes the resultant sequences. SAVEMONEY defines optimal mixtures in a pre-survey step, and following sequencing, executes a post-analysis workflow involving sequence classification, alignment, and consensus determination. By using Bayesian analysis with prior probability of expected plasmid construction error rate, high-confidence sequences can be obtained for each plasmid in the mixture. Plasmids differing by as little as two bases can be mixed as a single sample for nanopore sequencing, and routine multiplexing of even six plasmids per 180 reads can still maintain high accuracy of consensus sequencing. SAVEMONEY should further democratize whole-plasmid sequencing by nanopore and related technologies, driving down the effective cost of whole-plasmid sequencing to lower than that of a single Sanger sequencing run.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99116">Major nuclear locales define nuclear genome organization and function beyond A and B compartments</a></h4>

              
                Models of nuclear genome organization often propose a binary division into active versus inactive compartments yet typically overlook nuclear bodies. Here, we integrated analysis of sequencing and image-based data to compare genome organization in four human cell types relative to three different nuclear locales: the nuclear lamina, nuclear speckles, and nucleoli. Although gene expression correlates mostly with nuclear speckle proximity, DNA replication timing correlates with proximity to multiple nuclear locales. Speckle attachment regions emerge as DNA replication initiation zones whose replication timing and gene composition vary with their attachment frequency. Most facultative LADs retain a partially repressed state as iLADs, despite their positioning in the nuclear interior. Knock out of two lamina proteins, Lamin A and LBR, causes a shift of H3K9me3-enriched LADs from lamina to nucleolus, and a reciprocal relocation of H3K27me3-enriched partially repressed iLADs from nucleolus to lamina. Thus, these partially repressed iLADs appear to compete with LADs for nuclear lamina attachment with consequences for replication timing. The nuclear organization in adherent cells is polarized with nuclear bodies and genomic regions segregating both radially and relative to the equatorial plane. Together, our results underscore the importance of considering genome organization relative to nuclear locales for a more complete understanding of the spatial and functional organization of the human genome.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95545">Changes in local mineral homeostasis facilitate the formation of benign and malignant testicular microcalcifications</a></h4>

              
                Testicular microcalcifications consist of hydroxyapatite and have been associated with an increased risk of testicular germ cell tumors (TGCTs) but are also found in benign cases such as loss-of-function variants in the phosphate transporter <i>SLC34A2</i>. Here, we show that fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), a regulator of phosphate homeostasis, is expressed in testicular germ cell neoplasia in situ (GCNIS), embryonal carcinoma (EC), and human embryonic stem cells. FGF23 is not glycosylated in TGCTs and therefore cleaved into a C-terminal fragment which competitively antagonizes full-length FGF23. Here, <i>Fgf23</i> knockout mice presented with marked calcifications in the epididymis, spermatogenic arrest, and focally germ cells expressing the osteoblast marker Osteocalcin (gene name: <i>Bglap</i>, protein name). Moreover, the frequent testicular microcalcifications in mice with no functional androgen receptor and lack of circulating gonadotropins are associated with lower <i>Slc34a2</i> and higher <i>Bglap</i>/<i>Slc34a1</i> (protein name: NPT2a) expression compared with wild-type mice. In accordance, human testicular specimens with microcalcifications also have lower <i>SLC34A2</i> and a subpopulation of germ cells express phosphate transporter NPT2a, Osteocalcin, and RUNX2 highlighting aberrant local phosphate handling and expression of bone-specific proteins. Mineral disturbance in vitro using calcium or phosphate treatment induced deposition of calcium phosphate in a spermatogonial cell line and this effect was fully rescued by the mineralization inhibitor pyrophosphate. In conclusion, testicular microcalcifications arise secondary to local alterations in mineral homeostasis, which in combination with impaired Sertoli cell function and reduced levels of mineralization inhibitors due to high alkaline phosphatase activity in GCNIS and TGCTs facilitate osteogenic-like differentiation of testicular cells and deposition of hydroxyapatite.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/77616">Deep sequencing of yeast and mouse tRNAs and tRNA fragments using OTTR</a></h4>

              
                Among the major classes of RNAs in the cell, tRNAs remain the most difficult to characterize via deep sequencing approaches, as tRNA structure and nucleotide modifications can each interfere with cDNA synthesis by commonly-used reverse transcriptases (RTs). Here, we benchmark a recently-developed RNA cloning protocol, termed Ordered Two-Template Relay (OTTR), to characterize intact tRNAs and tRNA fragments in budding yeast and in mouse tissues. We show that OTTR successfully captures both full-length tRNAs and tRNA fragments in budding yeast and in mouse reproductive tissues without any prior enzymatic treatment, and that tRNA cloning efficiency can be further enhanced via AlkB-mediated demethylation of modified nucleotides. As with other recent tRNA cloning protocols, we find that a subset of nucleotide modifications leave misincorporation signatures in OTTR datasets, enabling their detection without any additional protocol steps. Focusing on tRNA cleavage products, we compare OTTR with several standard small RNA-Seq protocols, finding that OTTR provides the most accurate picture of tRNA fragment levels by comparison to "ground truth" Northern blots. Applying this protocol to mature mouse spermatozoa, our data dramatically alter our understanding of the small RNA cargo of mature mammalian sperm, revealing a far more complex population of tRNA fragments - including both 5′ and 3′ tRNA halves derived from the majority of tRNAs – than previously appreciated. Taken together, our data confirm the superior performance of OTTR to commercial protocols in analysis of tRNA fragments, and force a reappraisal of potential epigenetic functions of the sperm small RNA payload.

">Charting the nanotopography of inner hair cell synapses using MINFLUX nanoscopy</a></h4>

              
                For us to hear, the cochlea encodes sounds into neural signals at synapses of inner hair cells (IHCs) and the auditory nerve with remarkable fidelity. To achieve the high rates of temporally precise synaptic transmission over long periods of time, IHCs employ sophisticated ribbon-type active zones (AZ). In order for us to understand synaptic sound encoding, we need to decipher the underpinning molecular topography of these synapse which had remained challenging due to technological limitations. Here we applied 3-dimensional minimal flux optical nanoscopy to mouse IHC synapses to chart the position of key pre- and postsynaptic proteins with single digit nanometre resolution of imaging. We demonstrate that nanoclusters of channels and interacting proteins govern the topography of AZs and postsynaptic densities (PSDs). We count synaptic proteins, their nanoclusters and determine their spatial organization feeding into computational modelling of AZ function. In conclusion, this study reveals a nanocluster-based molecular AZ and PSD topography, likely serving as functional modules in synaptic sound encoding.

">Personalized Biomarkers of Multiscale Functional Alterations in Temporal Lobe Epilepsy</a></h4>

              
                Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) presents with substantial inter-patient variability in clinical and neuroimaging manifestations. This multicenter study examined inter-individual differences in spatial patterns of intrinsic brain function in TLE using normative modeling at multiple spatial scales and evaluated the effectiveness of individual functional deviations for clinical diagnosis and postsurgical outcome prediction. We analyzed multimodal MRI data on 298 healthy controls, 282 TLE patients, and 45 disease controls with extratemporal epilepsy. Cortical function was profiled at local, regional, and global scales using brain signal variability, regional homogeneity, and node strength. We estimated patient-specific W-score maps to index deviations from normative metrics. Compared to healthy controls, patients with TLE showed considerable variations in patterns of functional alterations across the cortex, with the highest overlap in the ipsilateral mesiotemporal regions. Connectome-based simulation revealed the paralimbic and medial default mode regions as key disease epicenters. Functional changes were primarily underpinned by superficial white matter anomalies. Supervised pattern learning achieved classification AUCs of 0.76 for TLE versus disease controls, 0.74 for left versus right TLE, and 0.63 for seizure-free versus non-seizure-free TLE, with greater contralateral temporal functional deviations correlating with unfavorable postsurgical seizure outcome. Our findings reveal the heterogeneous impact of TLE on intrinsic cortical function. These biomarkers hold promise for clinical translation, guiding precision therapeutics and enhancing presurgical decision-making in TLE.

">The representation of mood in primate anterior insular cortex</a></h4>

              
                Understanding how the brain reflects and shapes mood requires resolving the disconnect between behavioral measures of mood that can only be made in humans (typically based on subjective reports of happiness) and detailed measures of brain activity only available in animals. To achieve this, we developed a universal mood model to predict behavioral fluctuations in human subjective happiness as individuals experienced wins and losses during a gambling task. Next, we investigated how this operationalization of mood was reflected in the brains of two monkeys engaged in the same gambling task. We found a remarkable alignment between human mood model signatures and the persistent responses of units in monkey anterior insular cortex, including a matched timescale of integration across events. In comparison, the same signatures were only weakly reflected in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, suggesting that insular mood representations do not trivially follow from a signal (like arousal) broadcast to all higher brain areas. These results are consistent with a model in which the brain transforms experiences into mood by integrating events through a recurrently connected network of excitatory and inhibitory pools of neurons. These are among the first detailed insights into the nature of putative mood representations in the primate brain.

">Neural trajectories reveal orchestration of cortical coding underlying natural language composition</a></h4>

              
                Language is a hierarchically structured system that enables humans to communicate complex meanings. Despite recent advances, the neurocomputational mechanism underlying the composition of natural language remains unclear. Building on the neural population theory, we investigated how neural trajectories in latent spaces underpin natural language composition that integrates diverse lexical content and syntactic relations. We found that neural trajectories derived from human neocortical responses show an orchestration of distinct coding strategies during naturalistic story comprehension. Neural latent geometry is primarily associated with syntactic relations and exhibits more efficient compression relative to lexical content. We further demonstrate that these trajectories can be simulated by brain-inspired computing systems with near-critical dynamics and a preference for historical information. Overall, by positioning structure-based integration as a key computation of natural language comprehension, our findings provide a novel perspective on the mechanism underlying real-world language use and emphasize the importance of contextual information in the development of brain-inspired intelligent systems.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The human brain processes visual input across various spatial frequency (SF) ranges to extract emotional cues. Prior studies have extensively explored SF processing in facial expressions, yielding partly conflicting results. However, bodily expressions, which provide complementary emotional and survival-relevant cues, remain unexplored. We investigated the neural mechanisms underlying the processing of low (LSF), high (HSF), and broad spatial frequency (BSF) components in fearful versus neutral bodily postures. Using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging, we examined brain activity in 20 participants viewing SF-filtered images of bodily expressions in a semi-passive task. A multivariate “searchlight” analysis based on Multi-Voxel Pattern Analysis was employed to decode the non-linear activation patterns associated with each SF band. Our findings reveal that SF processing engages distinct neural networks in response to fearful bodily expressions. BSF stimuli activated a widespread network, including the amygdala, pulvinar, frontal, and temporal cortices. These findings suggest a general threat-detection system integrating information across all SFs. HSF stimuli engaged cortical regions associated with detailed emotional evaluation and motor planning, such as the orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and premotor areas, suggesting that processing fine-grained fear cues involves computationally demanding networks related to emotional resonance and action preparation. In contrast, LSF stimuli primarily activated motor-preparatory regions linked to rapid, action-oriented responses, highlighting the brain prioritization of quick readiness to low-detail threats. Notably, the amygdala showed no SF selectivity, supporting its role as a generalized “relevance detector” in emotional processing. The present study demonstrates that the brain flexibly adapts its SF processing strategy based on the visual details available in fearful bodily expressions, underscoring the complexity and adaptability of emotional processing from bodily signals.</span>

                <p>Substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) dopaminergic (DA) neurons are characterized by specific morphological and electrophysiological properties. First, in ~90% of the cases, their axon arises from an axon-bearing dendrite (ABD) at highly variable distances from the soma. Second, they display a highly regular pattern of spontaneous activity (aka pacemaking) and a broad action potential (AP) that faithfully back-propagates through the entire dendritic arbor. In previous studies (  <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B30">Moubarak et al., 2019</cross-ref>;   <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B31">Moubarak et al., 2022</cross-ref>), we demonstrated that the presence of a high density of sodium current in the ABD and the complexity of this dendrite played a critical role in the robustness of pacemaking and setting the half-width of the AP. In the current study, we investigated the postnatal development of both morphology and AP shape in SNc DA neurons in order to determine when and how the mature electrophysiological phenotype of these neurons was achieved. To do so, we performed electrophysiological recordings of SNc DA neurons at four postnatal ages (P3, P7, P14, P21) and fully reconstructed their dendritic and proximal axon morphology. Our results show that several morphological parameters, including the length of the ABD, display abrupt changes between P7 and P14, such that a mature morphology is reached by P14. We then showed that AP shape followed a similar timecourse. Using realistic multicompartment Hodgkin&ndash;Huxley modeling, we then demonstrated that the rapid morpho-electrical maturation of SNc DA neurons likely arises from synergistic increases in dendritic length and in somatodendritic sodium channel density.</p>

                <p>What the basal ganglia do is an oft-asked question; answers range from the selection of actions to the specification of movement to the estimation of time. Here, I argue that <I>how</I> the basal ganglia do what they do is a less-asked but equally important question. I show that the output regions of the basal ganglia create a stringent computational bottleneck, both structurally, because they have far fewer neurons than do their target regions, and dynamically, because of their tonic, inhibitory output. My proposed solution to this bottleneck is that the activity of an output neuron is setting the weight of a basis function, a function defined by that neuron&rsquo;s synaptic contacts. I illustrate how this may work in practice, allowing basal ganglia output to shift cortical dynamics and control eye movements via the superior colliculus. This solution can account for troubling issues in our understanding of the basal ganglia: why we see output neurons increasing their activity during behavior, rather than only decreasing as predicted by theories based on disinhibition, and why the output of the basal ganglia seems to have so many codes squashed into such a tiny region of the brain.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-134/v3?src=rss">Heavy Metal Contamination: Sources, Health Impacts, and Sustainable Mitigation Strategies with Insights from Nigerian Case Studies [version 3; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Heavy metal contamination has gradually become a highly significant global issue due to its continual existence in the environment and bioaccumulation in the ecosystems, posing deleterious risks to human health. This review aims to investigate the sources, pathways, and toxicological impacts of heavy metals such as cadmium, lead, mercury, and arsenic, elucidating their health consequences and plausible mitigation strategies. Furthermore, the review explores the dual origins of heavy metal contamination; natural geological processes and anthropogenic activities such as industrial emissions, mining, and agricultural practices. These heavy metals seep into soil, water, and food chains, leading to bioaccumulation, bio-magnification and causing significant health risks, including cardiovascular diseases, neurological disorders, and reproductive toxicity. Additionally, the addition of indigenous case studies from Nigeria, such as lead poisoning in Zamfara State and contamination in the Great Kwa River of Cross Rivers State underscores the disproportionate impact of heavy metal pollution in developing nations. These case studies reveal the socio-economic and environmental dimensions of the issue, providing a contextual understanding of region-specific vulnerabilities and health outcomes. To address these problems, the review evaluates already existing mitigation strategies, including chelation therapy and phytoremediation, while proposing sustainable, cost-effective solutions for reducing exposure and mitigating impacts. It emphasizes the importance of integrative approaches involving policy, community engagement, and technological innovations to fight heavy metal contamination effectively. In conclusion, this seminar contributes to the understanding of heavy metal toxicity, giving and showcasing very much important insights into the sources and health implications of contamination. By integrating theoretical perspectives with practical solutions, this review provides a robust framework for informing policy makers and advancing sustainable environmental management practices.

                Background Natural products databases are well-structured data sources that offer new molecular development opportunities in drug discovery, agrochemistry, food, cosmetics, and several other research disciplines or chemical industries. The crescent world’s interest in the development of these databases is related to the exploration of chemical diversity in geographical regions with rich biodiversity. Methods In this work, we introduce and discuss Nat-UV DB, the first natural products database from a coastal zone of Mexico. We discuss its construction, curation, and chemoinformatic characterization of their content, and chemical space coverage compared with other compound databases, like approved drugs, and other Mexican (BIOFACQUIM and UNIIQUIM databases) and the Latin American natural products database (LaNAPDB). Results Nat-UV DB comprises 227 compounds that contain 112 scaffolds, of which 52 are not present in previous natural product databases. The compounds present in Nat-UV DB have a similar size, flexibility, and polarity to previously reported natural products and approved drug datasets. Conclusions Nat-UV DB compounds have a higher structural and scaffold diversity than the approved drugs, but they have low structural and scaffold diversity in contrast with other natural products in the reference datasets. This database serves as a valuable addition to the global natural products landscape, bridging gaps in exploring biodiversity-rich regions.

                Objectives In an increasingly interconnected world, the effectiveness of health security (HeS) is pivotal in shaping informed health policies and enhancing public health outcomes. This study aims to analyses HeS in 27 non-EU European countries, identifying key priorities and trends, benchmarking against African and Eastern Mediterranean regions (EMR), and ranking and clustering health security performance to inform targeted interventions. Methods Utilizing 2019, 2021, and aggregated 2017–2021 data from six Global Health Security Index indicators, this study applied an integrated Entropy-CoCoSo-K-means framework. The Entropy method was employed to identify health security (HeS) priorities and trends in Non-EU countries, enabling cross-regional comparisons with African and EMR regions to highlight priority shifts and disparities. The Entropy-CoCoSo (Combined Compromise Solution) model generated dynamic rankings, while K-means clustering categorized countries into five risk clusters (high to dangerous). This integration facilitated cross-national dynamic rankings and cluster analyses, informing targeted interventions across Non-EU countries. Results Entropy analysis reveals that detection and reporting emerged as the most critical indicator (weight: 0.388), reflecting disparities in surveillance. The risk environment remains minimally influential (0.067), highlighting consistent vulnerabilities to external threats. Compliance with norms shows a sharp rise (0.091 → 0.123), indicating emerging regulatory gaps or uneven adherence to health standards post-2019. Cross-regional comparisons highlighted a focus on detection and reporting in non-EU countries versus an emphasis on prevention in Africa and healthcare infrastructure prioritization in the EMR. Ranking and clustering revealed stark disparities: Armenia, Norway, and the UK consistently ranked “High,” In contrast, Andorra, Monaco, San Marino, and Tajikistan (Cluster 5: “Dangerous”) exhibited systemic weaknesses. Conclusion This study underscores the need for tailored policies to address non-EU Europe’s evolving HeS challenges. Harmonizing surveillance systems, scaling preventive measures, and bridging compliance gaps are critical. Regional collaboration and resource reallocation to low-performing nations are essential to mitigate disparities.

                Background With rapid industrialization, urbanization, and population explosion in sub-Saharan Africa including Uganda, the population has experienced increased exposure to environmental lead subsequently causing extreme (>50μg/dL) and elevated (< 50μg/dL) blood lead levels. For example, means (Blood Lead levels) of 332μg/dL, 120μg/dL, 25μg/dL,11μg/dL, and 10μg/dL in children under 18 years of age in Nigeria, DR Congo, South Africa, Sudan, and Uganda respectively are reported. Susceptibility to lead toxicity correlates with one’s nutrition status, age, and genetics. This study expounded susceptibility to lead toxicity by relating blood lead levels, delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD) enzyme activity, and genetic variations of proteins that code for ALAD in urban children of Uganda aged between 6 and 60 months. Methods A total of 198 blood samples from randomly selected participants, children residing in the Katanga slum of Kampala, Uganda, were analyzed in duplicates for blood lead levels (BLL) on an atomic absorption spectrophotometer, Hemoglobin (Hb) levels, and ALAD enzyme activity were analyzed on a spectrophotometer before DNA extraction, polymerase chain reaction, and restriction fragment length digestion for ALAD polymorphism. The results are presented below. Results Geometric means of BLL (10.55μg/dL, SD = 7.4), Hb (7.85g/dL, SD = 1.3) and ALAD enzyme activity (37.15 units/L BLL, S. D = 9.7), corresponded to samples that coded for ALAD1 allele (99.5%) compared to the 0.5% that coded for ALAD2 with BLL (14.5μg/ dL, SD = 4.7), Hb (6.1 g/dL), ALAD enzyme activity (33.8 units/L, SD=1.45). There was a significant relationship with a negative linear correlation between BLL, Hb (status, and ALAD enzyme activity in the three isozymes (ALAD1-1, ALAD1-2, and ALAD2-2) in the strength of ALAD1-1 (r = 0.42, p-value = 0.02) ˂ ALAD1-2 (r = 0.62, effective size = 0.43, p-value = ˂ 0.001) ˂ ALAD2-2 (r = 0.67, effective size = 0.86, p-value = ˂ 0.001).

                Dental implants provide a reliable treatment option for completely or partially edentulous patients. In case of a membrane perforation, the gap can be closed using a piece of resorbable collagen membrane or by suturing the Schneiderian membrane using a resorbable suture. The present study shows a new development in this technique, which involves modifying the design of the absorbable membrane and using pins to fix the membrane. This study concluded that the novel design of the collagen membrane and its fixation with the pins led to greater stability of the bone graft and led to subsequent bone gain that enables dental implantation. Still, this technique requires a histological study to determine the nature of the bone formed.

[version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Type 3c diabetes mellitus (T3cDM) is a subtype that develops following pancreatic diseases, such as pancreatitis, impairing both exocrine and endocrine functions. Its management is challenging owing to exocrine enzyme deficiencies. Although plants have long been used for diabetes treatment, research on their role in T3cDM, particularly in exocrine enzymes, remains limited. The exact mechanisms by which enzymes and hormones interact remain unclear. Thus, this study aims to explore the role of Orthosiphon stamineus (OS) in glucose regulation by exploring both pancreatic endocrine and exocrine functions in the T3cDM Wistar Bonn/Kobori (WBN/Kob) pancreatitis rat model. Methods This protocol describes a planned, single-blind, randomized, controlled study conducted on animals to determine the efficacy of OS in regulating exocrine and endocrine pancreatic functions in a pancreatitis-induced WBN/Kob rat model. The groups will consist of control and different treatment groups. The duration of treatment is one month. A glucose tolerance test will be conducted orally before and after OS treatment. Blood glucose and insulin levels will be collected at different time points. Exocrine enzymes (amylase, lipase, and trypsinogen) and endocrine hormones (insulin, glucagon, ghrelin, pancreatic polypeptide, and somatostatin) will be measured in the serum. Hemoglobin A1c and lipid-soluble vitamins will also be evaluated. Results This pre-clinical study aims to explore pancreatic endocrine hormones and exocrine functions in response to OS treatment in rats with T3cDM pancreatitis. Body weight, diarrhea, and any adverse effects will be assessed as the secondary outcomes. Statistical analysis will be conducted to determine the significance of differences between the two groups. Conclusion This study protocol examines the efficacy of OS in addressing both exocrine and endocrine pancreatic dysfunction, ultimately aiding in blood glucose regulation. The findings of this study may help improve the health strategies of T3cDM patients and enhance patient outcomes.

                <p>by Luis A. Álvarez-García, Wolfram Liebermeister, Ian Leifer, Hernán A. Makse</p>

Symmetry principles play an important role in geometry, and physics, allowing for the reduction of complicated systems to simpler, more comprehensible models that preserve the system’s features of interest. Biological systems are often highly complex and may consist of a large number of interacting parts. Using symmetry fibrations, the relevant symmetries for biological “message-passing” networks, we introduce a scheme, called Complexity Reduction by Symmetry or CoReSym, to reduce the gene regulatory networks of <i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> bacteria to core networks in a way that preserves the dynamics and uncovers the computational capabilities of the network. Gene nodes in the original network that share isomorphic input trees are collapsed by the fibration into equivalence classes called fibers, whereby nodes that receive signals with the same “history” belong to one fiber and synchronize. Then we reduce the networks to its minimal computational core via k-core decomposition. This computational core consists of a few strongly connected components or “signal vortices,” in which signals can cycle through. While between them, these “signal vortices” transmit signals in a feedforward manner. These connected components perform signal processing and decision making in the bacterial cell by employing a series of genetic toggle-switch circuits that store memory, plus oscillator circuits. These circuits act as the central computation device of the network, whose output signals then spread to the rest of the network. Our reduction method opens the door to narrow the vast complexity of biological systems to their minimal parts in a systematic way by using fundamental theoretical principles of symmetry.

                <p>by Basile Confavreux, Everton J. Agnes, Friedemann Zenke, Henning Sprekeler, Tim P. Vogels</p>

Synaptic plasticity is a key player in the brain’s life-long learning abilities. However, due to experimental limitations, the mechanistic link between synaptic plasticity rules and the network-level computations they enable remain opaque. Here we use evolutionary strategies (ES) to meta learn local co-active plasticity rules in large recurrent spiking networks with excitatory (E) and inhibitory (I) neurons, using parameterizations of increasing complexity. We discover rules that robustly stabilize network dynamics for all four synapse types acting in isolation (E-to-E, E-to-I, I-to-E and I-to-I). More complex functions such as familiarity detection can also be included in the search constraints. However, our meta learning strategy begins to fail for co-active rules of increasing complexity, as it is challenging to devise loss functions that effectively constrain network dynamics to plausible solutions <i>a priori</i>. Moreover, in line with previous work, we can find multiple degenerate solutions with identical network behaviour. As a local optimization strategy, ES provides one solution at a time and makes exploration of this degeneracy cumbersome. Regardless, we can glean the interdependecies of various plasticity parameters by considering the covariance matrix learned alongside the optimal rule with ES. Our work provides a proof of principle for the success of machine-learning-guided discovery of plasticity rules in large spiking networks, and points at the necessity of more elaborate search strategies going forward.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012391">Efficient discovery of frequently co-occurring mutations in a sequence database with matrix factorization</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Michael Robert Kolar, Debasis Mitra, Valerie Kobzarenko</p>

We have developed a robust method for efficiently tracking multiple co-occurring mutations in a sequence database. Evolution often hinges on the interaction of several mutations to produce significant phenotypic changes that lead to the proliferation of a variant. However, identifying numerous simultaneous mutations across a vast database of sequences poses a significant computational challenge. Our approach leverages a matrix factorization technique to automatically and efficiently pinpoint subsets of positions where co-mutations occur, appearing in a substantial number of sequences within the database. We validated our method using SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domains, comprising approximately seven hundred thousand sequences of the Spike protein, demonstrating superior performance compared to a reasonably exhaustive brute-force method. Furthermore, we explore the biological significance of the identified <i>co-mutational positions</i> (CMPs) and their potential impact on the virus’s evolution and functionality, identifying key mutations in Delta and Omicron variants. This analysis underscores the significant role of identified CMPs in understanding the evolutionary trajectory. By tracking the “birth" and “death" of CMPs, we can elucidate the persistence and impact of specific groups of mutations across different viral strains, providing valuable insights into the virus’ adaptability and thus, possibly aiding vaccine design strategies.

                <p>by Juliana Zimmermann, Clara Boudriot, Christiane Eipert, Gabriel Hoffmann, Rachel Nuttall, Viktor Neumaier, Moritz Bonhoeffer, Sebastian Schneider, Lena Schmitzer, Jan Kufer, Stephan Kaczmarz, Dennis M Hedderich, Andreas Ranft, Daniel Golkowski, Josef Priller, Claus Zimmer, Rüdiger Ilg, Gerhard Schneider, Christine Preibisch, Christian Sorg, Benedikt Zott</p>

In the mammalian brain, the directed motion of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF-flux) is instrumental in the distribution and removal of solutes. Changes in total cerebral blood volume (CBV) have been hypothesized to drive CSF-flux. We tested this hypothesis in two multimodal brain imaging experiments in healthy humans, in which we drove large changes in total CBV by neuronal burst-suppression under anesthesia or by transient global vasodilation in a hypercapnic challenge. We indirectly monitored CBV changes with a high temporal resolution based on associated changes in total brain volume by functional MRI (fMRI) and measured cerebral blood flow by arterial spin-labeling. Relating CBV-sensitive signals to fMRI-derived measures of macroscopic CSF flow across the basal cisternae, we demonstrate that increasing total CBV extrudes CSF from the skull and decreasing CBV allows its influx. Moreover, CSF largely stagnates when CBV is stable. Together, our results establish the direct coupling between total CBV changes and CSF-flux.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3003137">Normal locomotion in zebrafish lacking the sodium channel NaV1.4 suggests that the need for muscle action potentials is not universal</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Chifumi Akiyama, Souhei Sakata, Fumihito Ono</p>

Extensive studies over decades have firmly established the concept that action potentials (APs) in muscles are indispensable for muscle contraction. To re-examine the significance of APs, we generated zebrafish lacking APs by editing the <i>scn4aa</i> and <i>scn4ab</i> genes, which together encode NaV1.4 (NaVDKO), using the CRISPR-Cas9 system. Surprisingly, the escape response of NaVDKOs to tactile stimuli, both in the embryonic and adult stages, was indistinguishable from that of wild-type (WT) fish. Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging using the calcium indicator protein GCaMP revealed that myofibers isolated from WT fish could be excited by the application of acetylcholine (ACh), even in the presence of tetrodotoxin (TTX) indicating that NaVs are dispensable for skeletal muscle contraction in zebrafish. Mathematical simulations showed that the end-plate potential was able to elicit a change in membrane potential large enough to activate the dihydropyridine receptors of the entire muscle fiber owing to the small fiber size and the disseminated distribution of neuromuscular synapses in both adults and embryos. Our data demonstrate that NaVs are not essential for muscle contraction in zebrafish and that the physiological significance of NaV1.4 in muscle is not uniform across vertebrates.

                Background Since the building sector contributes significantly to carbon emissions, using sustainable materials is more crucial than ever. Mycelium is investigated in this study as a natural substitute for conventional insulation materials like rock wool and XPS. Its thermal performance has been evaluated in a residential building in New Cairo, Egypt, using Design-Builder simulations, paying particular attention to U-values, discomfort hours, PPD-PMV, and energy consumption. The results demonstrate that mycelium is environmentally safe, biodegradable, and provides insulation that is comparable to XPS. This demonstrates its promise as a sustainable option for building in the future. Methods This research uses Design-Builder software version 7.3.0.046 integrated with Energy-Plus to simulate the thermal conductivity of mycelium compared to two of the most frequently utilized traditional materials for insulation in Egypt, in Janna Compound, New Cairo. The analysis examines energy consumption, thermal comfort, Predicted Mean Vote (PMV), and Predicted Percentage of Dissatisfaction (PPD%). The study provides a comparative evaluation of mycelium insulation compared to traditional materials like XPS and Rockwool. Results According to the simulation results, mycelium insulation performs comparably to XPS regarding U-values, discomfort hours, PPD-PMV, and energy consumption. Specifically, mycelium achieved a 0.323 U-value, reduced discomfort hours percentage to 16.9%, and achieved a ratio of energy reduction of 15.8% compared to the base case. These results demonstrate how mycelium has the potential to compete with traditional insulation materials while offering significant sustainability advantages, such as biodegradability and a lower carbon footprint. Conclusion In Janna Compound, New Cairo, the research shows how mycelium insulation can improve thermal comfort and save energy usage. It performs similarly to XPS but has more positive environmental effects. These results support the integration of mycelium into Egypt’s sustainable housing practices, providing key insights for architects, developers, and policymakers focused on energy-efficient and sustainable urban development.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-458/v1?src=rss">Internal and external risk factors analysis on pilot precondition in Indonesia [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Pilot errors accounted for 80% of accidents and 50% of serious incidents. The Human Factor Analysis and Classification System (HFACS) allows the identification of pilot preconditions as an imminent layer of error. This study aimed to analyze the correlation between internal and external risk factors and pilot preconditions in Indonesia. Methods A cross-sectional study design with purposive sampling, directed to male pilots who had flight duty in the past seven days, underwent medical examination at the Aviation Medical Center, Jakarta, August 12–16, 2024. The data were collected through a self-report questionnaire, Trail Making Test A and B, laboratory tests (plasma lipid, fasting blood glucose), and physical measurements (height, weight, waist circumference, and blood pressure). The independent variables included internal (Age, Burnout, Metabolic Syndrome parameters) and external (Flight Time, Duty Time, Unscheduled Flight Duty, Number of Sectors, Sleep Duration). The dependent variables were pilot preconditions based on the HFACS. Results A total of 122 participants participated in this study. Among them, 28.7% had an unscheduled flight duty in the last 30 d. Significant correlations were found between Adverse Mental State and HDL-cholesterol (95%CI=1.52 – 5.80), Adverse Physiological State and Burnout [personal (95%CI=0.005–0,04), work-related (95%CI=0.009–0.042)], Physical Mental Limitation and Fasting Blood Glucose (95%CI =(-0.479)–(-0.071)), and Number of Sectors (95%CI=0.022–3.001). For Personal Readiness (PR), a significant correlation was found between PR-psychological demand and Flight-Time One Year (95%CI=(0.000 – 0.001), Sleep Duration (95%CI =(-0.137)–(-0.013)), Waist Circumference (95%CI =(-0.014)–(-0.002)), PR-Social Support and Sleep Duration (95%IK=0.018–0.207), and Client-Related Burnout (95%IK =(-0.011)–(-0.002)). Conclusions The internal factors that correlated with pilot preconditions in Indonesia were waist circumference, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, fasting blood glucose, personal burnout, work, and client-related burnout. External factors that correlated with pilot preconditions were the number of sectors, Flight-Time One Year and Sleep duration. These findings emphasize the need to address both physical and mental health aspects of pilots to enhance aviation safety.

                Terminal myelocystocele (TMC) is a rare, skin-covered congenital spinal anomaly characterized by turbulent cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drainage, an elongated caudal spinal cord, terminal cystic dilation, and an intact dura mater. TMC is frequently associated with other congenital abnormalities affecting the anorectal, genitourinary, and vertebral systems, which necessitates careful clinical and radiological differentiation from other skin-covered spinal dysraphisms. We report a case of a two-week-old male neonate, born to a 19-year old primigravida mother, who presented with a large swelling in the lower back. Prenatal anatomical ultrasound at 20 weeks’ gestation had revealed sacrococcygeal anomalies. Postnatal spinal MRI demonstrated a well-defined, multi-lobulated sacrococcygeal cystic lesion with internal septations originating from an anterior sacral defect. Based on the imaging findings, differential diagnoses included a pure cystic sacrococcygeal teratoma and TMC. Surgical excision of the lesion was undertaken through two inverted V-shaped incisions along the caudal region. Following 8-months outpatient follow up, the infant did not demonstrate any neurological impairments. The potential for cyst expansion in TMC represents a significant clinical consideration, as it may indicate rapid neurological decline. Caregivers should be informed of this risk and advised to seek immediate medical attention if cyst enlargement is observed.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-456/v1?src=rss">Application of digital health technologies to substance use reduction among students in higher education institutions: A scoping review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Substance use among college and university students is associated with significant health issues, academic struggles, and premature death. This scoping review explores the potential of digital health interventions, including internet-based and mobile platforms, to reduce substance use. A comprehensive search across databases such as PubMed, PsycINFO, Scopus, and Google Scholar identified 11 eligible studies conducted across seven countries between 2013 and 2025. These studies focused primarily on alcohol use and included digital health tools like instant messaging, Telegram applications, text messaging, and web-based interventions. The results suggest that digital health technologies can effectively motivate college students in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) to reduce or abstain from psychoactive substance use. However, there is a notable research gap in evaluating the effectiveness and feasibility of these tools, especially mobile text messaging, which remains one of the most widely used methods in LMICs. The review highlights the need for further research, including systematic reviews and meta-analyses, to better understand the impact of digital health interventions on substance use reduction and to develop evidence-based programs for behavior change.

It also induces phenotypes commonly observed in patients, such as immune activation, metabolomic changes, and reduced skin innervation.

                Zhang et al. show that deficiency of the myeloid-lineage-specific membrane protein LRRC25 in the tumor microenvironment suppresses growth of multiple murine tumor models. This effect is mediated by reprogramming polarization of TAMs toward an anti-tumor phenotype and thereby enhancing infiltration and activation of CD8+T cells.

                Trypanosoma and Leishmania infections cause devastating neglected tropical diseases. These parasites harbor peroxisome-related organelles called glycosomes, which are essential for their survival. Krishna et al. established an inventory of glycosomal membrane proteins. They identified several proteins, including PEX15, which is essential for glycosome biogenesis and parasite survival.

                Brains of aging mice harbor rare monocyte-derived microglia (MoMg) that are transcriptomically indistinguishable from yolk-sac-derived cells. MoMg are targets of clonal hematopoiesis (CH) and, hence, could be a liability. Indeed, Kim et al. show in a mouse model that when harboring a CH-associated DNMT3a variant, MoMg cause motoric deficits.

                Zaidi et al. demonstrate that the loss of neurofibromin in macrophages enhances glucose uptake via membrane-bound GLUT1 in an Akt2-dependent manner, leading to increased glycolysis. This metabolic shift promotes a phenotypic switch from reparative to inflammatory macrophages, resulting in sustained inflammation and pathological neovascularization in retina and human NF1 tumors.

                Neurons fail to express Hsp70 protein during heat shock. Seluzicki et al. reveal that neuronal adaptation to heat shock accompanies a brake on mRNA translation, slowed elongating ribosomes, phosphorylation of eukaryotic elongation factor-2, and suppressed integrated stress response. If recovered within 1 h, translation is restored, and neurons survive.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100287">Stimulus representation in human frontal cortex supports flexible control in working memory</a></h4>

              
                When holding visual information temporarily in working memory (WM), the neural representation of the memorandum is distributed across various cortical regions, including visual and frontal cortices. However, the role of stimulus representation in visual and frontal cortices during WM has been controversial. Here, we tested the hypothesis that stimulus representation persists in the frontal cortex to facilitate flexible control demands in WM. During functional MRI, participants flexibly switched between simple WM maintenance of visual stimulus or more complex rule-based categorization of maintained stimulus on a trial-by-trial basis. Our results demonstrated enhanced stimulus representation in the frontal cortex that tracked demands for active WM control and enhanced stimulus representation in the visual cortex that tracked demands for precise WM maintenance. This differential frontal stimulus representation traded off with the newly-generated category representation with varying control demands. Simulation using multi-module recurrent neural networks replicated human neural patterns when stimulus information was preserved for network readout. Altogether, these findings help reconcile the long-standing debate in WM research, and provide empirical and computational evidence that flexible stimulus representation in the frontal cortex during WM serves as a potential neural coding scheme to accommodate the ever-changing environment.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105576">Pyruvate and related energetic metabolites modulate resilience against high genetic risk for glaucoma</a></h4>

              
                A glaucoma polygenic risk score (PRS) can effectively identify disease risk, but some individuals with high PRS do not develop glaucoma. Factors contributing to this resilience remain unclear. Using 4,658 glaucoma cases and 113,040 controls in a cross-sectional study of the UK Biobank, we investigated whether plasma metabolites enhanced glaucoma prediction and if a metabolomic signature of resilience in high-genetic-risk individuals existed. Logistic regression models incorporating 168 NMR-based metabolites into PRS-based glaucoma assessments were developed, with multiple comparison corrections applied. While metabolites weakly predicted glaucoma (Area Under the Curve = 0.579), they offered marginal prediction improvement in PRS-only-based models (p=0.004). We identified a metabolomic signature associated with resilience in the top glaucoma PRS decile, with elevated glycolysis-related metabolites—lactate (p=8.8E-12), pyruvate (p=1.9E-10), and citrate (p=0.02)—linked to reduced glaucoma prevalence. These metabolites combined significantly modified the PRS-glaucoma relationship (P<sub>interaction</sub> = 0.011). Higher total resilience metabolite levels within the highest PRS quartile corresponded to lower glaucoma prevalence (Odds Ratio<sub>highest vs. lowest total resilience metabolite quartile</sub>=0.71, 95% Confidence Interval = 0.64–0.80). As pyruvate is a foundational metabolite linking glycolysis to tricarboxylic acid cycle metabolism and ATP generation, we pursued experimental validation for this putative resilience biomarker in a human-relevant <i>Mus musculus</i> glaucoma model. Dietary pyruvate mitigated elevated intraocular pressure (p=0.002) and optic nerve damage (p&lt;0.0003) in <i>Lmx1b<sup>V265D</sup></i> mice. These findings highlight the protective role of pyruvate-related metabolism against glaucoma and suggest potential avenues for therapeutic intervention.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94590">RAS–p110α signalling in macrophages is required for effective inflammatory response and resolution of inflammation</a></h4>

              
                Macrophages are crucial in the body’s inflammatory response, with tightly regulated functions for optimal immune system performance. Our study reveals that the RAS–p110α signalling pathway, known for its involvement in various biological processes and tumourigenesis, regulates two vital aspects of the inflammatory response in macrophages: the initial monocyte movement and later-stage lysosomal function. Disrupting this pathway, either in a mouse model or through drug intervention, hampers the inflammatory response, leading to delayed resolution and the development of more severe acute inflammatory reactions in live models. This discovery uncovers a previously unknown role of the p110α isoform in immune regulation within macrophages, offering insight into the complex mechanisms governing their function during inflammation and opening new avenues for modulating inflammatory responses.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101075">Stabilization of GTSE1 by cyclin D1–CDK4/6-mediated phosphorylation promotes cell proliferation with implications for cancer prognosis</a></h4>

              
                In healthy cells, cyclin D1 is expressed during the G1 phase of the cell cycle, where it activates CDK4 and CDK6. Its dysregulation is a well-established oncogenic driver in numerous human cancers. The cancer-related function of cyclin D1 has been primarily studied by focusing on the phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma (RB) gene product. Here, using an integrative approach combining bioinformatic analyses and biochemical experiments, we show that GTSE1 (G-Two and S phases expressed protein 1), a protein positively regulating cell cycle progression, is a previously unrecognized substrate of cyclin D1–CDK4/6 in tumor cells overexpressing cyclin D1 during G1 and subsequent phases. The phosphorylation of GTSE1 mediated by cyclin D1–CDK4/6 inhibits GTSE1 degradation, leading to high levels of GTSE1 across all cell cycle phases. Functionally, the phosphorylation of GTSE1 promotes cellular proliferation and is associated with poor prognosis within a pan-cancer cohort.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101011">Molecular mapping and functional validation of GLP-1R cholesterol binding sites in pancreatic beta cells</a></h4>

              
                G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are integral membrane proteins which closely interact with their plasma membrane lipid microenvironment. Cholesterol is a lipid enriched at the plasma membrane with pivotal roles in the control of membrane fluidity and maintenance of membrane microarchitecture, directly impacting on GPCR stability, dynamics, and function. Cholesterol extraction from pancreatic beta cells has previously been shown to disrupt the internalisation, clustering, and cAMP responses of the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R), a class B1 GPCR with key roles in the control of blood glucose levels via the potentiation of insulin secretion in beta cells and weight reduction via the modulation of brain appetite control centres. Here, we unveil the detrimental effect of a high cholesterol diet on GLP-1R-dependent glucoregulation in vivo, and the improvement in GLP-1R function that a reduction in cholesterol synthesis using simvastatin exerts in pancreatic islets. We next identify and map sites of cholesterol high occupancy and residence time on active <i>vs</i> inactive GLP-1Rs using coarse-grained molecular dynamics (cgMD) simulations, followed by a screen of key residues selected from these sites and detailed analyses of the effects of mutating one of these, Val229, to alanine on GLP-1R-cholesterol interactions, plasma membrane behaviours, clustering, trafficking and signalling in INS-1 832/3 rat pancreatic beta cells and primary mouse islets, unveiling an improved insulin secretion profile for the V229A mutant receptor. This study (1) highlights the role of cholesterol in regulating GLP-1R responses in vivo; (2) provides a detailed map of GLP-1R - cholesterol binding sites in model membranes; (3) validates their functional relevance in beta cells; and (4) highlights their potential as locations for the rational design of novel allosteric modulators with the capacity to fine-tune GLP-1R responses.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93781">Accelerated signal propagation speed in human neocortical dendrites</a></h4>

              
                Human-specific cognitive abilities depend on information processing in the cerebral cortex, where the neurons are significantly larger and their processes longer and sparser compared to rodents. We found that, in synaptically connected layer 2/3 pyramidal cells (L2/3 PCs), the delay in signal propagation from soma to soma is similar in humans and rodents. To compensate for the longer processes of neurons, membrane potential changes in human axons and/or dendrites must propagate faster. Axonal and dendritic recordings show that the propagation speed of action potentials (APs) is similar in human and rat axons, but the forward propagation of excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) and the backward propagation of APs are 26 and 47% faster in human dendrites, respectively. Experimentally-based detailed biophysical models have shown that the key factor responsible for the accelerated EPSP propagation in human cortical dendrites is the large conductance load imposed at the soma by the large basal dendritic tree. Additionally, larger dendritic diameters and differences in cable and ion channel properties in humans contribute to enhanced signal propagation. Our integrative experimental and modeling study provides new insights into the scaling rules that help maintain information processing speed albeit the large and sparse neurons in the human cortex.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98851">Monoclonal antibodies derived from B cells in subjects with cystic fibrosis reduce Pseudomonas aeruginosa burden in mice</a></h4>

              
                <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> (PA) is an opportunistic, frequently multidrug-resistant pathogen that can cause severe infections in hospitalized patients. Antibodies against the PA virulence factor, PcrV, protect from death and disease in a variety of animal models. However, clinical trials of PcrV-binding antibody-based products have thus far failed to demonstrate benefit. Prior candidates were derivations of antibodies identified using protein-immunized animal systems and required extensive engineering to optimize binding and/or reduce immunogenicity. Of note, PA infections are common in people with cystic fibrosis (pwCF), who are generally believed to mount normal adaptive immune responses. Here, we utilized a tetramer reagent to detect and isolate PcrV-specific B cells in pwCF and, via single-cell sorting and paired-chain sequencing, identified the B cell receptor (BCR) variable region sequences that confer PcrV-specificity. We derived multiple high affinity anti-PcrV monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from PcrV-specific B cells across three donors, including mAbs that exhibit potent anti-PA activity in a murine pneumonia model. This robust strategy for mAb discovery expands what is known about PA-specific B cells in pwCF and yields novel mAbs with potential for future clinical use.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97614">Cerebellar Purkinje cells control posture in larval zebrafish (Danio rerio)</a></h4>

              
                Cerebellar dysfunction leads to postural instability. Recent work in freely moving rodents has transformed investigations of cerebellar contributions to posture. However, the combined complexity of terrestrial locomotion and the rodent cerebellum motivate new approaches to perturb cerebellar function in simpler vertebrates. Here, we adapted a validated chemogenetic tool (TRPV1/capsaicin) to describe the role of Purkinje cells — the output neurons of the cerebellar cortex — as larval zebrafish swam freely in depth. We achieved both bidirectional control (activation and ablation) of Purkinje cells while performing quantitative high-throughput assessment of posture and locomotion. Activation modified postural control in the pitch (nose-up/nose-down) axis. Similarly, ablations disrupted pitch-axis posture and fin-body coordination responsible for climbs. Postural disruption was more widespread in older larvae, offering a window into emergent roles for the developing cerebellum in the control of posture. Finally, we found that activity in Purkinje cells could individually and collectively encode tilt direction, a key feature of postural control neurons. Our findings delineate an expected role for the cerebellum in postural control and vestibular sensation in larval zebrafish, establishing the validity of TRPV1/capsaicin-mediated perturbations in a simple, genetically tractable vertebrate. Moreover, by comparing the contributions of Purkinje cell ablations to posture in time, we uncover signatures of emerging cerebellar control of posture across early development. This work takes a major step towards understanding an ancestral role of the cerebellum in regulating postural maturation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100731">A host enzyme reduces metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) by inactivating intestinal lipopolysaccharide</a></h4>

              
                The incidence of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) has been increasing worldwide. Since gut-derived bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) can travel via the portal vein to the liver and play an important role in producing hepatic pathology, it seemed possible that (1) LPS stimulates hepatic cells to accumulate lipid, and (2) inactivating LPS can be preventive. Acyloxyacyl hydrolase (AOAH), the eukaryotic lipase that inactivates LPS and oxidized phospholipids, is produced in the intestine, liver, and other organs. We fed mice either normal chow or a high-fat diet for 28 weeks and found that <i>Aoah<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice accumulated more hepatic lipid than did <i>Aoah<sup>+/+</sup></i> mice. In young mice, before increased hepatic fat accumulation was observed, <i>Aoah<sup>-/-</sup></i> mouse livers increased their abundance of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1, and the expression of its target genes that promote fatty acid synthesis. <i>Aoah<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice also increased hepatic expression of <i>Cd36</i> and <i>Fabp3</i>, which mediate fatty acid uptake, and decreased expression of fatty acid-oxidation-related genes <i>Acot2</i> and <i>Ppara</i>. Our results provide evidence that increasing AOAH abundance in the gut, bloodstream, and/or liver may be an effective strategy for preventing or treating MASLD.

">Hebb's Vision: The Structural Underpinnings of Hebbian Assemblies</a></h4>

              
                In 1949, Donald Hebb proposed that groups of neurons that activate stereotypically form the organizational building blocks of perception, cognition, and behavior. He theorized that repeated activations induce the structural changes needed to group neurons in these assemblies. Despite Hebb's enduring influence, testing his predictions at relevant scales has been technically challenging. Here, we test the theory using a novel, large-scale dataset featuring in vivo calcium fluorescence imaging of neural activity with postmortem electron microscopy (EM) for detailed reconstruction of neurons from the same volume of mouse visual neocortex. A coregistration process matches EM-reconstructed neurons to their recorded fluorescence traces. From these traces, we extract neural assemblies from higher-order correlations in neural activity. We find multiple assemblies, many with overlapping neurons, and some neurons that do not participate in any assembly. We then show that these assemblies exhibit properties consistent with Hebb's theory, including more reliable responses to repeated natural movie inputs than size-matched random ensembles and superior decoding of visual stimuli. Using coregistration to probe structural correlates, we find that neurons that participate in assemblies are significantly more integrated into the structural network than those that do not. Contrary to Hebb's original prediction, we do not observe a marked increase in the strength of monosynaptic excitatory connections between cells participating in the same assembly. However, we find significantly stronger indirect feed-forward inhibitory connections targeting cells in other assemblies. Intuitively, the delineation of assemblies can be realized either by internal excitation or external inhibition. Our findings support the latter mechanism. These results show the utility of assemblies in perception and provide a structural underpinning. They lay the foundation for future studies looking at the utility of assemblies in cognition and behavior, as well as the mechanisms for the formation and maintenance of such assemblies.

                Oscillatory activities and network dynamics are fundamental to sensorimotor processing, motor control, and cognitive functions. Capturing the fast cortical dynamics underlying sensorimotor behaviors demands temporal resolution beyond conventional imaging methods. We employed pan-cortical JEDI-1P voltage imaging of layer 2/3 activity in a skilled reaching task to reveal previously inaccessible rapid networks dynamics. Our approach uncovered distinct spectral signatures including reward-related gamma oscillations in M2, global low-frequency suppression during movement execution, and 8 Hz large-amplitude oscillations in sensorimotor cortex during task disengagement. Using independent component analysis, we were able to separate multiplexed functional networks with fast temporal features shared among sensorimotor regions and slower dynamics such as a global preparatory ramp. These distributed activity patterns successfully predicted both sensorimotor parameters and trial outcomes. Our study bridges critical gaps in understanding rapid temporal organization of cortical networks during complex behaviors, revealing how fast neural dynamics coordinate to produce motor actions across distributed cortical regions.

">Early synaptic changes and reduced brain connectivity in PD-like mice with depressive phenotype</a></h4>

              
                Anxiety and depression are common in Parkinson's disease (PD), affecting quality of life. Aggregates of -synuclein (-Syn) are found in serotonergic (5-HT) raphe nuclei early in the disease, but their relationship to brain changes is unclear. We investigated synaptic plasticity, neuronal activity, and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)-based brain connectivity in a PD-like mouse model with depressive phenotype. AAV-induced human -Syn accumulation in raphe 5-HT neurons causes progressive synaptic pathology in interconnected brain regions. This is marked by lower MAP-2, PSD95 and higher SV2A, VAMP2, which are key to synaptic structure and function, as confirmed in human brain tissue samples. Abnormalities in Egr-1-dependent neuronal activity and region-specific differences in resting-state functional brain activity were also detected eight weeks post-AAV infusion, before neurodegeneration. This provides evidence for synaptic and fMRI markers associated with -Syn pathology in emotional brain circuits, and has translational importance for identifying PD patients at risk for depression.

                Dopamine (DA) is critically involved in processes such as reward anticipation, attention, and decision-making. The present study examined the temporal dynamics of phasic DA transients in the nucleus accumbens core (NAcC) during a visual decisional task based on signal detection theory, using the fluorescent DA sensor dLight1.3b. During the decision-making phase, DA transients in the NAcC encoded real-time outcome expectancy, apparently reflecting the confidence of rats in their choices. Reward prediction errors (RPEs) emerged following reward delivery and omission and were amplified under conditions of increased uncertainty, produced either by degrading the visual target or introducing interfering distraction. Moreover, DA transients were elicited on both visual signal and no-signal trials. These findings demonstrate that DA fluctuations in the NAcC reflect the RPE that incorporates confidence and levels of uncertainty, emphasizing an involvement of nucleus accumbens DA in adaptive decision-making.

">Tracking neural representations of attended and unattended features in multisensory working memory over time</a></h4>

              
                Working memory supports goal-directed behavior by maintaining task-relevant information. However, a growing number of studies shows that even task-irrelevant features are automatically encoded and can interfere with the recall of task-relevant information. While this phenomenon is well documented in unisensory contexts, it remains unclear whether and how task-irrelevant information persists in multisensory working memory. We examine the role of cross-modal binding by tracking the dynamic neural representation of audio-visual objects under varying selective attention conditions, using an EEG-based audio-visual delayed-match-to-sample task. Participants attended to either auditory or visual features (selective attention), or to both features (conjunction) of two sequential audio-visual items and subsequently compared those task-relevant features to an audio-visual probe. Further, to investigate the influence of bottom-up factors on cross-modal binding, we manipulated spatial congruency by presenting both features from either the same (i.e., in the center) or from disparate positions. Behaviorally, task-irrelevant features interfered with performance even under selective attention, consistent with automatic cross-modal binding and encoding into working memory. This interference was even stronger with spatially disparate presentation, suggesting that bottom-up attentional dynamics strengthen cross-modal bindings and their subsequent storage. Condition-level representational similarity analysis (RSA) showed that EEG activity patterns under selective attention more closely resembled those of conjunction trials than unisensory trials, indicating that task-irrelevant features were incorporated into multisensory object-level representations. This conjunction-similarity persisted in attend-visual trials, but declined over time in attend-auditory trials, reflecting partial filtering of task-irrelevant orientations. Crucially, activity patterns never shifted fully towards an auditory-only profile, indicating that irrelevant visual features were not fully excluded. In addition, feature-level RSA corroborated that both sound frequency-specific and orientation-specific information were present in EEG activity patterns, irrespective of the attended modality. Overall, these results demonstrate the persistence of task-irrelevant information in multisensory working memory and offer critical insights into how attentional processes shape its representational architecture.

">Characterization of Human Anterior Neural Organoids as a Model for Investigating Cohen Syndrome</a></h4>

              
                Neural organoids display three-dimensional (3D) structures that resemble in vivo neural architectures. Previously, we developed a novel two-dimensional (2D) neural induction-based protocol for culturing spinal cord organoids, enabling size control and recapitulating neural tube morphogenesis. In this study, we evaluated the application of this concept to induce the anterior regions of the brain and generate human anterior neural organoids (hANOs). By inducing neuroepithelial (NE) cells in 2D and re-aggregating them led to tube-forming morphogenesis similar to that posterior spinal cord induction. The transcriptome profiles of these hANOs resembled the frontal cortex of 20 weeks post-conception (PCW) human embryos. Using this hANOs protocol, we investigated microcephaly phenotypes associated with Cohen syndrome (CS), caused by biallelic loss-of-function variants in VPS13B gene. Deleting VPS13B in human pluripotent stem cells resulted in Golgi dispersion and growth retardation onset in mutant hANOs, akin to CS patients with postnatal microcephaly. This delay is partly linked to reduced neuronal growth. Additionally, mature CS organoids showed enhanced hyper-excitability associated with an excitatory/inhibitory imbalance. In conclusion, this protocol is suitable for studying microcephaly phenotypes from human genetic mutations due to its simplicity and scalability.

">Activity deprivation modulates the Shank3/Homer1/mGluR5 signaling pathway to enable synaptic upscaling</a></h4>

              
                Shank3 is an autism spectrum disorder-associated postsynaptic scaffold protein that links glutamate receptors to trafficking and signaling networks within the postsynaptic density. Shank3 is required for synaptic scaling (Tatavarty et al., 2020), a form of homeostatic plasticity that bidirectionally modulates post-synaptic strength in the right direction to stabilize neuronal activity. Shank3 undergoes activity-dependent phosphorylation/dephosphorylation at S1586/S1615, and dephosphorylation at these sites is critical for enabling synaptic upscaling (Wu et al., 2022). Here, we probe the molecular machinery downstream of Shank3 dephosphorylation that allows for synaptic upscaling. We first show that a phosphomimetic mutant of Shank3 has reduced binding ability and interaction with long-form Homer1, a postsynaptic protein also crucial for scaling, and a known binding partner of Shank3. Since metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) has been shown to associate with Shank3 through long-form Homer1, we manipulated mGluR5 signaling with either noncompetitive or competitive inhibitors and found that only competitive inhibition (which targets agonist-dependent signaling) impairs synaptic upscaling. Further, we found that mGluR5 activation rescues synaptic upscaling in the presence of phosphomimetic Shank3, thus is downstream of Shank3 phosphorylation. Finally, we identify necessary signaling pathways downstream of group I mGluR. Taken together, these data show that activity-dependent dephosphorylation of Shank3 remodels the Shank3/Homer1/mGluR signaling pathway to favor agonist-dependent mGluR signaling, which is necessary to enable synaptic upscaling. More broadly, because downscaling depends on agonist-independent mGluR5 signaling, these findings demonstrate that synaptic up and downscaling rely on distinct functional configurations of the same signaling elements.

">Complementary cortical and striatal encoding of locomotor preparation and performance</a></h4>

              
                Cortical and striatal circuits play an important role in motor planning and execution, and encode movement-related information. While neural dynamics in these areas show substantial similarities, possibly reflecting shared information content, studies directly comparing the cortical and striatal encoding of locomotor preparation and performance have been lacking. Here we contrasted the neural coding properties of mouse primary motor and medial prefrontal cortex, as well as dorsolateral and dorsomedial striatum, prior to and during bouts of self-initiated walking. All four areas contained cells active during both the preparatory and performance periods of locomotion. However, the decoding of behaviorally relevant information using population-level activity revealed significant regional variations. Specifically, dorsomedial striatum more accurately encoded the preparatory period prior to walking, while primary motor cortex more accurately encoded rhythmic limb kinematics during walking. Together, this work provides evidence for a complementary neural coding scheme for locomotor preparation and performance in cortical and striatal circuits.

">Large Language Models Reveal the Neural Tracking of Linguistic Context in Attended and Unattended Multi-Talker Speech</a></h4>

              
                Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong alignment with contextualized semantic encoding in the brain, offering a new avenue for studying language processing. However, natural speech often occurs in multi-talker environments, which remain underexplored. We investigated how auditory attention modulates context tracking using electrocorticography (ECoG) and stereoelectroencephalography (sEEG) from three epilepsy patients in a two-conversation "cocktail party" paradigm. LLM embeddings were used to predict brain responses to attended and unattended speech streams. Results show that LLMs reliably predict brain activity for the attended stream, and notably, contextual features from the unattended stream also contribute to prediction. Importantly, the brain appears to track shorter-range context in the unattended stream compared to the attended one. These findings reveal that the brain processes multiple speech streams in parallel, modulated by attention, and that LLMs can be valuable tools for probing neural language encoding in complex auditory settings.

">Activation of complement protein C3 depicts the dynamic tissue damage of the cochlea after noise trauma.</a></h4>

              
                Hearing loss is characterized by dysfunction and pathological changes of the cochlea, including the loss of sensory hair cells and connected synapses. Growing evidence has revealed that the immune system plays critical roles in shaping cochlear responses to tissue injury and the clearance of damaged cells under pathological conditions such as noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). However, the underlying mechanisms that regulate this process remain unclear. As a crucial part of the innate immune system, the complement system is widely known to respond to tissue damage and help remove cellular debris. Such functions are yet to be fully explored in the auditory system, especially in the cochlea. Among various complement factors, the activation of complement protein C3 is an essential functional hub of the complement cascade, resulting in the phagocytosis of dead or dying cells. In this study, we sought to investigate whether C3 exists in the cochlea and what roles it might play upon noise injury. To test this, we studied C3 activation using immunohistochemistry in the cochleae of various mouse models that were noise exposed to an octave band noise (8-16 kHz) for two hours at 112 dB SPL. Mice were sacrificed at various post exposure times to examine cochlear pathology. We found damage dependent C3 activity in the organ of Corti in mice after noise exposure (NE), especially in damaged outer hair cell (OHC) area. Specifically, C3 opsonized damaged cellular structures include degenerating OHCs, OHC debris, ribbon synapses, and efferent synaptic boutons, and the temporal dynamics of the opsonization closely resemble the timing of cochlear tissue damages post exposure. Unexpectedly, C3-deficient mice exhibited similar ABR thresholds and OHC counts at baseline as wild type mice, as well as comparable ABR threshold shifts and OHC loss after NE. However, we observed significantly reduced MOC terminal bouton degeneration in C3-deficient mice upon 112 dB SPL noise injury, indicating that C3 does modulate tissue damage and clearance, at least at the MOC terminals. Our results suggest that complement C3 is dynamically activated in the cochlea upon noise injury, which may play significant roles in damage recognition and further immune recruitment during the development of NIHL.
