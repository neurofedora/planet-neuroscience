              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00968">Measuring the entropy of a neuron cell from its membrane current signal</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2508.00968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this study was to investigate how the entropy of a neuron cell can be measured using membrane ion current signals, which were recorded from neurons in the mouse medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). The sample entropy and the Scalogram entropy were used as entropy measurement methods. It is well known that the entropy increases in the direction of the movement of the system towards the equilibrium. Therefore, in the process of the electrical activity of a living cell, the entropy is expected to reach a maximum at the moment when the membrane potential reaches the 'Nernst equilibrium potential' (or ionic equilibrium) of the ions. However, it was observed that the entropy values obtained by traditional calculations did not reach the peak at the equilibrium state of the ions. Therefore, two modifications to these measurement methods were proposed to adjust the entropy value to the maximum at the equilibrium potential of the ions. As a result of these proposed modifications, the entropy values were observed to peak around the equilibrium potential of the ions. These refined approaches were successfully validated using the Logistic map. Additionally, the entropy results were compared with Lyapunov exponents. The results show that the behaviour of living cells can be analysed using entropy measurements. The results also suggest that the method could be used to detect differences in the behaviour of tumour and normal cells, or the effects of drugs on cells.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01252">Algebraic Connectivity Enhances Hyperedge Specificity in the Alzheimer's Disease Continuum</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2508.01252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Functional MRI is a neuroimaging technique aiming at analyzing the functional activity of the brain by measuring blood-oxygen-level-dependent signals throughout the brain. The derived functional features can be used for investigating brain alterations in neurological and psychiatric disorders. In this work, we employed the hypergraph structure to model high-order functional relations across brain regions, introducing algebraic connectivity (a(G)) for estimating the hyperedge weights. The hypergraph structure was derived from healthy controls to build a common topological structure across individuals. The considered cohort included subjects covering the Alzheimer's disease (AD) continuum, that is both mild cognitive impairment and AD patients. Statistical analysis was performed using the hyperedges' weights as features to assess the differences across the three groups. Additionally, a mediation analysis was performed to evaluate the effectiveness and reliability of the a(G) values, representing the functional information, as the mediator between tau-PET levels, a key biomarker of AD, and cognitive scores. The proposed approach outperformed state-of-the-art methods in identifying a larger number of hyperedges statistically different across groups. Among these, two hyperedges belonging to salience ventral attention and somatomotor networks showed a partial mediation effect between the tau biomarkers and cognitive decline. These results suggested that the a(G) can be an effective approach for extracting the hyperedge weights, including important functional information that resides in the brain areas forming the hyperedges.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01307">Patterns of imbalance states between sub-brain regimes during development in the resting state</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2508.01307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The functional brain network is the result of neurons and different areas working together in a coordinated manner. The findings indicate that the spatial distribution of anticorrelations in the brain network is not inherent. In this study, using Heider balance theory, we examine the network of imbalanced triangles with negative links in the brain, which undergoes dynamic changes across development. By analyzing the age-related transformations in the connectivity of imbalanced triangles at the level of brain subnetworks. We show that anticorrelations evolve from childhood to adulthood, reflecting a developmental trajectory from a locally modular organization in childhood, through a flexible and reconfigurable architecture during adolescence, to a highly segregated and functionally specialized network system in adulthood. This mature configuration supports a balance between internally directed cognition and external task demands, enabling efficient and adaptive cognitive control. Specifically, in childhood, prominent anticorrelations were observed between the default mode network (DMN) and the dorsal attention network (DAN), as well as between the default mode network (DMN) and the ventral attention network (VAN). During adolescence, these anticorrelations persisted but became weaker. By adulthood, dominant anticorrelations were observed between the DMN and both the DAN and the frontoparietal network (FPN).

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01920">CITS: Nonparametric Statistical Causal Modeling for High-Resolution Neural Time Series</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2508.01920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how signals propagate through neural circuits is central to deciphering brain computation. While functional connectivity captures statistical associations, it does not reveal directionality or causal mechanisms. We introduce CITS (Causal Inference in Time Series), a non-parametric method for inferring statistically causal neural circuitry from high-resolution time series data. CITS models neural dynamics using a structural causal model with arbitrary Markov order and tests for time-lagged conditional independence using either Gaussian or distribution-free statistics. Unlike classical Granger Causality, which assumes linear autoregressive models and Gaussian noise, or the Peter-Clark algorithm, which assumes i.i.d. data and no temporal structure, CITS handles temporally dependent, potentially non-Gaussian data with flexible testing procedures. We prove consistency under mild mixing assumptions and validate CITS on simulated linear, nonlinear, and continuous-time recurrent neural network data, where it outperforms state-of-the-art methods. We then apply CITS to Neuropixels recordings from mouse brain during visual tasks. CITS uncovers interpretable, stimulus-specific causal circuits linking cortical, thalamic, and hippocampal regions, consistent with experimental literature. It also reveals that neurons with similar orientation selectivity indices are more likely to be causally connected. Our results demonstrate the utility of CITS in uncovering biologically meaningful pathways and generating hypotheses for future experimental studies.

                arXiv:2508.02059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate reconstruction of neuronal morphology is essential for classifying cell types and understanding brain connectivity. Recent advances in imaging and reconstruction techniques have greatly expanded the scale and quality of neuronal data. However, large-scale, standardized annotated datasets remain limited. Here, we present an open, multi-level neuronal dataset covering the whole mouse brain. Using a hierarchical strategy, we divided imaging data from 237 mouse brains into about 13,570,000 standardized blocks, classified into four levels of reconstruction difficulty. With the custom-developed reconstruction platform, we achieved high-precision three-dimensional reconstructions of 9,676 neurons at the whole-brain scale. This dataset will be made publicly available, providing a valuable resource for algorithm development and brain circuit modeling in neuroscience research.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02436">Distinct inhibitory connectivity motifs trigger distinct forms of anticipation in the retinal network</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2508.02436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motion is an important feature of visual scenes and retinal neuronal circuits selectively signal different motion features. It has been shown that the retina can extrapolate the position of a moving object, thereby compensating sensory transmission delays and enabling signal processing in real-time. Amacrine cells, the inhibitory interneurons of the retina, play essential roles in such computations although their precise function remain unclear. Here, we computationally explore the effect of two different inhibitory connectivity motifs on the retina's response to moving objects: feed-forward and recurrent feed-back inhibition. We show that both can account for motion anticipation with two different mechanisms. Feed-forward inhibition truncates motion responses and shifts peak responses forward via subtractive inhibition, whereas recurrent feedback coupling evokes, via divisive inhibition, excitatory and inhibitory waves with different phases that add up and shift the response peak. A key difference between the two mechanisms is how the peak response scales with the speed of a moving object. Motion prediction with feedforward circuits monotonically decreases with increasing speeds, while recurrent feedback coupling induces tuning curves that exhibit a preferred speed for which motion prediction is maximal.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02620">Perception of dynamic multi-speaker auditory scenes under different modes of attention</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2508.02620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Attention is not monolithic; rather, it operates in multiple forms to facilitate efficient cognitive processing. In the auditory domain, attention enables the prioritization of relevant sounds in an auditory scene and can be either attracted by elements in the scene in a bottom-up fashion or directed towards features, objects, or the entire scene in a top-down fashion. How these modes of attention interact and whether their neural underpinnings are distinct remains unclear. In this work, we investigate the perceptual and neural correlates of different attentional modes in a controlled "cocktail party" paradigm, where listeners listen to the same stimuli and attend to either a spatial location (feature-based), a speaker (object-based), or the entire scene (global or free-listening) while detecting deviations in pitch of a voice in the scene. Our findings indicate that object-based attention is more perceptually effective than feature-based or global attention. Furthermore, object-based and spatial-based attention engage distinct neural mechanisms and are differentially modulated by bottom-up salience. Notably, while bottom-up salience aids in the initial segregation of auditory objects, it plays a reduced role in object tracking once attention has been voluntarily allocated. In addition, decoding the stimulus envelope from the EEG data revealed a source-sampling scheme in the global attention mode that is not present in the object or spatial modes. Overall, the study shows that the perception of the same acoustic scene differs according to the listening task, guided by an interaction between top-down and bottom-up processes.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01992">Toward Efficient Spiking Transformers: Synapse Pruning Meets Synergistic Learning-Based Compensation</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2508.01992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As a foundational architecture of artificial intelligence models, Transformer has been recently adapted to spiking neural networks with promising performance across various tasks. However, existing spiking Transformer (ST)-based models require a substantial number of parameters and incur high computational costs, thus limiting their deployment in resource-constrained environments. To address these challenges, we propose combining synapse pruning with a synergistic learning-based compensation strategy to derive lightweight ST-based models. Specifically, two types of tailored pruning strategies are introduced to reduce redundancy in the weight matrices of ST blocks: an unstructured $\mathrm{L_{1}P}$ method to induce sparse representations, and a structured DSP method to induce low-rank representations. In addition, we propose an enhanced spiking neuron model, termed the synergistic leaky integrate-and-fire (sLIF) neuron, to effectively compensate for model pruning through synergistic learning between synaptic and intrinsic plasticity mechanisms. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed methods significantly reduce model size and computational overhead while maintaining competitive performance. These results validate the effectiveness of the proposed pruning and compensation strategies in constructing efficient and high-performing ST-based models.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02560">Explainable AI Methods for Neuroimaging: Systematic Failures of Common Tools, the Need for Domain-Specific Validation, and a Proposal for Safe Application</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2508.02560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trustworthy interpretation of deep learning models is critical for neuroimaging applications, yet commonly used Explainable AI (XAI) methods lack rigorous validation, risking misinterpretation. We performed the first large-scale, systematic comparison of XAI methods on ~45,000 structural brain MRIs using a novel XAI validation framework. This framework establishes verifiable ground truth by constructing prediction tasks with known signal sources - from localized anatomical features to subject-specific clinical lesions - without artificially altering input images. Our analysis reveals systematic failures in two of the most widely used methods: GradCAM consistently failed to localize predictive features, while Layer-wise Relevance Propagation generated extensive, artifactual explanations that suggest incompatibility with neuroimaging data characteristics. Our results indicate that these failures stem from a domain mismatch, where methods with design principles tailored to natural images require substantial adaptation for neuroimaging data. In contrast, the simpler, gradient-based method SmoothGrad, which makes fewer assumptions about data structure, proved consistently accurate, suggesting its conceptual simplicity makes it more robust to this domain shift. These findings highlight the need for domain-specific adaptation and validation of XAI methods, suggest that interpretations from prior neuroimaging studies using standard XAI methodology warrant re-evaluation, and provide urgent guidance for practical application of XAI in neuroimaging.

                arXiv:2508.02633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in experimental techniques enable the simultaneous recording of activity from thousands of neurons in the brain, presenting both an opportunity and a challenge: to build meaningful, scalable models of large neural populations. Correlations in the brain are typically weak but widespread, suggesting that a mean-field approach might be effective in describing real neural populations, and we explore a hierarchy of maximum entropy models guided by this idea. We begin with models that match only the mean and variance of the total population activity, and extend to models that match the experimentally observed mean and variance of activity along multiple projections of the neural state. Confronted by data from several different brain regions, these models are driven toward a first-order phase transition, characterized by the presence of two nearly degenerate minima in the energy landscape, and this leads to predictions in qualitative disagreement with other features of the data. To resolve this problem we introduce a novel class of models that constrain the full probability distribution of activity along selected projections. We develop the mean-field theory for this class of models and apply it to recordings from 1000+ neurons in the mouse hippocampus. This 'distributional mean--field' model provides an accurate and consistent description of the data, offering a scalable and principled approach to modeling complex neural population dynamics.

                arXiv:2310.07543v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Characterizing judgments of similarity within a perceptual or semantic domain, and making inferences about the underlying structure of this domain from these judgments, has an increasingly important role in cognitive and systems neuroscience. We present a new framework for this purpose that makes limited assumptions about how perceptual distances are converted into similarity judgments. The approach starts from a dataset of empirical judgments of relative similarities: the fraction of times that a subject chooses one of two comparison stimuli to be more similar to a reference stimulus. These empirical judgments provide Bayesian estimates of underling choice probabilities. From these estimates, we derive indices that characterize the set of judgments in three ways: compatibility with a symmetric dis-similarity, compatibility with an ultrametric space, and compatibility with an additive tree. Each of the indices is derived from rank-order relationships among the choice probabilities that, as we show, are necessary and sufficient for local consistency with the three respective characteristics. We illustrate this approach with simulations and example psychophysical datasets of dis-similarity judgments in several visual domains and provide code that implements the analyses at https://github.com/jvlab/simrank.

                arXiv:2506.02044v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to revolutionize AI research, there is a growing interest in building large-scale brain foundation models to advance neuroscience. While most existing brain foundation models are pre-trained on time-series signals or connectome features, we propose a novel graph-based pre-training paradigm for constructing a brain graph foundation model. In this paper, we introduce the Brain Graph Foundation Model, termed BrainGFM, a unified framework that leverages graph contrastive learning and graph masked autoencoders for large-scale fMRI-based pre-training. BrainGFM is pre-trained on a diverse mixture of brain atlases with varying parcellations, significantly expanding the pre-training corpus and enhancing the model's ability to generalize across heterogeneous fMRI-derived brain representations. To support efficient and versatile downstream transfer, we integrate both graph prompts and language prompts into the model design, enabling BrainGFM to flexibly adapt to a wide range of atlases, neurological and psychiatric disorders, and task settings. Furthermore, we employ meta-learning to optimize the graph prompts, facilitating strong generalization to previously unseen disorders under both few-shot and zero-shot learning conditions via language-guided prompting. BrainGFM is pre-trained on 27 neuroimaging datasets spanning 25 common neurological and psychiatric disorders, encompassing 2 types of brain atlases (functional and anatomical) across 8 widely-used parcellations, and covering over 25,000 subjects, 60,000 fMRI scans, and a total of 400,000 graph samples aggregated across all atlases and parcellations. The code is available at: https://github.com/weixinxu666/BrainGFM

                arXiv:2506.05794v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a continuous, information-theoretic extension of the Free Energy Principle through the concept of Markov blanket density, i.e., a scalar field that quantifies the degree of conditional independence between internal and external states at each point in space (ranging from 0 for full coupling to 1 for full separation). It demonstrates that active inference dynamics, including the minimization of variational and expected free energy, naturally emerge from spatial gradients in this density, making Markov blanket density a necessary foundation for the Free Energy Principle. These ideas are developed through a mathematically framework that links density gradients to precise and testable dynamics, offering a foundation for novel predictions and simulation paradigms.

Abstract: Neural synchrony is hypothesized to play a crucial role in how the brain organizes visual scenes into structured representations, enabling the robust encoding of multiple objects within a scene. However, current deep learning models often struggle with object binding, limiting their ability to represent multiple objects effectively. Inspired by neuroscience, we investigate whether synchrony-based mechanisms can enhance object encoding in artificial models trained for visual categorization. Specifically, we combine complex-valued representations with Kuramoto dynamics to promote phase alignment, facilitating the grouping of features belonging to the same object. We evaluate two architectures employing synchrony: a feedforward model and a recurrent model with feedback connections to refine phase synchronization using top-down information. Both models outperform their real-valued counterparts and complex-valued models without Kuramoto synchronization on tasks involving multi-object images, such as overlapping handwritten digits, noisy inputs, and out-of-distribution transformations. Our findings highlight the potential of synchrony-driven mechanisms to enhance deep learning models, improving their performance, robustness, and generalization in complex visual categorization tasks.

                arXiv:2505.02945v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The origins of economic behavior remain unresolved-not only in the social sciences but also in AI, where dominant theories often rely on predefined incentives or institutional assumptions. Contrary to the longstanding myth of barter as the foundation of exchange, converging evidence from early human societies suggests that reciprocity-not barter-was the foundational economic logic, enabling communities to sustain exchange and social cohesion long before formal markets emerged. Yet despite its centrality, reciprocity lacks a simulateable and cognitively grounded account. Here, we introduce a minimal behavioral framework based on three empirically supported cognitive primitives-individual recognition, reciprocal credence, and cost--return sensitivity-that enable agents to participate in and sustain reciprocal exchange, laying the foundation for scalable economic behavior. These mechanisms scaffold the emergence of cooperation, proto-economic exchange, and institutional structure from the bottom up. By bridging insights from primatology, developmental psychology, and economic anthropology, this framework offers a unified substrate for modeling trust, coordination, and economic behavior in both human and artificial systems. For an interactive visualization of the framework, see: https://egil158.github.io/cogfoundations-econ/

Abstract: Criticality is a behavioral state in dynamical systems that is known to present the highest computation capabilities, i.e., information transmission, storage, and modification. Therefore, such systems are ideal candidates as a substrate for reservoir computing, a subfield in artificial intelligence. Our choice of a substrate is a cellular automaton (CA) governed by an artificial neural network, also known as neural cellular automaton (NCA). We apply evolution strategy to optimize the NCA to achieve criticality, demonstrated by power law distributions in structures called avalanches. With an evolved critical NCA, the substrate is tested for reservoir computing. Our evaluation of the substrate is performed with two benchmarks, 5-bit memory task and image classification of handwritten digits. The result of the 5-bit memory task achieved a perfect score and the system managed to remember all 5 bits. The result for the image classification task matched and sometimes surpassed the performance of the best elementary CA for this task. Moreover, the proposed critical NCA may operate as a self-organized critical system, due to its robustness to extreme initial conditions.

Abstract: We investigate the phenomenon of neuron universality in independently trained GPT-2 Small models, examining how these universal neurons-neurons with consistently correlated activations across models-emerge and evolve throughout training. By analyzing five GPT-2 models at three checkpoints (100k, 200k, 300k steps), we identify universal neurons through pairwise correlation analysis of activations over a dataset of 5 million tokens. Ablation experiments reveal significant functional impacts of universal neurons on model predictions, measured via loss and KL divergence. Additionally, we quantify neuron persistence, demonstrating high stability of universal neurons across training checkpoints, particularly in deeper layers. These findings suggest stable and universal representational structures emerge during neural network training.

                arXiv:2508.01175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dominant paradigm in modern neural networks relies on simple, monotonically-increasing activation functions like ReLU. While effective, this paradigm necessitates large, massively-parameterized models to approximate complex functions. In this paper, we introduce the Periodic Linear Unit (PLU), a learnable sine-wave based activation with periodic non-monotonicity. PLU is designed for maximum expressive power and numerical stability, achieved through its formulation and a paired innovation we term Repulsive Reparameterization, which prevents the activation from collapsing into a non-expressive linear function. We demonstrate that a minimal MLP with only two PLU neurons can solve the spiral classification task, a feat impossible for equivalent networks using standard activations. This suggests a paradigm shift from networks as piecewise Taylor-like approximators to powerful Fourier-like function synthesizers, achieving exponential gains in parameter efficiency by placing intelligence in the neuron itself.

Abstract: Current Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) underutilize the temporal dynamics inherent in spike-based processing, relying primarily on rate coding while overlooking precise timing information that provides rich computational cues. We propose SPARTA (Spiking Priority Attention with Resource-Adaptive Temporal Allocation), a framework that leverages heterogeneous neuron dynamics and spike-timing information to enable efficient sparse attention. SPARTA prioritizes tokens based on temporal cues, including firing patterns, spike timing, and inter-spike intervals, achieving 65.4% sparsity through competitive gating. By selecting only the most salient tokens, SPARTA reduces attention complexity from O(N^2) to O(K^2) with k << n, while maintaining high accuracy. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on DVS-Gesture (98.78%) and competitive results on CIFAR10-DVS (83.06%) and CIFAR-10 (95.3%), demonstrating that exploiting spike timing dynamics improves both computational efficiency and accuracy.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate an impressive ability to utilise information within the context of their input sequences to appropriately respond to data unseen by the LLM during its training procedure. This ability is known as in-context learning (ICL). Humans and non-human animals demonstrate similar abilities, however their neural architectures differ substantially from LLMs. Despite this, a critical component within LLMs, the attention mechanism, resembles modern associative memory models, widely used in and influenced by the computational neuroscience community to model biological memory systems. Using this connection, we introduce an associative memory model capable of performing ICL. We use this as inspiration for a novel residual stream architecture which allows information to directly flow between attention heads. We test this architecture during training within a two-layer Transformer and show its ICL abilities manifest more quickly than without this modification. We then apply our architecture in small language models with 8 million and 1 billion parameters, focusing on attention head values, with results also indicating improved performance at these larger and more naturalistic scales.

Abstract: Hyperparameter optimization (HPO) is of paramount importance in the development of high-performance, specialized artificial intelligence (AI) models, ranging from well-established machine learning (ML) solutions to the deep learning (DL) domain and the field of spiking neural networks (SNNs). The latter introduce further complexity due to the neuronal computational units and their additional hyperparameters, whose inadequate setting can dramatically impact the final model performance. At the cost of possible reduced generalization capabilities, the most suitable strategy to fully disclose the power of SNNs is to adopt an application-oriented approach and perform extensive HPO experiments. To facilitate these operations, automatic pipelines are fundamental, and their configuration is crucial. In this document, the Neural Network Intelligence (NNI) toolkit is used as reference framework to present one such solution, with a use case example providing evidence of the corresponding results. In addition, a summary of published works employing the presented pipeline is reported as possible source of insights into application-oriented HPO experiments for SNN prototyping.

                arXiv:2505.03510v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a paradigm for reservoir computing (RC) that leverages a pool of cultured biological neurons as the reservoir substrate, creating a biological reservoir computing (BRC). This system operates similarly to an echo state network (ESN), with the key distinction that the neural activity is generated by a network of cultured neurons, rather than being modeled by traditional artificial computational units. The neuronal activity is recorded using a multi-electrode array (MEA), which enables high-throughput recording of neural signals. In our approach, inputs are introduced into the network through a subset of the MEA electrodes, while the remaining electrodes capture the resulting neural activity. This generates a nonlinear mapping of the input data to a high-dimensional biological feature space, where distinguishing between data becomes more efficient and straightforward, allowing a simple linear classifier to perform pattern recognition tasks effectively. To evaluate the performance of our proposed system, we present an experimental study that includes various input patterns, such as positional codes, bars with different orientations, and a digit recognition task. The results demonstrate the feasibility of using biological neural networks to perform tasks traditionally handled by artificial neural networks, paving the way for further exploration of biologically-inspired computing systems, with potential applications in neuromorphic engineering and bio-hybrid computing.

                arXiv:2504.05108v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Discovering efficient algorithms for solving complex problems has been an outstanding challenge in mathematics and computer science, requiring substantial human expertise over the years. Recent advancements in evolutionary search with large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in accelerating the discovery of algorithms across various domains, particularly in mathematics and optimization. However, existing approaches treat the LLM as a static generator, missing the opportunity to update the model with the signal obtained from evolutionary exploration. In this work, we propose to augment LLM-based evolutionary search by continuously refining the search operator - the LLM - through reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning. Our method leverages evolutionary search as an exploration strategy to discover improved algorithms, while RL optimizes the LLM policy based on these discoveries. Our experiments on combinatorial optimization tasks demonstrate that integrating RL with evolutionary search accelerates the discovery of superior algorithms, showcasing the potential of RL-enhanced evolutionary strategies for algorithm design.

                arXiv:2507.06082v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: evortran is a modern Fortran library designed for high-performance genetic algorithms and evolutionary optimization. evortran can be used to tackle a wide range of problems in high-energy physics and beyond, such as derivative-free parameter optimization, complex search taks, parameter scans and fitting experimental data under the presence of instrumental noise. The library is built as an fpm package with flexibility and efficiency in mind, while also offering a simple installation process, user interface and integration into existing Fortran (or Python) programs. evortran offers a variety of selection, crossover, mutation and elitism strategies, with which users can tailor an evolutionary algorithm to their specific needs. evortran supports different abstraction levels: from operating directly on individuals and populations, to running full evolutionary cycles, and even enabling migration between independently evolving populations to enhance convergence and maintain diversity. In this paper, we present the functionality of the evortran library, demonstrate its capabilities with example benchmark applications, and compare its performance with existing genetic algorithm frameworks. As physics-motivated applications, we use evortran to confront extended Higgs sectors with LHC data and to reconstruct gravitational wave spectra and the underlying physical parameters from LISA mock data, demonstrating its effectiveness in realistic, data-driven scenarios.

Effective identification of oncogenic mutations is essential for diagnosis, forecasting resistance, and metastasis in remission. It is required for an optimal drug regimen. We develop a framework to discover mutations that <i>co-exist</i> in different oncoproteins, and those that are <i>excluded</i>, likely encoding oncogene-induced senescence. For the first, mapping the proteins onto pathways assist combinatorial drug selections and help detect metastases. The second provides the molecular basis for synthetic lethality, to date investigated at the genome level. Our pan-cancer profiles of ~60,000 tumor sequences, detect 3424 co-existing tumor-specific mutations. Mapping them onto pathways indicates that they preferentially promote specific primary tumors. We uncover metastatic mutations and provide metastatic breast-cancer markers. This work not only clarifies the mechanistic basis of intratumor mutational diversity but usefully reveals markers for metastasis in patients’ genomes and introduces a novel computational framework for detecting metastasis based on tumor mutational profiles. Mapping the mutations onto pathways provides an invaluable metastasis-targeting resource, guiding drug combinations.

                <p>by Oswaldo Gressani, Niel Hens</p>

The serial interval of an infectious disease is a key instrument to understand transmission dynamics. Estimation of the serial interval distribution from illness onset data extracted from transmission pairs is challenging due to the presence of censoring and state-of-the-art methods mostly rely on parametric models. We present a fully data-driven methodology to estimate the serial interval distribution based on interval-censored serial interval data. The proposed nonparametric estimator of the cumulative distribution function of the serial interval is based on the class of uniform mixtures. Closed-form solutions are available for point estimates of different serial interval features and the bootstrap is used to construct confidence intervals. Algorithms underlying our approach are simple, stable, and computationally inexpensive, making them easily implementable in a programming language that is most familiar to a potential user. The nonparametric user-friendly routine is included in the EpiDelays package for ease of implementation. Our method complements existing parametric approaches for serial interval estimation and permits to analyze past, current, or future illness onset data streams following a set of best practices in epidemiological delay modeling.

                <p>by Michele Tizzani, Laetitia Gauvin</p>

Socioeconomic inequalities significantly influence infectious disease outcomes, as seen with COVID-19, but the pathways through which socioeconomic conditions affect transmission dynamics remain unclear. To address this, we conducted a survey representative of the Italian population, stratified by age, gender, geographical area, city size, employment status, and education level. The survey’s final aim was to estimate differences in contact and protective behaviors across various population strata, both of which are crucial for understanding transmission dynamics. Our initial insights based on the survey indicate that years after the pandemic began, the perceived impact of COVID-19 on professional, economic, social, and psychological dimensions varied across socioeconomic strata, extending beyond the epidemiological outcomes. This reinforces the need for approaches that systematically consider socioeconomic determinants. In this context, using generalized linear models, we identified associations between socioeconomic factors and vaccination status for both COVID-19 and influenza, as well as the influence of socioeconomic conditions on mask-wearing and social distancing. Importantly, we also observed differences in contact behaviors based on employment status while education level did not show a significant association. These findings highlight the complex interplay of socioeconomic and demographic factors in shaping protective behavior and contact patterns. Understanding these dynamics can contribute to the improvement of epidemic models and better guide public health efforts for at-risk groups.

                <p>by Dini Wang, Peng Yi, Yiguang Hong, Jie Chen, Gang Yan</p>

Cooperation is fundamental to human societies, and the interaction structure among individuals profoundly shapes its emergence and evolution. In real-world scenarios, cooperation prevails in multi-group (higher-order) populations, beyond just dyadic behaviors. Despite recent studies on group dilemmas in higher-order networks, the exploration of cooperation driven by higher-order strategy updates remains limited due to the intricacy and indivisibility of group-wise interactions. Here we investigate four categories of higher-order mechanisms for strategy updates in public goods games and establish their mathematical conditions for the emergence of cooperation. Such conditions uncover the impact of both higher-order strategy updates and network properties on evolutionary outcomes, notably highlighting the enhancement of cooperation by overlaps between groups. Interestingly, we discover that the group-mutual comparison update – selecting a high-fitness group and then imitating a random individual within this group – can prominently promote cooperation. Our analyses further unveil that, compared to pairwise interactions, higher-order strategy updates generally improve cooperation in most higher-order networks. These findings underscore the pivotal role of higher-order strategy updates in fostering collective cooperation in complex social systems.

                <p>by Franco Gino Brunello, Lorenzo Erra, Juan Nicola, Marcelo Adrián Martí</p>

Short Linear Motifs (SLiMs) are protein functionally relevant regions that mediate reversible protein-protein interactions. Variants that disrupt SLiMs can lead to numerous Mendelian diseases. Although various bioinformatic tools have been developed to identify SLiMs, most suffer from low specificity. In our previous work, we demonstrated that integrating sequence variant information with structural analysis can enhance the prediction of true functional SLiMs while simultaneously generating tolerance matrices that indicate whether each of the 19 possible single amino acid substitutions (SASs) is tolerated. However, the scarcity of representative crystallographic structures of SLiM-receptor complexes posed a significant limitation. In this study, we demonstrate that these interactions can be modeled using AlphaFold2 (AF2) to generate high-quality structures that serve as input for our MotSASi method. These AF2-derived structures show robust performance, both in reproducing known structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and in reflecting the deleterious effects of known sequence variants. This updated version of MotSASi expands the repertoire of high-confidence predicted SLiMs and provides a comprehensive catalog of variants located within SLiMs, along with their respective deleteriousness assessments. When compared to AlphaMissense, MotSASi demonstrates superior performance in predicting variant deleteriousness. By contributing to the accurate identification and interpretation of variants, this work aligns with ACMG/AMP standards and aims to improve diagnostic rates in clinical genomics.

Methylation at cytosines in DNA (5mC) is actively regulated for proper control of gene expression and chromatin architecture. Numerous genes display active DNA demethylation across retinal development; a process that requires oxidation of 5mC to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) and is controlled by the ten-eleven translocation (TET) methylcytosine dioxygenase enzymes. Using an allelic series of conditional TET enzyme mutants in mice, we determine that DNA demethylation is required upstream of NRL and NR2E3 expression for the establishment of rod-photoreceptor fate. Using histological, behavioral, transcriptomic, and base-pair resolution DNA methylation analyses, we establish that inhibition of active DNA demethylation results in global changes in gene expression and methylation patterns that prevent photoreceptor precursors from adopting a rod-photoreceptor fate, instead producing a retina in which all photoreceptors specify as cones. Our results establish the TET enzymes and DNA demethylation as critical regulators of retinal development and cell fate specification, elucidating a novel mechanism required for the specification of rod-photoreceptors.

Diverse biological factors, such as sex and age, confer heterogeneity on sensory processing challenges in autism. These factors result in major difficulties in the processing of contextual information in social and non-social situations. To assess divergence in autistic traits, it is critical to consider sex- and age-related variability. Nevertheless, these differences remain largely elusive. Animal models of autism offer the possibility to examine contextual processing at the single-neuron level. Here, we investigated predictive processing of contextual auditory cues in the auditory midbrain of control and prenatally valproic acid-induced rats, a well-established animal model of autism. The rats were prepubertal and adult female and male animals. We performed single-unit recordings in the inferior colliculus of control and prenatally, or in utero, exposed rats under the classical oddball paradigm and non-repetitive cascade control sequences to study neuronal mismatch. This is the neuronal correlate of mismatch negativity, the brain’s automatic response to interruptions in environmental regularity. When comparing control and exposed rats, our results demonstrated a reduction in neuronal mismatch in rats exposed to valproic acid. However, exposed adult females exhibited an increased neuronal mismatch compared to their control counterparts. With respect to sex distinctions, valproic acid induced sex differences in neuronal mismatch of prepubertal and adult rats that are not observable in control animals. Moreover, we detected an age-dependent refinement in prediction error that is not affected by the drug. But valproic acid altered typical developmental trajectory of neuronal mismatch in both sexes. Such observations support sex- and age-related effects of in utero valproic acid exposure in contextual auditory processing at the neural level of the inferior colliculus. In autism, atypical predictive processing of environmental regularities underlies unusual responses to novel experiences. The present study highlights the importance of sex and age, that confer heterogeneity to these challenges.

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The dorsal and ventral hippocampus have distinct processing properties, but it remains unclear if interneuron subtypes differ in connectivity along the dorsoventral axis. Oriens lacunosum-moleculare (OLM) interneurons, identified by the <i>Chrna2</i> gene, are known to regulate memory processes differently along this axis. OLMɑ2 cells bidirectionally modulate risk-taking behavior, while ventral hippocampal medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)-projecting neurons regulate approach and avoidance behaviors. Using rabies virus-mediated monosynaptic retrograde tracing, we show that OLMɑ2 cells receive differential innervation across the dorsal, intermediate, and ventral hippocampus. We find that CA1 and CA3 inputs differ between hippocampal poles, suggesting that OLMɑ2 cells may have distinct feedback and feed-forward inhibitory roles in the hippocampal microcircuit. Intermediate OLMɑ2 cells uniquely receive substantial input from the subiculum and dorsal/medial raphe nuclei, as well as widespread CA2 inputs potentially linked to social memory. The medial septum and diagonal band of Broca provide cholinergic, GABAergic, and glutamatergic inputs across the axis, likely influencing disinhibition and oscillatory activity during various behavioral states. Excitatory input to intermediate-ventral OLMɑ2 cells partly arises from CA1 projection neurons targeting the mPFC. This suggests a gate-switching function that favors CA3 input to projection neurons by two different mechanisms related to feedback and feed-forward inhibition. In conclusion, OLMɑ2 cells exhibit distinct presynaptic input profiles along the dorsoventral axis, with major differences in the proportions of intrahippocampal inputs, highlighting their diverse roles in hippocampal microcircuits.</p>

                Odors are intimately tied to the taste system to aid food selection and determine the sensory experience of food. However, how smell and taste are integrated in the nervous system to drive feeding remains elusive. We show in <i>Drosophila</i> that odors alone activate gustatory receptor neurons (GRNs), trigger proboscis extension reflex (PER), a canonical taste-evoked feeding behavior, and enhance food intake. Odor-evoked PER requires the function of sugar-sensing GRNs but not olfactory organs. Calcium imaging and electrophysiological recording show that GRNs directly respond to odors. Odor-evoked PER is mediated by the Gr5a receptor, and is bidirectionally modulated by olfactory binding proteins. Finally, odors and sucrose co-applied to GRNs synergistically enhance PER and food consumption. These results reveal a cell-intrinsic mechanism for odor-taste multimodal integration that takes place as early as in GRNs, indicating that unified chemosensory experience is a product of layered integration in peripheral neurons and in the brain.

">A synaptic mechanism for encoding the learned value of action-derived safety</a></h4>

              
                Motivated behavior is often framed in terms of biologically grounded outcomes, such as food or threat. Yet many motivated actions, like the pursuit of safety or agency, depend on outcomes that lack explicit sensory value and must instead be inferred from experience. Here, we identify a thalamostriatal circuit mechanism by which such internally constructed outcomes acquire motivational value. In mice performing an active avoidance task, neurons in the paraventricular thalamus (PVT) projecting to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) develop a safety-encoding signal that emerges following successful avoidance. This signal is experience-dependent and value-sensitive, diminishing upon devaluation of the instrumental contingency. Selective silencing of the PVT[-&gt;]NAc projection at safety onset disrupts avoidance persistence without impairing action-outcome learning, as confirmed by computational modeling of value updating based on prediction error. Mechanistically, PVT input recruits cholinergic interneurons (CINs) to modulate dopamine release and this influence depends on synaptic potentiation mediated by GluA2-lacking AMPA receptor insertion at PVT-CIN synapses. Disrupting this plasticity selectively impairs the avoidance response by blunting the motivational value of safety without affecting acquisition. These findings reveal how thalamic circuits assign value to abstract, internal outcomes, providing a framework for understanding how goals like safety are inferred, stabilized, and rendered behaviorally effective.

">Precision Functional Neuroimaging Reveals Individually Specific Auditory Responses in Infants</a></h4>

              
                Adaptively responding to salient stimuli in the environment is a fundamental feature of cognitive development in early life, which is enabled by the developing brain. Understanding individual variability in how the brain supports this fundamental process is essential for uncovering neurodevelopmental trajectories and potential neurodevelopmental risks. In the present study, we used a precision functional imaging approach to probe activation in response to salient auditory stimuli and its relation to brain functional networks in individual infants. A minimum of 60 minutes of fMRI BOLD data with an auditory oddball paradigm were collected in ten infants with a mean postmenstrual age of 48 weeks. Results demonstrate the feasibility of performing a precision functional imaging study to investigate individual specific responses to salient stimuli in infants. While responses to the auditory oddball were consistent between individuals in auditory processing areas, responses across the rest of the brain differed across individuals in their magnitude and shape. Individual specific response patterns appeared to be relatively stable and differed from other participant's response patterns, despite fluctuations across runs. Commonalities and differences between individuals demonstrated in this sample contribute to our understanding of how the developing brain instantiates processing of salient stimuli. Our findings suggest that during early development, early unimodal processing is well conserved across individuals, however subsequent perceptual processing is still being personally defined. In this context, individual specific response patterns could be a promising target for biomarkers of normative brain and cognitive development.

">Early Reprogramming Intermediates Enable Direct Neuronal Conversion via NGN2</a></h4>

              
                The generation of engineered neurons via Neurogenin-2 (NGN2) overexpression, starting from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), is a powerful tool for modeling neurological diseases. However, using stabilized hiPSCs as a starting point significantly increases the time required to obtain a valuable human neuronal model in vitro. Here, we demonstrated that as little as 3 days of transient expression of reprogramming factors in human fibroblasts can unlock the ability of these cells to transdifferentiate into neurons upon overexpression of NGN2. We used single-cell transcriptomic data to dissect the distinct cell identities that emerge during reprogramming. We identified three distinct reprogramming intermediate populations responsive to NGN2-mediated neuronal induction and found that partial reprogramming for only 3 days is sufficient to mediate NGN2 neuronal conversion of human fibroblasts. Moreover, we found that the efficiency in neuronal fate acquisition mediated by NGN2 overexpression is strictly correlated with the stage of reprogramming used as a starting point.

">Emotional and Linguistic Features Predict Prefrontal Functional Connectivity during Ongoing Dialogues: An fNIRS Investigation</a></h4>

              
                Identifying the neural bases of language has been a central focus in neuroscience since the pioneering case studies by Broca and Wernicke. Contemporary research has moved beyond classical modular models to conceptualize language as supported by a distributed network of anatomically and functionally interconnected brain regions. Yet, few studies have explored how these networks operate during spontaneous, real-life speech, limiting our understanding of language in natural contexts. In this study, we collected data from 84 individuals engaged in live conversations. Participants' prefrontal brain activity was recorded using functional near-infrared spectroscopy hyperscanning, and functional connectivity was quantified via wavelet transform coherence. Dialogues were manually transcribed, and computational methods were applied to extract emotional and semantic/syntactic features from the speech data. Using linear mixed-effects models, we found that emotional content significantly predicted prefrontal functional connectivity (R^2 marginal = 0.04). Among all emotional predictors, expressed anger was the most robust: higher anger levels were associated with reduced connectivity between the left middle frontal gyrus and the right inferior frontal gyrus (q = .032, R^2 marginal = 0.07). While other semantic and syntactic features did not predict overall connectivity, degree assortativity - an index of linguistic structure - was negatively associated with connectivity between the superior frontal gyri and the left inferior frontal gyrus (q = .026, R^2 marginal = 0.08). These findings highlight how both affective and structural properties of speech modulate prefrontal connectivity during real-life interaction. More broadly, this work demonstrates the potential of integrating computational linguistics with social neuroscience to uncover the neural mechanisms of real-life social interactions.

">Rational Expectations and Kinematic Information in Coordination Games</a></h4>

              
                Successful coordination often requires integrating strategic reasoning with real-time observations of others' actions, yet how humans resolve conflicts between these information sources remains unclear. This study aimed to fill this gap by examining how people coordinate in a strategic game when observing partial kinematic information from their partner's actions. Participants played a HI-LO game with a virtual partner, choosing payoffs based on grasping movements toward invisible large and small targets. Hand movements were presented as schematic animations, with partners grasping targets linked to higher or lower payoffs across two configurations. Participants relied exclusively on kinematic cues from hand shape changes in maximum grip aperture to infer their partner's choices. There were two main findings. While participants preferred higher payoffs consistent with rational game-theoretic expectations, reliable kinematic cues overrode these expectations. When early grip aperture changes indicated the partner was reaching for a large target associated with a lower payoff, participants abandoned their default preference for higher payoffs. They chose the lower option instead, achieving a high coordination success rate. These findings demonstrate that people prioritize kinematic cues about others' choices over theoretical assumptions about rational behavior when coordinating. This suggests that movement-based inferences about others' actions in natural social interactions may be weighted more heavily than strategic reasoning when the two sources of information conflict.

">Distinct Motor Cortex Interneuron Plasticity and Its Association with Prefrontal Brain Volume in Parkinson's Disease</a></h4>

              
                Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by motor and cognitive deficits, including abnormal primary motor cortex (M1) excitability and diminished sensorimotor neuroplasticity. While paired associative stimulation (PAS) can induce M1 plasticity, people with PD (PwPD) demonstrate variability that cannot be accounted for by disease progression or medication status. Distinct M1 interneuron populations and attention-related brain structures may influence the reduced PAS-induced neuroplasticity. We aimed to characterize M1 interneuron plasticity in PwPD using attention-modulated PAS and identify neurostructural correlates. PwPD underwent MRI, then a PAS protocol with task-relevant attention. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) assessments of corticospinal excitability using posterior-to-anterior (PA) and anterior-to-posterior (AP) current directions were employed before and three post-PAS time-points. PAS induced distinct time-dependent M1 interneuron excitability changes. PA TMS showed increased corticospinal excitability at all post-PAS time-points; AP TMS increased only at 30 minutes. Rostral middle frontal gyrus volume uniquely explained variance in PA-sensitive M1 interneuron plasticity. In contrast, AP-sensitive plasticity was associated with baseline AP TMS excitability and age. These findings highlight that M1 interneuron circuits show unique neuroplasticity patterns in PwPD and relate to prefrontal brain volume. Our results suggest a complex interplay between motor and cognition-related deficits as interrelated pathophysiological features in PD.

">Musical complexity governs a tradeoff between reliability and dimensionality in the neural code</a></h4>

              
                The rich experience of listening to music depends on the neural integration of its constituent elements within the early auditory pathway. Here, we performed the first large-scale study of neural responses to complex music to characterize the neural coding of individual instruments and mixtures with both normal hearing and mild-to-moderate hearing loss. Using coherence and manifold analyses along with deep learning, we identified strong nonlinear interactions in mixed music that impacted the fidelity and geometry of the neural code. We found that increasing musical complexity resulted in the creation of new neural modes, but this increased dimensionality was associated with decreased reliability. This tradeoff persisted even after hearing loss, the effects of which were largely corrected with suitable amplification. These results suggest that the neural coding of music is governed by an inherent tradeoff and highlight a fundamental challenge in maintaining fidelity while processing sensory inputs with increasing complexity.

">ACTION ENHANCEMENT DRIVES THE EMBODIMENT OF A SUPERNUMERARY ROBOTIC DIGIT</a></h4>

              
                Wearable robotic supernumerary limbs enhance motor capabilities by leveraging principles from both engineering and neuroscience. Despite extensive research, how supernumerary limbs become embodied and the relationship between embodiment and artificially enhanced action possibilities remain largely unexplored. This gap has implications for device design and clinical adoption, as embodiment likely promotes patients' acceptance and daily use of their supernumerary limb. Using an adapted proprioceptive drift paradigm from rubber hand illusion research, we investigated the embodiment of a robotic Soft Sixth Finger (SSF). Participants performed grasp-to-lift actions versus mere lift actions without object interaction, wearing the SSF on two different configurations: the palm and back of the hand. The Palm condition involved achievable actions without the SSF, while the Dorsal condition enabled otherwise anatomically impossible actions, extending beyond the physiological motor repertoire. Hand proprioceptive drift was measured before and after each task. Results showed that the SSF impacted body representation only when dorsally mounted. Proprioceptive drift was significantly higher for grasp-to-lift actions in Dorsal versus Palm conditions and higher for grasp-to-lift versus mere lift in the Dorsal condition only. This proves that SSF embodiment relates to extending, rather than substituting, users' action possibilities. Future research must integrate behavioral, cognitive, and neural measurements across healthy and patient populations. Our study provides an ideal model for clinical application, demonstrating how enabling otherwise impossible actions drives robotic supernumerary finger embodiment.

">Unfolding spatiotemporal representations of 3D visual perception in the human brain</a></h4>

              
                Although visual input is initially recorded in two dimensions on our retinas, we perceive and interact with the world in three dimensions. Achieving 3D perception requires the brain to integrate 2D spatial representations with multiple depth cues, such as binocular disparity. However, most studies typically examine 2D and depth information in isolation, leaving the integrated nature of 3D spatial encoding largely underexplored. In this study, we collected a large-scale, multimodal neuroimaging dataset consisting of multiple EEG and fMRI sessions while participants viewed stereoscopic 3D stimuli through red-green anaglyph glasses. Participants first completed a behavioral session including depth judgement tasks and a novel cube adjustment task to quantify and calibrate individual depth perception in units of binocular disparity. Then during two EEG and two fMRI sessions, participants passively viewed stimuli presented at 64 systematically sampled 3D locations, yielding over 66,000 trials in total across ten participants. Combining this large-scale EEG-fMRI dataset with computational methods via representational similarity analysis, we not only systematically characterized the spatiotemporal representation of multiple spatial features in 3D perception but also explored how different coordinate systems (e.g., Cartesian or Polar) might be employed across brain regions and time. Our results reveal that human brains employ multiple types of spatial feature representations and coordinate systems to encode spatial locations at different temporal stages and across distinct cortical regions. In addition to strong representations of 2D space throughout visual cortex, we find unique representations for depth and 3D features in later timepoints and visual areas, including some evidence for 3D processing in parahippocampus. These findings contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the spatiotemporal organization of neural representations that support 3D perception. Additionally, our novel large dataset will be made openly available to support future research on 3D perception and spatial cognition.

">Oxytocin neurons in the anterior and posterior paraventricular nucleus have distinct behavioral functions and electrophysiological profiles</a></h4>

              
                Oxytocin is a neuropeptide that can either promote or inhibit affiliative social behaviors. Recent evidence suggests that these diverse effects are mediated by distinct oxytocin receptor-expressing neuron. An outstanding question is whether these behavioral effects are also driven by distinct or overlapping populations of oxytocin-producing neurons. The paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus is a major source of oxytocin and sends projections to the mesolimbic dopamine system and the extended amygdala. Previous work found that social defeat increased oxytocin neuron activity in the anterior PVN (aPVN) but not posterior PVN (pPVN). We reduced oxytocin synthesis with antisense morpholino oligonucleotides in either anterior or posterior PVN in California mice (Peromyscus californicus), a strong model system for studying effects of social stress on brain function and behavior. Antisense morpholinos in aPVN had no effect on behavior in unstressed females but increased social approach and reduced social vigilance in females exposed to social defeat stress. In pPVN, antisense morpholinos reduced social approach in unstressed male and female California mice. We then used OxtCre mice to compare electrophysiological profiles of oxytocin in aPVN and pPVN with a population of oxytocin neurons in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST). Oxytocin neurons in aPVN and BNST oxytocin neurons had higher post-synaptic potentials and responded more strongly to current injections versus oxytocin neurons in pPVN. These findings shed light onto functional and physiological heterogeneity of PVN oxytocin neurons. Our results suggest that context dependent effects of oxytocin are mediated by different populations of oxytocin neurons.

This study aimed to elucidate the neural correlates of subjective well-being and examine its potential association with aggression using a two-part investigation. The first involved a functional MRI study (<span style="font-style:italic;">n</span> = 111), focusing on amygdala responses to emotional face processing and broader cortical activation related to subjective well-being. The second involved a larger behavioral sample (<span style="font-style:italic;">n</span> = 627) to assess the relationship between subjective well-being and aggression, as well as the mediating role of emotional variables. Behaviorally, subjective well-being was inversely associated with anger, hostility, and overall aggression, and with negative affect, anxiety, and depression. Mediation analyses demonstrated significant effects of mood (negative affect, depression, and anxiety) in linking subjective well-being to aggression. Neuroimaging results revealed that individuals with higher subjective well-being displayed attenuated amygdala reactivity to fearful faces. Additionally, intersubject representational similarity analyses demonstrated that individuals with similar subjective well-being levels shared more convergent neural activation patterns in visual (e.g., occipital pole, lateral occipital cortex, middle temporal gyrus, and fusiform) and the emotional network (e.g., insula), but not within the amygdala. These findings provide novel insights into the neuropsychological mechanisms linking well-being to emotional regulation and aggression.</span>

One such strategy is reappraisal, where individuals reframe their own negative emotions (ie self-reappraisal) or help others reframe their negative emotions (ie social-reappraisal). Here, we compared the neural mechanisms underlying self- and social-reappraisal of negative autobiographical memories using standard univariate contrasts, Bayes factor, and multivariate classifier approaches. Both self- and social-reappraisal recruited regions associated with control and mentalizing, such as dorsolateral and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex. However, social-reappraisal was qualitatively different from self-reappraisal in its recruitment of additional control and mentalizing regions, such as the right lateral prefrontal cortex, medial prefrontal cortex, and right temporal pole. Notably, multivariate patterns within regions associated with mentalizing—but not control—were distinguishable between self- and social-reappraisal, suggesting that different kinds of information are drawn upon when reappraising for self vs. others. Finally, both self- and social-reappraisal modulated activity in regions associated with affective responding and the perceptual representation of remembered scenes, including the mid-orbital frontal cortex, left insula, and posterior parahippocampal gyrus.

">Defining and measuring proximity to criticality</a></h4>

              
                Over the half century since the renormalization group (RG) brought about deep understanding of critical phenomena in condensed matter physics, it has been claimed that diverse social, engineered, astrophysical, and biological systems operate close to criticality. However, these systems do not afford the neat phase diagrams and exquisite control available in condensed matter physics. How can one assess proximity to criticality when control parameters are unknown, difficult to manipulate experimentally, and fluctuating in response to changing environmental or internal conditions? Here we meet this challenge with a rigorous theoretical framework and data-analytic strategy for measuring proximity to criticality from observed system dynamics. We developed a temporal RG, well-suited to commonly measured time series, and an information theoretic quantification of proximity to criticality that is independent of model parameterization. After benchmarking our approach on diverse ground-truth cases, we apply it to recordings of spiking activity in the mammalian brain, addressing a long-standing controversy. We show that brain dynamics shift closer to criticality during wakefulness and shift away during deep sleep.

">Large-scale wearable data reveal spatiotemporal organization of annual sleep patterns</a></h4>

              
                Sleep is fundamental to health, yet large-scale, objective data on how geography shapes sleep behavior remain scarce. We analyzed over 45 million nights of sensor data from 105,741 German adults wearing consumer-grade wearables across 2.7 years. Sleep timing displayed a continuous east-west gradient, with later onset, midsleep, and offset in western regions, consistent with solar progression. This effect was strongest on weekends and in rural areas, where midsleep was delayed by 2.2 minutes per degree longitude and sleep duration increased by 1.0 minute. A north-south gradient also emerged. Weekday midsleep advanced by 0.9 minutes per degree latitude, while weekend midsleep was delayed by 0.2 minutes, resulting in greater social jetlag in the north. Sleep duration declined toward higher latitudes across both day types. Seasonal analyses revealed consistent annual rhythms. Sleep duration increased by 24.7 minutes in winter relative to summer, and sleep offset closely followed sunrise. These patterns highlight the joint influence of solar and social time on sleep, with implications for regionally tailored public health strategies.

">Distinguishing cortical indexes of arousal and awareness in sleeping patients with unresponsive wakefulness syndrome</a></h4>

              
                Consciousness is assumed to be defined by two components: awareness and arousal. However, the cortical indexes for these two components remain unclear. Since patients with unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS) are supposed to have no awareness but arousal, sleep-wake cycle in patients with UWS may reflect pure arousal fluctuations, and then could distinguish the cortical indexes for arousal from ones for awareness. This study recorded nighttime polysomnography in patients with UWS, patients with minimally conscious state (MCS) and healthy controls, showing that spectral slope could index arousal, fluctuating among sleep stages in all three groups. Both spectral entropy and Lempel-Ziv complexity can index awareness, showing a significant difference between conscious and unconscious states. These findings provide fundamental evidence for the two-component hypothesis of consciousness.

Although extensive literature has proposed that alpha oscillations (7-14 Hz) suppress distractor processing, recent studies have questioned this role. In this magnetoencephalography (MEG) study, we used a modified Stroop task to investigate whether (1) alpha oscillations are associated with functional inhibition in higher-order visual regions and the ventral attention network (VAN), and (2) alpha phase adjusts in anticipation of relevant and irrelevant stimuli. We found no significant increase in pre-stimulus alpha power or phase adjustment over higher-order visual regions in the attend-color condition, consistent with the absence of a behavioral Stroop effect. However, we observed elevated alpha-beta power (10-20 Hz) in the VAN during both attend-color and attend-word conditions compared to control conditions, occurring before stimulus onset. Higher alpha-beta power in the right temporo-parietal junction correlated with faster reaction times, suggesting that inhibition of this network region facilitates task performance. This alpha-beta modulation in the VAN may represent a general mechanism for resisting distraction, preventing attentional capture by irrelevant information regardless of task condition. Additionally, we found enhanced theta power (4 Hz) over the VAN and left medial frontal gyrus (part of the cognitive control network) in both experimental conditions. Theta power correlated with improved reaction times across these regions. Furthermore, theta activity in the left medial frontal gyrus synchronized with VAN nodes, potentially indicating cross-network interaction between cognitive control and attention systems.

">Microglia-to-neuron signaling increases lipid droplet metabolism, enhancing neuronal network activity</a></h4>

              
                Microglia regulate neuronal circuit plasticity. Disrupting their homeostatic function has detrimental effects on neuronal circuit health. Neuroinflammation contributes to the onset and progression of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimers disease, with several microglial activation genes linked to increased risk for these conditions. Inflammatory microglia alter neuronal excitability, inducing metabolic strain. Interestingly, expression of APOE4, the strongest genetic risk factor for Alzheimers disease, affects both microglial activation and neuronal excitability, highlighting the interplay between lipid metabolism, inflammation, and neuronal function. It remains unclear how microglial inflammatory state is conveyed to neurons to affect circuit function and whether APOE4 expression alters this intercellular communication. Here, we use a reductionist model of human iPSC-derived microglial and neuronal monocultures to dissect how the APOE genotype in each cell-type independently contributes to microglial regulation of neuronal activity during inflammation. Conditioned media from LPS-stimulated microglia increased neuronal network activity, assessed by calcium imaging, with APOE4 microglial conditioned media driving higher neuronal firing rates than APOE3 conditioned media. Both APOE3 and APOE4 neurons increase network activity in response to conditioned media treatments, while APOE4 neurons uniquely increase presynaptic puncta with APOE4 microglial conditioned media. Conditioned media-derived exosomes from LPS-stimulated microglia can mediate increases to network activity. Lastly, increased network activity is accompanied by increased lipid droplet metabolism and blocking lipid droplet metabolism abolishes network activity. These findings illuminate how microglia-to-neuron communication drives inflammation-induced changes in neuronal circuit function, demonstrate a role for neuronal lipid droplets in network activity, and support a potential mechanism through which APOE4 increases neuronal excitability.

">Mechanically-gated currents in mouse sensory neurons lacking PIEZO2</a></h4>

              
                Touch sensation starts with the opening of mechanically-gated activated ion channels at neuroglial endings of mechanoreceptors in the skin. The function of around half of low threshold mechanoreceptors is dependent on the presence of the mechanically gated ion channel PIEZO2. It has been reported that particularly rapidly-adapting mechanosensitive currents (RA-currents) in the cell bodies of acutely cultured sensory neurons are dependent on PIEZO2. Here we re-examined this question by making a quantitative study of mechanically-gated currents activated by substrate deflection in sensory neurons lacking PIEZO2. We characterized mechanically-gated currents from embryonic and post-natal sensory neurons, taken from global Piezo2-/- or Piezo2 conditional knockouts (Piezo2cko), respectively. Surprisingly in both models, Piezo2 gene deletion was not associated with any significant reduction in the sensitivity or incidence of mechanosensitive currents compared to wild type controls. There was, however, a moderate reduction in the incidence of RA-currents with very fast activation and inactivation kinetics in both embryonic Piezo2-/- and juvenile Piezo2cKO mice. These results show that PIEZO2 channels are not the only mechanosensitive channels mediating RA-currents in sensory neurons. Furthermore, our data suggest that the phenotypes associated with Piezo2 loss of function alleles may sometimes be due to secondary effects of gene deletion, for example, by changing the developmental trajectory of sensory neurons. Emphasis should be put on the diversity of mechanosensitive ion channel function in sensory neurons which needs to be further elucidated.

">Ca2+-phospholipid-dependent regulation of Munc13-1 is essential for post-tetanic potentiation at mossy fiber synapses and supports working memory</a></h4>

              
                Hippocampal mossy fiber (hMF) to CA3 pyramidal cell synapses are thought to support the formation of working memory through presynaptic short-term facilitation (STF) and post-tetanic potentiation (PTP). However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these transient forms of synaptic enhancement remain poorly understood. We show here that Munc13-1-mediated priming of synaptic vesicles (SVs) at active zones controls hMF STF and PTP in response to Ca2+-phospholipid and Ca2+-calmodulin (CaM) signaling. Knock-in mice expressing Munc13-1 variants that are insensitive to Ca2+-phospholipid and Ca2+-CaM signaling exhibit severely impaired STF and PTP at hMF synapses. Moreover, the PTP-induction threshold is strongly increased upon the loss of Ca2+-phospholipid-Munc13-1 signaling. Since these synaptic defects are accompanied by working memory deficits, especially in mice expressing the Ca2+-phospholipid-insensitive Munc13-1 variant, we conclude that Ca2+-dependent regulation of Munc13-1-mediated SV priming co-determines hMF short-term plasticity and working memory formation.

">Habenular μ-opioid receptor knockout and chronic systemic receptor blockade promote negative affect and heighten nociceptive sensitivity</a></h4>

              
                The -opioid receptor (MOR), a subtype of opioid G protein-coupled receptor, is expressed in multiple brain circuits and is particularly enriched in the habenula, a small epithalamic structure implicated in aversive states. MOR dysfunction has been linked to several psychiatric and nociceptive disorders. Identifying the key brain regions mediating the behavioral consequences of disrupted MOR signaling can shed light on the role of the opioid system in mood and pain regulation. In this study, we administered methocinnamox (MCAM), a long-acting, pseudo-irreversible MOR antagonist, acutely or chronically to adult C57BL/6J mice. A comprehensive behavioral battery was used to assess affective, social, and pain behavior. A single MCAM administration (10 mg/kg, s.c.) did not alter baseline behavior, but blocked opioid-induced analgesia, suggesting that basal -opioid tone does not contribute to these behaviors. In contrast, chronic MCAM administration (10 mg/kg, s.c., 3x/week for 4 weeks) led to increased anxiety-like behavior and decreased sociability, as well as enhanced mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia. Remarkably, selective knockout of habenular MORs in adult Oprm1fl/fl mice reproduced key features of the chronic MCAM phenotype, including anxiety-like behavior and mechanical hyperalgesia. Together, these findings reveal that sustained inhibition of MOR signaling disrupts affective and nociceptive processing and highlight the habenula as a node mediating key behavioral deficits of disrupted opioid signaling.

                Retrograde optogenetics enables tagging and manipulation of pathway-defined neurons, although its application to the non-human primate brain remains challenging. We applied the technique to identify, record, and activate neurons forming the frontal eye field-superior colliculus projection in behaving macaques. Optical stimulation evoked robust contralateral saccades and pathway-selective opto-tagging revealed the functional visuo-motor convergences within this pathway. Our findings resolve a longstanding controversy about the frontal oculomotor outputs and highlight retrograde optogenetics as a powerful tool for primate circuit-level studies.

">PyMouse Lifter: Real Time 3-D Pose Estimation for Mice with Only 2-D Annotation Via Data Synthesis</a></h4>

              
                Neural-network based pose estimation models have become increasingly popular for quantitative analysis of mouse behavior, yet most recordings still use a single 2 D camera view and therefore lack the depth cues needed for accurate 3 D kinematics. Existing open source 3 D mouse datasets for training deep-learning models cover only a narrow range of environments and do not generalize well to various laboratory settings. To overcome these limitations, we introduce PyMouseLifter, a pipeline that automatically reconstructs 3 D mouse poses from ordinary 2-D top view videos with minimal manual 2-D annotation. PyMouseLifter combines (i) an anatomically realistic 3 D mouse model for automated data synthesis, (ii) a monocular depth estimation model, and (iii) a 2 D key point estimation model, enabling accurate 3 D reconstruction (model-based 3D inference) in virtually any open field arena without using depth or multiple camera views for reconstruction. We validate the system on multiple datasets against depth camera ground truth and show that the lifted 3D trajectories yield improved behavior classification over 2 D data and can be implemented in real time.

                Background: The blood-brain barrier (BBB) interferes with the treatment of central nervous system disorders owing to the complexity of its structure and restrictive function. Thus, it is challenging to develop central nervous system drug delivery strategies. Specific mode electroacupuncture (EA) stimulation can effectively open the BBB in rats. Methods: Here, we used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to comprehensively map the cell population in the rat cerebral cortex. Results: We identified 23 cell subsets and eight types of cells in the brain by cell annotation. scRNA-seq revealed transcriptional changes in the cerebral cortex under EA. Conclusions: Our findings offer valuable insights into the molecular and cellular modifications in the brain resulting from EA intervention and serve as a resource for drug delivery across healthy and diseased states. Innovative approaches to enhance BBB opening will lead to more effective therapeutic plans and enhanced drug delivery.

">Targeting intracranial electrical stimulation to network regions defined within individuals causes network-level effects</a></h4>

              
                Intracranial electrical stimulation (ES) is routinely used therapeutically, diagnostically, and to provide causal evidence in neuroscience studies. However, our understanding of the brain network-level effects of ES remains limited. We applied precision functional mapping (PFM), based on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), to define large-scale networks within individual epilepsy patients. We show that single-pulse electrical stimulation (SPES) and high-frequency electrical stimulation (HFES) are more likely to evoke within-network responses and elicit network-related behavioral effects, respectively, when applied near to a PFM-defined network region. Network-level effects were more likely when stimulating sites in white matter, in close proximity to the targeted network, and within a region predominantly occupied by the targeted network. Further, network-specific modulation may be achievable by applying lower current intensities at these sites. Our findings support that modulation of specific networks is achievable by targeting ES to a functional anatomic "sweet spot" that can be identified using PFM.

">Processing of inner bodily signals: evidence and insight from adolescence</a></h4>

              
                Interoception, the sense of inner bodily signals, plays a key role in emotional regulation, cognition and mental health. While its relevance in adulthood has been extensively explored, less is known about how these abilities develop during adolescence, a period characterised by significant physical and psychological changes. This study aimed to investigate three distinct dimensions of interoception -- accuracy, sensitivity and awareness -- in adolescents and adults to better understand the developmental profile of this sense. Fifty-four adolescents (aged 12-14) and 50 adults (aged 25-34) completed the Heartbeat Monitoring Task to assess their actual ability to detect heartbeats, their confidence in this ability, and the confidence-accuracy correspondence, and a questionnaire on the tendency to focus on bodily sensations. The study also examined where participants localised bodily sensations during the interoceptive task. The results revealed no significant differences in interoceptive accuracy between the two groups. Both age groups exhibited similar body localisation patterns, primarily focusing on the chest during heartbeat detection. However, adolescents showed significantly lower metacognitive awareness of their ability to perceive internal bodily sensations, and higher focus on interoceptive sensations, as reflected in their higher confidence ratings and questionnaire scores. No significant correlations emerged among the three interoceptive dimensions in either group, which supports the view that these dimensions represent independent components of interoception. These findings suggest that, while basic interoceptive detection may be established by early adolescence, the capacity to accurately reflect on these internal sensations continues to mature into adulthood. The mismatch observed between adolescents' heightened bodily focus and their limited metacognitive insight may partly help explain why adolescence is a period of increased vulnerability to mental health difficulties.

">Transcranial magnetic stimulation induced pupil dilations can serve as a cortical excitability measure</a></h4>

              
                The application of non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) often relies on proxy estimates of cortical excitability (CE), such as the resting motor threshold (rMT), measured through transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). However, estimating the rMT is not always possible, as it requires an intact corticospinal pathway for neural signals to travel from the cortex to the periphery. To broaden the application of NIBS there is a need for additional CE measures. In three experiments combining TMS, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), and eye-tracking, we measured TMS-induced pupil dilations as a potential CE proxy. We present Bayesian evidence (Experiment 1: BF > 9; Experiment 2: BF > 46; Experiment 3: BFs > 6) that TMS-induced pupil dilations serve as an objective CE proxy, with larger pupil size reflecting higher CE. We also show that these effects are not due to auditory, muscle, or sensory confounds. The introduction of this novel measure paves the way for a deeper understanding of CE by enabling objective NIBS measures beyond the motor cortex. Moving away from the reliance on the motor cortex would allow NIBS research and therapy to become more inclusive, allowing access to populations that are affected by damage along the corticospinal pathway.

">Evidence for a Transient State of Auditory Hypersensitivity During Initial Onset of Tinnitus, Evidenced by Intensity Dependence of the Auditory Evoked Potential (IDAEP)</a></h4>

              
                Our understanding of tinnitus pathophysiology may be greatly advanced by understanding how the condition evolves from its initial onset or acute stage to its chronic manifestation. Such a transition likely reflects dynamic neurophysiological changes within central auditory and non-auditory networks. Our integrated model of tinnitus posits that sensory precision (sensory weighting) may be heightened during the acute stages of tinnitus to resolve degraded auditory input, but in chronic tinnitus, its role may diminish as plastic processes take over the percept's maintenance. Consequently, we hypothesize that bottom-up neural mechanisms linked to initiation of tinnitus, such as central gain and neural synchrony, are maximal around the time of tinnitus onset, but later subside by way of regression to the mean. We evaluated this hypothesis by measuring central auditory reactivity through the Intensity Dependence of Auditory Evoked Potential (IDAEP), a non-invasive index of higher-order inhibitory processing within the auditory system. A steeper IDAEP slope is associated with heightened sensory reactivity (higher sensitivity to changes in auditory stimuli), indicative of reduced central inhibition. Conversely, a shallower slope reflects greater inhibitory control. Studying a group with acute tinnitus (onset within six weeks), with a repeated assessment after six months from onset, we found an initially increased IDAEP slope in the acute stage, which had significantly reduced at follow-up, supporting our hypothesis that there is increased sensory reactivity during tinnitus onset, which need not persist in order for tinnitus to become chronic.

">Unveiling Distinct Neuroimmune Responses in Mouse Models of Cervical Spinal Cord Injury: Hemisection versus Hemicontusion</a></h4>

              
                Traumatic cervical spinal cord injury (cSCI) causes severe neurological deficits and long-term disability. Preclinical models such as cervical 2 (C2) hemisection (C2HS), resulting in disrupted communication between the respiratory centers and the phrenic motoneurons (PMN) pool, have been used since decades to study respiratory dysfunction and neuroinflammation after cSCI. Recently, contusive injuries such as C3 hemi-contusion (C3HC) have been increasingly used, as they induce phrenic motoneuron damage and offer a more clinically relevant model of SCI. However, these two different models may engage distinct pathophysiological cascades, raising concerns about the generalizability of findings across injury paradigms. In this study, we compared neuroimmune responses following C2HS or C3HC in mice. Animals underwent C2HS or C3HC, and spinal cord segments (C1-C8) were collected seven days post-injury for immuno-histological analyses around the lesion level and flow cytometry analyses at the lesion level. We observed that C2HS preserved more neurons and exhibited elevated CD86 and F4/80 expression. These markers are typically expressed by activated microglia and are indicative of a response oriented toward phagocytic and reparative functions. This phenotype was associated with limited pro-inflammatory cell infiltration and normalized level of systemic IL-6 in this model. Conversely, C3HC induced more extensive tissue damage, heightened microglial activation, a trend toward increased astrocytic reactivity, and significantly elevated CSPG levels on the contralateral side. Moreover, a persistent NK cell, neutrophil, and CD43 antigen-presenting cells infiltration, along with persistently high circulating IL-6 has been observed following C3HC. These findings demonstrate distinct neuroinflammatory signatures and repairing mechanisms between models, with C2HS promoting a microglia profile toward repair and C3HC leading to a prolonged and potentially harmful immune response. This study underscores, for the first time, how injury type shapes neuroimmune mechanisms, reinforcing the need for lesion-specific therapeutic strategies in cervical spinal cord injury.

">Feature-specific inhibitory connectivity augments the accuracy of cortical representations</a></h4>

              
                To interpret complex sensory scenes, animals exploit statistical regularities to infer missing features and suppress redundant or ambiguous information. Cortical microcircuits might contribute to this cognitive goal by either completing or cancelling predictable activity, but it remains unknown whether, and how, a single circuit can implement these antagonistic computations. To address this central question, we used all-optical physiology to simulate sensory-evoked activity patterns in pyramidal cells (PCs) and somatostatin interneurons (SSTs) in the mouse primary visual cortex. In the absence of external visual input, photostimulation of orientation-tuned PC ensembles drove either completion or cancelation of input-matching representations, depending on the number of photostimulated cells. This dual computational capacity arose from the co-existence of "like-to-like" excitatory interactions between PCs, and a newly discovered "like-to-like" SST-PC connectivity motif, in which SSTs are preferentially recruited by, and in turn suppress, similarly tuned PCs. Finally, we show that photoactivation of tuned SST ensembles during visual processing improved the discriminability of their preferred visual input by suppressing ambiguous activity. Thus, these complementary feature-specific connectivity motifs allow different strategies of contextual modulation to optimize inference by either completion (through PC-PC interactions) or cancelation (via PC-SST-PC loops) of predictable activity, depending on the structure of the input and the network state.

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Early-life stress and depression among youths are linked to hippocampal gray- and white-matter alterations. Less is known about hippocampal alterations in adolescent anxiety disorders (Anx) or the role that stress or comorbid depressive disorders (Anx + Dep) might play. Here, structural- and diffusion-MRI along with early-life stress-exposure reports were acquired from 197 adolescents (13.58–17.00 years) with Anx, Anx + Dep, and those without (Controls). A normative model externally validated on a large, healthy sample revealed that Anx were more likely than Controls and Anx + Dep to exhibit undersized hippocampal gray-matter volumes for their ages. Volume reductions among Anx were further localized to subfield CA1. No significant gray-matter differences were observed between Anx + Dep and Controls. Standardized probabilistic tractography in hippocampal white-matter pathways demonstrated that, relative to Controls, Anx and Anx + Dep exhibited lower fractional anisotropy specifically in the cingulum-temporal branch. All effects were specific to hippocampal structures. Group differences were not accounted for by early-life stress exposures, despite Anx and Anx + Dep reporting more than Controls. Findings indicated that gray-matter expansion, principally within CA1, may be disrupted among adolescents with anxiety disorders, but not those with comorbid depression. The progressive strengthening of hippocampal-cortical circuits occurring during adolescence may also be disrupted in adolescents with anxiety disorders, regardless of depression.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To determine whether established heart rate parameters of exercise, related to cardiac autonomic function, are associated with incident Parkinson's disease, independent of both clinical and autonomic prodromal features.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A study of UK Biobank participants who performed a standardized bicycle exercise test (2009–2013), followed until November 2022, and analyzed in January 2024, was carried out. Heart rate increase from rest to exercise, and heart rate decrease from peak exercise to recovery were associated with incident Parkinson's disease. Multivariable adjustment was performed both for clinical characteristics and for prodromal non-cardiac autonomic features.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 69,288 eligible participants (men 48%, mean age 56.8 years [SD 8.2 years]) were followed for 12.5 years: among the 319 (0.5%) who developed Parkinson's disease, recognized prodromal markers (constipation, bladder dysfunction) were more common at baseline. The median lag time to diagnosis was 9.3 years (interquartile range 4.4). Both heart rate increase (37.5 [SD 11.5] vs 40.8 [SD 12.4] b.p.m., <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and recovery (23.4 [SD 8.8] vs. 27.8 [SD 10.3] b.p.m., <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) were significantly lower in incident cases compared with controls. Heart rate recovery was independently associated with incident Parkinson's disease, whereas heart rate increase was not. Specifically, a blunted heart rate lowering during recovery was associated with a 30% higher risk of incident Parkinson's disease (HR 1.3; 95% CI 1.1–1.4; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001 per 10 beats less recovery).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Collectively, this suggests that cardiac autonomic involvement precedes clinically manifest Parkinson's disease, and that heart rate recovery might serve as a quantitative prodromal marker. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

<p>The schematic illustrates the interplay between differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and autophagy-related genes (ARGs) in ischemic stroke pathogenesis. PPP1R15A emerges as a central regulator, linking these gene networks by activating the TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway. This activation drives downstream processes, including cytotoxicity, apoptosis, autophagy, and neuroinflammation, ultimately exacerbating ischemic stroke progression.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Ischemic stroke (IS) is a prevalent and serious neurological disorder, and is one of the major contributors to mortality and disability worldwide. The activation of autophagy and the inflammatory response following cerebral ischemia are crucial in the progression of IS. Protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 15A (PPP1R15A), as a stress-responsive protein, has been proven to be closely associated with autophagy. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanism of PPP1R15A in IS remains to be fully understood. Our study screened PPP1R15A as a candidate gene by bioinformatics analysis of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in IS and autophagy-related genes (ARGs). Functionally, experiments uncovered that down-regulation of PPP1R15A alleviated oxygen–glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R)-mediated inhibition of cell viability and promotion of LDH release, cell apoptosis, autophagy, and inflammation in A172 and SH-SY5Y cells. Simultaneously, silencing PPP1R15A ameliorated the IS progression in the middle cerebral artery occlusion and reperfusion (MCAO/R) rat model. Furthermore, PPP1R15A activated the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)/nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) pathway in vivo and in vitro. Rescue experiments indicated that TLR4 inhibitors TAK-242 and NF-κB inhibitors BAY-11-7082 effectively alleviated the malignant progression of IS mediated by overexpression of PPP1R15A. Our data illustrated that PPP1R15A promoted OGD/R-induced cytotoxicity, apoptosis, autophagy, and inflammation by activating the TLR4/NF-κB pathway.</p>

<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Melatonin and its receptors play a primary role in regulating circadian rhythms, which are frequently disrupted in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Furthermore, there is increasing evidence that the use of a ketogenic diet (KD) delays the onset of AD. Therefore, we aimed to investigate whether KD has an ameliorative effect on AD through the regulation of melatonin receptors. In this study, male Sprague–Dawley rats were divided into three groups: sham, AD, and KD. At the end of KD supplementation, behavioral parameters were determined by the Morris Water Maze. Melatonin levels, protein expression levels, and immunoreactivity of MT1–MT2 in thehippocampus and striatum were determined by ELISA, Western blotting, and immunofluorescence staining, respectively. As a result, KD improved memory decline in AD rats. Also, KD increased melatonin levels in the hippocampus but did not affect striatum melatonin levels. MT1 expression tended to increase in the hippocampus of the AD group, while MT2 expression decreased. On the contrary, KD treatment increased both MT1 and MT2 expressions. In the striatum, there was no change in MT1 expression in the AD and KD groups, but MT2 expression increased in the AD group compared with the sham group and was suppressed in the KD group. In addition, KD treatment reduced streptozotocin-induced apoptosis and neuroinflammation in the hippocampus and striatum. Our results suggest that KD may improve AD-associated inflammation and apoptosis by altering melatonin levels and the expression of MT2 receptors in the hippocampus and striatum. Therefore, KD may be a promising preventive and therapeutic option for AD.</p>

                Sudholz et al. identified the core fucosyltransferase, FUT8, as an essential component for maintaining NK cell homeostasis, namely through the post-translational modification of the IL-15 receptor. The absence of FUT8 in murine NK cells resulted in significant impairments to their survival, proliferation, and cytotoxicity, which impaired anti-tumor immunity.

                The precise mechanism by which stress augments inflammation via Th17 cells remains unclear. Shimba et al. show that stress-associated hormone glucocorticoids enhance the glycolysis, proliferation, and differentiation of Th17 cells. Acute stress-induced glucocorticoids expand TCF1low Th17 cells, which promotes IL-17 production and neutrophil infiltration, thereby exacerbating intestinal inflammation.

">Backward Conditioning Reveals Flexibility in Infralimbic Cortex Inhibitory Memories</a></h4>

              
                While the infralimbic cortex (IL) is recognized as critical for behavioral inhibition, the content of the inhibitory memories stored in this region remains elusive. To probe this content, we examined some of the conditions that allow retrieval and facilitation of an inhibitory memory stored in the IL using optogenetic stimulation in female and male rats. We found that IL stimulation did not facilitate an initial fear extinction session. However, prior experience with fear extinction enabled IL stimulation to facilitate subsequent fear extinction. Importantly, the facilitative effects of IL stimulation were not limited to fear extinction experience, as prior exposure to backward fear conditioning also enabled IL stimulation to enhance later fear extinction. The effects were stimulus-specific and did not depend on the motivational context present during the prior experience, as backward appetitive conditioning allowed IL stimulation to facilitate later fear extinction. Additional experiments ruled out stimulus familiarity as an explanation for the facilitative effects of IL stimulation and demonstrated that IL-mediated facilitations occur in procedures other than fear extinction. Together, these findings demonstrate that the IL stores inhibitory memories that are extremely flexible since they can be retrieved and used across many inhibitory procedures and distinct motivational contexts. These features establish the IL as a critical hub for the flexible application of inhibitory knowledge that allows adaptive responses in dynamic environments.

">Exercise-induced plasma-derived extracellular vesicles increase adult hippocampal neurogenesis</a></h4>

              
                Aerobic exercise enhances cognition in part by increasing adult hippocampal neurogenesis, angiogenesis, and astrogliogenesis. Since hippocampal atrophy is a hallmark of several neurological and psychiatric conditions- including depression, PTSD, Alzheimers disease, and aging- understanding the mechanisms by which exercise increases neurogenesis has broad therapeutic relevance. One potential mechanism involves extracellular vesicles (EVs), lipid bilayer-enclosed particles released by multiple tissues during exercise that transport bioactive molecular cargo to distant organs, including the brain. In this study, we tested whether plasma-derived EVs from exercising mice (ExerVs) are sufficient to promote hippocampal neurogenesis, astrogliogenesis, and vascular density in sedentary mice. EVs were isolated from the plasma of sedentary or exercising C57BL/6J mice and injected intraperitoneally into sedentary recipients twice weekly for four weeks. To evaluate reproducibility, the study was conducted across two independent cohorts using identical procedures. ExerV-treated mice showed a significant increase in BrdU-positive cells in the granule cell layer compared to both PBS- and SedV-treated controls in both cohorts. Approximately 90% of these cells co-expressed NeuN, indicating neuronal differentiation, while 6% co-expressed S100B;, indicating astrocyte generation. No changes were observed in vascular density across groups. These findings provide initial evidence that systemically delivered exercise-derived EVs can enhance hippocampal neurogenesis and astrogliogenesis in sedentary mice. This proof-of-concept work supports further investigation into ExerVs as a potential therapeutic strategy for conditions associated with hippocampal atrophy.

">Digestive Dimensions of Autism: A Multiscale Exploration of Gut-Brain Interactions</a></h4>

              
                Social communication difficulties characterize autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms are more common in ASD than in the general population. The identification of GI problems in individuals with ASD is challenging due to their altered pain perception and irregular behaviors. Importantly, GI symptoms and ASD can potentially aggravate each other. However, it is unclear if GI problems cause ASD symptoms or vice versa. A crosstalk between the digestive system, gut microbiota, and the central and enteric nervous systems has been repeatedly reported. The enteric nervous system (ENS) regulates the GI tract with the central nervous system (CNS) and the autonomic nervous system (ANS), as well as independently through specific neural circuits. Several mechanisms contribute to GI problems in ASD, including genetic mutations that affect the enteric nervous system (ENS), dysregulation of the ANS, alterations in gut microbiota, unhealthy dietary preferences, and changes in metabolomic profiles. Furthermore, studies have shown molecular and cellular differences in the GI biopsy of children with and without ASD. These findings highlight the unique nature of GI issues in ASD, underscoring the importance of further investigating the changes that occur in the digestive system and enteric nervous system (ENS) in ASD models.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Early visual cortex, once thought to be exclusively used for visual processes, has been shown to represent auditory information in the absence of visual stimulation. However, the exact information content of these representations is still unclear, as is their degree of specificity. Here, we acquired functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data while blindfolded human participants listened to 36 natural sounds, hierarchically organized into semantic categories. Multivoxel pattern analysis revealed that animate and inanimate sounds, as well as human, animal, vehicle, and object sounds could be decoded from fMRI activity patterns in early visual regions V1, V2, and V3. Further, pairwise classification of the different sound categories demonstrated that sounds produced by humans were represented in early visual cortex more distinctively than other semantic categories. Whole-brain searchlight analysis showed that sounds could be decoded also in higher level visual and multisensory brain regions. Our findings extend our understanding of early visual cortex function beyond visual feature processing and show that semantic and categorical sound information is represented in early visual cortex, potentially used to predict visual input.</span>

The spontaneous Identical (IST) and the Different Stimuli Tests (DST), with objects and odors, allow for incidental memory testing using variable memory loads in rats. Here, fiber photometry and chemogenetics were used to examine the necessity of CaMKII-expressing neurons in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) for novelty discrimination in the IST and DST with odors. Male and female Long Evans rats completed 6-odor IST and DST. No differences in total exploration times or stimuli visits were observed in either test or sex. During the sample phase of the DST, a heightened response and a sustained increase in mPFC neuronal activity occurred during the first stimulus interaction. A sustained increase in mPFC neuronal activity during interaction with the novel stimulus was also observed in the test phase of the DST, but not the IST. Activation of inhibitory DREADDs expressed in mPFC CaMKII-expressing neurons impaired novelty preference in the DST, but not IST, and significantly decreased c-Fos + cells in the mPFC. Taken together, we show increased activity in mPFC CaMKII-expressing neurons facilitates novelty recognition under higher memory loads in the DST.</span>

Due to hearing impairments, deaf college students not only experienced a lot of physical pain personally but also had difficulties in social interactions. However, the empathy responses to others’ physical pain in the deaf college students is not well established. We assessed the brain activity of 27 deaf and 28 hearing college students when observing images depicting painful and nonpainful information by using event-related potentials. Results showed that compared to the hearing college students, the deaf college students exhibited greater N1, N2, and P3 amplitudes evoked by painful picture. This study indicated that deaf college students experienced heighten emotional arousal and more psychological resources costed when facing others in pain.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Temporal interference stimulation (TIS) is a novel technique for neural modulation; however, its precise effects on verbal working memory (WM) and underlying neural mechanisms remain underexplored. This study employed electroencephalogram (EEG) to investigate the temporal dynamics of TIS-induced modulation, with a particular focus on hemispheric lateralization, an aspect often overlooked. Using a delayed recognition task, we categorized WM into high-load and low-load conditions and applied TIS to the left and right hemispheres with sham stimulation as a control. The results revealed a robust right-lateralized effect of TIS under high-load conditions, characterized by increased N200 amplitude and decreased P300 amplitude at the right parietal site post-stimulation, whereas no significant effects emerged under low-load conditions. This pattern of results contrasts sharply with the null effects in low-load conditions, highlighting the influence of TIS on verbal WM under high-load conditions. Furthermore, our study uncovered distinct activation patterns between the 2 hemispheres, suggesting a complex interplay between hemispheric lateralization and TIS-induced neural modulation. Supporting the attention-memory model, our results indicated that the right parietal TIS facilitates cognitive resource redistribution through attentional modulation. This study fills a critical gap in understanding the impact of TIS on verbal WM and provides novel insights into its cognitive enhancement potential.</span>

                <p>Neurodevelopmental disorders disproportionately affect males compared with females. The biological mechanisms of this male susceptibility or female protection have not been identified. There is evidence that fetal/neonatal gonadal hormones, which play a pivotal role in many aspects of development, may contribute. Here, we investigate the effects of excess testosterone (T) during a critical period of sex-specific brain organization on social approach and fear learning behaviors in C57BL/6J wild-type mice. Male, but not female, mice treated with T on the day of birth (Postnatal Day 0; PN0) exhibited decreased social approach as juveniles and decreased contextual fear memory as adults, compared with vehicle (veh)-treated controls. These deficits were not driven by anxiety-like behavior or changes in locomotion or body weight. Mice treated with the same dose of T on PN18, which is outside of the critical period of brain masculinization, did not demonstrate impairments compared with the veh group. These findings indicate that excess T during a critical period of early development, but not shortly after, induces long-term deficits relevant to the male sex bias in neurodevelopmental disorders.</p>

Understanding the functions of proteins is of great importance for deciphering the mechanisms of life activities. To date, there have been over 200 million known proteins, but only 0.2% of them have well-annotated functional terms. By measuring the contacts among residues, proteins can be described as graphs so that the graph leaning approaches can be applied to learn protein representations. However, existing graph-based methods put efforts in enriching the residue node information and did not fully exploit the edge information, which leads to suboptimal representations considering the strong association of residue contacts to protein structures and to the functions. In this article, we propose SuperEdgeGO, which introduces the supervision of edges in protein graphs to learn a better graph representation for protein function prediction. Different from common graph convolution methods that uses edge information in a plain or unsupervised way, we introduce a <i>supervised</i> attention to encode the residue contacts <i>explicitly</i> into the protein representation. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that SuperEdgeGO achieves state-of-the-art performance on all three categories of protein functions. Additional ablation analysis further proves the effectiveness of the devised edge supervision strategy. The implementation of edge supervision in SuperEdgeGO resulted in enhanced graph representations for protein function prediction, as demonstrated by its superior performance across all the evaluated categories. This superior performance was confirmed through ablation analysis, which validated the effectiveness of the edge supervision strategy. This strategy has a broad application prospect in the study of protein function and related fields.

                <p>by Viktoria Zemliak, Gordon Pipa, Pascal Nieters</p>

Familiarity memory enables recognition of previously encountered inputs as familiar without recalling detailed stimuli information, which supports adaptive behavior across various timescales. We present a spiking neural network model with lateral connectivity shaped by unsupervised spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) that encodes familiarity via local plasticity events. We show that familiarity can be decoded from network activity using both frequency (spike count) and temporal (spike synchrony) characteristics of spike trains. Temporal coding demonstrates enhanced performance under sparse input conditions, consistent with the principles of sparse coding observed in the brain. We also show how connectivity structure supports each decoding strategy, revealing different plasticity regimes. Our approach outperforms LSTM in temporal generalizability on the continual familiarity detection task, with input stimuli being naturally encoded in the recurrent connectivity without a separate training stage.

RAF inhibitor “paradoxical activation” (PA) is a phenomenon where RAF kinase inhibitors increase RAF kinase signaling. Through mathematical modeling and experimental data analysis, we recently demonstrated that the combination of conformational autoinhibition (CA) with the disruption of CA by RAF inhibitors plays an important role in PA. 14-3-3 proteins are known to modulate RAF CA and RAF dimerization. We here extend our mathematical model to include both roles of 14-3-3 proteins, and we derive rigorous analytical expressions of RAF signal regulation as modulated by 14-3-3 proteins. We then use the model to investigate how 14-3-3 proteins may modulate PA. We mathematically show 14-3-3 protein stabilization of the autoinhibited form of RAF should potentiate PA, while 14-3-3 protein stabilization of the active RAF dimer should reduce PA. Our analysis suggests that the net-effect will often be a potentiation of PA, and that 14-3-3 proteins may be capable of inducing PA for RAF inhibitors that normally show little to no PA. We test model-based insights experimentally with two different approaches: forced increases in 14-3-3 expression (which we find amplifies PA) and evolved resistance assays (which suggest increased 14-3-3 expression may contribute to resistance to RAF inhibitors). Overall, this work supports a role for 14-3-3 in modulating RAF-inhibitor mediated paradoxical activation.

                Kines et al. find the pro-tumorigenic protein SEMA7A is upregulated in the aged environment and may be a downstream target of TGF-β signaling. The aged environment accelerates tumor growth and a mesenchymal phenotype, and this depends on SEMA7A host expression. SEMA7A overexpression accelerates metastasis, which is attenuated by inhibiting SEMA7A.

They engineer a ZIKV E protein variant, “ZIKVm10,” that minimizes DENV cross-reactivity, reduces ADE risk, and protects against lethal ZIKV challenge in mice, offering a pathway for safer, more targeted ZIKV vaccines.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104918">Trained immunity in the lung</a></h4>

              
                Trained immunity represents a recent concept that elucidates the long-term reprogramming of innate immune cells, enabling them to adapt and respond more effectively to subsequent encounters with diverse pathogens. Initially recognized through the Bacillus Calmette–Guérin vaccine, <i>Candida albicans</i> infection, and β-glucan administration, this phenomenon challenges the traditional view that immune memory is exclusive to the adaptive immune system. Trained immunity is characterized by epigenetic and metabolic modifications in innate immune cells that facilitate enhanced responses to infections through mechanisms like chromatin remodeling and altered gene expression. This review focuses on the implications of trained immunity within the lung environment, which is constantly exposed to a plethora of pathogens and environmental irritants. We discuss the roles of various immune cell types, including alveolar macrophages and dendritic cells, in mediating trained immunity and how these adaptations may influence pulmonary insults and disease. Furthermore, we highlight the potential for leveraging trained immunity to enhance vaccine efficacy and develop novel therapeutic strategies for immune-related lung conditions. As research progresses, understanding trained immunity in the lung could pave the way for innovative interventions that improve lung health and resilience against infections.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98843">Srs2 binding to proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and its sumoylation contribute to replication protein A (RPA) antagonism during the DNA damage response</a></h4>

              
                Activation of the DNA damage checkpoint upon genotoxin treatment induces a multitude of cellular changes to cope with genome stress. After prolonged genotoxin treatment, the checkpoint can be downregulated to allow cell cycle and growth resumption. In yeast, downregulation of the DNA damage checkpoint requires the Srs2 DNA helicase, which removes the ssDNA binding complex replication protein A (RPA) and the associated Mec1 checkpoint kinase from DNA, thus dampening Mec1-mediated checkpoint. However, it is unclear whether the ‘anti-checkpoint’ role of Srs2 is temporally and spatially regulated to allow timely checkpoint termination while preventing superfluous RPA removal. Here we address this question by examining regulatory elements of Srs2, such as its phosphorylation, sumoylation, and protein-interaction sites. Our genetic analyses and checkpoint level assessment suggest that the RPA countering role of Srs2 is promoted by Srs2 binding to proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), which recruits Srs2 to a subset of ssDNA containing regions. RPA antagonism is further fostered by Srs2 sumoylation, which we found depends on the Srs2-PCNA interaction and Mec1, and peaks after Mec1 activity reaches maximal levels. These data support a model in which Srs2 recruitment to PCNA adjacent to ssDNA-RPA filaments, followed by Mec1-dependent sumoylation, modulates RPA-mediated checkpoint signaling, while Srs2 action is limited at ssDNA regions lacking proximal PCNA, thereby favoring RPA-mediated ssDNA protection and repair.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105430">Meteorins regulate the formation of the left-right organizer and the establishment of vertebrate body asymmetry</a></h4>

              
                While the exterior of vertebrate bodies appears bilaterally symmetrical, internal organ positioning and morphology frequently exhibit left-right (L-R) asymmetries. In several vertebrates, including human, mouse, frog, and zebrafish, left-right symmetry-breaking during embryonic development is initiated by a ciliated organ called the Node or left-right organizer. Within the Node, a leftward flow of extraembryonic fluid named the Nodal flow mediates the asymmetric expressions of Nodal factors. Although downstream Nodal pathway components leading to the establishment of the embryonic left-right axis are well known, less is known about the development and formation of the embryonic Node itself. Here, we reveal a novel role for the Meteorin protein family in the establishment of the left-right axis and in the formation of Kupffer’s vesicle, the Node equivalent structure in zebrafish. We show that the genetic inactivation of each or all three members of the zebrafish Meteorin family (<i>metrn</i>, <i>metrn-like a,</i> and <i>metrn-like b</i>) leads to defects in properties of the Kupffer’s vesicle, caused by impaired assembly and migration of the Kupffer’s vesicle forming dorsal forerunner cells. In addition, we demonstrate that Meteorins genetically interact with integrins ItgαV and Itgβ1b, regulating the dorsal forerunner cell clustering, and that <i>meteorins</i> loss-of-function results in disturbed Nodal factor expression and consequently in randomized or symmetric heart looping and jogging. These results identify a new role for the Meteorin protein family in the left-right asymmetry patterning during embryonic vertebrate development.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105087">Interleukin-4 induces CD11c+ microglia leading to amelioration of neuropathic pain in mice</a></h4>

              
                Neuropathic pain, a debilitating chronic pain condition, is a major clinical challenge. The pleiotropic cytokine interleukin-4 (IL-4) has been shown to suppress neuropathic pain in rodent models, but its underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here, we show that intrathecal administration of IL-4 to mice with spinal nerve transection (SpNT) increased the number of CD11c<sup>+</sup> microglia (a microglia subset important for pain remission) in the spinal dorsal horn (SDH) and that this effect of IL-4 was essential for its ameliorating effect on SpNT-induced pain hypersensitivity. Furthermore, in mice with spared nerve injury (SNI), another model in which pain remission does not occur, the emergence of CD11c<sup>+</sup> SDH microglia was curtailed, but intrathecal IL-4 increased their emergence and ameliorated pain hypersensitivity in a CD11c<sup>+</sup> microglia-dependent manner. Our study reveals a mechanism by which intrathecal IL-4 ameliorates pain hypersensitivity after nerve injury and provides evidence that IL-4 increases CD11c<sup>+</sup> microglia with a function that ameliorates neuropathic pain.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106657">Conserved and unique features of terminal telomeric sequences in ALT-positive cancer cells</a></h4>

              
                A significant portion of human cancers utilize a recombination-based pathway, alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT), to maintain telomere length. Targeting the ALT is of growing interest as a cancer therapy, yet a substantial knowledge gap remains regarding the basic features of telomeres in ALT-positive cells. To address this, we adopted END-seq, an unbiased sequencing-based approach, to define the identity and regulation of the terminal sequences of chromosomes in ALT cells. Our data reveal that the terminal portions of chromosomes in ALT cells contain canonical telomeric sequences with the same terminus bias (-ATC) observed in non-ALT cells. Furthermore, as reported for non-ALT cells, POT1 is required to preserve the precise regulation of the 5′ end in cells that maintain telomere length using the ALT pathway. Thus, the regulation of the terminal 5′ of chromosomes occurs independently of the mechanism of telomere elongation. Additionally, we employed an S1 endonuclease-based sequencing method to determine the presence and origin of single-stranded regions within ALT telomeres. These data shed light on conserved and unique features of ALT telomeres.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105955">Separable dorsal raphe dopamine projections mimic the facets of a loneliness-like state</a></h4>

              
                Affiliative social connections facilitate well-being and survival in numerous species. Engaging in social interactions requires positive or negative motivational drive, elicited through coordinated activity across neural circuits. However, the identity, interconnectivity, and functional encoding of social information within these circuits remains poorly understood. Here, we focus on downstream projections of dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) dopamine neurons (DRN<sup>DAT</sup>) in mice, which we previously implicated in social motivation alongside an aversive affective state. We show that three prominent DRN<sup>DAT</sup> projections – to the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), central amygdala (CeA), and posterior basolateral amygdala (BLP) – play separable roles in behavior, despite substantial collateralization. Photoactivation of the DRN<sup>DAT</sup>-CeA projection promoted social behavior and photostimulation of the DRN<sup>DAT</sup>-BNST projection promoted exploratory behavior, while the DRN<sup>DAT</sup>-BLP projection supported place avoidance, suggesting a negative affective state. Downstream regions showed diverse receptor expression, poising DRN<sup>DAT</sup> neurons to act through dopamine, neuropeptide, and glutamate transmission. Furthermore, we show ex vivo that the effect of DRN<sup>DAT</sup> photostimulation on downstream neuron excitability depended on region and baseline cell properties, resulting in excitatory responses in BNST cells and diverse responses in CeA and BLP. Finally, in vivo microendoscopic cellular-resolution recordings in the CeA with DRN<sup>DAT</sup> photostimulation revealed a correlation between social behavior and neurons excited by social stimuli, suggesting that increased dopamine tone may recruit different CeA neurons to social ensembles. Collectively, these circuit features may facilitate a coordinated, but flexible, response in the presence of social stimuli that can be flexibly guided based on the internal social homeostatic need state of the individual.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105585">Loss of olfaction reduces caterpillar performance and increases susceptibility to a natural enemy</a></h4>

              
                Insect herbivores such as caterpillars are under strong selection pressure from natural enemies, especially parasitoid wasps. Although the role of olfaction in host-plant seeking has been investigated in great detail in parasitoids and adult lepidopterans, the caterpillar olfactory system and its significance in tri-trophic interactions remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the olfactory system of <i>Pieris brassicae</i> caterpillars and the importance of olfactory information in the interactions among this herbivore, its host-plant <i>Brassica oleracea</i>, and its primary natural enemy <i>Cotesia glomerata</i>. To examine the role of olfaction, we utilized CRISPR/Cas9 to knockout (KO) the odorant receptor co-receptor (<i>Orco</i>). This KO impaired olfactory detection and primary processing in the brain. <i>Orco</i> KO caterpillars exhibited reduced weight and lost preference for their optimal food plants. Interestingly, the KO caterpillars also experienced reduced weight when challenged by the parasitoid <i>C. glomerata</i> whose ovipositor had been removed, and the mortality of the KO caterpillars under the attack of unmanipulated parasitoids increased. We then investigated the behavior of <i>P. brassicae</i> caterpillars in response to volatiles from plants attacked by conspecific caterpillars and volatiles from plants on which the caterpillars were themselves attacked by <i>C. glomerata</i>. After analyzing the volatile compounds involved in these interactions, we concluded that olfactory information enables caterpillars to locate suitable food sources more efficiently as well as to select enemy-free spaces. Our results reveal the crucial role of olfaction in caterpillar feeding and natural-enemy avoidance, highlighting the significance of chemoreceptor genes in shaping ecological interactions.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105887">Phage-displayed synthetic library and screening platform for nanobody discovery</a></h4>

              
                Nanobodies, single-domain antibodies derived from camelid heavy-chain antibodies, are known for their high affinity, stability, and small size, which make them useful in biological research and therapeutic applications. However, traditional nanobody generation methods rely on camelid immunization, which can be costly and time-consuming, restricting their practical feasibility. In this study, we present a phage-displayed synthetic library for nanobody discovery. To validate this approach, we screened nanobodies targeting various <i>Drosophila</i> secreted proteins. The nanobodies identified were suitable for applications such as immunostaining and immunoblotting, supporting the phage-displayed synthetic library as a versatile platform for nanobody development. To address the challenge of limited accessibility to high-quality synthetic libraries, this library is openly available for non-profit use.
