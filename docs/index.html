<p>Neurofeedback is a form of brain training in which subjects are fed back
information about some measure of their brain activity which they are
instructed to modify in a way thought to be functionally advantageous. Over the
last twenty years, NF has been used to treat various neurological and
psychiatric conditions, and to improve cognitive function in various contexts.
However, despite its growing popularity, each of the main steps in NF comes
with its own set of often covert assumptions. Here we critically examine some
conceptual and methodological issues associated with the way general objectives
and neural targets of NF are defined, and review the neural mechanisms through
which NF may act, and the way its efficacy is gauged. The NF process is
characterised in terms of functional dynamics, and possible ways in which it
may be controlled are discussed. Finally, it is proposed that improving NF will
require better understanding of various fundamental aspects of brain dynamics
and a more precise definition of functional brain activity and brain-behaviour
relationships.

<p>Automatic sleep staging is a challenging problem and state-of-the-art
algorithms have not yet reached satisfactory performance to be used instead of
manual scoring by a sleep technician. Much research has been done to find good
feature representations that extract the useful information to correctly
classify each epoch into the correct sleep stage. While many useful features
have been discovered, the amount of features have grown to an extent that a
feature reduction step is necessary in order to avoid the curse of
dimensionality. One reason for the need of such a large feature set is that
many features are good for discriminating only one of the sleep stages and are
less informative during other stages. This paper explores how a second feature
representation over a large set of pre-defined features can be learned using an
auto-encoder with a selective attention for the current sleep stage in the
training batch. This selective attention allows the model to learn feature
representations that focuses on the more relevant inputs without having to
perform any dimensionality reduction of the input data. The performance of the
proposed algorithm is evaluated on a large data set of polysomnography (PSG)
night recordings of patients with sleep-disordered breathing. The performance
of the auto-encoder with selective attention is compared with a regular
auto-encoder and previous works using a deep belief network (DBN).

<p>Development of a mesoscale neural circuitry map of the common marmoset is an
essential task due to the ideal characteristics of the marmoset as a model
organism for neuroscience research. To facilitate this development there is a
need for new computational tools to cross-register multi-modal data sets
containing MRI volumes as well as multiple histological series, and to register
the combined data set to a common reference atlas. We present a fully automatic
pipeline for same-subject-MRI guided reconstruction of image volumes from a
series of histological sections of different modalities, followed by
diffeomorphic mapping to a reference atlas. We show registration results for
Nissl, myelin, CTB, and fluorescent tracer images using a same-subject ex-vivo
MRI as our reference and show that our method achieves accurate registration
and eliminates artifactual warping that may be result from the absence of a
reference MRI data set. Examination of the determinant of the local metric
tensor of the diffeomorphic mapping between each subject's ex-vivo MRI and
resultant Nissl reconstruction allows an unprecedented local quantification of
geometrical distortions resulting from the histological processing, showing a
slight shrinkage, a median linear scale change of ~-1% in going from the
ex-vivo MRI to the tape-transfer generated histological image data.

<p>Learned Categorical Perception (CP) occurs when the members of different
categories come to look more dissimilar (between-category separation) and/or
members of the same category come to look more similar (within-category
compression) after a new category has been learned. To measure learned CP and
its physiological correlates we compared dissimilarity judgments and Event
Related Potentials (ERPs) before and after learning to sort multi-featured
visual textures into two categories by trial and error with corrective
feedback. With the same frequency of trials and feedback, about half the
participants succeeded in learning the categories (learners: criterion 80%
accuracy) and the rest did not (non-learners). The lower the proportion of
features distinguishing category members from non-members (i.e., greater
difficulty), the fewer the learners and the more trials it took them to learn.
At both lower and higher levels of difficulty, successful learners showed
significant between-category separation in pairwise dissimilarity judgments
after learning compared to before; their late parietal ERP positivity (LPC,
usually interpreted as decisional) also increased and their occipital
negativity (N1) (usually interpreted as perceptual) decreased. The LPC of
learners increased with response accuracy whereas their N1 amplitude after
learning increased with between-category separation. Non-learners showed no
significant changes in dissimilarity judgments, LPC or N1, within or between
categories. This is behavioral and physiological evidence that category
learning can alter perception. We sketch a neural net model for this effect.

<p>Goal: Limited-channel EEG research in neonates is hindered by lack of open,
accessible analytic tools. To overcome this limitation, we have created the
Washington University- Neonatal EEG Analysis Toolbox (WU-NEAT), containing two
of the most commonly used tools, provided in an open-source,
clinically-validated package running within MATLAB. Methods: The first
algorithm is the amplitude-integrated EEG (aEEG), which is generated by
filtering, rectifying and time-compressing the original EEG recording, with
subsequent semi-logarithmic display. The second algorithm is the spectral edge
frequency (SEF), calculated as the critical frequency below which a user-
defined proportion of the EEG spectral power is located. The aEEG algorithm was
validated by three experienced reviewers. Reviewers evaluated aEEG recordings
of fourteen preterm/term infants, displayed twice in random order, once using a
reference algorithm and again using the WU-NEAT aEEG algorithm. Using standard
methodology, reviewers assigned a background pattern classification.
Inter/intra-rater reliability was assessed. For the SEF, calculations were made
using the same fourteen recordings, first with the reference and then with the
WU-NEAT algorithm. Results were compared using Pearson's correlation
coefficient. Results: For the aEEG algorithm, intra- and inter-rater
reliability was 100% and 98%, respectively. For the SEF, the mean (SD) Pearson
correlation coefficient between algorithms was 0.96 (0.04). Conclusion: We have
demonstrated a clinically-validated toolbox for generating the aEEG as well as
calculating the SEF from EEG data. Open-source access will enable widespread
use of common analytic algorithms which are device-independent and not subject
to obsolescence, thereby facilitating future collaborative research in neonatal
EEG.

Behavioral studies show that motor actions are planned by adapting motor programs to produce desired visual consequences. Does this mean that the brain plans these visual consequences independent of the motor actions required to obtain them? Here we addressed this question by investigating planning-related fMRI activity in human posterior parietal (PPC) and dorsal premotor (PMd) cortex. By manipulating visual movement of a virtual end-effector controlled via button presses we could dissociate motor actions from their sensory outcome. A clear representation of the visual consequences was visible in both PPC and PMd activity during early planning stages. Our findings suggest that in both PPC and PMd action plans are initially represented on the basis of the desired sensory outcomes while later activity shifts towards representing motor programs.

A common goal in data-analysis is to sift through a large data-matrix and detect any significant submatrices (i.e., biclusters) that have a low numerical rank. We present a simple algorithm for tackling this biclustering problem. Our algorithm accumulates information about 2-by-2 submatrices (i.e., ‘loops’) within the data-matrix, and focuses on rows and columns of the data-matrix that participate in an abundance of low-rank loops. We demonstrate, through analysis and numerical-experiments, that this loop-counting method performs well in a variety of scenarios, outperforming simple spectral methods in many situations of interest. Another important feature of our method is that it can easily be modified to account for aspects of experimental design which commonly arise in practice. For example, our algorithm can be modified to correct for controls, categorical- and continuous-covariates, as well as sparsity within the data. We demonstrate these practical features with two examples; the first drawn from gene-expression analysis and the second drawn from a much larger genome-wide-association-study (GWAS).<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/MbY469xyEU0" width="1" />

Cytoskeletal components, such as tubulins and actins, have the remarkable ability to organize themselves into filaments and networks to support specialized and compartmentalized functions. Alterations in cytoskeletal proteins have long been associated with a variety of neurodevelopmental disorders. This review focuses on recent findings, primarily from forward genetic screens in Caenorhabditis elegans that illustrate how different tubulin protein isotypes can play distinct roles in neuronal development and function. Additionally, we discuss studies revealing new regulators of the actin cytoskeleton, and highlight recent technological advances in in vivo imaging and functional dissection of the neuronal cytoskeleton. <br /><br />

Publication date: October 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 52<br />     Author(s): Manuel   Valero, Liset Menendez   de la Prida<br /> Understanding how the brain represents events is a fundamental question in neuroscience. The entorhinal–hippocampal system is central to such representations, which are severely compromised in some neurological diseases. In spite of much progress, a comprehensive, integrated view of spatial, temporal and other aspects of episodic representation remains elusive. Here, we review recent data on the role of cell-type specific entorhinal inputs which excite deep and superficial CA1 pyramidal cells by direct and indirect pathways. We discuss how an entorhinal dialogue with deep-superficial CA1 cells can multiplex neuronal activity along theta phases and how their reactivation may be segregated during sharp-wave ripples. Thus, deep and superficial CA1 sublayers provide substrate for general hippocampal function. <br /> <h3 class="h3">Graphical abstract</h3> <img alt="image" height="159" src="http://origin-ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0959438817302994-fx1.jpg" width="301" /><br />

Publication date: October 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 52<br />     Author(s): Yutaka   Yoshida, Tadashi   Isa<br /> An ability to control dexterous hand movements is considered to parallel the evolutionary development of the corticospinal tract and the appearance of direct connections between corticospinal neurons and motoneurons (the corticomotoneuronal (CM) pathway), which developed uniquely in higher primates. However, recent studies have revealed that some non-primate animal species have higher levels of dexterity than previously supposed, and in higher primates, various indirect non-CM descending pathways have been shown to participate in the control of dexterous movements. More recently, the CM pathway was shown to exist in rodents during early development, suggesting that rodents and primates diverged in their reliance on the CM pathway at some point in evolution, thus challenging the traditional view of the sequential development of hand control from rodents to primates. <br /><br />

Publication date: August 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 51<br />     Author(s): Tara E   Tracy, Li   Gan<br /> The accumulation of pathological tau in the brain is associated with neuronal deterioration and cognitive impairments in tauopathies including Alzheimer's disease. Tau, while primarily localized in the axons of healthy neurons, accumulates in the soma and dendrites of neurons under pathogenic conditions. Tau is found in both presynaptic and postsynaptic compartments of neurons in Alzheimer's disease. New research supports that soluble forms of tau trigger pathophysiology in the brain by altering properties of synaptic and neuronal function at the early stages of disease progression, before neurons die. Here we review the current understanding of how tau-mediated synaptic and neuronal dysfunction contributes to cognitive decline. Delineating the mechanisms by which pathogenic tau alters synapses, dendrites and axons will help lay the foundation for new strategies that can restore neuronal function in tauopathy. <br /><br />

Publication date: June 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 50<br />     Author(s): Guosong   Hong, Xiao   Yang, Tao   Zhou, Charles M   Lieber<br /> Existing implantable neurotechnologies for understanding the brain and treating neurological diseases have intrinsic properties that have limited their capability to achieve chronically-stable brain interfaces with single-neuron spatiotemporal resolution. These limitations reflect what has been dichotomy between the structure and mechanical properties of living brain tissue and non-living neural probes. To bridge the gap between neural and electronic networks, we have introduced the new concept of mesh electronics probes designed with structural and mechanical properties such that the implant begins to ‘look and behave’ like neural tissue. Syringe-implanted mesh electronics have led to the realization of probes that are neuro-attractive and free of the chronic immune response, as well as capable of stable long-term mapping and modulation of brain activity at the single-neuron level. This review provides a historical overview of a 10-year development of mesh electronics by highlighting the tissue-like design, syringe-assisted delivery, seamless neural tissue integration, and single-neuron level chronic recording stability of mesh electronics. We also offer insights on unique near-term opportunities and future directions for neuroscience and neurology that now are available or expected for mesh electronics neurotechnologies. <br /><br />

Publication date: December 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 53<br />     Author(s): Henrik   Boije, Klas   Kullander<br /> The spinal circuitry governing the undulatory movements of swimming vertebrates consist of excitatory and commissural inhibitory interneurons and motor neurons. This locomotor network generates the rhythmic output, coordinate left/right alternation, and permit communication across segments. Through evolution, more complex movement patterns have emerged, made possible by sub-specialization of neural populations within the spinal cord. Walking tetrapods use a similar basic circuitry, but have added layers of complexity for the coordination of intralimbic flexor and extensor muscles as well as interlimbic coordination between the body halves and fore/hindlimbs. Although the basics of these circuits are known there is a gap in our knowledge regarding how different speeds and gaits are coordinated. Analysing subpopulations among described neuronal populations may bring insight into how changes in locomotor output are orchestrated by a hard-wired network. <br /><br />

Publication date: August 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 51<br />     Author(s): Anne   Bertolotti<br /> Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's, Huntington's, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and prion disorders are devastating neurodegenerative diseases of increasing prevalence in aging populations. Although clinically different, they share similar molecular features: the accumulation of one or two proteins in abnormal conformations inside or outside neurons. Enhancing protein quality control systems could be a useful strategy to neutralize the abnormal proteins causing neurodegenerative diseases. This review emphasizes the subcellular location of protein deposits in neurodegenerative diseases and the need to tailor strategies aimed at boosting protein quality control systems to the affected subcellular compartment. Inhibition of a protein phosphatase terminating the unfolded protein response will be discussed as a strategy to protect from diseases associated with misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum. <br /><br />

Publication date: December 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 53<br />     Author(s): Emilia   Favuzzi, Beatriz   Rico<br /> The complexity and precision of cortical circuitries is achieved during development due to the exquisite diversity of synapse types that is generated in a highly regulated manner. Here, we review the recent increase in our understanding of how synapse type-specific molecules differentially regulate the development of excitatory and inhibitory synapses. Moreover, several synapse subtype-specific molecules have been shown to control the targeting, formation or maturation of particular subtypes of excitatory synapses. Because inhibitory neurons are extremely diverse, a similar molecular diversity is likely to underlie the development of different inhibitory synapses making it a promising topic for future investigation in the field of the synapse development. <br /><br />

Since the earliest days of embryology, lineage questions have been addressed with methods of increasing specificity, capacity, and resolution. Yet, a full realization of individual cell lineages remains challenging for complex systems. A recent explosion of technical advances in genome-editing and single-cell sequencing has enabled lineage analysis in an unprecedented scale, speed, and depth across different species. In this review, we discuss the application of available as well as future genetic labeling techniques for tracking neural lineages in vivo in the mammalian nervous system. <br /><br />

Publication date: December 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 53<br />     Author(s): Clinton   Cave, Shanthini   Sockanathan<br /> The embryonic generation of motor neurons is a complex process involving progenitor patterning, fate specification, differentiation, and maturation. Throughout this progression, the differential expression of transcription factors has served as our road map for the eventual cell fate of nascent motor neurons. Recent findings from in vivo and in vitro models of motor neuron development have expanded our understanding of how transcription factors govern motor neuron identity and their individual regulatory mechanisms. With the advent of next generation sequencing approaches, researchers now have unprecedented access to the gene regulatory dynamics involved in motor neuron development and are uncovering new connections linking neurodevelopment and neurodegenerative disease. <br /><br />

Publication date: August 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 51<br />     Author(s): Sylvain   Rama, Mickaël   Zbili, Dominique   Debanne<br /> Axons link distant brain regions and are usually considered as simple transmission cables in which reliable propagation occurs once an action potential has been generated. Safe propagation of action potentials relies on specific ion channel expression at strategic points of the axon such as nodes of Ranvier or axonal branch points. However, while action potentials are generally considered as the quantum of neuronal information, their signaling is not entirely digital. In fact, both their shape and their conduction speed have been shown to be modulated by activity, leading to regulations of synaptic latency and synaptic strength. We report here newly identified mechanisms of (1) safe spike propagation along the axon, (2) compartmentalization of action potential shape in the axon, (3) analog modulation of spike-evoked synaptic transmission and (4) alteration in conduction time after persistent regulation of axon morphology in central neurons. We discuss the contribution of these regulations in information processing. <br /><br />

Publication date: October 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 52<br />     Author(s): Kanika   Bansal, Johan   Nakuci, Sarah Feldt   Muldoon<br /> Many recent efforts in computational modeling of macro-scale brain dynamics have begun to take a data-driven approach by incorporating structural and/or functional information derived from subject data. Here, we discuss recent work using personalized brain network models to study structure–function relationships in human brains. We describe the steps necessary to build such models and show how this computational approach can provide previously unobtainable information through the ability to perform virtual experiments. Finally, we present examples of how personalized brain network models can be used to gain insight into the effects of local stimulation and improve surgical outcomes in epilepsy. <br /> <h3 class="h3">Graphical abstract</h3> <img alt="image" height="93" src="http://origin-ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0959438818300059-fx1.jpg" width="301" /><br />

However, bulk of evidence demonstrates the requirement of the reciprocal interactions between cortical and thalamic neurons as key for the correct development of functional thalamocortical circuits. This reciprocal loop of connections is essential for sensory processing as well as for the execution of complex sensory-motor tasks. Here, we review recent advances in our understanding of how mutual collaborations between both brain regions define area patterning and cell differentiation in the thalamus and cortex. <br /><br />

Publication date: June 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 50<br />     Author(s): Nicholas A   Steinmetz, Christof   Koch, Kenneth D   Harris, Matteo   Carandini<br /> Electrophysiological methods are the gold standard in neuroscience because they reveal the activity of individual neurons at high temporal resolution and in arbitrary brain locations. Microelectrode arrays based on complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology, such as Neuropixels probes, look set to transform these methods. Neuropixels probes provide ∼1000 recording sites on an extremely narrow shank, with on-board amplification, digitization, and multiplexing. They deliver low-noise recordings from hundreds of neurons, providing a step change in the type of data available to neuroscientists. Here we discuss the opportunities afforded by these probes for large-scale electrophysiology, the challenges associated with data processing and anatomical localization, and avenues for further improvements of the technology. <br /><br />

Publication date: August 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 51<br />     Author(s): Craig   Blackstone<br /> Hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSPs) are neurologic disorders characterized by prominent lower-extremity spasticity, resulting from a length-dependent axonopathy of corticospinal upper motor neurons. They are among the most genetically-diverse neurologic disorders, with &amp;gt;80 distinct genetic loci and over 60 identified genes. Studies investigating the molecular pathogenesis underlying HSPs have emphasized the importance of converging cellular pathogenic themes in the most common forms of HSP, providing compelling targets for therapy. Most notably, these include organelle shaping and biogenesis as well as membrane and cargo trafficking. <br /><br />

Publication date: August 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 51<br />     Author(s): Kelsey A   Herrmann, Heather T   Broihier<br /> Although retrograde neurotrophin signaling has provided an immensely influential paradigm for understanding growth factor signaling in the nervous system, recent studies indicate that growth factors also signal via cell-autonomous, or autocrine, mechanisms. Autocrine signals have been discovered in many neuronal contexts, providing insights into their regulation and function. The growing realization of the importance of cell-autonomous signaling stems from advances in both conditional genetic approaches and in sophisticated analyses of growth factor dynamics, which combine to enable rigorous in vivo dissection of signaling pathways. Here we review recent studies defining autocrine roles for growth factors such as BDNF, and classical morphogens, including Wnts and BMPs, in regulating neuronal development and plasticity. Collectively, these studies highlight an intimate relationship between activity-dependent autocrine signaling and synaptic plasticity, and further suggest a common principle for coordinating paracrine and autocrine signaling in the nervous system. <br /><br />

Publication date: June 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 50<br />     Author(s): Philipp   Gutruf, John A   Rogers<br /> Recently developed classes of ultraminiaturized wireless devices provide powerful capabilities in neuroscience research, as implantable light sources for simulation/inhibition via optogenetics, as integrated microfluidic systems for programmed pharmacological delivery and as multimodal sensors for physiological measurements. These platforms leverage basic advances in biocompatible materials, semiconductor device designs and systems engineering concepts to afford modes of operation that are qualitatively distinct from those of conventional approaches that tether animals to external hardware by means of optical fibers, electrical cables and/or fluidic tubing. Neuroscience studies that exploit the unique features of these technologies enable insights into neural function through targeted stimulation, inhibition and recording, with spatially and genetically precise manipulation of neural circuit activity. Experimental possibilities include studies in naturalistic, three dimensional environments, investigations of pair-wise or group related social interactions and many other scenarios of interest that cannot be addressed using traditional hardware. <br /><br />

Publication date: August 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 51<br />     Author(s): Patrick   Lüningschrör, Michael   Sendtner<br /> Regulated release of neurotransmitter depends on the orchestrated function of a large number of proteins in the presynaptic compartment. When synaptic vesicles fuse with the plasma membrane, these membranes and the attached proteins are endocytosed and either recycled or degraded. This turnover needs to be tightly regulated in a timely and spatially confined manner. Increasing evidence suggests that these mechanisms do not only serve for the removal of defective synaptic vesicles or structural proteins of the active zone but also contribute to pathways regulating synaptic strength. The corresponding presynaptic autophagy system thus appears also important for synaptic maintenance and plasticity. Exciting new studies provide evidence how the autophagy machinery recognizes and degrades synaptic components and lay the ground to understand how autophagy in the presynaptic compartment contributes to modulation and maintenance of synaptic function. <br /><br />

Publication date: August 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 51<br />     Author(s): Natali L   Chanaday, Ege T   Kavalali<br /> Presynaptic nerve terminals release neurotransmitter synchronously, asynchronously or spontaneously. During synchronous neurotransmission release is precisely coupled to action potentials, in contrast, asynchronous release events show only loose temporal coupling to presynaptic activity whereas spontaneous neurotransmission occurs independent of presynaptic activity. The mechanisms that give rise to this diversity in neurotransmitter release modes are poorly understood. Recent studies have described several presynaptic molecular pathways controlling synaptic vesicle pool segregation and recycling, which in turn may dictate distinct modes of neurotransmitter release. In this article, we review this recent work regarding neurotransmitter release modes and their relationship to synaptic vesicle pool dynamics as well as the molecular machinery that establishes synaptic vesicle pool identity. <br /><br />

Publication date: June 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 50<br />     Author(s): Denis   Scaini, Laura   Ballerini<br /> Interfacing the nervous system with devices able to efficiently record or modulate the electrical activity of neuronal cells represents the underlying foundation of future theranostic applications in neurology and of current openings in neuroscience research. These devices, usually sensing cell activity via microelectrodes, should be characterized by safe working conditions in the biological milieu together with a well-controlled operation-life. The stable device/neuronal electrical coupling at the interface requires tight interactions between the electrode surface and the cell membrane. This neuro-electrode hybrid represents the hyphen between the soft nature of neural tissue, generating electrical signals via ion motions, and the rigid realm of microelectronics and medical devices, dealing with electrons in motion. Efficient integration of these entities is essential for monitoring, analyzing and controlling neuronal signaling but poses significant technological challenges. Improving the cell/electrode interaction and thus the interface performance requires novel engineering of (nano)materials: tuning at the nanoscale electrode's properties may lead to engineer interfacing probes that better camouflaged with their biological target. In this brief review, we highlight the most recent concepts in nanotechnologies and nanomaterials that might help reducing the mismatch between tissue and electrode, focusing on the device's mechanical properties and its biological integration with the tissue. <br /><br />

Abstract<p>The precise nature of the engram, the physical substrate of memory, remains uncertain. Here, it is reported that RNA extracted from the central nervous system of <i>Aplysia</i> given long-term sensitization training induced sensitization when injected into untrained animals; furthermore, the RNA-induced sensitization, like training-induced sensitization, required DNA methylation. In cellular experiments, treatment with RNA extracted from trained animals was found to increase excitability in sensory neurons, but not in motor neurons, dissociated from naïve animals. Thus, the behavioral, and a subset of the cellular, modifications characteristic of a form of nonassociative long-term memory in <i>Aplysia</i> can be transferred by RNA. These results indicate that RNA is sufficient to generate an engram for long-term sensitization in <i>Aplysia</i> and are consistent with the hypothesis that RNA-induced epigenetic changes underlie memory storage in <i>Aplysia</i>.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> It is generally accepted that long-term memory (LTM) is encoded as alterations in synaptic strength. An alternative model, however, proposes that LTM is encoded by epigenetic changes. Non-coding RNAs can mediate epigenetic modifications. Therefore, RNA from a trained animal might be capable of producing learning-like behavioral change in an untrained animal. Here, it is demonstrated that the memory for long-term sensitization in the marine mollusk <i>Aplysia</i> can be successfully transferred by injecting RNA from sensitized into naïve animals. Moreover, a specific cellular alteration that underlies sensitization in <i>Aplysia</i>, sensory neuron hyperexcitability, can be reproduced by exposing sensory neurons <i>in vitro</i> to RNA from trained animals. The results provide support for a nonsynaptic, epigenetic model of memory storage in <i>Aplysia</i>.</p>

Abstract<p>Protein Interacting with C-Kinase 1 (PICK1) is a widely expressed scaffold protein known to interact via its PDZ domain with several membrane proteins including the dopamine (DA) transporter (DAT), the primary target for cocaine’s reinforcing actions. Here, we establish the importance of PICK1 for behavioral effects observed after both acute and repeated administration of cocaine. In PICK1 knockout (KO) mice, the acute locomotor response to a single injection of cocaine was markedly attenuated. Moreover, in support of a role for PICK1 in neuroadaptive changes induced by cocaine, we observed diminished cocaine intake in a self-administration paradigm. Reduced behavioral effects of cocaine were not associated with decreased striatal DAT distribution and most likely not caused by the ~30% reduction in synaptosomal DA uptake observed in PICK1 KO mice. The PICK1 KO mice demonstrated preserved behavioral responses to DA receptor agonists supporting intact downstream DA receptor signaling. Unexpectedly, we found a prominent increase in striatal DA content and levels of striatal tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in PICK1 KO mice. Chronoamperometric recordings showed enhanced DA release in PICK1 KO mice, consistent with increased striatal DA pools. Viral-mediated knockdown of PICK1 in cultured dopaminergic neurons increased TH expression, supporting a direct cellular effect of PICK1. In summary, in addition to demonstrating a key role of PICK1 in mediating behavioral effects of cocaine, our data reveal a so far unappreciated role of PICK1 in DA homeostasis that possibly involves negative regulation of striatal TH levels.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Cocaine addiction is a major societal problem and better treatments are needed. We demonstrate here the importance of the PDZ-domain scaffold protein PICK1 for both the acute reinforcing effects of cocaine and the long-term behavioral changes seen on repeated cocaine exposure. Interestingly, our data suggest that these alterations are independent of PICK1 binding to the primary target of cocaine, DAT. Moreover, our study reveals a novel role of PICK1 in maintenance of DA homeostasis that involves negative regulation of the levels of striatal TH, the rate-limiting enzyme in DA synthesis. Summarized, these data provide an important framework for further exploring the role of PICK1 in addiction and as putative target for treatment of psychostimulant abuse.</p>

<p>One of the main challenges in Biophysics teaching consists on how to motivate
students to appreciate the beauty of theoretical formulations. This is crucial
when the system modeling requires numerical calculations to achieve realistic
results. In this sense, due to the massive use of software, students often
become a mere users of computational tools without capturing the essence of
formulation and further problem solution. It is, therefore, necessary for
instructors to find innovating ways, allowing students developing of their
ability to deal with mathematical modelling. To address this issue one can
highlight the use of Benford's law, thanks to its simple formulation, easy
computational implementation and wide possibility for applications. Indeed,
this law enables students to carry out their own data analysis with use of free
software packages. This law is among the several power or scaling laws found in
biological systems. However, to the best of our knowledge, this law has not
been contemplated in Cell Biophysics yet. Beyond its vast applications in many
fields, neuromuscular junction represents a remarkable substrate for learning
and teaching of complex system. Thus, in this work, we applied both classical
and a generalized form of Benford's Law, to examine if electrophysiological
data recorded from neuromuscular junction conforms the anomalous number law.
The results indicated that nerve-muscle communications conform the generalized
Benford's law better than the seminal formulation. From our
electrophysiological measurements a biological scenario is used to interpret
the theoretical analysis.

<p>Modularity plays an important role in brain networks' architecture and
influences its dynamics and the ability to integrate and segregate different
modules of cerebral regions. Alterations in community structure are associated
with several clinical disorders, specially schizophrenia, although its time
evolution is not clear yet. In the present work, we analyze fMRI functional
networks of $65$ healthy subjects (HC) and $44$ patients of schizophrenia (SZ),
$28$ of them in a chronic state (CR) of illness, and $16$ at early stage (ES).
We find clear differences in edges' weights distribution, networks density,
community structure consistency and robustness against edge removal. In
comparison to healthy subjects, we found that networks from SZ patients
exhibits wider weight distribution, larger overall connectivity, and are more
consistent in the community structure across subjects. We also showed that the
networks of SZ patients tend to be more robust to edge removal than healthy
subjects, while having lower network density. In the case of early stages
patients, we found that their networks exhibit topological features
consistently in between the ones obtained from the other two groups, resulting
in a tendency towards the chronic group state.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.04157">On the Classification of SSVEP-Based Dry-EEG Signals via Convolutional Neural Networks. (arXiv:1805.04157v1 [cs.HC])</a></h4>

<p>In this paper, we propose a novel Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) approach
for the classification of raw dry-EEG signals without any data pre-processing.
To illustrate the effectiveness of our approach, we utilise the Steady State
Visual Evoked Potential (SSVEP) paradigm as our use case. SSVEP can be utilised
to allow people with severe physical disabilities such as Complete Locked-In
Syndrome or Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis to be aided via BCI applications, as
it requires only the subject to fixate upon the sensory stimuli of interest.
Here we utilise SSVEP flicker frequencies between 10 to 30 Hz, which we record
as subject cortical waveforms via the dry-EEG headset. Our proposed end-to-end
CNN allows us to automatically and accurately classify SSVEP stimulation
directly from the dry-EEG waveforms. Our CNN architecture utilises a common
SSVEP Convolutional Unit (SCU), comprising of a 1D convolutional layer, batch
normalization and max pooling. Furthermore, we compare several deep learning
neural network variants with our primary CNN architecture, in addition to
traditional machine learning classification approaches. Experimental evaluation
shows our CNN architecture to be significantly better than competing
approaches, achieving a classification accuracy of 96% whilst demonstrating
superior cross-subject performance and even being able to generalise well to
unseen subjects whose data is entirely absent from the training process.

We investigated glucocorticoid, a major risk factor of Alzheimer disease, promoted microtubule instability that culminates in memory deficits. Mice group exposed to corticosteroid had reduced trafficking of AMPAR1/2 and mitochondria into the synapse due to microtubule destabilization, which finally impaired cognitive function. Furthermore, cortisol reduced microtubule stability through the mitochondria glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-dependent pathway in SH-SY5Y cells. Cortisol translocated the Hsp70-bound GR into mitochondria before stimulating ER-mitochondria interaction via increasing GR-Bcl-2 complex. Subsequently, amyloid beta was produced since gamma-secretase activity was upregulated by increased ER-mitochondria connectivity. Mitochondrial calcium influx was also elevated due to ER-mitochondria bridging, resulting in activation of mTOR pathway. Subsequent autophagy inhibition failed to remove amyloid beta and led to its accumulation. Moreover, selective autophagy through ubiquitination of SCG10 was suppressed. We eventually showed that both elevated amyloid beta, and SCG10 levels drive cells to fail trafficking AMPAR1/2 and mitochondria into the cell terminus. In conclusion, glucocorticoid regulates ER-mitochondria coupling, which evokes amyloid beta generation and SCG10 upregulation. Subsequent microtubule destabilization leads to memory impairment through failure of AMPAR1/2 or mitochondria transport into cell periphery.

Current techniques for monitoring GABA, the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in vertebrates, cannot follow ephemeral transients in intact neural circuits. We applied the design principles used to create iGluSnFR, a fluorescent reporter of synaptic glutamate, to develop a GABA sensor using a protein derived from a previously unsequenced Pseudomonas fluorescens strain. Structure-guided mutagenesis and library screening led to a usable iGABASnFR (maximum DeltaF/F ~ 2.5, Kd ~ 9 micromolar, good specificity, adequate kinetics). iGABASnFR is genetically encoded, detects single action potential-evoked GABA release events in culture, and produces readily detectable fluorescence increases in vivo in mice and zebrafish. iGABASnFR enabled tracking of: (1) mitochondrial GABA content and its modulation by an anticonvulsant; (2) swimming-evoked GABAergic transmission in zebrafish cerebellum; (3) GABA release events during inter-ictal spikes and seizures in awake mice; and (4) GABAergic tone decreases during isoflurane anesthesia. iGABASnFR will permit high spatiotemporal resolution of GABA signaling in intact preparations.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/322438v1?rss=1">Two-dimensional local Fourier image reconstruction via domain decomposition Fourier continuation method</a></h4>

The MRI image is obtained in the spatial domain from the given Fourier coefficients in the frequency domain. It is costly to obtain the high resolution image because it requires higher frequency Fourier data while the lower frequency Fourier data is less costly and effective if the image is smooth. However, the Gibbs ringing, if existent, prevails with the lower frequency Fourier data. We propose an efficient and accurate local reconstruction method with the lower frequency Fourier data that yields sharp image profile near the local edge. The proposed method utilizes only the small number of image data in the local area. Thus the method is efficient. Furthermore the method is accurate because it minimizes the global effects on the reconstruction near the weak edges shown in many other global methods for which all the image data is used for the reconstruction. To utilize the Fourier method locally based on the local non-periodic data, the proposed method is based on the Fourier continuation method. This work is an extension of our previous 1D Fourier domain decomposition method to 2D Fourier data. The proposed method first divides the MRI image in the spatial domain into many subdomains and applies the Fourier continuation method for the smooth periodic extension of the subdomain of interest. Then the proposed method reconstructs the local image based on $L_2$ minimization regularized by the $L_1$ norm of edge sparsity to sharpen the image near edges. Our numerical results suggest that the proposed method should be utilized in dimension-by-dimension manner instead of in a global manner for both the quality of the reconstruction and computational efficiency. The numerical results show that the proposed method is effective when the local reconstruction is sought and that the solution is free of Gibbs oscillations.

Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is one of the most common and disabling psychiatric disorders, but its neural pathophysiology remains largely unknown. Functional brain network studies in MDD have suffered from limited statistical power and high flexibility in data analyses. Here we launched the REST-meta-MDD Project of resting-state fMRI (R-fMRI) data of 1,300 patients with MDD and 1,128 normal controls (NCs) from 25 research groups in China. The data were preprocessed with a standardized protocol across all sites prior to aggregated group analyses. Our analyses focused on functional connectivity (FC) within the default mode network (DMN) which has been frequently reported to show increased FC in MDD. However, we found decreased instead of increased DMN FC in MDD compared to NCs. Specifically, this FC reduction only presented in recurrent MDD but not in first-episode drug naive MDD. Patients with recurrent MDD even demonstrated decreases of DMN FC when directly compared with the first-episode drug naive MDD. Decreased DMN FC was associated with medication usage in MDD but not illness duration or severity. Finally, exploratory analyses revealed alterations of local intrinsic activity in the MDD samples. The pooled R-fMRI metrics of the REST-meta-MDD Project provide an unprecedented opportunity to investigate the key neural underpinnings of MDD and call for longitudinal brain imaging studies to understand the effects of medications, illness duration and severity.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/321703v1?rss=1">The capacity for correlated semantic memories in the cortex</a></h4>

We analyze an autoassociative network of Potts units, coupled via tensor connections, as an effective model of extended cortical networks with distinct short and long-range synaptic connections. To study semantic memory, organized in terms of the relations between the attributes of real-world knowledge, we formulate a generative model of item representation with correlations. The model ascribes such correlations to the influence of underlying "factors": items with more shared factors have more correlated representations. Moreover, if many factors are balanced, correlations are overall low; whereas if a few factors dominate (increasing a dominance parameter {zeta}), they become strong. Our model allows for correlations that are neither trivial (random) nor merely hierarchical (an ultrametric tree). The network can retrieve one from up to p [~=] CS^2/a weakly correlated items, of order 10,000,000 with human cortical parameters. When its storage capacity is exceeded, however, retrieval fails completely only for low {zeta}; above a critical dominance value, a phase transition leads to a regime where the network still extracts considerable information about the cued item, even if not recovering its detailed representation: possibly a model of semantic memory resilience in remember/know paradigms.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/321687v1?rss=1">Characteristics of the mitochondrial and cellular uptake of MPP+, as probed by the fluorescent mimic, 4\'I-MPP+</a></h4>

The discovery that 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) selectively destroys dopaminergic neurons and causes Parkinson's disease (PD) symptoms in mammals has strengthened the environmental hypothesis of PD. The current model for the dopaminergic toxicity of MPP+ is centered on the uptake into dopaminergic neurons, accumulation into the mitochondria, inhibition of the complex-I leading to ATP depletion, increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and apoptotic cell death. However, some aspects of this mechanism and the details of the cellular and mitochondrial accumulation of MPP+ are still poorly understood. The aim of this study was to characterize a structural and functional MPP+ mimic which is suitable to study the cellular distribution and mitochondrial uptake of MPP+ in live cells and use it to identify the molecular details of these processes to advance the understanding of the mechanism of the selective dopaminergic toxicity of MPP+. Here we report the characterization of the fluorescent MPP+ derivative, 1-methyl-4-(4'-iodophenyl)pyridinium (4'I-MPP+), as a suitable candidate for this purpose. Using this novel probe, we show that cytosolic/mitochondrial Ca2+ play a critical role through sodium-calcium exchanger (NCX) in the mitochondrial and cellular accumulation of MPP+ suggesting for the first time that MPP+ and related mitochondrial toxins may also exert their toxic effects through the perturbation of Ca2+ homeostasis in dopaminergic cells. We also found that the specific mitochondrial NCX (mNCX) inhibitors protect dopaminergic cells from the MPP+ and 4'I-MPP+ toxicity, most likely through the inhibition of the mitochondrial uptake, which could potentially be exploited for the development of pharmacological agents to protect the central nervous system (CNS) dopaminergic neurons from PD-causing environmental toxins.

Background: Depression affects approximately 25% of people with MS (pwMS) at any given time. It is however under recognised in clinical practice, in part due to a lack of uptake for brief assessment tools and uncertainty about their psychometric properties. The 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) is an attractive candidate for this role. Objective: To synthesise published findings on the psychometric properties of the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) when applied to people with multiple sclerosis (pwMS). Data sources: PubMed, Medline and ISI Web of Science databases, supplemented by hand-searching of references from all eligible sources. Study eligibility criteria: Primary literature written in English and published following peer-review with a primary aim to evaluate the performance of the PHQ-9 in pwMS. Outcome measures: Psychometric performance with respect to appropriateness, reliability, validity, responsiveness, precision, interpretability, acceptability, and feasibility. Results: Seven relevant studies were identified, these were of high quality and included 5080 participants from all MS disease-course groups. Strong evidence was found supporting the validity of the PHQ-9 as a unidimensional measure of depression. Used as a screening tool for major depressive disorder (MDD) with a cut-point of 11, sensitivity was 95% sensitivity and specificity 88.3% (PPV 51.4%, NPV 48.6%). Alternative scoring systems that may address the issue of overlap between somatic features of depression and features of MS per se are being developed, although their utility remains unclear. However data on reliability was limited, and no specific evidence was available on test-retest reliability, responsiveness, acceptability, or feasibility. Conclusions: The PHQ-9 represents a suitable tool to screen for MDD in pwMS. However use as a diagnostic tool cannot currently be recommended, and the potential value for monitoring depressive symptoms cannot be established without further evidence on test-retest reliability, responsiveness, acceptability, and feasibility.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/321646v1?rss=1">Dopamine D1 receptor availability is not associated with delusional ideation measures of psychosis proneness</a></h4>

The dopamine D1 receptor (D1R) is thought to play a role in psychosis and schizophrenia, however the exact nature of this involvement is not clear. Positron emission tomography studies comparing D1R between patients and control subjects have produced inconsistent results. An important confounding factor in most clinical studies is previous exposure to antipsychotic treatment, which is thought to influence the density of D1R. To circumvent some of the limitations of clinical studies, an alternative approach for studying the relationship between D1R and psychosis is to examine individuals at increased risk for psychotic disorders, or variation in subclinical psychotic symptoms such as delusional ideation within the general population, referred to as psychosis proneness traits. In this study, we investigated whether D1R availability is associated with delusional ideation in healthy controls using data from 76 individuals measured with PET using [11C]SCH23390 and 217 individuals who completed delusional ideation questionnaires, belonging to three different study cohorts. We first performed exploratory, hypothesis-generating, analyses by creating and evaluating a new measure of delusional ideation (n=132 and n=27), which was then found to show a negative association with D1R availability (n=24). Next, we performed confirmatory analyses using Bayesian statistical modelling, in which we first attempted to replicate this result (n=20), and then evaluated the association of Peters Delusion Inventory scores with D1R availability in two independent cohorts (n=41 and 20). Collectively, we found strong evidence that there is little to no linear association between delusional ideation and D1R availability in healthy controls. If differences in D1R can be confirmed in drug-naive schizophrenia patients compared to controls, further studies are needed to ascertain whether these changes occur at the onset of psychotic symptoms or if they are associated with specific behavioural or genetic aspects of psychosis proneness other than delusional ideation.

Spinal motor axons traverse large distances to innervate target muscle, and thus require local control of cellular events for proper functioning of the distal axon. To interrogate axon-specific processes we developed Axon-seq, a refined method incorporating microfluidic devices and stringent bioinformatic quality controls. Axon-seq demonstrates improved sensitivity and accuracy in whole-transcriptome sequencing of axons compared to previously published studies. Importantly, we show that axon transcriptomes are distinct from those of somas, displaying fewer detected genes and no contaminating astrocytic markers. We identified &gt;5,000 transcripts in stem cell-derived spinal motor axons required for local oxidative energy production and ribosome generation. Axons contained unique transcription factor mRNAs, e.g. Ybx1, with implications for local axonal functions. Cross-comparison with peripheral sensory neuron datasets identified a common axon transcriptome consisting of 1,750 mRNAs, as well as 396 mRNAs unique to motor axons, which included genes for ribogenesis, vesicle transport and mRNA splicing. As motor axons degenerate in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), we investigated their response to the disease-causing SOD1G93A mutation, identifying 121 ALS-dysregulated transcripts. Several of these are implicated in axonal and dendritic outgrowth, including Nrp1, Dbn1, and Nek1, a known ALS-causing gene. In conclusion, Axon-seq proves a robust and improved method for RNA-seq of axons, furthers our understanding of peripheral axon biology, and identifies novel therapeutic targets to maintain neural connectivity in disease.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/321562v1?rss=1">Burst Synchronization in A Scale-Free Neuronal Network with Inhibitory Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity</a></h4>

We consider the Barabasi-Albert scale-free network (SFN) composed of inhibitory bursting Hindmarsh-Rose neurons. This inhibitory neuronal population has adaptive dynamic synaptic strengths governed by the inhibitory spike-timing-dependent plasticity (iSTDP). In previous works without iSTDP, burst synchronization (BS) was found to appear in a range of noise intensities for fixed synaptic inhibition strengths. Here, we investigate the effect of iSTDP on BS by varying the noise intensity. We employ an anti-Hebbian time window for the iSTDP update rule, in contrast to the Hebbian time window for the excitatory STDP. A Matthew effect in inhibitory synaptic plasticity is thus found to occur; good BS (with higher bursting measure) gets better via long-term depression (LTD), while bad BS (with lower bursting measure) gets worse via long-term potentiation (LTP). This kind of Matthew effect is in contrast to that in excitatory synaptic plasticity where good (bad) synchronization gets better (worse) via LTP (LTD). Furthermore, emergences of LTD and LTP of synaptic inhibition strengths are intensively investigated via a microscopic method based on the distributions of time delays between the pre- and the post-synaptic burst onset times. Finally, in the presence of iSTDP we investigate the effects of network architecture on BS by varying the symmetric attachment degree l* and the asymmetry parameter{Delta} l in the SFN, and Matthew effects in inhibitory synaptic plasticity are also found to occur by varying l* and{Delta} l.

We consider the Watts-Strogatz small-world network (SWN) consisting of inhibitory fast spiking Izhikevich interneurons. This inhibitory neuronal population has adaptive dynamic synaptic strengths governed by the inhibitory spike-timing-dependent plasticity (iSTDP). In previous works without iSTDP, fast sparsely synchronized rhythms, associated with diverse cognitive functions, were found to appear in a range of large noise intensities for fixed strong synaptic inhibition strengths. Here, we investigate the effect of iSTDP on fast sparse synchronization (FSS) by varying the noise intensity D. We employ an asymmetric anti-Hebbian time window for the iSTDP update rule [which is in contrast to the Hebbian time window for the excitatory STDP (eSTDP)]. Depending on values of D, population-averaged values of saturated synaptic inhibition strengths are potentiated [long-term potentiation (LTP)] or depressed [long-term depression (LTD)] in comparison with the initial mean value, and dispersions from the mean values of LTP/LTD are much increased when compared with the initial dispersion, independently of D. In most cases of LTD where the effect of mean LTD is dominant in comparison with the effect of dispersion, good synchronization (with higher spiking measure) is found to get better via LTD, while bad synchronization (with lower spiking measure) is found to get worse via LTP. This kind of Matthew effect in inhibitory synaptic plasticity is in contrast to that in excitatory synaptic plasticity where good (bad) synchronization gets better (worse) via LTP (LTD). Emergences of LTD and LTP of synaptic inhibition strengths are intensively investigated via a microscopic method based on the distributions of time delays between the pre- and the post-synaptic spike times. Furthermore, we also investigate the effects of network architecture on FSS by changing the rewiring probability p of the SWN in the presence of iSTDP.

Recurrent excitatory synapses are shown theoretically to play roles in memory storage and associative learning, and such recurrent synapses are well described to occur in the CA3 region of the hippocampus. Here, we report that the CA2 region also contains recurrent excitatory monosynaptic couplings. Using dual whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from CA2 pyramidal cells in mouse hippocampal slices under differential interference contrast microscopic controls, we evaluated monosynaptic excitatory connections. Unitary excitatory postsynaptic potentials occurred in 1.4% of 502 cell pairs. These connected pairs were located preferentially in the superficial layer and proximal part (CA2b) of the CA2 region. These results indicate that recurrent excitatory circuits are dense in the CA2 region as well as in the CA3 region.

While the exact role of {beta}1 subunit-containing GABA-A receptors (GABARs) in brain function is not well understood, altered expression of the {beta}1 subunit gene (GABRB1) is associated with neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders. In particular, down-regulation of {beta}1 subunit levels is observed in brains of patients with epilepsy, autism, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. A pathophysiological feature of these disease states is imbalance in energy metabolism and mitochondrial dysfunction. The transcription factor, nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF-1), has been shown to be a key mediator of genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial biogenesis. Using a variety of molecular approaches (including mobility shift, promoter/reporter assays, and overexpression of dominant negative NRF-1), we now report that NRF-1 regulates transcription of GABRB1 and that its core promoter contains a conserved canonical NRF-1 element responsible for sequence specific binding and transcriptional activation. Our identification of GABRB1 as a new target for NRF-1 in neurons suggests that genes coding for inhibitory neurotransmission may be coupled to cellular metabolism. This is especially meaningful as binding of NRF-1 to its element is sensitive to the kind of epigenetic changes that occur in multiple disorders associated with altered brain inhibition.

The prefrontal cortex (PFC) plays an important role in regulating social functions in mammals, and impairments in this region have been linked with social dysfunction in psychiatric disorders. Yet little is known of how the PFC encodes social information and of how social representations may be altered in such disorders. Here, we show that neurons in the medial PFC (mPFC) of freely behaving mice preferentially respond to socially-relevant sensory cues. Population activity patterns in the mPFC differed considerably between social and nonsocial stimuli and underwent experience-dependent refinement. In Cntnap2 knockout mice, a genetic model of autism, both the categorization of sensory stimuli and the refinement of social representations were impaired. Noise levels in spontaneous population activity were higher in Cntnap2 mice, and correlated strongly with the degree to which social representations were disrupted. Our findings elucidate the encoding of social sensory cues in the mPFC, and provide an important link between altered prefrontal dynamics and autism-associated social dysfunction.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/321166v1?rss=1">Self-regulation of the Dopaminergic Reward Circuit in Cocaine Users with Mental Imagery and Neurofeedback</a></h4>

Background: Enhanced drug-related reward sensitivity accompanied by impaired sensitivity to non-drug related rewards in the mesolimbic dopamine system are thought to underlie the broad motivational deficits and dysfunctional decision-making frequently observed in cocaine use disorder (CUD). Effective approaches to modify this imbalance and reinstate non-drug reward responsiveness are urgently needed. Here we examine whether cocaine users (CU) can use mental imagery of non-drug rewards to self-regulate the ventral tegmental area and substantia nigra (VTA/SN). We expected that compulsive and obsessive thoughts about cocaine consumption would hamper the ability to self-regulate the VTA/SN. Finally, we tested if self-regulation of the VTA/SN can be improved with real-time fMRI (rtfMRI) neurofeedback (NFB). Methods: Twenty-two CU and 28 healthy controls (HC) were asked to voluntarily up-regulate VTA/SN activity with rewarding non-drug imagery alone, or combined with rtfMRI NFB of VTA/SN activity. Obsessive-compulsive drug use was measured with the Obsessive Compulsive Cocaine Use Scale (OCCUS). Results: CU were able to induce activity in the dopaminergic midbrain and other reward regions with reward imagery. The ability to self-regulate the VTA/SN was reduced in those with more severe obsessive-compulsive drug use. NFB enhanced the effect of non-drug imagery. Conclusion: CU can voluntary activate their reward system through non-drug related imagery and improve this ability with rtfMRI NFB. Combining reward imagery and rtFMRI NFB has great potential for modifying the maladapted reward sensitivity and reinstating non-drug reward responsiveness. This motivates further work to examine the therapeutic potential of cognitive neurostimulation in CUD.

Unraveling how neural networks process and represent sensory information and how this cellular dynamics instructs behavioral output is a main goal in current neuroscience. Two-photon activation of optogenetic actuators and fluorescence calcium (Ca2+) imaging with genetically encoded Ca2+ indicators allow, respectively, the all-optical stimulation and read-out of activity from genetically identified cell populations. However, these techniques expose the brain to high near-infrared light doses raising the concern of light-induced adverse effects on the biological phenomena being studied. Combing Ca2+ imaging of GCaMP6f-expressing cortical astrocytes as a sensitive readout for photodamage and an unbiased machine-based event detection, we demonstrate the subtle build-up of aberrant microdomain Ca2+ signals in fine astroglial processes. Illumination conditions routinely being used in biological two-photon microscopy (920-nm excitation, 100-fs regime, ten mW average power) increased the frequency of microdomain Ca2+ events, but left their amplitude, area and duration rather unchanged. This increase in local Ca2+ activity was followed by Ca2+ transients in the otherwise silent soma. Ca2+ hyperactivity occurred without overt morphological damage. Surprisingly, at the same average power, continuous-wave 920-nm illumination was as damaging as fs pulses, indicating a linear, heating-mediated (rather than a highly non-linear) damage mechanism. In an astrocyte-specific IP3-receptor knock-out mouse (IP3R2-KO), Near-infrared light-induced Ca2+ microdomains signals persisted in the small processes, underpinning their resemblance to physiological IP3R2-independent Ca2+ signals, while somatic activity was abolished. Contrary to what has generally been believed in the field, shorter pulses and lower average power are advantageous to alleviate photodamage and allow for longer useful recording windows.

Accumulating evidence indicates that astrocytes are actively involved in the physiological and pathophysiological functions of the brain. Intracellular Ca2+ signaling, especially Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), is considered to be crucial for the regulation of astrocytic functions. Mice with genetic deletion of IP3R type 2 (IP3R2) are reportedly devoid of astrocytic Ca2+ signaling, and thus widely used to explore the roles of Ca2+ signaling in astrocytic functions. While functional deficits in IP3R2-knockout (KO) mice have been found in some reports, no functional deficit was observed in others. Thus, there remains a controversy regarding the functional significance of astrocytic Ca2+ signaling. To address this controversy, we re-evaluated the assumption that Ca2+ release from the ER is abolished in IP3R2-KO astrocytes using a highly sensitive imaging technique. We expressed the ER luminal Ca2+ indicator G-CEPIA1er in cortical and hippocampal astrocytes to directly visualize spontaneous and stimulus-induced Ca2+ release from the ER. We found attenuated but significant Ca2+ release in response to application of norepinephrine to IP3R2-KO astrocytes. This IP3R2-independent Ca2+ release induced only minimal cytosolic Ca2+ transients but induced significant Ca2+ increases in mitochondria that are frequently in close contact with the ER. These results indicate that ER Ca2+ release is retained and is sufficient to increase the Ca2+ concentration in close proximity to the ER in IP3R2-KO astrocytes.

Neuroscientific data analysis has classically involved methods for statistical signal and image processing, drawing on linear algebra and stochastic process theory. However, digitized neuroanatomical data sets containing labelled neurons, either individually or in groups labelled by tracer injections, do not fully fit into this classical framework. The tree-like shapes of neurons cannot mathematically be adequately described as points in a vector space (eg, the subtraction of two neuronal shapes is not a meaningful operation). There is therefore a need for new approaches. Methods from computational topology and geometry are naturally suited to the analysis of neuronal shapes. Here we introduce methods from Discrete Morse Theory to extract tree-skeletons of individual neurons from volumetric brain image data, or to summarize collections of neurons labelled by localized anterograde tracer injections. Since individual neurons are topologically trees, it is sensible to summarize the collection of neurons labelled by a localized anterograde tracer injection using a consensus tree-shape. This consensus tree provides a richer information summary than the regional or voxel-based "connectivity matrix" approach that has previously been used in the literature. The algorithmic procedure includes an initial pre-processing step to extract a density field from the raw volumetric image data, followed by initial skeleton extraction from the density field using a discrete version of a 1-(un)stable manifold of the density field. Heuristically, if the density field is regarded as a mountainous landscape, then the 1-(un)stable manifold follows the "mountain ridges" connecting the maxima of the density field. We then simplify this skeleton-graph into a tree using a shortest-path approach and methods derived from persistent homology. The advantage of this approach is that it uses global information about the density field and is therefore robust to local fluctuations and non-uniformly distributed input signals. To be able to handle large data sets, we use a divide-and-conquer approach. The resulting software DiMorSC is available on Github. To the best of our knowledge this is currently the only publicly available code for the extraction of the 1-unstable manifold from an arbitrary simplicial complex using the Discrete Morse approach.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/321232v1?rss=1">Population coding of valence in the basolateral amygdala</a></h4>

The basolateral amygdala (BLA) plays an important role in associative learning, by representing both conditioned stimuli (CSs) and unconditioned stimuli (USs) of positive and negative valences, and by forming associations between CSs and USs. However, how such associations are formed and updated during learning remains unclear. Here we show that associative learning driven by reward and punishment profoundly alters BLA neuronal responses at population levels, reducing noise correlations and transforming the representations of CSs to resemble the distinctive valence-specific representations of USs. This transformation is accompanied by the emergence of prevalent inhibitory CS and US responses, and by the plasticity of CS responses in individual BLA neurons. During reversal learning wherein the expected valences are reversed, BLA population CS representations are remapped onto ensembles representing the opposite valences and track the switching in valence specific behavioral actions. Our results reveal how signals predictive of opposing valences in the BLA evolve during reward and punishment learning, and how these signals might be updated and used to guide flexible behaviors.

Abstract<p>The brainstem pre-Bötzinger complex (preBötC) generates inspiratory breathing rhythms, but which neurons comprise its rhythmogenic core? Dbx1-derived neurons may play the preeminent role in rhythm generation, an idea well founded at perinatal stages of development but incompletely evaluated in adulthood. We expressed archaerhodopsin or channelrhodopsin in Dbx1 preBötC neurons in intact adult mice to interrogate their function. Prolonged photoinhibition slowed down or stopped breathing, whereas prolonged photostimulation sped up breathing. Brief inspiratory-phase photoinhibition evoked the next breath earlier than expected, whereas brief expiratory-phase photoinhibition delayed the subsequent breath. Conversely, brief inspiratory-phase photostimulation increased inspiratory duration and delayed the subsequent breath, whereas brief expiratory-phase photostimulation evoked the next breath earlier than expected. Because they govern the frequency and precise timing of breaths in awake adult mice with sensorimotor feedback intact, Dbx1 preBötC neurons constitute an essential core component of the inspiratory oscillator, knowledge directly relevant to human health and physiology.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Breathing behavior depends on rhythmic movements. The underlying neural rhythm for inspiration may originate due to brainstem interneurons defined genetically by expression of the embryonic transcription factor Dbx1. Dbx1-derived neurons comprise the core oscillator microcircuit in perinatal mice, but they serve other functions too, and their inspiratory rhythmogenic role has not been conclusively tested in adults. Optogenetic photostimulation and photoinhibition of Dbx1-derived brainstem neurons in intact adult mice modulated breathing, either speeding it up, slowing it down to the point of apnea (no breathing), or perturbing its phase, which are functions consistent with the rhythm generator. These results establish the cellular point of origin for breathing rhythm, a key physiologic brain function in humans and all mammals.</p>

<p><b>Significance Statement</b> Inverted encoding models (IEMs) are a powerful tool for reconstructing population-level stimulus representations from aggregate measurements of neural activity (e.g., fMRI or EEG). In a recent report, Liu et al., (2018) tested whether IEMs can provide information about the underlying tuning of <i>single units</i>. Here, we argue that using stimulus reconstructions to infer properties of single neurons, such as neural tuning bandwidth, is an ill-posed problem with no unambiguous solution. Instead of interpreting results from these methods as evidence about single-unit tuning, we emphasize the utility of these methods for assaying <i>population-level</i> stimulus representations. These can be compared across task conditions to better constrain theories of large-scale neural information processing across experimental manipulations, such as changing sensory input or attention.</p>

<p>Symbolic methods of analysis are valuable tools for investigating complex
time-dependent signals. In particular, the ordinal method defines sequences of
symbols according to the ordering in which values appear in a time series. This
method has been shown to yield useful information, even when applied to signals
with large noise contamination. Here we use ordinal analysis to investigate the
transition between eyes closed (EC) and eyes open (EO) resting states. We
analyze two {EEG} datasets (with 71 and 109 healthy subjects) with different
recording conditions (sampling rates and the number of electrodes in the
scalp). Using as diagnostic tools the permutation entropy, the entropy computed
from symbolic transition probabilities, and an asymmetry coefficient (that
measures the asymmetry of the likelihood of the transitions between symbols) we
show that ordinal analysis applied to the raw data distinguishes the two brain
states. In both datasets, we find that the EO state is characterized by higher
entropies and lower asymmetry coefficient, as compared to the EC state. Our
results thus show that these diagnostic tools have the potential for detecting
and characterizing changes in time-evolving brain states.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.03886">Effect of dilution in asymmetric recurrent neural networks. (arXiv:1805.03886v1 [cond-mat.dis-nn])</a></h4>

<p>We study with numerical simulation the possible limit behaviors of
synchronous discrete-time deterministic recurrent neural networks composed of N
binary neurons as a function of a network's level of dilution and asymmetry.
The network dilution measures the fraction of neuron couples that are
connected, and the network asymmetry measures to what extent the underlying
connectivity matrix is asymmetric. For each given neural network, we study the
dynamical evolution of all the different initial conditions, thus
characterizing the full dynamical landscape without imposing any learning rule.
Because of the deterministic dynamics, each trajectory converges to an
attractor, that can be either a fixed point or a limit cycle. These attractors
form the set of all the possible limit behaviors of the neural network. For
each network, we then determine the convergence times, the limit cycles'
length, the number of attractors, and the sizes of the attractors' basin. We
show that there are two network structures that maximize the number of possible
limit behaviors. The first optimal network structure is fully-connected and
symmetric. On the contrary, the second optimal network structure is highly
sparse and asymmetric. The latter optimal is similar to what observed in
different biological neuronal circuits. These observations lead us to
hypothesize that independently from any given learning model, an efficient and
effective biologic network that stores a number of limit behaviors close to its
maximum capacity tends to develop a connectivity structure similar to one of
the optimal networks we found.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.03792">Impact of axonal delay on structure development in a Linsker type network. (arXiv:1805.03792v1 [q-bio.NC])</a></h4>

<p>In his seminal, three paper series, Linsker provided a mechanism for how
random activity in the visual pathway could give rise to many of the features
observed experimentally in the early stages of visual processing. Owing to the
complexity of multilayer models, an implicit assumption in Linsker's and
subsequent papers has been that propagation delay is homogeneous and,
consequently, plays little functional role in neural behaviour. In this paper,
we relax this assumption to examine the impact of axonal distance dependent
propagation delay on neural learning. We show that propagation delay induces
lowpass filtering by dispersing the arrival times of spikes from presynaptic
neurons, providing a natural correlation cancellation mechanism for distal
connections. The cutoff frequency decreases as the radial propagation delay
within a layer, relative to propagation delay between the layers, increases,
introducing an upper limit on temporal resolution. Given that the postsynaptic
potential also acts as a lowpass filter, we show that the effective time
constant of each should enable the processing of similar scales of temporal
information. This result has implications for the visual system, in which
receptive field size and, thus, radial propagation delay, increases with
eccentricity. Furthermore, the network response is frequency dependent since
higher frequencies require increased input amplitude to compensate for
attenuation. This concords with frequency dependent contrast sensitivity in the
visual system, which changes with eccentricity and receptive field size.
Finally, we determine the eigenfunctions of both Linsker's network, and the
network with propagation delay. We show that the addition of propagation delay
stabilizes the leading eigenfunction to changes in homeostatic parameters, and
hence stabilizes the resulting receptive field structure.

<p>Previous work by Linsker revealed how simple cells can emerge in the absence
of structured environmental input, via a selforganisation learning process. He
empirically showed the development of spatial-opponent cells driven only by
input noise, emerging as a result of structure in the initial synaptic
connectivity distribution. To date, a complete set of radial eigenfunctions
have not been provided for this multi-layer network. In this paper, the
complete set of eigenfunctions and eigenvalues for a three-layered network is
for the first time analytically derived. Initially a simplified learning
equation is considered for which the homeostatic parameters are set to zero. To
extend the eigenfunction analysis to the full learning equation, including
non-zero homeostatic parameters, a perturbation analysis is used.

<p>by Thanos Manos, Magteld Zeitler, Peter A. Tass</p>

Several brain diseases are characterized by abnormally strong neuronal synchrony. Coordinated Reset (CR) stimulation was computationally designed to specifically counteract abnormal neuronal synchronization processes by desynchronization. In the presence of spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) this may lead to a decrease of synaptic excitatory weights and ultimately to an anti-kindling, i.e. unlearning of abnormal synaptic connectivity and abnormal neuronal synchrony. The long-lasting desynchronizing impact of CR stimulation has been verified in pre-clinical and clinical proof of concept studies. However, as yet it is unclear how to optimally choose the CR stimulation frequency, i.e. the repetition rate at which the CR stimuli are delivered. This work presents the first computational study on the dependence of the acute and long-term outcome on the CR stimulation frequency in neuronal networks with STDP. For this purpose, CR stimulation was applied with Rapidly Varying Sequences (RVS) as well as with Slowly Varying Sequences (SVS) in a wide range of stimulation frequencies and intensities. Our findings demonstrate that acute desynchronization, achieved during stimulation, does not necessarily lead to long-term desynchronization after cessation of stimulation. By comparing the long-term effects of the two different CR protocols, the RVS CR stimulation turned out to be more robust against variations of the stimulation frequency. However, SVS CR stimulation can obtain stronger anti-kindling effects. We revealed specific parameter ranges that are favorable for long-term desynchronization. For instance, RVS CR stimulation at weak intensities and with stimulation frequencies in the range of the neuronal firing rates turned out to be effective and robust, in particular, if no closed loop adaptation of stimulation parameters is (technically) available. From a clinical standpoint, this may be relevant in the context of both invasive as well as non-invasive CR stimulation.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/rx9Yjw7JXhk" width="1" />

To cooperatively carry large food items to the nest, individual ants conform their efforts and coordinate their motion. Throughout this expedition, collective motion is driven both by internal interactions between the carrying ants and a response to newly arrived informed ants that orient the cargo towards the nest. During the transport process, the carrying group must overcome obstacles that block their path to the nest. Here, we investigate the dynamics of cooperative transport, when the motion of the ants is frustrated by a linear obstacle that obstructs the motion of the cargo. The obstacle contains a narrow opening that serves as the only available passage to the nest, and through which single ants can pass but not with the cargo. We provide an analytical model for the ant-cargo system in the constrained environment that predicts a bi-stable dynamic behavior between an oscillatory mode of motion along the obstacle and a convergent mode of motion near the opening. Using both experiments and simulations, we show how for small cargo sizes, the system exhibits spontaneous transitions between these two modes of motion due to fluctuations in the applied force on the cargo. The bi-stability provides two possible problem solving strategies for overcoming the obstacle, either by attempting to pass through the opening, or take large excursions to circumvent the obstacle.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/jPqnVrYLq7g" width="1" />

<p>by Tim van Mourik, Lukas Snoek, Tomas Knapen, David G. Norris</p>

The field of neuroimaging is rapidly adopting a more reproducible approach to data acquisition and analysis. Data structures and formats are being standardised and data analyses are getting more automated. However, as data analysis becomes more complicated, researchers often have to write longer analysis scripts, spanning different tools across multiple programming languages. This makes it more difficult to share or recreate code, reducing the reproducibility of the analysis. We present a tool, Porcupine, that constructs one’s analysis visually and automatically produces analysis code. The graphical representation improves understanding of the performed analysis, while retaining the flexibility of modifying the produced code manually to custom needs. Not only does Porcupine produce the analysis code, it also creates a shareable environment for running the code in the form of a Docker image. Together, this forms a reproducible way of constructing, visualising and sharing one’s analysis. Currently, Porcupine links to Nipype functionalities, which in turn accesses most standard neuroimaging analysis tools. Our goal is to release researchers from the constraints of specific implementation details, thereby freeing them to think about novel and creative ways to solve a given problem. Porcupine improves the overview researchers have of their processing pipelines, and facilitates both the development and communication of their work. This will reduce the threshold at which less expert users can generate reusable pipelines. With Porcupine, we bridge the gap between a conceptual and an implementational level of analysis and make it easier for researchers to create reproducible and shareable science. We provide a wide range of examples and documentation, as well as installer files for all platforms on our website: https://timvanmourik.github.io/Porcupine. Porcupine is free, open source, and released under the GNU General Public License v3.0.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/OPful2fUMb8" width="1" />

Retina is a paradigmatic system for studying sensory encoding: the transformation of light into spiking activity of ganglion cells. The inverse problem, where stimulus is reconstructed from spikes, has received less attention, especially for complex stimuli that should be reconstructed “pixel-by-pixel”. We recorded around a hundred neurons from a dense patch in a rat retina and decoded movies of multiple small randomly-moving discs. We constructed nonlinear (kernelized and neural network) decoders that improved significantly over linear results. An important contribution to this was the ability of nonlinear decoders to reliably separate between neural responses driven by locally fluctuating light signals, and responses at locally constant light driven by spontaneous-like activity. This improvement crucially depended on the precise, non-Poisson temporal structure of individual spike trains, which originated in the spike-history dependence of neural responses. We propose a general principle by which downstream circuitry could discriminate between spontaneous and stimulus-driven activity based solely on higher-order statistical structure in the incoming spike trains.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0tROk9h9FSA" width="1" />

BK virus (BKV) associated nephropathy affects 1–10% of kidney transplant recipients, leading to graft failure in about 50% of cases. Immune responses against different BKV antigens have been shown to have a prognostic value for disease development. Data currently suggest that the structural antigens and regulatory antigens of BKV might each trigger a different mode of action of the immune response. To study the influence of different modes of action of the cellular immune response on BKV clearance dynamics, we have analysed the kinetics of BKV plasma load and anti-BKV T cell response (Elispot) in six patients with BKV associated nephropathy using ODE modelling. The results show that only a small number of hypotheses on the mode of action are compatible with the empirical data. The hypothesis with the highest empirical support is that structural antigens trigger blocking of virus production from infected cells, whereas regulatory antigens trigger an acceleration of death of infected cells. These differential modes of action could be important for our understanding of BKV resolution, as according to the hypothesis, only regulatory antigens would trigger a fast and continuous clearance of the viral load. Other hypotheses showed a lower degree of empirical support, but could potentially explain the clearing mechanisms of individual patients. Our results highlight the heterogeneity of the dynamics, including the delay between immune response against structural versus regulatory antigens, and its relevance for BKV clearance. Our modelling approach is the first that studies the process of BKV clearance by bringing together viral and immune kinetics and can provide a framework for personalised hypotheses generation on the interrelations between cellular immunity and viral dynamics.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/8poCgXZvMAQ" width="1" />

<p>The robustness of the visual system lies in its ability to perceive degraded images. This is achieved through interacting bottom-up, recurrent, and top-down pathways that process the visual input in concordance with stored prior information. The interaction mechanism by which they integrate visual input and prior information is still enigmatic. We present a new approach using deep neural network (DNN) representation to reveal the effects of such integration on degraded visual inputs. We transformed measured human brain activity resulting from viewing blurred images to the hierarchical representation space derived from a feedforward DNN. Transformed representations were found to veer toward the original nonblurred image and away from the blurred stimulus image. This indicated deblurring or sharpening in the neural representation, and possibly in our perception. We anticipate these results will help unravel the interplay mechanism between bottom-up, recurrent, and top-down pathways, leading to more comprehensive models of vision.</p>

Abstract
<p>Intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) innervate the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), a circadian oscillator that functions as a biological clock. ipRGCs use vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (vGlut2) to package glutamate into synaptic vesicles and light-evoked resetting of the SCN circadian clock is widely attributed to ipRGC glutamatergic neurotransmission. Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) is also packaged into vesicles in ipRGCs and PACAP may be coreleased with glutamate in the SCN. vGlut2 has been conditionally deleted in ipRGCs in mice [conditional knock-outs (cKOs)] and their aberrant photoentrainment and residual attenuated light responses have been ascribed to ipRGC PACAP release. However, there is no direct evidence that all ipRGC glutamatergic neurotransmission is eliminated in vGlut2 cKOs. Here, we examined two lines of ipRGC vGlut2 cKO mice for SCN-mediated behavioral responses under several lighting conditions and for ipRGC glutamatergic neurotransmission in the SCN. Circadian behavioral responses varied from a very limited response to light to near normal photoentrainment. After collecting behavioral data, hypothalamic slices were prepared and evoked EPSCs (eEPSCs) were recorded from SCN neurons by stimulating the optic chiasm. In cKOs, glutamatergic eEPSCs were recorded and all eEPSC parameters examined (stimulus threshold, amplitude, rise time or time-to-peak and stimulus strength to evoke a maximal response) were similar to controls. We conclude that a variable number but functionally significant percentage of ipRGCs in two vGlut2 cKO mouse lines continue to release glutamate. Thus, the residual SCN-mediated light responses in these cKO mouse lines cannot be attributed solely to ipRGC PACAP release.</p>

<p>We study finite-size fluctuations in a network of spiking deterministic
neurons coupled with non-uniform synaptic coupling. We generalize a previously
developed theory of finite size effects for uniform globally coupled neurons.
In the uniform case, mean field theory is well defined by averaging over the
network as the number of neurons in the network goes to infinity. However, for
nonuniform coupling it is no longer possible to average over the entire network
if we are interested in fluctuations at a particular location within the
network. We show that if the coupling function approaches a continuous function
in the infinite system size limit then an average over a local neighborhood can
be defined such that mean field theory is well defined for a spatially
dependent field. We then derive a perturbation expansion in the inverse system
size around the mean field limit for the covariance of the input to a neuron
(synaptic drive) and firing rate fluctuations due to dynamical deterministic
finite-size effects.

<p>The study of neuronal interactions is currently at the center of several
neuroscience big collaborative projects (including the Human Connectome, the
Blue Brain, the Brainome, etc.) which attempt to obtain a detailed map of the
entire brain matrix. Under certain constraints, mathematical theory can advance
predictions of the expected neural dynamics based solely on the statistical
properties of such synaptic interaction matrix. This work explores the
application of free random variables (FRV) to the study of large synaptic
interaction matrices. Besides recovering in a straightforward way known results
on eigenspectra of neural networks, we extend them to heavy-tailed
distributions of interactions. More importantly, we derive analytically the
behavior of eigenvector overlaps, which determine stability of the spectra. We
observe that upon imposing the neuronal excitation/inhibition balance, although
the eigenvalues remain unchanged, their stability dramatically decreases due to
strong non-orthogonality of associated eigenvectors. It leads us to the
conclusion that the understanding of the temporal evolution of asymmetric
neural networks requires considering the entangled dynamics of both
eigenvectors and eigenvalues, which might bear consequences for learning and
memory processes in these models. Considering the success of FRV analysis in a
wide variety of branches disciplines, we hope that the results presented here
foster additional application of these ideas in the area of brain sciences.

<p>This paper introduces the concept of a bi-scale metric for use in the
cooperative phase of the self-organizing map (SOM) algorithm. Use of a bi-scale
metric allows segmentation of the map into a number of regions, corresponding
to anticipated cluster structure in the data. Such a situation occurs, for
example, in the somatotopic maps which inspired the SOM algo- rithm, where
clusters of data may correspond to body surface regions whose general structure
is known. When a bi-scale metric is appropriately applied, issues with map
neurons that are not activated by any point in the training data are reduced or
eliminated. The paper also presents results of simulation studies on the
plasticity of bi-scale metric maps when they are retrained af- ter loss of
groups of map neurons or after changes in training data (such as would occur in
a somatotopic map when a body surface region like a finger is lost/removed).
The paper further considers situations where tri-scale met- rics may be useful,
and an alternative approach suggested by neurobiology, where some map regions
adapt more slowly to stimuli because they have a lower learning rate parameter.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The ability to coordinate approach and avoidance actions in dynamic environments represents the boundary between extinction and the continued survival of many animal species. It is therefore crucial that sensory systems allocate limited attentional resources to the most relevant information to facilitate planning and execution of appropriate actions. Prominent theories of how attention regulates visual processing focus on the distinction between behaviorally relevant and irrelevant visual inputs. To date, however, no study has directly compared the deployment of attention to visual inputs relevant for approach and avoidance behaviors, which naturally occur in dynamic, interactive environments. In two experiments, we combined electroencephalography, frequency tagging, and eye gaze measures to investigate whether the deployment of visual selective attention differs for items relevant for approach and avoidance actions. Participants maneuvered a cursor to approach and avoid contact with moving items in a continuous interactive task. The results indicated that while the approach and avoidance tasks recruited equivalent attentional resources overall, attentional biases were directed toward task-relevant items during approach, and away from task-relevant items during avoidance. We conclude that the deployment of visual attention is guided not only by relevance to a behavioral goal, but also by the nature of that goal.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Somatosensory inputs to the cortex undergo an early and a later stage of processing which are characterized by an early and a late somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP). The early response is highly representative of the stimulus characteristics whereas the late response reflects a more integrative, task specific, stage of sensory processing. We hypothesized that the later processing stage is independent of the early processing stage. We tested the prediction that a reduction of the first volley of input to the cortex should not prevent the increase of the late SEP. Using the sensory interference phenomenon, we halved the amplitude of the early response to somatosensory input of the ankle joints (evoked by vibration) when participants either planned a step forward or remained still. Despite the initial cortical response to the vibration being massively decreased in both tasks, the late response was still enhanced during step planning. Source localization indicated the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) as the likely origin of the late response modulation. Overall these results support the dissociation between the processes underlying the early and late SEP. The later processing stage could involve both direct and indirect thalamic connections to PPC which bypass the postcentral somatosensory cortex.</span>

Teixeira et al. report that neurotransmitter release from hippocampal serotonin terminals modulates CA3-to-CA1 excitatory transmission and spatial memory formation. 5-HT4 receptors are centrally involved in relaying both modulatory consequences, supporting the rationale to target this receptor subtype for pharmacotherapy of cognitive impairment.

Sjulson et al. demonstrate that cocaine place conditioning recruits location-dependent firing of medium spiny neurons in the nucleus accumbens. This recruitment is mediated primarily through selective coupling with hippocampal inputs that encode the cocaine-paired location, providing a possible substrate for storage of drug-location associations.

<p>by Gonçalo M. Marques, Starrlight Augustine, Konstadia Lika, Laure Pecquerie, Tiago Domingos, Sebastiaan A. L. M. Kooijman</p>

We developed new methods for parameter estimation-in-context and, with the help of 125 authors, built the AmP (Add-my-Pet) database of Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) models, parameters and referenced underlying data for animals, where each species constitutes one database entry. The combination of DEB parameters covers all aspects of energetics throughout the full organism’s life cycle, from the start of embryo development to death by aging. The species-specific parameter values capture biodiversity and can now, for the first time, be compared between animals species. An important insight brought by the AmP project is the classification of animal energetics according to a family of related DEB models that is structured on the basis of the mode of metabolic acceleration, which links up with the development of larval stages. We discuss the evolution of metabolism in this context, among animals in general, and ray-finned fish, mollusks and crustaceans in particular. New DEBtool code for estimating DEB parameters from data has been written. AmPtool code for analyzing patterns in parameter values has also been created. A new web-interface supports multiple ways to visualize data, parameters, and implied properties from the entire collection as well as on an entry by entry basis. The DEB models proved to fit data well, the median relative error is only 0.07, for the 1035 animal species at 2018/03/12, including some extinct ones, from all large phyla and all chordate orders, spanning a range of body masses of 16 orders of magnitude. This study is a first step to include evolutionary aspects into parameter estimation, allowing to infer properties of species for which very little is known.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/HxEjp5eCvBA" width="1" />

<p>Aging is known as a major risk factor for the structure and function of the nervous system. There is urgent need to overcome such deleterious effects of age-related neurodegeneration. Here we show that peripheral nerves of 24-month-old aging C57BL/6 mice of either sex show similar pathological alterations as nerves from aging human individuals, whereas 12-month-old adult mice lack such alterations. Specifically, nerve fibers showed demyelination, remyelination and axonal lesion. Moreover, in the aging mice, neuromuscular junctions showed features typical for dying-back neuropathies, as revealed by a decline of presynaptic markers, associated with α-bungarotoxin-positive postsynapses. In line with these observations were reduced muscle strengths. These alterations were accompanied by elevated numbers of endoneurial macrophages, partially comprising the features of phagocytosing macrophages. Comparable profiles of macrophages could be identified in peripheral nerve biopsies of aging persons. To determine the pathological impact of macrophages in aging mice, we selectively targeted the cells by applying an orally administered CSF-1R specific kinase (c-FMS) inhibitor. The 6-month-lasting treatment started before development of degenerative changes at 18 months and reduced macrophage numbers in mice by ~70%, without side effects. Strikingly, nerve structure was ameliorated and muscle strength preserved. We show, for the first time, that age-related degenerative changes in peripheral nerves are driven by macrophages. These findings may pave the way for treating degeneration in the aging peripheral nervous system by targeting macrophages, leading to reduced weakness, improved mobility, and eventually increased quality of life in the elderly.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Aging is a major risk factor for the structure and function of the nervous system. Here we show that peripheral nerves of 24-month-old aging mice show similar degenerative alterations as nerves from aging human individuals. Both in mice and humans, these alterations were accompanied by endoneurial macrophages. To determine the pathological impact of macrophages in aging mice, we selectively targeted the cells by blocking a cytokine receptor, essential for macrophage survival. The treatment strongly reduced macrophage numbers and substantially improved nerve structure and muscle strength. We show, for the first time, that age-related degenerative changes in peripheral nerves are driven by macrophages. These findings may be helpful for treatment weakness and reduced mobility in the elderly.</p>

<p>In the rodent olfactory system, neuroblasts produced in the ventricular-subventricular zone of the postnatal brain migrate tangentially in chain-like cell aggregates toward the olfactory bulb (OB) through the rostral migratory stream (RMS). After reaching the OB, the chains are dissociated and the neuroblasts migrate individually and radially toward their final destination. The cellular and molecular mechanisms controlling cell–cell adhesion during this detachment remain unclear. Here we report that Fyn, a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase, regulates the detachment of neuroblasts from chains in the male and female mouse OB. By performing chemical screening and <i>in vivo</i> loss-of-function and gain-of-function experiments, we found that Fyn promotes somal disengagement from the chains and is involved in neuronal migration from the RMS into the granule cell layer of the OB. Fyn knockdown or Dab1 (disabled-1) deficiency caused p120-catenin to accumulate and adherens junction-like structures to be sustained at the contact sites between neuroblasts. Moreover, a Fyn and N-cadherin double-knockdown experiment indicated that Fyn regulates the N-cadherin-mediated cell adhesion between neuroblasts. These results suggest that the Fyn-mediated control of cell–cell adhesion is critical for the detachment of chain-forming neuroblasts in the postnatal OB.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> In the postnatal brain, newly born neurons (neuroblasts) migrate in chain-like cell aggregates toward their destination, where they are dissociated into individual cells and mature. The cellular and molecular mechanisms controlling the detachment of neuroblasts from chains are not understood. Here we show that Fyn, a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase, promotes the somal detachment of neuroblasts from chains, and that this regulation is critical for the efficient migration of neuroblasts to their destination. We further show that Fyn and Dab1 (disabled-1) decrease the cell–cell adhesion between chain-forming neuroblasts, which involves adherens junction-like structures. Our results suggest that Fyn-mediated regulation of the cell–cell adhesion of neuroblasts is critical for their detachment from chains in the postnatal brain.</p>

<p>Ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) is thought to provide regulatory control over Pavlovian fear responses and has recently been implicated in appetitive approach behavior, but much less is known about its role in contexts in which appetitive and aversive outcomes can be obtained and avoided, respectively. To address this issue, we recorded from single neurons in vmPFC while male rats performed our combined approach and avoidance task under reinforced and non-reinforced (extinction) conditions. Surprisingly, we found that cues predicting reward modulated cell firing in vmPFC more often and more robustly than cues preceding avoidable shock; in addition, firing of vmPFC neurons was both response (press or no-press) and outcome (reinforced or extinction) selective. These results suggest a complex role for vmPFC in regulating behavior and support its role in appetitive contexts during both reinforced and non-reinforced conditions.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Selecting context-appropriate behaviors to gain reward or avoid punishment is critical for survival. Although the role of ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) in mediating fear responses is well established, vmPFC has also been implicated in the regulation of reward-guided approach and extinction. Many studies have used indirect methods and simple behavioral procedures to study vmPFC, which leaves the literature incomplete. We recorded vmFPC neural activity during a complex cue-driven combined approach and avoidance task and during extinction. Surprisingly, we found very little vmPFC modulation to cues predicting avoidable shock, whereas cues predicting reward approach robustly modulated vmPFC firing in a response- and outcome-selective manner. This suggests a more complex role for vmPFC than current theories suggest, specifically regarding context-specific behavioral optimization.</p>

<p>Cognitive decline is a debilitating hallmark during preclinical stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD), yet the causes remain unclear. Because histone acetylation homeostasis is critical for mediating epigenetic gene control throughout neuronal development, we postulated that its misregulation contributes to cognitive impairment preceding AD pathology. Here, we show that disruption of Tip60 histone acetlytransferase (HAT)/histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) homeostasis occurs early in the brain of an AD-associated amyloid precursor protein (APP) <i>Drosophila</i> model and triggers epigenetic repression of neuroplasticity genes well before Aβ plaques form in male and female larvae. Repressed genes display enhanced HDAC2 binding and reduced Tip60 and histone acetylation enrichment. Increasing Tip60 in the AD-associated APP brain restores Tip60 HAT/HDAC2 balance by decreasing HDAC2 levels, reverses neuroepigenetic alterations to activate synaptic plasticity genes, and reinstates brain morphology and cognition. Such <i>Drosophila</i> neuroplasticity gene epigenetic signatures are conserved in male and female mouse hippocampus and their expression and Tip60 function is compromised in hippocampus from AD patients. We suggest that Tip60 HAT/HDAC2-mediated epigenetic gene disruption is a critical initial step in AD that is reversed by restoring Tip60 in the brain.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Mild cognitive impairment is a debilitating hallmark during preclinical stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD), yet its causes remain unclear. Although recent findings support elevated histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) as a cause for epigenetic repression of synaptic genes that contribute to cognitive deficits, whether alterations in histone acetlytransferase (HAT) levels that counterbalance HDAC2 repressor action occur and the identity of these HATs remain unknown. We demonstrate that disruption of Tip60 HAT/HDAC2 homeostasis occurs early in the AD <i>Drosophila</i> brain and triggers epigenetic repression of neuroplasticity genes before Aβ plaques form. Increasing Tip60 in the AD brain restores Tip60 HAT/HDAC2 balance, reverses neuroepigenetic alterations to activate synaptic genes, and reinstates brain morphology and cognition.

<p>In Parkinson's disease (PD), subthalamic nucleus beta band oscillations are decreased by therapeutic deep-brain stimulation (DBS) and this has been proposed as important to the mechanism of therapy. The globus pallidus is a common alternative target for PD with similar motor benefits as subthalamic DBS, but effects of pallidal stimulation in PD are not well studied, and effects of pallidal DBS on cortical function in PD are unknown. Here, in 20 PD and 14 isolated dystonia human patients of both genders undergoing pallidal DBS lead implantation, we recorded local field potentials from the globus pallidus and in a subset of these, recorded simultaneous sensorimotor cortex ECoG potentials. PD patients had elevated resting pallidal low beta band (13–20 Hz) power compared with dystonia patients, whereas dystonia patients had elevated resting pallidal theta band (4–8 Hz) power compared with PD. We show that this results in disease-specific patterns of interaction between the pallidum and motor cortex: PD patients demonstrated relatively elevated phase coherence with the motor cortex in the beta band and this was reduced by therapeutic pallidal DBS. Dystonia patients had greater theta band phase coherence. Our results support the hypothesis that specific motor phenomenology observed in movement disorders are associated with elevated network oscillations in specific frequency bands, and that DBS in movement disorders acts in general by disrupting elevated synchronization between basal ganglia output and motor cortex.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Perturbations in synchronized oscillatory activity in brain networks are increasingly recognized as important features in movement disorders. The globus pallidus is a commonly used target for deep-brain stimulation (DBS) in Parkinson's disease (PD), however, the effects of pallidal DBS on basal ganglia and cortical oscillations are unknown. Using invasive intraoperative recordings in patients with PD and isolated dystonia, we found disease-specific patterns of elevated oscillatory synchronization within the pallidum and in coherence between pallidum and motor cortex. Therapeutic pallidal DBS in PD suppresses these elevated synchronizations, reducing the influence of diseased basal ganglia on cortical physiology. We propose a general mechanism for DBS therapy in movement disorders: functional disconnection of basal ganglia output and motor cortex by coherence suppression.</p>

<p>Disturbances in prefrontal cortical (PFC) dopamine (DA) transmission are well established features of psychiatric disorders involving pathological memory processing, such as post-traumatic stress disorder and opioid addiction. Transmission through PFC DA D4 receptors (D4Rs) has been shown to potentiate the emotional salience of normally nonsalient emotional memories, whereas transmission through PFC DA D1 receptors (D1Rs) has been demonstrated to selectively block recall of reward- or aversion-related associative memories. In the present study, using a combination of fear conditioning and opiate reward conditioning in male rats, we examined the role of PFC D4/D1R signaling during the processing of fear-related memory acquisition and recall and subsequent sensitivity to opiate reward memory formation. We report that PFC D4R activation potentiates the salience of normally subthreshold fear conditioning memory cues and simultaneously potentiates the rewarding effects of systemic or intra-ventral tegmental area (VTA) morphine conditioning cues. In contrast, blocking the recall of salient fear memories with intra-PFC D1R activation, blocks the ability of fear memory recall to potentiate systemic or intra-VTA morphine place preference. These effects were dependent upon dissociable PFC phosphorylation states involving calcium-calmodulin-kinase II or extracellular signal-related kinase 1–2, following intra-PFC D4 or D1R activation, respectively. Together, these findings reveal new insights into how aberrant PFC DAergic transmission and associated downstream molecular signaling pathways may modulate fear-related emotional memory processing and concomitantly increase opioid addiction vulnerability.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Post-traumatic stress disorder is highly comorbid with addiction. In this study, we use a translational model of fear memory conditioning to examine how transmission through dopamine D1 or D4 receptors, in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), may differentially control acquisition or recall of fear memories and how these mechanisms might regulate sensitivity to the rewarding effects of opioids. We demonstrate that PFC D4 activation not only controls the salience of fear memory acquisition, but potentiates the rewarding effects of opioids. In contrast, PFC D1 receptor activation blocks recall of fear memories and prevents potentiation of opioid reward effects. Together, these findings demonstrate novel PFC mechanisms that may account for how emotional memory disturbances might increase the addictive liability of opioid-class drugs.</p>

<p>Receptive field properties of individual visual neurons are dictated by the precise patterns of synaptic connections they receive, including the arrangement of inputs in visual space and features such as polarity (On vs Off). The inputs from the retina to the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) in the mouse undergo significant refinement during development. However, it is unknown how this refinement corresponds to the establishment of functional visual response properties. Here we conducted <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i> recordings in the mouse LGN, beginning just after natural eye opening, to determine how receptive fields develop as excitatory and feedforward inhibitory retinal afferents refine. Experiments used both male and female subjects. For <i>in vivo</i> assessment of receptive fields, we performed multisite extracellular recordings in awake mice. Spatial receptive fields at eye-opening were &gt;2 times larger than in adulthood, and decreased in size over the subsequent week. This topographic refinement was accompanied by other spatial changes, such as a decrease in spot size preference and an increase in surround suppression. Notably, the degree of specificity in terms of On/Off and sustained/transient responses appeared to be established already at eye opening and did not change. We performed <i>in vitro</i> recordings of the synaptic responses evoked by optic tract stimulation across the same time period. These recordings revealed a pairing of decreased excitatory and increased feedforward inhibitory convergence, providing a potential mechanism to explain the spatial receptive field refinement.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The development of precise patterns of retinogeniculate connectivity has been a powerful model system for understanding the mechanisms underlying the activity-dependent refinement of sensory systems. Here we link the maturation of spatial receptive field properties in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) to the remodeling of retinal and inhibitory feedforward convergence onto LGN neurons. These findings should thus provide a starting point for testing the cell type-specific plasticity mechanisms that lead to refinement of different excitatory and inhibitory inputs, and for determining the effect of these mechanisms on the establishment of mature receptive fields in the LGN.</p>

<p>Failures to obtain reward can occur from errors in action selection or action execution. Recently, we observed marked differences in choice behavior when the failure to obtain a reward was attributed to errors in action execution compared with errors in action selection (McDougle et al., 2016). Specifically, participants appeared to solve this credit assignment problem by discounting outcomes in which the absence of reward was attributed to errors in action execution. Building on recent evidence indicating relatively direct communication between the cerebellum and basal ganglia, we hypothesized that cerebellar-dependent sensory prediction errors (SPEs), a signal indicating execution failure, could attenuate value updating within a basal ganglia-dependent reinforcement learning system. Here we compared the SPE hypothesis to an alternative, "top-down" hypothesis in which changes in choice behavior reflect participants' sense of agency. In two experiments with male and female human participants, we manipulated the strength of SPEs, along with the participants' sense of agency in the second experiment. The results showed that, whereas the strength of SPE had no effect on choice behavior, participants were much more likely to discount the absence of rewards under conditions in which they believed the reward outcome depended on their ability to produce accurate movements. These results provide strong evidence that SPEs do not directly influence reinforcement learning. Instead, a participant's sense of agency appears to play a significant role in modulating choice behavior when unexpected outcomes can arise from errors in action execution.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> When learning from the outcome of actions, the brain faces a credit assignment problem: Failures of reward can be attributed to poor choice selection or poor action execution. Here, we test a specific hypothesis that execution errors are implicitly signaled by cerebellar-based sensory prediction errors. We evaluate this hypothesis and compare it with a more "top-down" hypothesis in which the modulation of choice behavior from execution errors reflects participants' sense of agency. We find that sensory prediction errors have no significant effect on reinforcement learning. Instead, instructions influencing participants' belief of causal outcomes appear to be the main factor influencing their choice behavior.</p>

<p>Neuropeptide Y (NPY) expression is tightly linked with the development of stress resilience in rodents and humans. Local NPY injections targeting the basolateral amygdala (BLA) produce long-term behavioral stress resilience in male rats via an unknown mechanism. Previously, we showed that activation of NPY Y<sub>1</sub> receptors hyperpolarizes BLA principal neurons (PNs) through inhibition of the hyperpolarization-activated, depolarizing H-current, <i>I</i><sub>h</sub>. The present studies tested whether NPY treatment induces stress resilience by modulating <i>I</i><sub>h</sub>. NPY (10 pmol) was delivered daily for 5 d bilaterally into the BLA to induce resilience; thereafter, the electrophysiological properties of PNs and the expression of <i>I</i><sub>h</sub> in the BLA were characterized. As reported previously, increases in social interaction (SI) times persisted weeks after completion of NPY administration. <i>In vitro</i> intracellular recordings showed that repeated intra-BLA NPY injections resulted in hyperpolarization of BLA PNs at 2 weeks (2W) and 4 weeks (4W) after NPY treatment. At 2W, spontaneous IPSC frequencies were increased, whereas at 4W, resting <i>I</i><sub>h</sub> was markedly reduced and accompanied by decreased levels of HCN1 mRNA and protein expression in BLA. Knock-down of HCN1 channels in the BLA with targeted delivery of lentivirus containing HCN1-shRNA increased SI beginning 2W after injection and induced stress resilience. NPY treatment induced sequential, complementary changes in the inputs to BLA PNs and their postsynaptic properties that reduce excitability, a mechanism that contributes to less anxious behavior. Furthermore, HCN1 knock-down mimicked the increases in SI and stress resilience observed with NPY, indicating the importance of <i>I</i><sub>h</sub> in stress-related behavior.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Resilience improves mental health outcomes in response to adverse situations. Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is associated with decreased stress responses and the expression of resilience in rodents and humans. Single or repeated injections of NPY into the basolateral amygdala (BLA) buffer negative behavioral effects of stress and induce resilience in rats, respectively. Here, we demonstrate that repeated administration of NPY into the BLA unfolds several cellular mechanisms that decrease the activity of pyramidal output neurons. One key mechanism is a reduction in levels of the excitatory ion channel HCN1. Moreover, shRNA knock-down of HCN1 expression in BLA recapitulates some of the actions of NPY and causes potent resilience to stress, indicating that this channel may be a possible target for therapy.</p>

<p>Behavioral flexibility and impulse control are necessary for successful execution of adaptive behavior. They are impaired in patients with damage to the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and in some clinically important conditions, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder. Although the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) has been investigated as a critical structure for behavioral flexibility and impulse control, the contribution of the underlying pyramidal neuron cell types in the mPFC remained to be understood. Here we show that interneuron-mediated local inactivation of pyramidal neurons in the mPFC of male and female mice induces both premature responses and choice bias, and establish that these impulsive and compulsive responses are modulated independently. Cell-type-specific photoinhibition of pyramidal deep layer corticostriatal or corticothalamic neurons reduces behavioral flexibility without inducing premature responses. Together, our data confirm the role of corticostriatal neurons in behavioral flexibility and demonstrate that flexible behaviors are also modulated by direct projections from deep layer corticothalamic neurons in the mPFC to midline thalamic nuclei.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Behavioral flexibility and impulse control are indispensable for animals to adapt to changes in the environment and often affected in patients with PFC damage and obsessive-compulsive disorder. We used a probabilistic reversal task to dissect the underlying neural circuitry in the mPFC. Through characterization of the three major pyramidal cell types in the mPFC with optogenetic silencing, we demonstrated that corticostriatal and corticothalamic but not corticocortical pyramidal neurons are temporally recruited for behavioral flexibility. Together, our findings confirm the role of corticostriatal projections in cognitive flexibility and identify corticothalamic neurons as equally important for behavioral flexibility.</p>

<p>Current approaches to the early detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) rely upon classifying individuals as "positive" or "negative" for biomarkers related to the core pathology of β-amyloid (Aβ). However, the accumulation of Aβ begins slowly, years before biomarkers become abnormal. We used longitudinal [<sup>11</sup>C] Pittsburgh Compound B PET scanning and neuropsychological assessment to investigate the earliest changes in AD pathology and how it affects memory in cognitively normal older humans (<i>N</i> = 71; mean age 75 years; 35% male). We used [<sup>18</sup>F] AV-1451 PET scanning at the end of the observation period to measure subsequent tau deposition in a subset of our sample (<i>N</i> = 37). We found evidence for an inverted-U relationship between baseline Aβ levels and Aβ slope in asymptomatic older adults, suggesting a slowing of Aβ accumulation even in cognitively normal adults. In participants who were nominally amyloid negative, both the rate of amyloid accumulation and the baseline levels of Aβ predicted early tau deposition in cortical Braak regions associated with AD. Amyloid measures were only sensitive to memory decline as baseline levels of Aβ increased, suggesting that pathological accumulation occurs before impacting memory. These findings support the necessity of early intervention with amyloid-lowering therapies even in those who are amyloid negative.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The progressive nature of Alzheimer's disease (AD) necessitates the earliest possible detection of pathological or cognitive change if disease progression is to be slowed. We examined cognitively normal older adults in whom AD pathology is starting to develop, with the goal of early detection of AD pathology or cognitive changes. We found amyloid measures to be sensitive early on in predicting subsequent early tau deposition. Further, it appears that rates of amyloid accumulation already begin to slow in preclinical AD, suggesting that it is a relatively late stage of AD progression. Thus, it is crucial to examine older adults early, before amyloid levels have saturated, to intervene to slow disease progression.</p>

<p>The medial temporal lobe (MTL) is widely implicated in supporting episodic memory and navigation, but its precise functional role in organizing memory across time and space remains elusive. Here we examine the specific cognitive processes implemented by MTL structures (hippocampus and entorhinal cortex) to organize memory by using electrical brain stimulation, leveraging its ability to establish causal links between brain regions and features of behavior. We studied neurosurgical patients of both sexes who performed spatial-navigation and verbal-episodic memory tasks while brain stimulation was applied in various regions during learning. During the verbal memory task, stimulation in the MTL disrupted the temporal organization of encoded memories such that items learned with stimulation tended to be recalled in a more randomized order. During the spatial task, MTL stimulation impaired subjects' abilities to remember items located far away from boundaries. These stimulation effects were specific to the MTL. Our findings thus provide the first causal demonstration in humans of the specific memory processes that are performed by the MTL to encode when and where events occurred.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Numerous studies have implicated the medial temporal lobe (MTL) in encoding spatial and temporal memories, but they have not been able to causally demonstrate the nature of the cognitive processes by which this occurs in real-time. Electrical brain stimulation is able to demonstrate causal links between a brain region and a given function with high temporal precision. By examining behavior in a memory task as subjects received MTL stimulation, we provide the first causal evidence demonstrating the role of the MTL in organizing the spatial and temporal aspects of episodic memory.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/19/4462?rss=1">Long-Term Depression Is Independent of GluN2 Subunit Composition</a></h4>

<p>NMDA receptors (NMDARs) mediate both long-term potentiation and long-term depression (LTD) and understanding how a single receptor can initiate both phenomena remains a major question in neuroscience. A prominent hypothesis implicates the NMDAR subunit composition, specifically GluN2A and GluN2B, in dictating the rules of synaptic plasticity. However, studies testing this hypothesis have yielded inconsistent and often contradictory results, especially for LTD. These inconsistent results may be due to challenges in the interpretation of subunit-selective pharmacology and in dissecting out the contributions of differential channel properties versus the interacting proteins unique to GluN2A or GluN2B. In this study, we address the pharmacological and biochemical challenges by using a single-neuron genetic approach to delete NMDAR subunits in conditional knock-out mice. In addition, the recently discovered non-ionotropic nature of NMDAR-dependent LTD allowed the rigorous assessment of unique subunit contributions to NMDAR-dependent LTD while eliminating the variable of differential charge transfer. Here we find that neither the GluN2A nor the GluN2B subunit is strictly necessary for either non-ionotropic or ionotropic LTD.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> NMDA receptors are key regulators of bidirectional synaptic plasticity. Understanding the mechanisms regulating bidirectional plasticity will guide development of therapeutic strategies to treat the dysfunctional synaptic plasticity in multiple neuropsychiatric disorders. Because of the unique properties of the NMDA receptor GluN2 subunits, they have been postulated to differentially affect synaptic plasticity. However, there has been significant controversy regarding the roles of the GluN2 subunits in synaptic long term depression (LTD). Using single-neuron knock-out of the GluN2 subunits, we show that LTD requires neither GluN2A nor GluN2B.</p>

<p>This article proposes a novel collective decision making scheme to solve the
multi-agent drift-diffusion-model problem with the help of spiking neural
networks. The exponential integrate-and-fire model is used here to capture the
individual dynamics of each agent in the system, and we name this new model as
Exponential Decision Making (EDM) model. We demonstrate analytically and
experimentally that the gating variable for instantaneous activation follows
Boltzmann probability distribution, and the collective system reaches
meta-stable critical states under the Markov chain premises. With mean field
analysis, we derive the global criticality from local dynamics and achieve a
power law distribution. Critical behavior of EDM exhibits the convergence
dynamics of Boltzmann distribution, and we conclude that the EDM model inherits
the property of self-organized criticality, that the system will eventually
evolve toward criticality.

<p>Lemma 4.8 in the article [Regularity structures and renormalisation of
FitzHugh-Nagumo SPDEs in three space dimensions, Electronic J. Probability 21
(18):1-48 (2016), <a href="http://export.arxiv.org/abs/1504.02953">arXiv:1504.02953</a>] contains a mistake, which implies a weaker
regularity estimate than the one stated in Proposition 4.11. This does not
affect the proof of Theorem 2.1, but Theorems 2.2 and 2.3 only follow from the
given proof if either the space dimension $d$ is equal to $2$, or the
nonlinearity $F(U,V)$ is linear in $V$. To fix this problem and provide a proof
of Theorems 2.2 and 2.3 valid in full generality, we consider an alternative
formulation of the fixed-point problem, involving a modified integration
operator with nonlocal singularity and a slightly different regularity
structure. We provide the multilevel Schauder estimates and
renormalisation-group analysis required for the fixed-point argument in this
new setting.

individual-template-based CCA (IT-CCA) has achieved excellent performance.
However, CCA requires the canonical vectors to be orthogonal, which may not be
a reasonable assumption for EEG analysis. In the current study, we propose
using the correlated component analysis (CORRCA) rather than CCA to implement
frequency recognition. CORRCA can relax the constraint of canonical vectors in
CCA, and generate the same projection vector for two multichannel EEG signals.
Furthermore, we propose a two-stage method based on the basic CORRCA method
(termed TSCORRCA). Evaluated on a benchmark dataset of thirty-five subjects,
the experimental results demonstrate that CORRCA significantly outperformed
CCA, and TSCORRCA obtained the best performance among the compared methods.
This study demonstrates that CORRCA-based methods have great potential for
implementing high-performance SSVEP-based BCI systems.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Cell death and subsequent inflammation are 2 key pathological changes occurring in cerebral ischemia. Active microglia/macrophages play a double-edged role depending on the balance of their M1/M2 phenotypes. Necrosis is the predominant type of cell death following ischemia. However, how necrotic cells modulate the M1/M2 polarization of microglia/macrophages remains poorly investigated. Here, we reported that ischemia induces a rapid RIPK3/MLKL-mediated neuron-dominated necroptosis, a type of programmed necrosis. Ablating RIPK3 or MLKL could switch the activation of microglia/macrophages from M1 to the M2 type in the ischemic cortex. Conditioned medium of oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD)-treated wild-type (WT) neurons induced M1 polarization, while that of RIPK3<sup>−/−</sup> neurons favored M2 polarization. OGD treatment induces proinflammatory IL-18 and TNFα in WT but not in RIPK3<sup>−/−</sup> neurons, which in turn upregulate anti-inflammatory IL-4 and IL-10. Furthermore, the expression of Myd88—a common downstream adaptor of toll-like receptors—is significantly upregulated in the microglia/macrophages of ischemic WT but not of RIPK3<sup>−/−</sup> or MLKL<sup>−/−</sup> cortices. Antagonizing the function of Myd88 could phenocopy the effects of RIPK3/MLKL-knockout on the polarization of microglia/macrophages and was neuroprotective. Our data revealed a novel role of necroptotic neurons in modulating the M1/M2 balance of microglia/macrophages in the ischemic cortex, possibly through Myd88 signaling.</span>

Cells respond to stressful conditions by coordinating a complex, multi-faceted response that spans many levels of physiology. Much of the response is coordinated by changes in protein phosphorylation. Although the regulators of transcriptome changes during stress are well characterized in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, the upstream regulatory network controlling protein phosphorylation is less well dissected. Here, we developed a computational approach to infer the signaling network that regulates phosphorylation changes in response to salt stress. We developed an approach to link predicted regulators to groups of likely co-regulated phospho-peptides responding to stress, thereby creating new edges in a background protein interaction network. We then use integer linear programming (ILP) to integrate wild type and mutant phospho-proteomic data and predict the network controlling stress-activated phospho-proteomic changes. The network we inferred predicted new regulatory connections between stress-activated and growth-regulating pathways and suggested mechanisms coordinating metabolism, cell-cycle progression, and growth during stress. We confirmed several network predictions with co-immunoprecipitations coupled with mass-spectrometry protein identification and mutant phospho-proteomic analysis. Results show that the cAMP-phosphodiesterase Pde2 physically interacts with many stress-regulated transcription factors targeted by PKA, and that reduced phosphorylation of those factors during stress requires the Rck2 kinase that we show physically interacts with Pde2. Together, our work shows how a high-quality computational network model can facilitate discovery of new pathway interactions during osmotic stress.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/sNFhadDEsvQ" width="1" />

Abstract
<p>Hypofunction of <i>N</i>-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) in inhibitory GABAergic interneurons is implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia (SZ), a heritable disorder with many susceptibility genes. However, it is still unclear how SZ risk genes interfere with NMDAR-mediated synaptic transmission in diverse inhibitory interneuron populations. One putative risk gene is neuregulin 1 (<i>NRG1</i>), which signals via the receptor tyrosine kinase ErbB4, itself a schizophrenia risk gene. The type I isoform of <i>NRG1</i> shows increased expression in the brain of SZ patients, and ErbB4 is enriched in GABAergic interneurons expressing parvalbumin (PV) or cholecystokinin (CCK). Here, we investigated ErbB4 expression and synaptic transmission in interneuronal populations of the hippocampus of transgenic mice overexpressing NRG1 type I (NRG1<sup>tg-type-I</sup> mice). Immunohistochemical analyses confirmed that ErbB4 was coexpressed with either PV or CCK in hippocampal interneurons, but we observed a reduced number of ErbB4-immunopositive interneurons in the NRG1<sup>tg-type-I</sup> mice. NMDAR-mediated currents in interneurons expressing PV (including PV<sup>+</sup> basket cells) or CCK were reduced in NRG1<sup>tg-type-I</sup> mice compared to their littermate controls. We found no difference in AMPA receptor–mediated currents. Optogenetic activation (5 pulses at 20 Hz) of local glutamatergic fibers revealed a decreased NMDAR-mediated contribution to disynaptic GABAergic inhibition of pyramidal cells in the NRG1<sup>tg-type-I</sup> mice. GABAergic synaptic transmission from either PV<sup>+</sup> or CCK<sup>+</sup> interneurons, and glutamatergic transmission onto pyramidal cells, did not significantly differ between genotypes. The results indicate that synaptic NMDAR-mediated signaling in hippocampal interneurons is sensitive to chronically elevated NGR1 type I levels. This may contribute to the pathophysiological consequences of increased <i>NRG1</i> expression in SZ.</p>

Abstract
<p>Some rats are especially prone to attribute incentive salience to a cue (conditioned stimulus, CS) paired with food reward (sign-trackers, STs), but the extent they do so varies as a function of the form of the CS. Other rats respond primarily to the predictive value of a cue (goal-trackers, GTs), regardless of its form. Sign-tracking is associated with greater cue-induced activation of mesolimbic structures than goal-tracking; however, it is unclear how the form of the CS itself influences activity in neural systems involved in incentive salience attribution. Thus, our goal was to determine how different cue modalities affect neural activity in the ventral pallidum (VP), which is known to encode incentive salience attribution, as rats performed a two-CS Pavlovian conditioned approach task in which both a lever-CS and a tone-CS predicted identical food reward. The lever-CS elicited sign-tracking in some rats (STs) and goal-tracking in others (GTs), whereas the tone-CS elicited only goal-tracking in all rats. The lever-CS elicited robust changes in neural activity (sustained tonic increases or decreases in firing) throughout the VP in STs, relative to GTs. These changes were not seen when STs were exposed to the tone-CS, and in GTs there were no differences in firing between the lever-CS and tone-CS. We conclude that neural activity throughout the VP encodes incentive signals and is especially responsive when a cue is of a form that promotes the attribution of incentive salience to it, especially in predisposed individuals.</p>

Abstract
<p>Human observers automatically extract temporal contingencies from the environment and predict the onset of future events. Temporal predictions are modeled by the hazard function, which describes the instantaneous probability for an event to occur given it has not occurred yet. Here, we tackle the question of whether and how the human brain tracks continuous temporal hazard on a moment-to-moment basis, and how flexibly it adjusts to strictly implicit variations in the hazard function. We applied an encoding-model approach to human electroencephalographic data recorded during a pitch-discrimination task, in which we implicitly manipulated temporal predictability of the target tones by varying the interval between cue and target tone (i.e. the foreperiod). Critically, temporal predictability either was driven solely by the passage of time (resulting in a monotonic hazard function) or was modulated to increase at intermediate foreperiods (resulting in a modulated hazard function with a peak at the intermediate foreperiod). Forward-encoding models trained to predict the recorded EEG signal from different temporal hazard functions were able to distinguish between experimental conditions, showing that implicit variations of temporal hazard bear tractable signatures in the human electroencephalogram. Notably, this tracking signal was reconstructed best from the supplementary motor area, underlining this area’s link to cognitive processing of time. Our results underline the relevance of temporal hazard to cognitive processing and show that the predictive accuracy of the encoding-model approach can be utilized to track abstract time-resolved stimuli.</p>

Abstract<p>It is widely assumed that distributed neuronal networks are fundamental to the functioning of the brain. Consistent spike timing between neurons is thought to be one of the key principles for the formation of these networks. This can involve synchronous spiking or spiking with time delays, forming spike sequences when the order of spiking is consistent. Finding networks defined by their sequence of time-shifted spikes, denoted here as spike timing networks, is a tremendous challenge. As neurons can participate in multiple spike sequences at multiple between-spike time delays, the possible complexity of networks is prohibitively large. We present a novel approach that is capable of (1) extracting spike timing networks regardless of their sequence complexity, and (2) that describes their spiking sequences with high temporal precision. We achieve this by decomposing frequency-transformed neuronal spiking into separate networks, characterizing each network’s spike sequence by a time delay per neuron, forming a spike sequence timeline. These networks provide a detailed template for an investigation of the experimental relevance of their spike sequences. Using simulated spike timing networks, we show network extraction is robust to spiking noise, spike timing jitter, and partial occurrences of the involved spike sequences. Using rat multi-neuron recordings, we demonstrate the approach is capable of revealing real spike timing networks with sub-millisecond temporal precision. By uncovering spike timing networks, the prevalence, structure, and function of complex spike sequences can be investigated in greater detail, allowing us to gain a better understanding of their role in neuronal functioning.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Spike timing consistencies in neuronal networks are widely thought to be one of several key principles behind neuronal functioning. They are challenging to investigate, however, because there is effectively an infinite number of combinations of neurons and their between-neuron time delays for any given recording. Many techniques have been developed for their analysis, but they are still limited by the complexity of spike timing patterns they can reveal. Here we present a novel approach that can reveal spike timing patterns with arbitrary combinatorial complexity. This provides a new opportunity for investigating spike timing networks, which is crucial to gain a better understanding of the role they play in neuronal functioning.</p>

Abstract<p>Increased permeability of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) following cerebral injury results in regional extravasation of plasma proteins and can critically contribute to the pathogenesis of epilepsy. Here, we comprehensively explored the spatiotemporal evolution of a main extravasation component, albumin, and illuminate associated responses of the neurovascular unit (NVU) contributing to early epileptogenic neuropathology. We applied translational <i>in vivo</i> MR imaging and complementary immunohistochemical analyses in the widely used rat pilocarpine-post status epilepticus (SE) model. The observed rapid BBB leakage affected major epileptogenesis-associated brain regions, peaked between 1 and 2 days post SE, and rapidly declined thereafter, accompanied by cerebral edema generally following the same time course. At peak of BBB leakage,serum albumin colocalized with NVU constituents, like vascular components, neurons and brain immune cells. Surprisingly, astroglial markers did not colocalize with albumin and aquaporin-4 (AQP4) was clearly reduced in areas of leaky BBB, indicating a severe disturbance of astrocyte-mediated endothelial-neuronal coupling. In addition, a distinct adaptive reorganization process of the NVU vasculature apparently takes place at sites of albumin presence, substantiated by reduced immunoreactivity of endothelial and changes in vascular basement membrane markers. Taken together, degenerative events at the level of the NVU, affecting vessels, astrocytes and neurons, seem to outweigh reconstructive processes. Considering the rapidly occurring BBB leakage and subsequent impairment of the NVU, our data support the necessity of a prompt BBB-restoring treatment as one component of rational therapeutic intervention to prevent epileptogenesis and the development of other detrimental sequelae of SE.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Blood-brain barrier (BBB) leakage is critically involved in brain insult-mediated epilepsy development. Here, we demonstrate rapid but transient BBB damage within hours after experimental status epilepticus (SE), an epileptogenic insult, and subsequent degenerative events at the level of the so called neurovascular unit (NVU), which reflects the anatomic and functional interplay between brain vasculature, glial cells and neurons. Analyses at cellular level revealed degeneration of various NVU components, which seem to outweigh reconstructive processes, thus providing potential targets for protective pharmacotherapy. The findings emphasize the requirement and expedience of rapid BBB-stabilizing treatment as a primary element of epilepsy-preventive therapeutic interventions.</p>

Abstract<p>The neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is a specialized synapse that is formed by motor axon innervation of skeletal muscle fibers. The maintenance of motor-muscle connectivity is critical for the preservation of muscle tone and generation of movement. Injury can induce a robust regenerative response in motor axons, but severe trauma or chronic denervation resulting from neurodegenerative disease typically leads to inefficient repair and poor functional recovery. The axon guidance molecule Semaphorin3A (Sema3A) has been implicated as a negative regulator of motor innervation. Upon binding to a plexinA-neuropilin1 (Npn1) receptor complex, Sema3A initiates a downstream signaling cascade that results in axonal repulsion. Here, we established a reproducible nerve crush model to quantify motor nerve regeneration. We then used that model to investigate the role of Sema3A signaling at the adult NMJ. In contrast to previous findings, we found that <i>Sema3A</i> and <i>Npn1</i> mRNA decrease in response to denervation, suggesting that Sema3A-Npn1 signaling may regulate NMJ reinnervation. To directly test that hypothesis, we used inducible knockout models to ubiquitously delete Sema3A or Npn1 from adult mice. Despite demonstrating that we could achieve highly efficient gene deletion, disruption of Sema3A-Npn1 signaling did not affect the normal maintenance of the NMJ or disrupt motor axon reinnervation after a denervating injury.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Increased axonal growth and sprouting after a peripheral nerve injury are thought to signify the activation of a robust regenerative response that results in more efficient recovery. The axon guidance factor Sema3A has been proposed to generate a growth inhibitory environment that reduces the regenerative capability of motor nerves. We sought to directly test how the inducible deletion of Sema3A or its receptor Npn1 alters muscle reinnervation after injury. Surprisingly, our work demonstrates that disruption of Npn1-Sema3A signaling does not alter reinnervation of the NMJ. Thus, the utility of targeting this pathway to improve recovery from denervating injuries may be more limited than suggested by earlier studies.</p>

<p>This work proposes a novel approach to include a model of making decision in
human brain into the control loop. Employing the methodology developed in
mathematical neuroscience, we construct a model that accounts for quality of
human decision in supervisory tasks. We specifically focus on adaptive gain
theory and the strategy selection problem. The proposed model is shown to be
capable of explaining the change of a strategy from compensatory to heuristics
in different conditions. We also propose a method to incorporate the effect of
internal and external parameters such as stress level and emergencies in the
decision model. The model is employed in a supervisory controller that
dispatches the jobs between autonomy and a human supervisor in an efficient
way.

<p>Previous experimental work has shown high-frequency Poisson-distributed
trains of combined excitatory and inhibitory conductance- and current-based
synaptic inputs reduce amplitude of subthreshold oscillations of SCs. In this
paper, we investigate the mechanism underlying these phenomena in the context
of the model. More specially, we studied the effects of both conductance- and
current-based synaptic inputs at various maximal conductance values on a SC
model. Our numerical simulations show that conductance-based synaptic inputs
reduce the amplitude of SC's subthreshold oscillations for low enough value of
the maximal synaptic conductance value but amplify these oscillations at a
higher range. These results contrast with the experimental results.

Abstract
<p>Natural sound is composed of various frequencies. Although the core region of the primate auditory cortex has functionally defined sound frequency preference maps, how the map is organized in the auditory areas of the belt and parabelt regions is not well known. In this study, we investigated the functional organizations of the core, belt, and parabelt regions encompassed by the lateral sulcus and the superior temporal sulcus in the common marmoset (<i>Callithrix jacchus</i>). Using optical intrinsic signal imaging, we obtained evoked responses to band-pass noise stimuli in a range of sound frequencies (0.5–16 kHz) in anesthetized adult animals and visualized the preferred sound frequency map on the cortical surface. We characterized the functionally defined organization using histologically defined brain areas in the same animals. We found tonotopic representation of a set of sound frequencies (low to high) within the primary (A1), rostral (R), and rostrotemporal (RT) areas of the core region. In the belt region, the tonotopic representation existed only in the mediolateral (ML) area. This representation was symmetric with that found in A1 along the border between areas A1 and ML. The functional structure was not very clear in the anterolateral (AL) area. Low frequencies were mainly preferred in the rostrotemplatal (RTL) area, while high frequencies were preferred in the caudolateral (CL) area. There was a portion of the parabelt region that strongly responded to higher sound frequencies (&gt;5.8 kHz) along the border between the rostral parabelt (RPB) and caudal parabelt (CPB) regions.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0443-17.2018v1?rss=1">Sharpening of Hierarchical Visual Feature Representations of Blurred Images</a></h4>

Abstract<p>The robustness of the visual system lies in its ability to perceive degraded images. This is achieved through interacting bottom-up, recurrent, and top-down pathways that process the visual input in concordance with stored prior information. The interaction mechanism by which they integrate visual input and prior information is still enigmatic. We present a new approach using deep neural network (DNN) representation to reveal the effects of such integration on degraded visual inputs. We transformed measured human brain activity resulting from viewing blurred images to the hierarchical representation space derived from a feedforward DNN. Transformed representations were found to veer towards the original non-blurred image and away from the blurred stimulus image. This indicated deblurring or sharpening in the neural representation, and possibly in our perception. We anticipate these results will help unravel the interplay mechanism between bottom-up, recurrent, and top-down pathways, leading to more comprehensive models of vision.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> One powerful characteristic of the visual system is its ability to complement visual information for incomplete visual images. It operates by projecting information from higher visual and semantic areas of the brain into the lower and mid-level representations of the visual stimulus. We investigate the mechanism by which the human brain represents blurred visual stimuli. By decoding fMRI activity into a feedforward-only deep neural network reference space, we found that neural representations of blurred images are biased toward their corresponding deblurred images. This indicates a sharpening mechanism occurring in the visual cortex.</p>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>It has been recently found that the human dorso-central insular cortex contributes to the execution and recognition of the affective component of hand actions, most likely through modulation of the activity of the parieto-frontal circuits. While the anatomical connections between the hand representation of the insula and, the parietal and frontal regions controlling reaching/grasping actions is well assessed in the monkey, it is unknown the existence of a homolog circuit in humans. In the present study, we performed a multifiber tractography investigation to trace the tracts possibly connecting the insula to the parieto-frontal circuits by locating seeds in the parietal, premotor, and prefrontal nodes of the reaching/grasping network, in both humans and monkeys. Results showed that, in both species, the insula is connected with the cortical action execution/recognition circuit by similar white matter tracts, running in parallel to the third branch of the superior longitudinal fasciculus and the anterior segment of the arcuate fasciculus.</span>

Many neuronal circuits contain, or are influenced by, colocalized neurotransmitters, which are suggested to fine-tune circuit function. Much of our knowledge about cotransmission derives from studies in non-mammalian model systems, although a growing number of studies have provided insights into the physiological role of cotransmission in more complex mammalian circuits, including the spinal cord. Here we discuss the current picture of colocalized neurotransmitters in spinal circuits of non-mammalian and mammalian systems, as well as the progression towards understanding of their functional roles.

People with Parkinson’s disease (PD) show impaired decision-making when sensory and memory information must be combined. This recently identified impairment results from an inability to accumulate the proper amount of information needed to make a decision and appears to be independent of dopamine tone and reinforcement learning mechanisms. Although considerable work focuses on PD and decisions involving risk and reward, in this Opinion article we propose that the emerging findings in perceptual decision-making highlight the multisystem nature of PD, and that unraveling the neuronal circuits underlying perceptual decision-making impairment may help in understanding other cognitive impairments in people with PD.

Frequency-specific patterns of neural activity are increasingly interpreted as transient bursts of isolated events rather than as rhythmically sustained oscillations. This has potentially far-reaching implications for theories of how such oscillations originate and how they shape neural computations. As this debate unfolds, we explore alternative interpretations and ask how best to distinguish between them.

<p>by Joseph B. Dechery, Jason N. MacLean</p>

Visual stimuli evoke activity in visual cortical neuronal populations. Neuronal activity can be selectively modulated by particular visual stimulus parameters, such as the direction of a moving bar of light, resulting in well-defined trial averaged tuning properties. However, given any single stimulus parameter, a large number of neurons in visual cortex remain unmodulated, and the role of this untuned population is not well understood. Here, we use two-photon calcium imaging to record, in an unbiased manner, from large populations of layer 2/3 excitatory neurons in mouse primary visual cortex to describe co-varying activity on single trials in neuronal populations consisting of both tuned and untuned neurons. Specifically, we summarize pairwise covariability with an asymmetric partial correlation coefficient, allowing us to analyze the resultant population correlation structure, or functional network, with graph theory. Using the graph neighbors of a neuron, we find that the local population, including both tuned and untuned neurons, are able to predict individual neuron activity on a moment to moment basis, while also recapitulating tuning properties of tuned neurons. Variance explained in total population activity scales with the number of neurons imaged, suggesting larger sample sizes are required to fully capture local network interactions. We also find that a specific functional triplet motif in the graph results in the best predictions, suggesting a signature of informative correlations in these populations. Variance explained in total population activity scales with the number of neurons imaged, suggesting larger sample sizes are required to fully capture local network interactions. In summary, we show that unbiased sampling of the local population can explain single trial response variability as well as trial-averaged tuning properties in V1, and the ability to predict responses is tied to the occurrence of a functional triplet motif.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Ovpobr3CnkQ" width="1" />

<p>by Florian Aspart, Michiel W. H. Remme, Klaus Obermayer</p>

The rise of transcranial current stimulation (tCS) techniques have sparked an increasing interest in the effects of weak extracellular electric fields on neural activity. These fields modulate ongoing neural activity through polarization of the neuronal membrane. While the somatic polarization has been investigated experimentally, the frequency-dependent polarization of the dendritic trees in the presence of alternating (AC) fields has received little attention yet. Using a biophysically detailed model with experimentally constrained active conductances, we analyze the subthreshold response of cortical pyramidal cells to weak AC fields, as induced during tCS. We observe a strong frequency resonance around 10-20 Hz in the apical dendrites sensitivity to polarize in response to electric fields but not in the basal dendrites nor the soma. To disentangle the relative roles of the cell morphology and active and passive membrane properties in this resonance, we perform a thorough analysis using simplified models, e.g. a passive pyramidal neuron model, simple passive cables and reconstructed cell model with simplified ion channels. We attribute the origin of the resonance in the apical dendrites to (i) a locally increased sensitivity due to the morphology and to (ii) the high density of h-type channels. Our systematic study provides an improved understanding of the subthreshold response of cortical cells to weak electric fields and, importantly, allows for an improved design of tCS stimuli.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/J_BWXr6Snsg" width="1" />

<p>by Nathanaël Hozé, Sebastian Bonhoeffer, Roland Regoes</p>

Disease tolerance is a defense strategy against infections that aims at maintaining host health even at high pathogen replication or load. Tolerance mechanisms are currently intensively studied with the long-term goal of exploiting them therapeutically. Because tolerance-based treatment imposes less selective pressure on the pathogen it has been hypothesised to be “evolution-proof”. However, the primary public health goal is to reduce the incidence and mortality associated with a disease. From this perspective, tolerance-based treatment bears the risk of increasing the prevalence of the disease, which may lead to increased mortality. We assessed the promise of tolerance-based treatment strategies using mathematical models. Conventional treatment was implemented as an increased recovery rate, while tolerance-based treatment was assumed to reduce the disease-related mortality of infected hosts without affecting recovery. We investigated the endemic phase of two types of infections: acute and chronic. Additionally, we considered the effect of pathogen resistance against conventional treatment. We show that, for low coverage of tolerance-based treatment, chronic infections can cause even more deaths than without treatment. Overall, we found that conventional treatment always outperforms tolerance-based treatment, even when we allow the emergence of pathogen resistance. Our results cast doubt on the potential benefit of tolerance-based over conventional treatment. Any clinical application of tolerance-based treatment of infectious diseases has to consider the associated detrimental epidemiological feedback.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/C5jRnX8QuMo" width="1" />

Abstract
<p>The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is known to regulate cellular growth pathways, and its genetic activation is sufficient to enhance regenerative axon growth following injury to the central or peripheral nervous systems. However, excess mTORC1 activation may promote innervation defects, and mTORC1 activity mediates injury-induced hypersensitivity, reducing enthusiasm for the pathway as a therapeutic target. While mTORC1 activity is required for full expression of some pain modalities, the effects of pathway activation on nociceptor phenotypes and sensory behaviors are currently unknown. To address this, we genetically activated mTORC1 in mouse peripheral sensory neurons by conditional deletion of its negative regulator Tuberous Sclerosis Complex 2 (Tsc2). Consistent with the well-known role of mTORC1 in regulating cell size, soma size and axon diameter of C-nociceptors were increased in Tsc2-deleted mice. Glabrous skin and spinal cord innervation by C-fiber neurons were also disrupted. Transcriptional profiling of nociceptors enriched by fluorescence-associated cell sorting (FACS) revealed downregulation of multiple classes of ion channels as well as reduced expression of markers for peptidergic nociceptors in Tsc2-deleted mice. In addition to these changes in innervation and gene expression, Tsc2-deleted mice exhibited reduced noxious heat sensitivity and decreased injury-induced cold hypersensitivity, but normal baseline sensitivity to cold and mechanical stimuli. Together, these data show that excess mTORC1 activity in sensory neurons produces changes in gene expression, neuron morphology and sensory behavior.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0411-17.2018v1?rss=1">Circadian Behavioral Responses to Light and Optic Chiasm-Evoked Glutamatergic EPSCs in the Suprachiasmatic Nucleus of ipRGC Conditional vGlut2 Knockout Mice</a></h4>

Abstract<p>Intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) innervate the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), a circadian oscillator that functions as a biological clock. ipRGCs use vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (vGlut2) to package glutamate into synaptic vesicles and light-evoked resetting of the SCN circadian clock is widely attributed to ipRGC glutamatergic neurotransmission. Pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide (PACAP) is also packaged into vesicles in ipRGCs and PACAP may be co-released with glutamate in the SCN. vGlut2 has been conditionally deleted in ipRGCs in mice (cKOs) and their aberrant photoentrainment and residual attenuated light responses have been ascribed to ipRGC PACAP release. However, there is no direct evidence that all ipRGC glutamatergic neurotransmission is eliminated in vGlut2 cKOs. Here we examined two lines of ipRGC vGlut2 cKO mice for SCN-mediated behavioral responses under several lighting conditions and for ipRGC glutamatergic neurotransmission in the SCN. Circadian behavioral responses varied from a very limited response to light to near normal photoentrainment. After collecting behavioral data, hypothalamic slices were prepared and evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents (eEPSCs) were recorded from SCN neurons by stimulating the optic chiasm. In cKOs, glutamatergic eEPSCs were recorded and all eEPSC parameters examined (stimulus threshold, amplitude, rise time or time-to-peak and stimulus strength to evoke a maximal response) were similar to controls. We conclude that a variable number but functionally significant percentage of ipRGCs in two vGlut2 cKO mouse lines continue to release glutamate. Thus, the residual SCN-mediated light responses in these cKO mouse lines cannot be attributed solely to ipRGC PACAP release.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> This study examined glutamatergic signaling by intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) of mice in which vesicular glutamate transporter 2 was knocked out using Cre recombination. The results indicate that significant glutamatergic neurotransmission remains in ipRGCs of Opn4<sup>Cre/+</sup>;vGlut2<sup>loxP/loxP</sup> mice and that the ipRGC vGlut2 conditional knockout model resulted in only subtle changes in the rate of vesicular glutamate replenishment even at high stimulation frequencies. These findings are consistent with the behavioral data observed in this and previous studies. Unfortunately, the residual ipRGC glutamatergic transmission in the Opn4<sup>Cre/+</sup>;vGlut2<sup>loxP/loxP</sup> mouse model limits the usefulness of this model to examine the role of retinal peptidergic afferents to the suprachiasmatic nucleus and also suggest caution when using Opn4<sup>Cre/+</sup> mice in other Cre recombination models.</p>

Pharmacological neuromodulation strategies have shown limited efficacy in treating memory deficits related to Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Despite encouraging results from a few preclinical studies, clinical trials investigating open-loop deep brain stimulation (DBS) for AD have not been successful. Recent refinements in understanding the various phases of memory processes, animal studies investigating phase-specific modulation of hippocampal activity during memorization, and clinical studies using closed-loop DBS strategies to treat patients with movement disorders, all point to the need to investigate closed-loop fornical DBS strategies to better understand memory dynamics and potentially treat memory deficits in AD preclinical models.

<p>by Aaron T. L. Lun, Hervé Pagès, Mike L. Smith</p>

Biological experiments involving genomics or other high-throughput assays typically yield a data matrix that can be explored and analyzed using the R programming language with packages from the Bioconductor project. Improvements in the throughput of these assays have resulted in an explosion of data even from routine experiments, which poses a challenge to the existing computational infrastructure for statistical data analysis. For example, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) experiments frequently generate large matrices containing expression values for each gene in each cell, requiring sparse or file-backed representations for memory-efficient manipulation in R. These alternative representations are not easily compatible with high-performance C++ code used for computationally intensive tasks in existing R/Bioconductor packages. Here, we describe a C++ interface named <i>beachmat</i>, which enables agnostic data access from various matrix representations. This allows package developers to write efficient C++ code that is interoperable with dense, sparse and file-backed matrices, amongst others. We evaluated the performance of <i>beachmat</i> for accessing data from each matrix representation using both simulated and real scRNA-seq data, and defined a clear memory/speed trade-off to motivate the choice of an appropriate representation. We also demonstrate how beachmat can be incorporated into the code of other packages to drive analyses of a very large scRNA-seq data set.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/MHxJ8eSA7PU" width="1" />

<p>by Paul A. Roberts, Ryan M. Huebinger, Emma Keen, Anne-Marie Krachler, Sara Jabbari</p>

As the development of new classes of antibiotics slows, bacterial resistance to existing antibiotics is becoming an increasing problem. A potential solution is to develop treatment strategies with an alternative mode of action. We consider one such strategy: anti-adhesion therapy. Whereas antibiotics act directly upon bacteria, either killing them or inhibiting their growth, anti-adhesion therapy impedes the binding of bacteria to host cells. This prevents bacteria from deploying their arsenal of virulence mechanisms, while simultaneously rendering them more susceptible to natural and artificial clearance. In this paper, we consider a particular form of anti-adhesion therapy, involving biomimetic multivalent adhesion molecule 7 coupled polystyrene microbeads, which competitively inhibit the binding of bacteria to host cells. We develop a mathematical model, formulated as a system of ordinary differential equations, to describe inhibitor treatment of a <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> burn wound infection in the rat. Benchmarking our model against <i>in vivo</i> data from an ongoing experimental programme, we use the model to explain bacteria population dynamics and to predict the efficacy of a range of treatment strategies, with the aim of improving treatment outcome. The model consists of two physical compartments: the host cells and the exudate. It is found that, when effective in reducing the bacterial burden, inhibitor treatment operates both by preventing bacteria from binding to the host cells and by reducing the flux of daughter cells from the host cells into the exudate. Our model predicts that inhibitor treatment cannot eliminate the bacterial burden when used in isolation; however, when combined with regular or continuous debridement of the exudate, elimination is theoretically possible. Lastly, we present ways to improve therapeutic efficacy, as predicted by our mathematical model.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/MQif6tb7BiM" width="1" />

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/kL4dFBBuUp4/article">Identification of animal behavioral strategies by inverse reinforcement learning</a></h4>

<p>by Shoichiro Yamaguchi, Honda Naoki, Muneki Ikeda, Yuki Tsukada, Shunji Nakano, Ikue Mori, Shin Ishii</p>

Animals are able to reach a desired state in an environment by controlling various behavioral patterns. Identification of the behavioral strategy used for this control is important for understanding animals’ decision-making and is fundamental to dissect information processing done by the nervous system. However, methods for quantifying such behavioral strategies have not been fully established. In this study, we developed an inverse reinforcement-learning (IRL) framework to identify an animal’s behavioral strategy from behavioral time-series data. We applied this framework to <i>C</i>. <i>elegans</i> thermotactic behavior; after cultivation at a constant temperature with or without food, fed worms prefer, while starved worms avoid the cultivation temperature on a thermal gradient. Our IRL approach revealed that the fed worms used both the absolute temperature and its temporal derivative and that their behavior involved two strategies: directed migration (DM) and isothermal migration (IM). With DM, worms efficiently reached specific temperatures, which explains their thermotactic behavior when fed. With IM, worms moved along a constant temperature, which reflects isothermal tracking, well-observed in previous studies. In contrast to fed animals, starved worms escaped the cultivation temperature using only the absolute, but not the temporal derivative of temperature. We also investigated the neural basis underlying these strategies, by applying our method to thermosensory neuron-deficient worms. Thus, our IRL-based approach is useful in identifying animal strategies from behavioral time-series data and could be applied to a wide range of behavioral studies, including decision-making, in other organisms.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/kL4dFBBuUp4" width="1" />

<p>Mirror neurons (MNs) have the distinguishing characteristic of modulating during both execution and observation of an action. Although most studies of MNs have focused on various features of the observed movement, MNs also may monitor the behavioral circumstances in which the movement is embedded, including time periods preceding and following the observed movement. Here, we recorded multiple MNs simultaneously from implanted electrode arrays as two male monkeys executed and observed a reach, grasp, and manipulate task involving different target objects. MNs were recorded from premotor cortex (PM-MNs) and primary motor cortex (M1-MNs). During execution trials, hidden Markov models (HMMs) applied to the activity of either PM-MN or M1-MN populations most often detected sequences of four hidden states, which we named according to the behavioral epoch during which each state began: initial, reaction, movement, and final. The hidden states of MN populations thus reflected not only the movement, but also three behavioral epochs during which no movement occurred. HMMs trained on execution trials could decode similar sequences of hidden states in observation trials, with complete hidden state sequences decoded more frequently from PM-MN populations than from M1-MN populations. Moreover, population trajectories projected in a 2D plane defined by execution trials were preserved in observation trials more for PM-MN than for M1-MN populations. These results suggest that MN populations represent entire behavioral sequences, including both movement and non-movement. PM-MN populations showed greater similarity than M1-MN populations in their representation of behavioral sequences during execution versus observation.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Mirror neurons (MNs) are thought to provide a neural mechanism for understanding the actions of others. However, for an action to be understood, both the movement per se and the non-movement context before and after the movement need to be represented. We found that simultaneously recorded MN populations encoded sequential hidden neural states corresponding approximately to sequential behavioral epochs of a reach, grasp, and manipulate task. During observation trials, hidden state sequences were similar to those identified in execution trials. Hidden state similarity was stronger for MN populations in premotor cortex than for those in primary motor cortex. Execution/observation similarity of hidden state sequences may contribute to understanding the actions of others without actually performing the action oneself.</p>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) plays crucial roles in monitoring the outcome of a choice and adjusting a subsequent choice behavior based on the outcome information. In the present study, we investigated how different types of dACC neurons, that is, putative pyramidal neurons and putative inhibitory interneurons, contribute to these processes. We analyzed single-unit database obtained from the dACC in monkeys performing a reversal learning task. The monkey was required to adjust choice behavior from past outcome experiences. Depending on their action potential waveforms, the recorded neurons were classified into putative pyramidal neurons and putative inhibitory interneurons. We found that these neurons do not equally contribute to outcome monitoring and behavioral adjustment. Although both neuron types evenly responded to the current outcome, a larger proportion of putative inhibitory interneurons than putative pyramidal neurons stored the information about the past outcome. The putative inhibitory interneurons further represented choice-related signals more frequently, such as whether the monkey would shift the last choice to an alternative at the next choice opportunity. Our findings suggest that putative inhibitory interneurons, which are thought not to project to brain areas outside the dACC, preferentially transmit signals that would adjust choice behavior based on past outcome experiences.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Converging evidence from activation, connectivity, and stimulation studies suggests that auditory brain networks are lateralized. Here we show that these findings can be at least partly explained by the asymmetric network embedding of the primary auditory cortices. Using diffusion-weighted imaging in 3 independent datasets, we investigate the propensity for left and right auditory cortex to communicate with other brain areas by quantifying the centrality of the auditory network across a spectrum of communication mechanisms, from shortest path communication to diffusive spreading. Across all datasets, we find that the right auditory cortex is better integrated in the connectome, facilitating more efficient communication with other areas, with much of the asymmetry driven by differences in communication pathways to the opposite hemisphere. Critically, the primacy of the right auditory cortex emerges only when communication is conceptualized as a diffusive process, taking advantage of more than just the topologically shortest paths in the network. Altogether, these results highlight how the network configuration and embedding of a particular region may contribute to its functional lateralization.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Mirror neurons have been proposed to underlie humans’ ability to understand others’ actions and intentions. Despite 2 decades of research, however, the exact computational and neuronal mechanisms implied in this ability remain unclear. In the current study, we investigated whether, in the absence of contextual cues, regions considered to be part of the human mirror neuron system represent intention from movement kinematics. A total of 21 participants observed reach-to-grasp movements, performed with either the intention to drink or to pour while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging. Multivoxel pattern analysis revealed successful decoding of intentions from distributed patterns of activity in a network of structures comprising the inferior parietal lobule, the superior parietal lobule, the inferior frontal gyrus, and the middle frontal gyrus. Consistent with the proposal that parietal regions play a key role in intention understanding, classifier weights were higher in the inferior parietal region. These results provide the first demonstration that putative mirror neuron regions represent subtle differences in movement kinematics to read the intention of an observed motor act.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Neuropathological conditions might affect adult granulogenesis in the adult human dentate gyrus. However, radial glial cells (RGCs) have not been well characterized during human development and aging. We have previously described progenitor and neuronal layer establishment in the hippocampal pyramidal layer and dentate gyrus from embryonic life until mid-gestation. Here, we describe RGC subtypes in the hippocampus from 13 gestational weeks (GW) to mid-gestation and characterize their evolution and the dynamics of neurogenesis from mid-gestation to adulthood in normal and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) subjects. In the pyramidal ventricular zone (VZ), RGC density declined with neurogenesis from mid-gestation until the perinatal period. In the dentate area, morphologic and antigenic differences among RGCs were observed from early ages of development to adulthood. Density and proliferative capacity of dentate RGCs as well as neurogenesis were strongly reduced during childhood until 5 years, few DCX<sup>+</sup> cells are seen in adults. The dentate gyrus of both control and AD individuals showed Nestin<sup>+</sup> and/or GFAPδ<sup>+</sup> cells displaying different morphologies. In conclusion, pools of morphologically, antigenically, and topographically diverse neural progenitor cells are present in the human hippocampus from early developmental stages until adulthood, including in AD patients, while their neurogenic potential seems negligible in the adult.</span>

GGGGCC (G4C2) repeat expansion in C9ORF72 is the most common genetic cause of ALS and FTD. An important issue is how repeat RNAs and their translation products, various dipeptide repeat (DPR) proteins, cause neurodegeneration. Drosophila has been widely used to model G4C2 repeat RNA and DPR protein toxicity. Overexpression of disease molecules in flies has revealed important molecular insights. These have been validated and further explored in human neurons differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), a disease-relevant model in which expanded G4C2 repeats are expressed in their native molecular context.

Abstract
<p>The aging brain is characterized by altered dopamine signaling. The amino acid tyrosine, a catecholamine precursor, is known to improve cognitive performance in young adults, especially during high environmental demands. Tyrosine administration might also affect catecholamine transmission in the aging brain, thereby improving cognitive functioning. In healthy older adults, impairments have been demonstrated in two forms of response inhibition: reactive inhibition (outright stopping) and proactive inhibition (anticipatory response slowing) under high information load. However, no study has directly compared the effects of a catecholamine precursor on reactive and load-dependent proactive inhibition. In this study we explored the effects of tyrosine on reactive and proactive response inhibition and signal in dopaminergically innervated fronto-striatal regions. Depending on age, tyrosine might lead to beneficial or detrimental neurocognitive effects. We aimed to address these hypotheses in 24 healthy older human adults (aged 61–72 years) using fMRI in a double blind, counterbalanced, placebo-controlled, within-subject design. Across the group, tyrosine did not alter reactive or proactive inhibition behaviorally but did increase fronto-parietal proactive inhibition-related activation. When taking age into account, tyrosine affected proactive inhibition both behaviorally and neurally. Specifically, increasing age was associated with a greater detrimental effect of tyrosine compared with placebo on proactive slowing. Moreover, with increasing age, tyrosine decreased fronto-striatal and parietal proactive signal, which correlated positively with tyrosine’s effects on proactive slowing. Concluding, tyrosine negatively affected proactive response slowing and associated fronto-striatal activation in an age-dependent manner, highlighting the importance of catecholamines, perhaps particularly dopamine, for proactive response inhibition in older adults.</p>

In 2011, an intronic (G4C2)•(G2C4) expansion was shown to cause the most common forms of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). This discovery linked ALS with a clinically distinct form of dementia and a larger group of microsatellite repeat diseases, and catalyzed basic and translational research.

The parabrachial nucleus (PBN), which is located in the pons and is dissected by one of the major cerebellar output tracks, is known to relay sensory information (visceral malaise, taste, temperature, pain, itch) to forebrain structures including the thalamus, hypothalamus, and extended amygdala. The availability of mouse lines expressing Cre recombinase selectively in subsets of PBN neurons and viruses for Cre-dependent gene expression is beginning to reveal the connectivity and functions of PBN component neurons.

Efforts to parcellate the cortex into areas based on fine-scale anatomical signatures (e.g., cytoarchitectonics) date back to the early years of the last century. In the ensuing decades, rapidly growing knowledge of cortical connections encouraged neurobiologists to search for connectivity-based principles underlying the organization of the cerebral cortex. Using such an approach, Felleman and Van Essen presented, in their 1991 paper, a connectivity-based hierarchical principle dictating the relationship between cortical areas.

In 2001 Raichle and colleagues showed that, at rest, brain activity fluctuates near a metabolically active equilibrium: a ‘default mode’ of brain function. This finding broke ranks with the prevailing ‘task–rest’ dichotomy to position the brain as continuously active, balancing the deployment of resources according to current and anticipated needs.

Spinal cord repair research appeared to have run out of new ideas in the 1970s. In a 1981 paper, the Aguayo Laboratory revisited an experiment by Tello and Cajal that suggested that central nervous system (CNS) axons could regenerate into peripheral nerve grafts. Using modern axon tracing methods, David and Aguayo showed that axons from neurons in the spinal cord could regenerate for long distances within peripheral nervous system (PNS) grafts, but not back into the CNS. This proved that damaged CNS tissue is inhibitory to axon regeneration while PNS tissue is permissive.

Elevated temperature induces the heat shock (HS) response, which modulates cell proliferation, apoptosis, the immune and inflammatory responses. However, specific mechanisms linking the HS response pathways to major cellular signaling systems are not fully understood. Here we used integrated computational and experimental approaches to quantitatively analyze the crosstalk mechanisms between the HS-response and a master regulator of inflammation, cell proliferation, and apoptosis the Nuclear Factor κB (NF-κB) system. We found that populations of human osteosarcoma cells, exposed to a clinically relevant 43°C HS had an attenuated NF-κB p65 response to Tumor Necrosis Factor α (TNFα) treatment. The degree of inhibition of the NF-κB response depended on the HS exposure time. Mathematical modeling of single cells indicated that individual crosstalk mechanisms differentially encode HS-mediated NF-κB responses while being consistent with the observed population-level responses. In particular “all-or-nothing” encoding mechanisms were involved in the HS-dependent regulation of the IKK activity and IκBα phosphorylation, while others involving transport were “analogue”. In order to discriminate between these mechanisms, we used live-cell imaging of nuclear translocations of the NF-κB p65 subunit. The single cell responses exhibited “all-or-nothing” encoding. While most cells did not respond to TNFα stimulation after a 60 min HS, 27% showed responses similar to those not receiving HS. We further demonstrated experimentally and theoretically that the predicted inhibition of IKK activity was consistent with the observed HS-dependent depletion of the IKKα and IKKβ subunits in whole cell lysates. However, a combination of “all-or-nothing” crosstalk mechanisms was required to completely recapitulate the single cell data. We postulate therefore that the heterogeneity of the single cell responses might be explained by the cell-intrinsic variability of HS-modulated IKK signaling. In summary, we show that high temperature modulates NF-κB responses in single cells in a complex and unintuitive manner, which needs to be considered in hyperthermia-based treatment strategies.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/SmfXbHv2meA" width="1" />

<p>by Spencer Bliven, Aleix Lafita, Althea Parker, Guido Capitani, Jose M. Duarte</p>
A correct assessment of the quaternary structure of proteins is a fundamental prerequisite to understanding their function, physico-chemical properties and mode of interaction with other proteins. Currently about 90% of structures in the Protein Data Bank are crystal structures, in which the correct quaternary structure is embedded in the crystal lattice among a number of crystal contacts. Computational methods are required to 1) classify all protein-protein contacts in crystal lattices as biologically relevant or crystal contacts and 2) provide an assessment of how the biologically relevant interfaces combine into a biological assembly. In our previous work we addressed the first problem with our EPPIC (Evolutionary Protein Protein Interface Classifier) method. Here, we present our solution to the second problem with a new method that combines the interface classification results with symmetry and topology considerations. The new algorithm enumerates all possible valid assemblies within the crystal using a graph representation of the lattice and predicts the most probable biological unit based on the pairwise interface scoring. Our method achieves 85% precision (ranging from 76% to 90% for different oligomeric types) on a new dataset of 1,481 biological assemblies with consensus of PDB annotations. Although almost the same precision is achieved by PISA, currently the most popular quaternary structure assignment method, we show that, due to the fundamentally different approach to the problem, the two methods are complementary and could be combined to improve biological assembly assignments. The software for the automatic assessment of protein assemblies (EPPIC version 3) has been made available through a web server at http://www.eppic-web.org.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/I193wKcTvyY" width="1" />

Understanding complexity in physical, biological, social and information systems is predicated on describing interactions amongst different components. Advances in genomics are facilitating the high-throughput identification of molecular interactions, and graphs are emerging as indispensable tools in explaining how the connections in the network drive organismal phenotypic plasticity. Here, we describe the architectural organization and associated emergent topological properties of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) that describe protein-DNA interactions (PDIs) in several model eukaryotes. By analyzing GRN connectivity, our results show that the anticipated scale-free network architectures are characterized by organism-specific power law scaling exponents. These exponents are independent of the fraction of the GRN experimentally sampled, enabling prediction of properties of the complete GRN for an organism. We further demonstrate that the exponents describe inequalities in transcription factor (TF)-target gene recognition across GRNs. These observations have the important biological implication that they predict the existence of an intrinsic organism-specific <i>trans</i> and/or <i>cis</i> regulatory landscape that constrains GRN topologies. Consequently, architectural GRN organization drives not only phenotypic plasticity within a species, but is also likely implicated in species-specific phenotype.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/6xXxhGM4T7U" width="1" />

Characterising the spatio-temporal dynamics of pathogens <i>in natura</i> is key to ensuring their efficient prevention and control. However, it is notoriously difficult to estimate dispersal parameters at scales that are relevant to real epidemics. Epidemiological surveys can provide informative data, but parameter estimation can be hampered when the timing of the epidemiological events is uncertain, and in the presence of interactions between disease spread, surveillance, and control. Further complications arise from imperfect detection of disease and from the huge number of data on individual hosts arising from landscape-level surveys. Here, we present a Bayesian framework that overcomes these barriers by integrating over associated uncertainties in a model explicitly combining the processes of disease dispersal, surveillance and control. Using a novel computationally efficient approach to account for patch geometry, we demonstrate that disease dispersal distances can be estimated accurately in a patchy (i.e. fragmented) landscape when disease control is ongoing. Applying this model to data for an aphid-borne virus (<i>Plum pox virus</i>) surveyed for 15 years in 605 orchards, we obtain the first estimate of the distribution of flight distances of infectious aphids at the landscape scale. About 50% of aphid flights terminate beyond 90 m, which implies that most infectious aphids leaving a tree land outside the bounds of a 1-ha orchard. Moreover, long-distance flights are not rare–10% of flights exceed 1 km. By their impact on our quantitative understanding of winged aphid dispersal, these results can inform the design of management strategies for plant viruses, which are mainly aphid-borne.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/6RNe0Vdqjuk" width="1" />

                <h4><a href="http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0371-17.2018v1?rss=1">Attention Effects on Neural Population Representations for Shape and Location Are Stronger in the Ventral than Dorsal Stream</a></h4>

Abstract<p>We examined how attention causes neural population representations of shape and location to change in AIT (ventral stream) and LIP (dorsal stream). Monkeys performed two identical delayed-match-to-sample tasks, attending either to shape or location. In AIT, shapes were more discriminable when directing attention to shape rather than location, measured by an increase in mean distance between population response vectors. In LIP, attending to location rather than shape did not increase the discriminability of different stimulus locations. Even when factoring out the change in mean vector response distance, multidimensional scaling still showed a significant task difference in AIT, but not LIP, indicating that beyond increasing discriminability, attention also causes a nonlinear warping of representation space in AIT. Despite single-cell attentional modulations in both areas, our data show that attentional modulations of population representations are weaker in dorsal stream, likely due to a need to maintain veridical representations for visuomotor control.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Disruption of <i>attention</i> is a fundamental characteristic of many human disorders. Although much work has focused on how attention to shape and space modulates responses at a single neuron level, that has provided little insight into how these modulations translate into effects at the population level. Similar to prior findings, we show attentional modulations at the single-cell level in both ventral and dorsal cortical areas. However, we also show that attention alters population representations of both shape and space more strongly the ventral stream than in the dorsal stream. This study is a first demonstration of how attention modulates the organization of high-dimensional neurophysiological representations, findings that help link cellular attentional modulations more tightly with behavior.</p>

<p>by Kevin J. Flynn, David O. F. Skibinski, Christian Lindemann</p>

Nutrient acquisition is a critical determinant for the competitive advantage for auto- and osmohetero- trophs alike. Nutrient limited growth is commonly described on a whole cell basis through reference to a maximum growth rate (<i>G</i><sub>max</sub>) and a half-saturation constant (<i>K</i><sub>G</sub>). This empirical application of a Michaelis-Menten like description ignores the multiple underlying feedbacks between physiology contributing to growth, cell size, elemental stoichiometry and cell motion. Here we explore these relationships with reference to the kinetics of the nutrient transporter protein, the transporter rate density at the cell surface (<i>TRD</i>; potential transport rate per unit plasma-membrane area), and diffusion gradients. While the half saturation value for the limiting nutrient increases rapidly with cell size, significant mitigation is afforded by cell motion (swimming or sedimentation), and by decreasing the cellular carbon density. There is thus potential for high vacuolation and high sedimentation rates in diatoms to significantly decrease <i>K</i><sub>G</sub> and increase species competitive advantage. Our results also suggest that <i>G</i><sub>max</sub> for larger non-diatom protists may be constrained by rates of nutrient transport. For a given carbon density, cell size and <i>TRD</i>, the value of <i>G</i><sub>max</sub><i>/K</i><sub>G</sub> remains constant. This implies that species or strains with a lower <i>G</i><sub>max</sub> might coincidentally have a competitive advantage under nutrient limited conditions as they also express lower values of <i>K</i><sub>G</sub>. The ability of cells to modulate the <i>TRD</i> according to their nutritional status, and hence change the instantaneous maximum transport rate, has a very marked effect upon transport and growth kinetics. Analyses and dynamic models that do not consider such modulation will inevitably fail to properly reflect competitive advantage in nutrient acquisition. This has important implications for the accurate representation and predictive capabilities of model applications, in particular in a changing environment.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/CoNucHdd8IM" width="1" />

Abstract<p>Network hyperexcitability is a feature of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) as well as numerous transgenic mouse models of AD. While hyperexcitability in AD patients and AD animal models share certain features, the mechanistic overlap remains to be established. We aimed to identify features of network hyperexcitability in AD models that can be related to epileptiform activity signatures in AD patients. We studied network hyperexcitability in mice expressing amyloid precursor protein (APP) with mutations that cause familial AD, and compared a transgenic model that overexpresses human APP (J20), to a knock-in model expressing APP at physiological levels (APP<sup>NL/F</sup>). We recorded continuous long-term electrocorticogram activity from mice, and studied modulation by circadian cycle, behavioural, and brain state. We report that while J20s exhibit frequent inter-ictal spikes (IIS), APP<sup>NL/F</sup> mice do not. In J20 mice, IIS were most prevalent during daylight hours and the circadian modulation was associated with sleep. Further analysis of brain state revealed that IIS in J20s are associated with features of rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep. We found no evidence of cholinergic changes that may contribute to IIS-circadian coupling in J20s. In contrast to J20s, intracranial recordings capturing IIS in AD patients demonstrated frequent IIS in non-REM sleep. The salient differences in sleep-stage coupling of IIS in APP overexpressing mice and AD patients suggests that different mechanisms may underlie network hyperexcitability in mice and humans. We posit that sleep-stage coupling of IIS should be an important consideration in identifying mouse AD models that most closely recapitulate network hyperexcitability in human AD.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> It is increasingly recognized that Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is associated with hyperexcitability in brain networks. Brain network hyperexcitability is also reported in several rodent models of AD. We studied the signatures of this hyperexcitability in two rodent models of AD as well as AD patients. Network hyperexcitability was prevalent in a transgenic model of AD, but was absent in a rodent model that is considered to be more physiologic. Moreover, while network hyperexcitability was coupled to rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep in transgenic mice, hyperexcitability occurred in non-REM sleep in AD patients. We suggest that brain state coupling of hyperexcitability can be used as a method for screening animal models of AD.</p>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Ongoing internal cortical activity plays a major role in perception and behavior both in animals and humans. Previously we have shown that spontaneous patterns resembling orientation-maps appear over large cortical areas in the primary visual-cortex of anesthetized cats. However, it remains unknown 1) whether spontaneous-activity in the primate also displays similar patterns and 2) whether a significant difference exists between cortical ongoing-activity in the anesthetized and awake primate. We explored these questions by combining voltage-sensitive-dye imaging with multiunit and local-field-potential recordings. Spontaneously emerging orientation and ocular-dominance maps, spanning up to 6 × 6 mm<sup>2</sup>, were readily observed in anesthetized but not in awake monkeys. Nevertheless, spontaneous correlated-activity involving orientation-domains was observed in awake monkeys. Under both anesthetized and awake conditions, spontaneous correlated-activity coincided with traveling waves. We found that spontaneous activity resembling orientation-maps in awake animals spans smaller cortical areas in each instance, but over time it appears across all of V1. Furthermore, in the awake monkey, our results suggest that the synaptic strength had been completely reorganized including connections between dissimilar elements of the functional architecture. These findings lend support to the notion that ongoing-activity has many more fast switching representations playing an important role in cortical function and behavior.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>While it is well known that netrin-1 and its receptors UNC5 and UNC40 family members are involved in the normal establishment of the motor cortex and its corticospinal tract, less is known about its other receptor Down syndrome cell adherence molecule (DSCAM). DSCAM is expressed in the developing motor cortex, regulates axonal outgrowth of cortical neurons, and its mutation impairs the dendritic arborization of cortical neurons, thus suggesting that it might be involved in the normal development and functioning of the motor cortex. In comparison to WT littermates, DSCAM<sup>2J</sup> mutant mice slipped and misplaced their paw while walking on the rungs of a horizontal ladder, and exhibited more difficulties in stepping over an obstacle while walking at slow speed. Anterograde tracing showed a normal pyramidal decussation and corticospinal projection, but a more dorsal distribution of their axonal terminals in the spinal gray matter. Intracortical microstimulations showed a reduced corticospinal and intracortical efficacy, whereas stimulations of the pyramidal tract revealed a normal spinal efficacy and excitability of corticospinal tract axons, thus arguing for a dysfunctional cortical development. Our study reveals impairment of the network dynamics within the motor cortex, reducing corticospinal drive and impairing voluntary locomotor functions upon DSCAM<sup>2J</sup> mutation.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Progress in neurodevelopmental brain research has been achieved through the use of animal models. Such models not only help understanding biological changes that govern brain development, maturation and aging, but are also essential for identifying possible mechanisms of neurodevelopmental and age-related chronic disorders, and to evaluate possible interventions with potential relevance to human disease. Genetic relationship of rhesus monkeys to humans makes those animals a great candidate for such models. With the typical lifespan of 25 years, they undergo cognitive maturation and aging that is similar to this observed in humans. Quantitative structural neuroimaging has been proposed as one of the candidate in vivo biomarkers for tracking white matter brain maturation and aging. While lifespan trajectories of white matter changes have been mapped in humans, such knowledge is not available for nonhuman primates. Here, we analyze and model lifespan trajectories of white matter microstructure using in vivo diffusion imaging in a sample of 44 rhesus monkeys. We report quantitative parameters (including slopes and peaks) of lifespan trajectories for 8 individual white matter tracts. We show different trajectories for cellular and extracellular microstructural imaging components that are associated with white matter maturation and aging, and discuss similarities and differences between those in humans and rhesus monkeys, the importance of our findings, and future directions for the field.Significance Statement: Quantitative structural neuroimaging has been proposed as one of the candidate in vivo biomarkers for tracking brain maturation and aging. While lifespan trajectories of structural white matter changes have been mapped in humans, such knowledge is not available for rhesus monkeys. We present here results of the analysis and modeling of the lifespan trajectories of white matter microstructure using in vivo diffusion imaging in a sample of 44 rhesus monkeys (age 4–27). We report and anatomically map lifespan changes related to cellular and extracellular microstructural components that are associated with white matter maturation and aging.</span>
