     alt="Identification and characterization of rostral ventromedial medulla neurons synaptically connected to the urinary bladder afferents in female rats with or without neonatal cystitis"/>
<p>Talluri et al identified and characterized rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM) neurons that are synaptically linked to the bladder and the colon and studied the effect of early life bladder inflammation on molecular expressions of these neurons. They demonstrated alterations of synaptic connectivity and GABAergic/serotonergic expressions in bladder-related RVM neurons in rats with neonatal cystitis.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The neurons in the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM) play a major role in pain modulation. We have previously shown that early-life noxious bladder stimuli in rats resulted in an overall spinal GABAergic disinhibition and a long-lasting bladder/colon sensitization when tested in adulthood. However, the neuromolecular alterations within RVM neurons in the pathophysiology of early life bladder inflammation have not been elucidated. In this study, we have identified and characterized RVM neurons that are synaptically linked to the bladder and colon and examined the effect of neonatal bladder inflammation on molecular expressions of these neurons. A transient bladder inflammation was induced by intravesicular instillation of protamine sulfate and zymosan during postnatal days 14 through 16 (P14–16) followed by pseudorabies virus PRV-152 and PRV-614 injections into the bladder and colon, respectively, on postnatal day P60. Tissues were examined 96 h postinoculation for serotonergic, GABAergic, and enkephalinergic expressions using in situ hybridization and/or immunohistochemistry techniques. The results revealed that &gt; 50% of RVM neurons that are synaptically connected to the bladder (i.e., PRV-152+) were GABAergic, 40% enkephalinergic, and about 14% expressing serotonergic marker tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (TpH2). Neonatal cystitis resulted in a significant increase in converging neurons in RVM receiving dual synaptic inputs from the bladder and colon. In addition, neonatal cystitis significantly downregulated vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT) with a concomitant increase in TpH2 expression in bladder-linked RVM neurons, suggesting an alteration in supraspinal signaling. These alterations of synaptic connectivity and GABAergic/serotonergic expressions in RVM neurons may contribute to bladder pain modulation and cross-organ visceral sensitivity.</p>

	<p>The diagnosis of mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) is challenging in the acute setting because the symptoms are nonspecific and often transient, or they develop with a delay. In these cases, the criteria for acute head imaging are frequently not fulfilled. This may lead to missed diagnoses in emergency care. There is a need for developing a rapid diagnostic test to verify the presence of TBI using body fluids. Blood, urine, and saliva samples from 11 adult patients (mean age 64 years, SD 24 years) with acute and clinically diagnosed TBI, and 12 healthy volunteers were collected at Turku University Hospital during a period of 5 months. The injuries necessitated hospitalization for at least one day. The TBIs were classified mild in nine cases and severe in two cases. The mean period between the trauma and the time for obtaining the samples was 27 h, SD 11 h. The samples were analyzed in an ISO-certified laboratory for the number of lectin-bound glycan molecules indicating destruction of nerve tissue. The screening was performed on several possible glycans for binding, and the measurement by degree of fluorescence. In the analysis, the group of patients with TBI was compared with healthy volunteers. The results showed a significant decrease (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05, Wilcoxon rank–sum two-sided test) in the level of two glycans in plasma, but no significant increase for any glycan; in saliva, one glycan showed a significant increase in the TBI group; in urine, three glycans were significantly different between the groups (one showed an increase, whereas two showed a decrease). The results support the idea of conducting more research on how diagnostic glycans could be detected in body fluids after TBI. As a proof-of-concept, significant changes in the concentration of five glycans were found in plasma, saliva, and urine between TBI patients and healthy controls. This may enable the development of a rapid body fluid-based point-of-care test to identify patients with TBI after a head injury.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The imbalance between glutamate and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) results in the loss of synaptic strength leading to neurodegeneration. The dogma on the field considered neurons as the main players in this excitation-inhibition (E/I) balance. However, current strategies focusing only on neurons have failed to completely understand this condition, bringing up the importance of glia as an alternative modulator for neuroinflammation as glia alter the activity of neurons and is a source of both neurotrophic and neurotoxic factors. This review's primary goal is to illustrate the role of glia over E/I balance in the central nervous system and its interaction with neurons. Rather than focusing only on the neuronal targets, we take a deeper look at glial receptors and proteins that could also be explored as drug targets, as they are early responders to neurotoxic insults. This review summarizes the neuron–glia interaction concerning GABA and glutamate, possible targets, and its involvement in the E/I imbalance in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and multiple sclerosis.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">A Model of the CA1 Field Rhythms</a></h4>

              
                <p>We propose a model of the main rhythms in the hippocampal CA1 field: theta rhythm; slow, middle, and fast gamma rhythms; and ripple oscillations. We have based this on data obtained from animals behaving freely. We have considered the modes of neuronal discharges and the occurrence of local field potential oscillations in the theta and non-theta states at different inputs from the CA3 field, the medial entorhinal cortex, and the medial septum. In our work, we tried to reproduce the main experimental phenomena about rhythms in the CA1 field: the coupling of neurons to the phase of rhythms, cross-rhythm phase&ndash;phase coupling, and phase&ndash;amplitude coupling. Using computational experiments, we have proved the hypothesis that the descending phase of the theta rhythm in the CA1 field is formed by the input from the CA3 field via the Shaffer collaterals, and the ascending phase of the theta rhythm is formed by the IPSPs from CCK basket cells. The slow gamma rhythm is coupled to the descending phase of the theta rhythm, since it also depends on the arrival of the signal via the Shaffer collaterals. The middle gamma rhythm is formed by the EPSPs of the principal neurons of the third layer of the entorhinal cortex, corresponds to experimental data. We were able to unite in a single mathematical model several theoretical ideas about the mechanisms of rhythmic processes in the CA1 field of the hippocampus.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">HR practices and turnover intention; the mediating role of organizational commitment in Tehran: a cross-sectional study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Employees are increasingly being recognised as a valuable source of information, especially in knowledge-based businesses. Businesses, however, suffer financial and organisational memory losses related to re-hiring and training new staff, and lost productivity and intellectual property because of employee turnover. Hence, employee turnover should be considered an essential part of human resource management. Furthermore, employees’ trust in management and human resource (HR) practices substantially impact organisational commitment (OC). Thus, anticipating employee commitment and turnover intentions is crucial, as people are the sole source for knowledge-based firms to maintain their competitive advantage. In the context of selected Tehran Renewable Energy (RE) firms, this study investigated the mediating impact of OC on the relationship between HR practices (recruitment and selection; training and development opportunities; performance appraisal and evaluation; teamwork; compensation and pay; and job security) and employee turnover intention. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study in Tehran that involved 90 experts and knowledgeable employees from four of Tehran's top RE businesses. A questionnaire was distributed to collect data which was later analysed with correlation, regression and bootstrapping analyses. Results: All six dimensions of HR practices were discovered to have an indirect impact on turnover intention and a direct impact on OC. OC among employees has an indirect effect on turnover intention. It was also revealed that the training and development opportunity has the most considerable effect on OC and turnover intention. OC was not found as a mediator between HR practices and turnover intention. Conclusions: The outcomes of this study showed that both training and development opportunities; and pay and compensation structure were found to be two significant components of HR practices in the relationship with OC. RE managers should employ appropriate HR strategies, particularly in these two dimensions, to improve an individual's degree of OC and reduce turnover intention.

                Background: Photodynamic therapy activity against different biological systems has been reported for porphyrins. Porphyrin modifications through peripheral groups and/or by metal insertion inside the ring are main alternatives for the improvement of its photo-physical properties. In this study, we synthesized and characterized 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-bromophenyl)porphyrin and the dicloro-5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-bromophenyl)porphyrinato Sn(IV). Methods: Metal-free porphyrin was synthesized using the Alder method, while the Sn(IV)-porphyrin complex was prepared by combining metal-free porphyrin with stannous chloride in DMF; the reaction yields were 47% and 64% respectively. Metal-free porphyrin was characterized by UV-Vis, FT-IR, ESI-mass spectrometry and 13C-NMR. Additionally, the Sn(IV) -porphyrin complex was characterized using UV-Vis and FT-IR. Cyclic voltammetry tests in four different solvents. The fluorescence quantum yield (Φf) was measured using fluorescein as a standard, the singlet oxygen quantum yield (ΦD) was estimated using the standard 5,10,15,20-(tetraphenyl)porphyrin (H2TPP) and the quencher of singlet oxygen 1,3-diphenylisobenzofuran (DPBF). Results: UV-Vis assay showed typical Q and Soret bands for porphyrin and its metallo-porphyrin complex. Compounds showed photoluminescence at the visible range of electromagnetic spectrum. The inclusion of the metal in the porphyrin core changed the Φf from 0.15 to 0.05 and the ΦD increased from 0.55 to 0.59. Finally, the effect of the compounds on the viability of L. panamensis was evaluated by means of the MTT test. The results showed that both compounds decreased the viability of the parasite; this inhibitory activity was greater under light irradiation; the porphyrin compound had IC50 of 16.5 μM and the Sn(IV)-porphyrin complex had IC50 of 19.2 μM. Conclusion: The compounds were synthesized efficiently, their characterization was carried out by different spectroscopy techniques and their own signals were evidenced for both structures, both compounds decreased the cell viability of L. panamensis.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">ELIXIR and Toxicology: a community in development [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Toxicology has been an active research field for many decades, with academic, industrial and government involvement. Modern omics and computational approaches are changing the field, from merely disease-specific observational models into target-specific predictive models. Traditionally, toxicology has strong links with other fields such as biology, chemistry, pharmacology and medicine. With the rise of synthetic and new engineered materials, alongside ongoing prioritisation needs in chemical risk assessment for existing chemicals, early predictive evaluations are becoming of utmost importance to both scientific and regulatory purposes. ELIXIR is an intergovernmental organisation that brings together life science resources from across Europe. To coordinate the linkage of various life science efforts around modern predictive toxicology, the establishment of a new ELIXIR Community is seen as instrumental. In the past few years, joint efforts, building on incidental overlap, have been piloted in the context of ELIXIR. For example, the EU-ToxRisk, diXa, HeCaToS, transQST, and the nanotoxicology community have worked with the ELIXIR TeSS, Bioschemas, and Compute Platforms and activities. In 2018, a core group of interested parties wrote a proposal, outlining a sketch of what this new ELIXIR Toxicology Community would look like. A recent workshop (held September 30th to October 1st, 2020) extended this into an ELIXIR Toxicology roadmap and a shortlist of limited investment-high gain collaborations to give body to this new community. This Whitepaper outlines the results of these efforts and defines our vision of the ELIXIR Toxicology Community and how it complements other ELIXIR activities.

                Background: Biochar is a promising material in mitigating greenhouse gases (GHGs) emissions from paddy fields due to its remarkable structural properties. Rice husk biochar (RhB) and melaleuca biochar (MB) are amendment materials that could be used to potentially reduce emissions in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta (VMD). However, their effects on CH4 and N2O emissions and soil under local water management and conventional rice cultivation have not been thoroughly investigated. Methods: We conducted a field experiment using biochar additions to the topsoil layer (0-20 cm). Five treatments comprising 0 t ha-1 (CT0); 5 t ha-1 (RhB5) and 10 t ha-1 (RhB10), and 5 t ha-1 (MB5) and 10 t ha-1 (MB10) were designed plot-by-plot (20 m2) in triplicates. Results: The results showed that biochar application from 5 to 10 t ha-1 significantly decreased cumulative CH4 (24.2 – 28.0%, RhB; 22.0 – 14.1%, MB) and N2O (25.6 – 41.0%, RhB; 38.4 – 56.4%, MB) fluxes without a reduction in grain yield. Increasing the biochar application rate further did not decrease significantly total CH4 and N2O fluxes but was seen to significantly reduce the global warming potential (GWP) and yield-scale GWP in the RhB treatments. Biochar application improved soil Eh but had no effects on soil pH. Whereas CH4 flux correlated negatively with soil Eh (P < 0.001; r2 = 0.552, RhB; P < 0.001; r2 = 0.502, MB). The soil physicochemical properties of bulk density, porosity, organic matter, and anaerobically mineralized N were significantly improved in biochar-amended treatments, while available P also slightly increased. Conclusions: Biochar supplementation significantly reduced CH4 and N2O fluxes and improved soil mineralization and physiochemical properties toward beneficial for rice plant. The results suggest that the optimal combination of biochar-application rates and effective water-irrigation techniques for soil types in the MD should be further studied in future works.

                We describe a web and standalone Shiny app for calculating the common, linear within-individual association for repeated assessments of paired measures with multiple individuals: repeated measures correlation (rmcorr). This tool makes rmcorr more widely accessible, providing a graphical interface for performing and visualizing the output of analysis with rmcorr. In contrast to rmcorr, most widely used correlation techniques assume paired data are independent. Incorrectly analyzing repeated measures data as independent will likely produce misleading results.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Discrimination of the SARS–CoV-2 strains using of coloured s-LASCA-imaging of GB-speckles, developed for the gene “S” nucleotide sequences [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: A recent bioinformatics technique involves changing nucleotide sequences into 2D speckles. This technique produces speckles called GB-speckles (Gene Based speckles). All classical strategies of speckle-optics, namely speckle-interferometry, subtraction of speckle-images as well as speckle-correlometry have been inferred for processing of GB-speckles. This indicates the considerable improvement in the present tools of bioinformatics.   Methods: Colour s-LASCA imaging of virtual laser GB-speckles, a new method of high discrimination and typing of pathogenic viruses, has been developed. This method has been adapted to the detecting of natural mutations in nucleotide sequences, related to the spike glycoprotein (coding the gene «S») of SARS–CoV-2 gene as the molecular target.    Results: The rate of the colouring images of virtual laser GB-speckles generated by s-LASCA can be described by the specific value of R. If the nucleotide sequences compared utilizing this approach the relevant images are completely identical, then the three components of the resulting colour image will be identical, and therefore the value of R will be equal to zero. However, if there are at least minimal differences in the matched nucleotide sequences, then the value of R will be positive.    Conclusion: The high effectiveness of an application of the colour images of GB-speckles that were generated by s-LASCA- has been demonstrated for discrimination between different variants of the SARS–CoV-2 spike glycoprotein gene.

                Big data is transforming many sectors, with far-reaching consequences to how decisions are made and how knowledge is produced and shared. In the current move toward more data-led decisions and data-intensive science, we aim here to examine three issues that are changing the way data are read and used. First, there is a shift toward paradigms that involve a large amount of data. In such paradigms, the creation of complex data-led models becomes tractable and appealing to generate predictions and explanations. This necessitates for instance a rethinking of Occam's razor principle in the context of knowledge discovery. Second, there is a growing erosion of the human role in decision making and knowledge discovery processes. Human users’ involvement is decreasing at an alarming rate, with no say on how to read, process, and summarize data. This makes legal responsibility and accountability hard to define. Third, thanks to its increasing popularity, big data is gaining a seductive allure, where volume and complexity of big data can de facto confer more persuasion and significance to knowledge or decisions that result from big-data-based processes. These issues call for an active human role by creating opportunities to incorporate, in the most unbiased way, human expertise and prior knowledge in decision making and knowledge production. This also requires putting in place robust monitoring and appraisal mechanisms to ensure that relevant data is answering the right questions. As the proliferation of data continues to grow, we need to rethink the way we interact with data to serve human needs.

                A large part of governmental research funding is currently distributed through the peer review of project proposals. In this paper, we argue that such funding systems incentivize and even force researchers to violate five moral values, each of which is central to commonly used scientific codes of conduct. Our argument complements existing epistemic arguments against peer-review project funding systems and, accordingly, strengthens the mounting calls for reform of these systems.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">PlotXpress, a webtool for normalization and visualization of reporter expression data [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                In molecular cell biology, reporter assays are frequently used to investigate gene expression levels. Reporter assays employ a gene that encodes a light-emitting protein, of which the luminescence is quantified as a proxy of gene expression. Commercial parties provide reporter assay kits that include protocols and specialized detection machinery. However, downstream analysis of the output data and their presentation are not standardized. We have developed plotXpress to fill this gap, providing a free, open-source platform for the semi-automated analysis and standardized visualisation of experimental gene reporter data. Users can upload raw luminescence data acquired from a reporter gene assay with an internal control. In plotXpress, the data is corrected for sample variation with the internal control and the average for each condition is calculated. When a reference condition is selected the fold change is calculated for all other conditions, based on the selected reference. The results are shown as dot plots with a statistical summary, which can be adjusted to create publication-grade plots without requiring coding skills. Altogether, plotXpress is an open-source, low-threshold, web-based tool, that promotes a standardized and reproducible analysis while providing an appealing visualization of reporter data. The webtool can be accessed at: https://huygens.science.uva.nl/PlotXpress/

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Determinants of maternal healthcare service utilisation among Indonesian mothers: A population-based study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: In Indonesia, maternal health care services are widely available, aiming to improve health and survival among mothers. However, these services remain underutilised, and its determining factor was unknown. This study sought to identify determinant factors of maternal healthcare services utilisation among Indonesian mothers. Methods: This population-based cross-sectional study leveraged the 2017 Indonesia Demographic and Health Survey data. A total of 12,033 mothers aged from 15 to 49 years who had a live birth in the five years preceding the survey were included in the analysis. Multivariable logistic regressions were used to identify the determinant factors. Results: Approximately 93.44% of the mothers had adequate antenatal care, 83.73% had a delivery at the healthcare facility, and 71.46% received postnatal care. The mother’s age and household wealth index were the typical determinants of all maternal healthcare services. Determinants of antenatal care visits were husband’s occupational status, the number of children, and access to the healthcare facility. Next, factors that drive mothers’ delivery at the healthcare facility were the mother’s education level, husband’s educational level, and residential area. The use of postnatal care was determined by the mother’s occupational status, husband’s educational level, number of children, wealth index, access to the healthcare facility, and residential area. Conclusions: Although there were differences in the determinant factors of three key maternal healthcare services, the mother’s age and household wealth index were the typical determinants of all maternal healthcare services utilisation. Providing a tailored programme aligned with these determinant factors may ensure that mothers can access and adequately utilise maternal healthcare services.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">The role of competition versus cooperation in microbial community coalescence</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Pablo Lechón-Alonso, Tom Clegg, Jacob Cook, Thomas P. Smith, Samraat Pawar</p>

New microbial communities often arise through the mixing of two or more separately assembled parent communities, a phenomenon that has been termed “community coalescence”. Understanding how the interaction structures of complex parent communities determine the outcomes of coalescence events is an important challenge. While recent work has begun to elucidate the role of competition in coalescence, that of cooperation, a key interaction type commonly seen in microbial communities, is still largely unknown. Here, using a general consumer-resource model, we study the combined effects of competitive and cooperative interactions on the outcomes of coalescence events. To do so, we simulate coalescence events between pairs of communities with different degrees of competition for shared carbon resources and cooperation through cross-feeding on leaked metabolic by-products (facilitation). We also study how structural and functional properties of post-coalescence communities evolve when they are subjected to repeated coalescence events. We find that in coalescence events, the less competitive and more cooperative parent communities contribute a higher proportion of species to the new community because this endows superior ability to deplete resources and resist invasions. Consequently, when a community is subjected to repeated coalescence events, it gradually evolves towards being less competitive and more cooperative, as well as more speciose, robust and efficient in resource use. Encounters between microbial communities are becoming increasingly frequent as a result of anthropogenic environmental change, and there is great interest in how the coalescence of microbial communities affects environmental and human health. Our study provides new insights into the mechanisms behind microbial community coalescence, and a framework to predict outcomes based on the interaction structures of parent communities.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">RESCRIPt: Reproducible sequence taxonomy reference database management</a></h4>

Nucleotide sequence and taxonomy reference databases are critical resources for widespread applications including marker-gene and metagenome sequencing for microbiome analysis, diet metabarcoding, and environmental DNA (eDNA) surveys. Reproducibly generating, managing, using, and evaluating nucleotide sequence and taxonomy reference databases creates a significant bottleneck for researchers aiming to generate custom sequence databases. Furthermore, database composition drastically influences results, and lack of standardization limits cross-study comparisons. To address these challenges, we developed RESCRIPt, a Python 3 software package and QIIME 2 plugin for reproducible generation and management of reference sequence taxonomy databases, including dedicated functions that streamline creating databases from popular sources, and functions for evaluating, comparing, and interactively exploring qualitative and quantitative characteristics across reference databases. To highlight the breadth and capabilities of RESCRIPt, we provide several examples for working with popular databases for microbiome profiling (SILVA, Greengenes, NCBI-RefSeq, GTDB), eDNA and diet metabarcoding surveys (BOLD, GenBank), as well as for genome comparison. We show that bigger is not always better, and reference databases with standardized taxonomies and those that focus on type strains have quantitative advantages, though may not be appropriate for all use cases. Most databases appear to benefit from some curation (quality filtering), though sequence clustering appears detrimental to database quality. Finally, we demonstrate the breadth and extensibility of RESCRIPt for reproducible workflows with a comparison of global hepatitis genomes. RESCRIPt provides tools to democratize the process of reference database acquisition and management, enabling researchers to reproducibly and transparently create reference materials for diverse research applications. RESCRIPt is released under a permissive BSD-3 license at https://github.com/bokulich-lab/RESCRIPt.

                <p>by Yipei Guo, Mor Nitzan, Michael P. Brenner</p>

Advances in genetic engineering technologies have allowed the construction of artificial genetic circuits, which have been used to generate spatial patterns of differential gene expression. However, the question of how cells can be programmed, and how complex the rules need to be, to achieve a desired tissue morphology has received less attention. Here, we address these questions by developing a mathematical model to study how cells can collectively grow into clusters with different structural morphologies by secreting diffusible signals that can influence cellular growth rates. We formulate how growth regulators can be used to control the formation of cellular protrusions and how the range of achievable structures scales with the number of distinct signals. We show that a single growth inhibitor is insufficient for the formation of multiple protrusions but may be achieved with multiple growth inhibitors, and that other types of signals can regulate the shape of protrusion tips. These examples illustrate how our approach could potentially be used to guide the design of regulatory circuits for achieving a desired target structure.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">More pests but less pesticide applications: Ambivalent effect of landscape complexity on conservation biological control</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Patrizia Zamberletti, Khadija Sabir, Thomas Opitz, Olivier Bonnefon, Edith Gabriel, Julien Papaïx</p>

In agricultural landscapes, the amount and organization of crops and semi-natural habitats (SNH) have the potential to promote a bundle of ecosystem services due to their influence on ecological community at multiple spatio-temporal scales. SNH are relatively undisturbed and are often source of complementary resources and refuges, therefore supporting more diverse and abundant natural pest enemies. However, the nexus of SNH proportion and organization with pest suppression is not trivial. It is thus crucial to understand how the behavior of pest and natural enemy species, the underlying landscape structure, and their interaction, may influence conservation biological control (CBC). Here, we develop a generative stochastic landscape model to simulate realistic agricultural landscape compositions and configurations of fields and linear elements. Generated landscapes are used as spatial support over which we simulate a spatially explicit predator-prey dynamic model. We find that increased SNH presence boosts predator populations by sustaining high predator density that regulates and keeps pest density below the pesticide application threshold. However, predator presence over all the landscape helps to stabilize the pest population by keeping it under this threshold, which tends to increase pest density at the landscape scale. In addition, the joint effect of SNH presence and predator dispersal ability among hedge and field interface results in a stronger pest regulation, which also limits pest growth. Considering properties of both fields and linear elements, such as local structure and geometric features, provides deeper insights for pest regulation; for example, hedge presence at crop field boundaries clearly strengthens CBC. Our results highlight that the integration of species behaviors and traits with landscape structure at multiple scales is necessary to provide useful insights for CBC.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Computational redesign of a fluorogen activating protein with Rosetta</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Nina G. Bozhanova, Joel M. Harp, Brian J. Bender, Alexey S. Gavrikov, Dmitry A. Gorbachev, Mikhail S. Baranov, Christina B. Mercado, Xuan Zhang, Konstantin A. Lukyanov, Alexander S. Mishin, Jens Meiler</p>

The use of unnatural fluorogenic molecules widely expands the pallet of available genetically encoded fluorescent imaging tools through the design of fluorogen activating proteins (FAPs). While there is already a handful of such probes available, each of them went through laborious cycles of <i>in vitro</i> screening and selection. Computational modeling approaches are evolving incredibly fast right now and are demonstrating great results in many applications, including <i>de novo</i> protein design. It suggests that the easier task of fine-tuning the fluorogen-binding properties of an already functional protein <i>in silico</i> should be readily achievable. To test this hypothesis, we used Rosetta for computational ligand docking followed by protein binding pocket redesign to further improve the previously described FAP DiB1 that is capable of binding to a BODIPY-like dye M739. Despite an inaccurate initial docking of the chromophore, the incorporated mutations nevertheless improved multiple photophysical parameters as well as the overall performance of the tag. The designed protein, DiB-RM, shows higher brightness, localization precision, and apparent photostability in protein-PAINT super-resolution imaging compared to its parental variant DiB1. Moreover, DiB-RM can be cleaved to obtain an efficient split system with enhanced performance compared to a parental DiB-split system. The possible reasons for the inaccurate ligand binding pose prediction and its consequence on the outcome of the design experiment are further discussed.

In order to enable gene deletion simulations and integration of gene expression data, these networks must include gene-protein-reaction (GPR) rules, which describe with a Boolean logic relationships between the gene products (e.g., enzyme isoforms or subunits) associated with the catalysis of a given reaction. Nevertheless, the reconstruction of GPRs still remains a largely manual and time consuming process. Aiming at fully automating the reconstruction process of GPRs for any organism, we propose the open-source python-based framework GPRuler. By mining text and data from 9 different biological databases, GPRuler can reconstruct GPRs starting either from just the name of the target organism or from an existing metabolic model. The performance of the developed tool is evaluated at small-scale level for a manually curated metabolic model, and at genome-scale level for three metabolic models related to <i>Homo sapiens</i> and <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> organisms. By exploiting these models as benchmarks, the proposed tool shown its ability to reproduce the original GPR rules with a high level of accuracy. In all the tested scenarios, after a manual investigation of the mismatches between the rules proposed by GPRuler and the original ones, the proposed approach revealed to be in many cases more accurate than the original models. By complementing existing tools for metabolic network reconstruction with the possibility to reconstruct GPRs quickly and with a few resources, GPRuler paves the way to the study of context-specific metabolic networks, representing the active portion of the complete network in given conditions, for organisms of industrial or biomedical interest that have not been characterized metabolically yet.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">The Impact of the HydroxyMethylCytosine epigenetic signature on DNA structure and function</a></h4>

We present a comprehensive, experimental and theoretical study of the impact of 5-hydroxymethylation of DNA cytosine. Using molecular dynamics, biophysical experiments and NMR spectroscopy, we found that Ten-Eleven translocation (TET) dioxygenases generate an epigenetic variant with structural and physical properties similar to those of 5-methylcytosine. Experiments and simulations demonstrate that 5-methylcytosine (mC) and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (hmC) generally lead to stiffer DNA than normal cytosine, with poorer circularization efficiencies and lower ability to form nucleosomes. In particular, we can rule out the hypothesis that hydroxymethylation reverts to unmodified cytosine physical properties, as hmC is even more rigid than mC. Thus, we do not expect dramatic changes in the chromatin structure induced by differences in physical properties between d(mCpG) and d(hmCpG). Conversely, our simulations suggest that methylated-DNA binding domains (MBDs), associated with repression activities, are sensitive to the substitution d(mCpG) ➔ d(hmCpG), while MBD3 which has a dual activation/repression activity is not sensitive to the d(mCpG) d(hmCpG) change. Overall, while gene activity changes due to cytosine methylation are the result of the combination of stiffness-related chromatin reorganization and MBD binding, those associated to 5-hydroxylation of methylcytosine could be explained by a change in the balance of repression/activation pathways related to differential MBD binding.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Atypically larger variability of resource allocation accounts for visual working memory deficits in schizophrenia</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yi-Jie Zhao, Tianye Ma, Li Zhang, Xuemei Ran, Ru-Yuan Zhang, Yixuan Ku</p>

Working memory (WM) deficits have been widely documented in schizophrenia (SZ), and almost all existing studies attributed the deficits to decreased capacity as compared to healthy control (HC) subjects. Recent developments in WM research suggest that other components, such as precision, also mediate behavioral performance. It remains unclear how different WM components jointly contribute to deficits in schizophrenia. We measured the performance of 60 SZ (31 females) and 61 HC (29 females) in a classical delay-estimation visual working memory (VWM) task and evaluated several influential computational models proposed in basic science of VWM to disentangle the effect of various memory components. We show that the model assuming variable precision (VP) across items and trials is the best model to explain the performance of both groups. According to the VP model, SZ exhibited abnormally larger variability of allocating memory resources rather than resources or capacity <i>per se</i>. Finally, individual differences in the resource allocation variability predicted variation of symptom severity in PSZ, highlighting its functional relevance to schizophrenic pathology. This finding was further verified using distinct visual features and subject cohorts. These results provide an alternative view instead of the widely accepted decreased-capacity theory and highlight the key role of elevated resource allocation variability in generating atypical VWM behavior in schizophrenia. Our findings also shed new light on the utility of Bayesian observer models to characterize mechanisms of mental deficits in clinical neuroscience.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Comparison of metabolic states using genome-scale metabolic models</a></h4>

Genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) are comprehensive knowledge bases of cellular metabolism and serve as mathematical tools for studying biological phenotypes and metabolic states or conditions in various organisms and cell types. Given the sheer size and complexity of human metabolism, selecting parameters for existing analysis methods such as metabolic objective functions and model constraints is not straightforward in human GEMs. In particular, comparing several conditions in large GEMs to identify condition- or disease-specific metabolic features is challenging. In this study, we showcase a scalable, model-driven approach for an in-depth investigation and comparison of metabolic states in large GEMs which enables identifying the underlying functional differences. Using a combination of flux space sampling and network analysis, our approach enables extraction and visualisation of metabolically distinct network modules. Importantly, it does not rely on known or assumed objective functions. We apply this novel approach to extract the biochemical differences in adipocytes arising due to unlimited vs blocked uptake of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs, considered as biomarkers in obesity) using a human adipocyte GEM (iAdipocytes1809). The biological significance of our approach is corroborated by literature reports confirming our identified metabolic processes (TCA cycle and Fatty acid metabolism) to be functionally related to BCAA metabolism. Additionally, our analysis predicts a specific altered uptake and secretion profile indicating a compensation for the unavailability of BCAAs. Taken together, our approach facilitates determining functional differences between any metabolic conditions of interest by offering a versatile platform for analysing and comparing flux spaces of large metabolic networks.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Self-organization of a doubly asynchronous irregular network state for spikes and bursts</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Filip Vercruysse, Richard Naud, Henning Sprekeler</p>

Cortical pyramidal cells (PCs) have a specialized dendritic mechanism for the generation of bursts, suggesting that these events play a special role in cortical information processing. <i>In vivo</i>, bursts occur at a low, but consistent rate. Theory suggests that this network state increases the amount of information they convey. However, because burst activity relies on a threshold mechanism, it is rather sensitive to dendritic input levels. In spiking network models, network states in which bursts occur rarely are therefore typically not robust, but require fine-tuning. Here, we show that this issue can be solved by a homeostatic inhibitory plasticity rule in dendrite-targeting interneurons that is consistent with experimental data. The suggested learning rule can be combined with other forms of inhibitory plasticity to self-organize a network state in which both spikes and bursts occur asynchronously and irregularly at low rate. Finally, we show that this network state creates the network conditions for a recently suggested multiplexed code and thereby indeed increases the amount of information encoded in bursts.

Martínez-Navarro, Isabel Cabas, Idoya Martínez-Vicente, Joy Armistead, Julia Hatzold, Azucena López-Muñoz, Teresa Martínez-Menchón, Raúl Corbalán-Vélez, Jesús Lacal, Matthias Hammerschmidt, José C.

Several studies have revealed a correlation between chronic inflammation and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD<sup>+</sup>) metabolism, but the precise mechanism involved is unknown. Here, we report that the genetic and pharmacological inhibition of nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (Nampt), the rate-limiting enzyme in the salvage pathway of NAD<sup>+</sup> biosynthesis, reduced oxidative stress, inflammation, and keratinocyte DNA damage, hyperproliferation, and cell death in zebrafish models of chronic skin inflammation, while all these effects were reversed by NAD<sup>+</sup> supplementation. Similarly, genetic and pharmacological inhibition of poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) polymerase 1 (Parp1), overexpression of PAR glycohydrolase, inhibition of apoptosis-inducing factor 1, inhibition of NADPH oxidases, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging all phenocopied the effects of Nampt inhibition. Pharmacological inhibition of NADPH oxidases/NAMPT/PARP/AIFM1 axis decreased the expression of pathology-associated genes in human organotypic 3D skin models of psoriasis. Consistently, an aberrant induction of NAMPT and PARP activity, together with AIFM1 nuclear translocation, was observed in lesional skin from psoriasis patients. In conclusion, hyperactivation of PARP1 in response to ROS-induced DNA damage, fueled by NAMPT-derived NAD<sup>+</sup>, mediates skin inflammation through parthanatos cell death.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Adult medial habenula neurons require GDNF receptor GFRα1 for synaptic stability and function</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Diana Fernández-Suárez, Favio A. Krapacher, Katarzyna Pietrajtis, Annika Andersson, Lilian Kisiswa, Alvaro Carrier-Ruiz, Marco A. Diana, Carlos F. Ibáñez</p>

The medial habenula (mHb) is an understudied small brain nucleus linking forebrain and midbrain structures controlling anxiety and fear behaviors. The mechanisms that maintain the structural and functional integrity of mHb neurons and their synapses remain unknown. Using spatiotemporally controlled Cre-mediated recombination in adult mice, we found that the glial cell–derived neurotrophic factor receptor alpha 1 (GFRα1) is required in adult mHb neurons for synaptic stability and function. mHb neurons express some of the highest levels of GFRα1 in the mouse brain, and acute ablation of GFRα1 results in loss of septohabenular and habenulointerpeduncular glutamatergic synapses, with the remaining synapses displaying reduced numbers of presynaptic vesicles. Chemo- and optogenetic studies in mice lacking GFRα1 revealed impaired circuit connectivity, reduced AMPA receptor postsynaptic currents, and abnormally low rectification index (R.I.) of AMPARs, suggesting reduced Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeability. Further biochemical and proximity ligation assay (PLA) studies defined the presence of GluA1/GluA2 (Ca<sup>2+</sup> impermeable) as well as GluA1/GluA4 (Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeable) AMPAR complexes in mHb neurons, as well as clear differences in the levels and association of AMPAR subunits with mHb neurons lacking GFRα1. Finally, acute loss of GFRα1 in adult mHb neurons reduced anxiety-like behavior and potentiated context-based fear responses, phenocopying the effects of lesions to septal projections to the mHb. These results uncover an unexpected function for GFRα1 in the maintenance and function of adult glutamatergic synapses and reveal a potential new mechanism for regulating synaptic plasticity in the septohabenulointerpeduncular pathway and attuning of anxiety and fear behaviors.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Predicting novel candidate human obesity genes and their site of action by systematic functional screening in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Neha Agrawal, Katherine Lawler, Catherine M. Davidson, Julia M. Keogh, Robert Legg, INTERVAL , Inês Barroso, I. Sadaf Farooqi, Andrea H. Brand</p>

The discovery of human obesity-associated genes can reveal new mechanisms to target for weight loss therapy. Genetic studies of obese individuals and the analysis of rare genetic variants can identify novel obesity-associated genes. However, establishing a functional relationship between these candidate genes and adiposity remains a significant challenge. We uncovered a large number of rare homozygous gene variants by exome sequencing of severely obese children, including those from consanguineous families. By assessing the function of these genes in vivo in <i>Drosophila</i>, we identified 4 genes, not previously linked to human obesity, that regulate adiposity (<i>itpr</i>, <i>dachsous</i>, <i>calpA</i>, and <i>sdk</i>). Dachsous is a transmembrane protein upstream of the Hippo signalling pathway. We found that 3 further members of the Hippo pathway, fat, four-jointed, and hippo, also regulate adiposity and that they act in neurons, rather than in adipose tissue (fat body). Screening Hippo pathway genes in larger human cohorts revealed rare variants in <i>TAOK2</i> associated with human obesity. Knockdown of <i>Drosophila tao</i> increased adiposity in vivo demonstrating the strength of our approach in predicting novel human obesity genes and signalling pathways and their site of action.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The impact of virtual learning on Multimedia University student performance: a cross-sectional study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The Covid-19 pandemic has imposed adaption to virtual learning for students and educators across all levels of education in the world. The effectiveness of virtual learning varies amongst age groups. It has been suggested that the adoption of virtual learning will continue to be implemented even after pandemic, particularly in higher education. Therefore, it is crucial to validate the effectiveness of a virtual learning approach among university students to ensure a smooth transition from a conventional education model to a hybrid education model. Thus, this study aims to evaluate the impact of virtual learning on students’ performance in a virtual classroom. Methods: We analysed survey data collected from undergraduate students at Multimedia University, Malaysia. Convenience sampling and self-administered online surveys were used to understand the impact of virtual learning. Multiple regression analysis was performed using SPSS software Results: A total of 210 first and second year degree and diploma students responded to the online surveys. Factors affecting virtual learning were segregated into three categories: virtual teaching techniques, technology issues, and environment distraction. Respondents stated that the critical factor that affect the effectiveness of virtual learning and impacts on students’ performance was the virtual teaching techniques employed by educators. Conclusions: This study concluded that virtual teaching techniques have significant impact on students’ performance whereas technology issues and environment distraction do not significantly influence students’ performance during virtual learning. Although this study is limited to students from Multimedia University, it lays the groundwork for future research to involve students from other universities or other countries. A future study can address more factors that affect virtual learning and students’ performance, such as students’ attitude and motivation.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Driver perceptions of advanced driver assistance systems: A case study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Automobile manufacturers need to have an insight and understand how consumers, specifically drivers, respond to the advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) technology in their manufactured vehicles. This study reveals drivers’ perceptions of Malaysia’s advanced driver assistance systems, which is currently lacking in the literature. So far, other studies have focused on countries that are unlike Malaysia’s multi-culture environment. Methods: A survey was designed and distributed using convenience sampling to obtain responses from licensed drivers. Questions included demographic and driving questions, the perceptions of benefits and obstacles relevant to ADAS use, vehicle decision-making, and technology use. Data were collected from 818 respondents who were licensed drivers in Malaysia. Results were then analysed using statistical approaches. Results: The findings indicated that 76.8% of drivers have a positive attitude towards ADAS technology, particularly safety applications when they are available. Regardless of the accuracy of these systems, acceptance of the technology may shift upon viewing or hearing messages of possible problems with ADAS. Conclusions: It can be concluded that the safety advantages of ADAS technology are less valued by drivers who do not have experience of road traffic accidents. Furthermore, acceptance of the technology could be undermined by assuming that the safety applications could be compromised.

<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>System x<sub>c</sub>
<sup>−</sup> (Sx<sub>c</sub>
<sup>−</sup>) is a heteromeric antiporter (L-cystine/L-glutamate exchanger) expressed predominately on astrocytes in the central nervous system. Its activity contributes importantly to the maintenance of the ambient extracellular glutamate levels, as well as, to cellular redox homeostasis. Since alterations in glutamate levels and redox modifications could cause structural changes, we analyzed gross regional morphology of thionin-stained brain sections and cellular and subcellular morphology of Golgi–Cox stained layer V pyramidal neurons in the primary motor cortex (PM1) of mice naturally null for <i>SLC7A11</i> (<i>SLC7A11<sup>sut/sut</sup>
</i>)—the gene that encodes the substrate specific light chain (xCT) for Sx<sub>c</sub>
<sup>−</sup>. Intriguingly, in comparison to age- and sex-matched wild-type (<i>SLC7A11<sup>+/+</sup>
</i>) littermate controls, we found morphologic changes—including increased dendritic complexity and mushroom spine area in males and reduced corpus callosum and soma size in females—that have previously been described, in each case, as morphological correlates of excitability. Consistent with this, we found that both male and female <i>SLC7A11<sup>sut/sut</sup>
</i> mice had lower convulsive seizure thresholds and greater seizure severity than their sex-matched wild-type (<i>SLC7A11<sup>+/+</sup>
</i>) littermates after acute challenge with two pharmacologically distinct chemoconvulsants: the Glu receptor agonist, kainic acid (KA), or the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor antagonist, pentylenetetrazole (PTZ). These results suggest that the loss of Sx<sub>c</sub>
<sup>−</sup> signaling in males and females perturbs excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) balance <i>in vivo</i>, potentially through its regulation of cellular and subcellular morphology.</p>

     alt="The dopamine membrane transporter plays an active modulatory role in synaptic dopamine homeostasis"/>
<p>The pH-sensitive fluorescent sensor remains OFF inside neurotransmitter vesicles due to low pH. Upon fusion of the vesicle with the synaptic membrane, the sensor is exposed to the neutral extra-cellular pH which switches it to the ON configuration. Fluorescence recovery after photo-bleaching imaging of vesicle fusion dynamics reveals an active role for the dopamine membrane transporter in synaptic dopamine homeostasis.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Modulatory mechanisms of neurotransmitter release and clearance are highly controlled processes whose finely tuned regulation is critical for functioning of the nervous system. Dysregulation of the monoamine neurotransmitter dopamine can lead to several neuropathies. Synaptic modulation of dopamine is known to involve pre-synaptic D2 auto-receptors and acid sensing ion channels. In addition, the dopamine membrane transporter (DAT), which is responsible for clearance of dopamine from the synaptic cleft, is suspected to play an active role in modulating release of dopamine. Using functional imaging on the <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> model system, we show that DAT-1 acts as a negative feedback modulator to neurotransmitter vesicle fusion. Results from our fluorescence recovery after photo-bleaching (FRAP) based experiments were followed up with and reaffirmed using swimming-induced paralysis behavioral assays. Utilizing our numerical FRAP data we have developed a mechanistic model to dissect the dynamics of synaptic vesicle fusion, and compare the feedback effects of DAT-1 with the dopamine auto-receptor. Our experimental results and the mechanistic model are of potential broader significance, as similar dynamics are likely to be used by other synaptic modulators including membrane transporters for other neurotransmitters across species.</p>

                Background: Giant gourami (Osphronemus goramy Lacepede, 1801) has become popular aquaculture in Indonesia. However, information on the feed used is minimal. This study analyzed the change in feeding nutrition, fish growth, feed efficiency, and body-carcass using product formulated from water coconut, palm sap sugar, and fungus. Methods: A total of 2,000 ml coconut water and 1,000 ml of palm sap sugar solution were formulated. Each product formulated was added with 6 g of Aspergillus niger (called product P1), 6 g of Rhizopus oligosporus (called product P2), and 6 g of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (called product P3). Commercial feeds supplemented with P1, P2, and P3 products are designated P1, P2, and P3 diets. Commercial feed added to freshwater is called the P4 diet (placebo). Their dosage is 300 ml/kg of feed. Gurami sago juveniles (initial weight 50±2.5 g and length 13.2±0.4 cm) were stocked in triplicate nets (2×1×1 m) in a freshwater concrete pond with a stocking density of 30 fish/net, an initial feeding rate of 3% per day until study termination. Results: Our results support our hypothesis that different product formulations have a significant effect (p<0.05) on growth performance and feed efficiency. At the same time, supplementing commercial feed with varying formula products has a significant impact (p<0.05) on the fatty acid composition of the diets and carcass body of gurami sago. Conclusion: Diet P2 contains a higher concentration of fatty acids to increase body weight, feed efficiency, and the best carcass fatty acid composition than other experiments for sago gurami reared in freshwater concrete ponds.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">New onset asthma during pregnancy: two case reports [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction:  Asthma is the most common chronic respiratory disease during pregnancy. However, reports of new onset asthma during pregnancy are lacking. We report two cases of new onset asthma during pregnancy following respiratory tract infection, subsequently one case with M. pneumoniae infection and the other case with a combined infection with respiratory syncytial virus and rhinovirus.   Case presentation:   Both patients presented with the clinical features of an acute asthma exacerbation during pregnancy without a medical history of asthma. During follow up the diagnosis of asthma was supported by spirometry showing significant reversibility and elevated fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO). Patients were hospitalized and received supplemental oxygen, treatment for an acute asthma exacerbation with systemic corticosteroids, high dose inhalation therapy. These therapeutic interventions subsequently led to a good outcome for the mother and newborn in both cases.   Conclusions:  New onset asthma should be part of the differential diagnosis in pregnant patients with respiratory symptoms, particularly in case of mycoplasma infection.  Diagnosing asthma during pregnancy can be challenging. In these circumstances, additional diagnostic tests (like inflammatory biomarkers FeNO and blood eosinophils) can be helpful to support the diagnosis.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Oral anticoagulants in the oldest old with recent stroke and atrial fibrillation</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To investigate the safety and effectiveness of direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) versus vitamin-K-antagonists (VKA) after recent stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) aged ≥85 years.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Individual patient data analysis from 7 prospective stroke cohorts. We compared DOAC versus VKA treatment among patients with AF and recent stroke (&lt;3 months) aged ≥85 versus &lt;85 years. Primary outcome was the composite of recurrent stroke, intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) and all-cause death. We used simple, adjusted and weighted Cox regression to account for confounders. We calculated the net benefit of DOAC versus VKA by balancing stroke reduction against the weighted ICH risk.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In total, 5,984 of 6,267 (95.5%) patients were eligible for analysis. Of those, 1,380 (23%) were aged ≥85 years and 3,688 (62%) received a DOAC. During 6,874 patient-years follow-up, the impact of anticoagulant type (DOAC versus VKA) on the hazard for the composite outcome did not differ between patients aged ≥85 (HR<sub>≥85y</sub>=0.65, 95%-CI [0.52, 0.81]) and &lt;85 years (HR<sub>&lt;85y</sub>=0.79, 95%-CI [0.66, 0.95]) in simple (p<sub>interaction</sub>=0.129), adjusted (p<sub>interaction</sub>=0.094) or weighted (p<sub>interaction</sub>=0.512) models. Analyses on recurrent stroke, ICH and death separately were consistent with the primary analysis, as were sensitivity analyses using age dichotomized at 90 years and as a continuous variable. DOAC had a similar net clinical benefit in patients aged ≥85 (+1.73 to +2.66) and &lt;85 years (+1.90 to +3.36 events/100 patient-years for ICH-weights 1.5 to 3.1).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The favorable profile of DOAC over VKA in patients with AF and recent stroke was maintained in the oldest old.</p>

                Background: Postal questionnaires are frequently used in randomised controlled trials to collect outcome data on participants; however, poor response can introduce bias, affect generalisability and validity, and reduce statistical power. The objective of this study was to assess whether a pen and/or social incentive text cover letter sent with a postal follow-up questionnaire increased response rates in a trial. Method: A two-by-two factorial randomised controlled trial was embedded within the OTIS host trial. Participants due their 12-month (final) follow-up questionnaire were randomised to be sent: a pen; a social incentive text cover letter; both; or neither. The primary outcome measure was the proportion of participants in each group who returned the questionnaire. Secondary outcomes were: time to return, completeness of the questionnaire, necessity of a reminder letter, and the cost effectiveness. Results: The overall 12-month questionnaire response rate was 721 out of 755 (95.5%). Neither the pen nor social incentive cover letter had a statistically significant effect on response rate: pen 95.2% vs. no pen 95.8%, adjusted OR 0.90 (95% CI 0.45 to 1.80; p=0.77); social incentive cover letter 95.2% vs. no social incentive cover letter 95.8%, adjusted OR 0.84 (95% CI 0.42 to 1.69, p=0.63). No statistically significant differences were observed between either of the intervention groups on time to response, need for a reminder or completeness. Therefore, neither intervention was cost-effective. Conclusions: We found no evidence of a difference in response rates associated with the inclusion of a pen and/or social incentive cover letter with the final follow-up postal questionnaire of the host trial. However, when these results are combined with previous SWATs, the meta-analysis evidence remains that including a pen increases response rates. The social incentive cover letter warrants further investigation to determine effectiveness. Trial registration: ISRCTN22202133 (21st June 2020).

     alt="Ultra-hyper-fractionated radiotherapy for high-grade gliomas"/>
<p>A human high-grade glioma (VIPI) positive for the stem cell marker nestin implanted in the brain of an immunodeficient mouse is irradiated with total 10.0 Gy split in 4 × 2.5 Gy fractions (hypofractionated radiotherapy) or 30 × 0.25 + 20 × 0.125 Gy fractions (ultra-hyper-fractionated radiotherapy). Mice treated with the latter survive significantly longer.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>High-grade gliomas (HGGs; WHO grades III and IV) are invariably lethal brain tumors. Low-dose hyper-radiosensitivity (HRS) of HGG is a well-established phenomenon <i>in vitro</i>. However, possibly linked to the unavailability of accurate animal models of the diseases, this therapeutic effect could not be consistently translated to the animal setting, thus impairing its subsequent clinical development. The purpose of this study was to develop radiotherapeutic (RT) schedules permitting to significantly improve the overall survival of faithful animal models of HGG that have been recently made available. We used primary glioma initiating cell (GIC)-driven orthotopic animal models that accurately recapitulate the heterogeneity and growth patterns of the patients' tumors, to investigate the therapeutic effects of low radiation doses toward HGG. With the same total dose, RT fractions ≤0.5 Gy twice per week [ultra-hyper-fractionation (ultra-hyper-FRT)] started at early stages of tumor progression (a condition that in the clinical setting often occurs at the end of the guidelines treatment) improved the effectiveness of RT and the animal survival in comparison to standard fractions. For the same cumulative dose, the use of fractions ≤0.5 Gy may permit to escape one or more tumor resistance mechanisms thus increasing the effectiveness of RT and the overall animal survival. These findings suggest investigating in the clinical setting the therapeutic effect of an ultra-hyper-FRT schedule promptly extending the conventional RT component of the current guideline (“Stupp”) therapeutic protocol.</p>

     alt="Is there a relationship between EEG and sTMS neurophysiological markers of the putative human mirror neuron system?"/>
<p>In a large sample of healthy adults, we assessed whether two predominantly used measures of the human mirror neuron system (MNS) are related. Results revealed strong evidence against an association, indicating that future researchers must carefully select their measures and embrace more versatile multi-methodological approaches to indexing the MNS.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The mirror neuron system (MNS) has been theorized to play a neurobiological role in a number of social cognitive abilities and is commonly indexed putatively in humans via interpersonal motor resonance (IMR) and mu suppression. Although both indices are thought to measure similar neuronal populations (i.e., “mirror neurons”), it has been suggested that these methods are unrelated, and therefore, incompatible. However, prior studies reporting no relationships were typically conducted in small and underpowered samples. Thus, we aimed to investigate this potential association in a large sample of neurotypical adults (<i>N</i> = 116; 72 females). Participants underwent transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), electromyography (EMG), and electroencephalography (EEG) during the observation of videos of actors performing grasping actions in order to index IMR and mu suppression (in beta, lower alpha, and upper alpha bandwidths). A series of linear regressions revealed no associations between IMR and each of the mu suppression bandwidths. Supplementary Bayesian analyses provided further evidence in favor of the null (B<sub>01</sub> = 8.85–8.93), providing further support for no association between the two indices of MNS activity. Our findings suggest that these two measures may indeed be unrelated indices that perhaps assess different neurophysiological aspects of the MNS. These results have important implications for future studies examining the MNS.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/neuron/inpress.rss">Synchronized cluster firing, a distinct form of sensory neuron activation, drives spontaneous pain</a></h4>

              
                Spontaneous pain, a primary complaint of individuals with neuropathic pain, is poorly understood. Zheng et al. describe a new form of sensory neuron activity: spatially clustered sensory neurons sporadically firing together, which mediates spontaneous pain in mouse models of neuropathic pain. Sympathetic fibers abnormally sprouting into sensory ganglia underlie this cluster firing.

                It is well recognized that population heterogeneity plays an important role in the spread of epidemics. While individual variations in social activity are often assumed to be persistent, i.e. constant in time, here we discuss the consequences of dynamic heterogeneity. By integrating the stochastic dynamics of social activity into traditional epidemiological models we demonstrate the emergence of a new long timescale governing the epidemic, in broad agreement with empirical data. Our Stochastic Social Activity model captures multiple features of real-life epidemics such as COVID-19, including prolonged plateaus and multiple waves, which are transiently suppressed due to the dynamic nature of social activity. The existence of a long timescale due to the interplay between epidemic and social dynamics provides a unifying picture of how a fast-paced epidemic typically will transition to an endemic state.

                Shotgun metagenomic sequencing is a powerful approach to study microbiomes in an unbiased manner and of increasing relevance for identifying novel enzymatic functions. However, the potential of metagenomics to relate from microbiome composition to function has thus far been underutilized. Here, we introduce the Metagenomics Genome-Phenome Association (MetaGPA) study framework, which allows linking genetic information in metagenomes with a dedicated functional phenotype. We applied MetaGPA to identify enzymes associated with cytosine modifications in environmental samples. From the 2365 genes that met our significance criteria, we confirm known pathways for cytosine modifications and proposed novel cytosine-modifying mechanisms. Specifically, we characterized and identified a novel nucleic acid modifying enzyme, 5-hydroxymethylcytosine carbamoyltransferase, that catalyzes the formation of a previously unknown cytosine modification, 5-carbamoyloxymethylcytosine, in DNA and RNA. Our work introduces MetaGPA as a novel and versatile tool for advancing functional metagenomics.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Rapid and sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection using quantitative peptide enrichment LC-MS analysis</a></h4>

              
                Reliable, robust, large-scale molecular testing for SARS-CoV-2 is essential for monitoring the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. We have developed a scalable analytical approach to detect viral proteins based on peptide immunoaffinity enrichment combined with liquid chromatography - mass spectrometry (LC-MS). This is a multiplexed strategy, based on targeted proteomics analysis and read-out by LC-MS, capable of precisely quantifying and confirming the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in PBS swab media from combined throat/nasopharynx/saliva samples.&lt;br /&gt;The results reveal that the levels of SARS-CoV-2 measured by LC-MS correlate well with their corresponding RT-PCR readout (r=0.79). The analytical workflow shows similar turnaround times as regular RT-PCR instrumentation with a quantitative readout of viral proteins corresponding to cycle thresholds (Ct) equivalents ranging from 21 to 34. Using RT-PCR as a reference, we demonstrate that the LC-MS-based method has 100% negative percent agreement (estimated specificity) and 95% positive percent agreement (estimated sensitivity) when analyzing clinical samples collected from asymptomatic individuals with a Ct within the limit of detection of the mass spectrometer (Ct ≤30). These results suggest that a scalable analytical method based on LC-MS has a place in future pandemic preparedness centers to complement current virus detection technologies.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Early evolution of beetles regulated by the end-Permian deforestation</a></h4>

              
                The end-Permian mass extinction (EPME) led to a severe terrestrial ecosystem collapse. However, the ecological response of insects—the most diverse group of organisms on Earth—to the EPME remains poorly understood. Here, we analyse beetle evolutionary history based on taxonomic diversity, morphological disparity, phylogeny, and ecological shifts from the Early Permian to Middle Triassic, using a comprehensive new data set. Permian beetles were dominated by xylophagous stem groups with high diversity and disparity, which probably played an underappreciated role in the Permian carbon cycle. Our suite of analyses shows that Permian xylophagous beetles suffered a severe extinction during the EPME largely due to the collapse of forest ecosystems, resulting in an Early Triassic gap of xylophagous beetles. New xylophagous beetles appeared widely in the early Middle Triassic, which is consistent with the restoration of forest ecosystems. Our results highlight the ecological significance of insects in deep-time terrestrial ecosystems.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Sumoylation of the human histone H4 tail inhibits p300-mediated transcription by RNA polymerase II in cellular extracts</a></h4>

              
                The post-translational modification of histones by the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) protein has been associated with gene regulation, centromeric localization and double-strand break repair in eukaryotes. Although sumoylation of histone H4 was specifically associated with gene repression, this could not be proven due to the challenge of site-specifically sumoylating H4 in cells. Biochemical crosstalk between SUMO and other histone modifications, such as H4 acetylation and H3 methylation, that are associated with active genes also remains unclear. We addressed these challenges in mechanistic studies using an H4 chemically modified at Lys12 by SUMO-3 (H4K12su) and incorporated into mononucleosomes and chromatinized plasmids for functional studies. Mononucleosome-based assays revealed that H4K12su inhibits transcription-activating H4 tail acetylation by the histone acetyltransferase p300, as well as transcription-associated H3K4 methylation by the extended catalytic module of the Set1/COMPASS histone methyltransferase complex. Activator- and p300-dependent <i>in vitro</i> transcription assays with chromatinized plasmids revealed that H4K12su inhibits both H4 tail acetylation and RNA polymerase II-mediated transcription. Finally, cell-based assays with a SUMO-H4 fusion that mimics H4 tail sumoylation confirmed the negative crosstalk between histone sumoylation and acetylation/methylation. Thus, our studies establish the key role for histone sumoylation in gene silencing and its negative biochemical crosstalk with active transcription-associated marks in human cells.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The role of TAp63γ and P53 point mutations in regulating DNA repair, mutational susceptibility and invasion of bladder cancer cells</a></h4>

              
                It has long been recognized that non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) has a low propensity (20%) of becoming muscle-invasive (MIBC), and that MIBC carry many more p53 point mutations (p53m) than NMIBC (50% vs 10%). MIBC also has a higher mutation burden than NMIBC. These results suggest that DNA repair capacities, mutational susceptibility and p53m are crucial for MIBC development. We found MIBC cells are hypermutable, deficient in DNA repair and have markedly downregulated DNA repair genes, XPC, hOGG1/2 and Ref1, and the tumor suppressor, TAp63γ. In contrast, NMIBC cells are hyperactive in DNA repair and exhibit upregulated DNA repair genes and TAp63γ. A parallel exists in human tumors, as MIBC tissues have markedly lower DNA repair activity, and lower expression of DNA repair genes and TAp63γ compared to NMIBC tissues. Forced TAp63γ expression in MIBC significantly mitigates DNA repair deficiencies and reduces mutational susceptibility. Knockdown of TAp63γ in NMIBC greatly reduces DNA repair capacity and enhances mutational susceptibility. Manipulated TAp63γ expression or knockdown of p53m reduce the invasion of MIBC by 40–60%. However, the combination of p53m knockdown with forced TAp63γ expression reduce the invasion ability to nil suggesting that p53m contributes to invasion phenotype independent from TAp63γ. These results indicate that in BC, TAp63γ regulates DNA repair capacities, mutational susceptibility and invasion, and that p53m contribute to the invasion phenotype. We conclude that concurrent TAp63γ suppression and acquisition of p53m are a major cause for MIBC development.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A genetic screen in macrophages identifies new regulators of IFNγ-inducible MHCII that contribute to T cell activation</a></h4>

              
                Cytokine-mediated activation of host immunity is central to the control of pathogens. Interferon-gamma (IFNγ) is a key cytokine in protective immunity that induces major histocompatibility complex class II molecules (MHCII) to amplify CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell activation and effector function. Despite its central role, the dynamic regulation of IFNg-induced MHCII is not well understood. Using a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screen in murine macrophages we identified genes that control MHCII surface expression. Mechanistic studies uncovered two parallel pathways of IFNg-mediated MHCII control that require the multifunctional glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3β) or the mediator complex subunit MED16. Both pathways control distinct aspects of the IFNg response and are necessary for IFNg-mediated induction of the MHCII transactivator <i>Ciita</i>, MHCII expression, and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell activation. Our results define previously unappreciated regulation of MHCII expression that is required to control CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses.

                Calcium imaging with protein-based indicators is widely used to follow neural activity in intact nervous systems. The popular GCaMP indicators are based on the calcium-binding protein calmodulin and the RS20 peptide. These sensors report neural activity at timescales much slower than electrical signaling, limited by their biophysical properties and trade-offs between sensitivity and speed. We used large-scale screening and structure-guided mutagenesis to develop and optimize several fast and sensitive GCaMP-type indicators. The resulting jGCaMP8 sensors, based on calmodulin and a fragment of endothelial nitric oxide synthase, have ultra-fast kinetics (rise times, 2 ms) and still feature the highest sensitivity for neural activity reported for any protein-based sensor. jGCaMP8 sensors will allow tracking of larger populations of neurons on timescales relevant to neural computation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Inversely proportional myelin growth due to altered Pmp22 gene dosage identifies PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling as a novel therapeutic target in HNPP</a></h4>

              
                Duplication of the gene encoding the myelin protein PMP22 causes the hereditary neuropathy Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease 1A (CMT1A), characterized by hypomyelination of medium to large peripheral axons. Conversely, haplo-insufficiency of PMP22 leads to focal myelin overgrowth in hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP). However, the molecular mechanisms of myelin growth regulation by PMP22 remain obscure. Here, we found that the major inhibitor of the myelin growth signaling pathway PI3K/Akt/mTOR, phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is increased in abundance in CMT1A and decreased in HNPP rodent models. Indeed, treatment of DRG co-cultures from HNPP mice with PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway inhibitors reduced focal hypermyelination and, importantly, treatment of HNPP mice with the mTOR inhibitor Rapamycin improved motor behavior, increased compound muscle amplitudes (CMAP) and reduced tomacula formation in the peripheral nerve. In Pmp22tg CMT1A mice, we uncovered that the differentiation defect of Schwann cells is independent from PI3K/Akt/mTOR activity, rendering the pathway insufficient as a therapy target on its own. Thus, while CMT1A pathogenesis is governed by dys-differentiation uncoupled from PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling, targeting the pathway provides novel proof-of-principle for a therapeutic approach to HNPP.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Paradoxical excitation of lateral habenula neurons by propofol involves enhanced presynaptic release of glutamate</a></h4>

              
                Sleep is a fundamental physiological process conserved across most species. As such, deficits in sleep can result in a myriad of psychological and physical health issues. However, the mechanisms underlying the induction of sleep are relatively unknown. Interestingly, general anesthetics cause unconsciousness by positively modulating GABA-A receptors (GABAARs). Based on this observation, it is hypothesized that GABAARs play a critical role in modulating circuits involved in sleep to promote unconsciousness. Recently, the lateral habenula (LHb) has been demonstrated to play a role in sleep physiology and sedation. Specifically, propofol has been shown to excite LHb neurons to promote sedation. However, the mechanism by which this occurs is unknown. Here, we utilize whole-cell voltage and current clamp recordings from LHb neurons obtained from 8-10 week old male mice to determine the physiological mechanisms for this phenomenon. We show that bath application of 1.5M propofol is sufficient to increase LHb neuronal excitability involving synaptic transmission, but not through modulation of intrinsic properties. Additionally, although there is increased LHb neuronal excitability, GABAARs localized postsynaptically on LHb neurons are still responsive to propofol, as indicated by an increase in the decay time. Lastly, we find that propofol increases the synaptic drive onto LHb neurons involving enhanced presynaptic release of both glutamate and GABA. However, the greatest contributor to the potentiated synaptic drive is the increased release of glutamate which shifts the balance of synaptic transmission towards greater excitation. Taken together, this study is the first to identify the physiological basis for why LHb neurons are excited by propofol, rather than inhibited, and as a result promote sedation.

                An analysis of an internationally shared functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data involving healthy participants and schizophrenia patients extracted brain networks involved in listening to radio speech and capture hallucination experiences. A multidimensional analysis technique demonstrated that for radio-speech sound files, a brain network matching known auditory perception networks emerged, and importantly, displayed speech-duration-dependent hemodynamic responses (HDRs), confirming fMRI detection of these speech events. In the hallucination-capture data, although a sensorimotor (response) network emerged, it did not show hallucination-duration-dependent HDRs. We conclude that although fMRI retrieved the brain network involved in generating the motor responses indicating the start and end of an experienced hallucination, the hallucination event itself was not detected. Previous reports on brain networks detected by fMRI during hallucination capture is reviewed in this context.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The learning curve of murine subretinal injection among clinically trained ophthalmic surgeons</a></h4>

              
                PURPOSE: Subretinal injection (SRI) in mice is widely used in retinal research, yet the learning curve (LC) of this surgically challenging technique is unknown. METHODS: To evaluate the LC for SRI in a murine model, we analyzed training data from 3 clinically trained ophthalmic surgeons from 2018 to 2020. Successful SRI was defined as either the absence of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) degeneration after phosphate buffer saline injection and the presence of RPE degeneration after Alu RNA injection. Multivariable survival-time regression models were used to evaluate the association between surgeon experience and success rate, with adjustment for injection agents, and to calculate an approximate case number to achieve a 95% success rate. A Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) analysis was performed and plotted individually to monitor each surgeon's simultaneous performance. RESULTS: Despite prior microsurgery experience, the combined average success rate of the first 50 cases in mice was only 27%. The predicted SRI success rate did not reach a plateau above 95% until approximately 364 prior cases. Using the 364-training case as a "cutoff" point, the predicted probability of success before and after the 364th case was 65.38% and 99.32%, respectively (P < 0.0001). CUSUM analysis showed an initial upward slope and then remained within the decision intervals with an acceptable success rate set at 95% in the late stage. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the complexity and substantial LC for successful SRI in mice with high confidence. A systematic training system could improve the reliability and reproducibility of SRI-related experiments and improve the interpretation of experimental results using this technique. Translational Relevance: Our prediction model and monitor system allow objective quantification of technical proficiency in the field of subretinal drug delivery and gene therapy for the first time.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Feasibility evaluation of transtympanic laser stimulation of the cochlea from the outer ear</a></h4>

              
                Infrared laser stimulation has been studied as an alternative approach to auditory prostheses. This study evaluated the feasibility of infrared laser stimulation of the cochlea from the outer ear bypassing the middle ear function. An optic fiber was inserted into the ear canal and a laser was used to irradiate the cochlea through the tympanic membrane in Mongolian gerbil. A pulsed infrared laser (10.1 mJ/cm2) and clicking sound (70 peak-to-peak equivalent sound pressure level) were presented to the animals. The amplitude of the laser-evoked cochlear response was systematically decreased following insertion of a filter between the tympanic membrane and cochlea; however, the auditory-evoked cochlear response did not decrease. The filter was removed and the laser-evoked response returned to around the original level. The amplitude ratio and the relative change in response amplitude before and during filter insertion significantly decreased as the absorbance of the infrared filter increased. These results indicate that laser irradiation could bypass the function of the middle ear and directly activate the cochlea. Therefore, an auditory prosthesis based on laser stimulation represents a possible noninvasive alternative to conventional auditory prostheses requiring surgical implants.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Modelling novelty detection in the thalamocortical loop</a></h4>

              
                In complex natural environments, sensory systems are constantly exposed to a large stream of inputs. Novel or rare stimuli, which are often associated with behaviorally important events, are typically processed differently than the steady sensory background, which has less relevance. Neural signatures of such differential processing, commonly referred to as novelty detection, have been identified on the level of EEG recordings as mismatch negativity and the level of single neurons as stimulus-specific adaptation. Here, we propose a multi-scale recurrent network with synaptic depression to explain how novelty detection can arise in the whisker-related part of the somatosensory thalamocortical loop. The architecture and dynamics of the model presume that neurons in cortical layer 6 adapt, via synaptic depression, specifically to a frequently presented stimulus, resulting in reduced population activity in the corresponding cortical column when compared with the population activity evoked by a rare stimulus. This difference in population activity is then projected from the cortex to the thalamus and amplified through the interaction between neurons of the primary and reticular nuclei of the thalamus, resulting in spindle-like, rhythmic oscillations. These differentially activated thalamic oscillations are forwarded to cortical layer 4 as a late secondary response that is specific to rare stimuli that violate a particular stimulus pattern. Model results show a strong analogy between this late single neuron activity and EEG-based mismatch negativity in terms of their common sensitivity to presentation context and timescales of response latency, as observed experimentally. Our results indicate that adaptation in L6 can establish the thalamocortical dynamics that produce signatures of SSA and MMN and suggest a mechanistic model of novelty detection that could generalize to other sensory modalities.

                Animals integrate external stimuli to shape their physiological responses throughout development. In adverse environments, Caenorhabditis elegans larvae can enter a stress-resistant diapause state with arrested metabolism and reproductive physiology. Amphid sensory neurons feed into both rapid chemotactic and short-term foraging mode decisions, mediated by amphid and pre-motor interneurons, as well as the long-term diapause decision. We identify amphid interneurons that integrate pheromone cues and propagate this information via a neuropeptidergic pathways to influence larval developmental fate, bypassing the pre-motor system. AIA interneuron-derived FLP-2 neuropeptide signaling promotes reproductive growth and AIA activity is suppressed by pheromone. FLP-2 acts antagonistically to the insulin-like INS-1. FLP-2's growth promoting effects are inhibited by upstream metabotropic glutamatergic signaling and mediated by the broadly-expressed neuropeptide receptor NPR-30. Conversely, the AIB interneurons and their neuropeptide receptor NPR-9/GALR2 promote diapause entry. These neuropeptidergic outputs allow reuse of parts of a sensory system for a decision with a distinct timescale.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Normalization by orientation anisotropy in human V1-V3</a></h4>

              
                An influential account of neuronal responses in primary visual cortex is the normalized energy model. This model is often implemented as a two-stage computation. The first stage is the extraction of contrast energy, whereby a complex cell computes the squared and summed outputs of a pair of linear filters in quadrature phase. The second stage is normalization, in which a local population of complex cells mutually inhibit one another. Because the population includes cells tuned to a range of orientations and spatial frequencies, the result is that the responses are effectively normalized by the local stimulus contrast. Here, using evidence from human functional MRI, we show that the classical model fails to account for the relative responses to two classes of stimuli: straight, parallel, band-passed contours (gratings), and curved, band-passed contours (snakes). The snakes elicit fMRI responses that are about twice as large as the gratings, yet traditional energy models, including normalized energy models, predict responses that are about the same. Here, we propose a computational model, in which responses are normalized not by the sum of the contrast energy, but by the orientation anisotropy, computed as the variance in contrast energy across orientation channels. We first show that this model accounts for differential responses to these two classes of stimuli. We then show that the model successfully generalizes to other band-pass textures, both in V1 and in extrastriate cortex (V2 and V3). We speculate that high anisotropy in the orientation responses leads to larger outputs in downstream areas, which in turn normalizes responses in these later visual areas, as well as in V1 via feedback.

                Under anesthesia, neural dynamics deviate dramatically from those seen during wakefulness. During recovery from this perturbation, thalamocortical activity abruptly switches among a small set of metastable intermediate states. These metastable states and structured transitions among them form a scaffold that guides the brain back to the waking state. Here, we investigate the mechanisms that constrain cortical activity to discrete states and give rise to abrupt transitions among them. If state transitions were imposed onto the thalamocortical system by changes in the subcortical modulation, different cortical sites should exhibit near-synchronous state transitions. To test this hypothesis, we quantified state synchrony at different cortical sites in anesthetized rats. States were defined by compressing spectra of layer-specific local field potentials (LFPs) in visual and motor cortices. Transition synchrony, mutual information, and canonical correlations all demonstrate that most state transitions in the cortex are local and that coupling between sites is weak. Fluctuations in the LFP in the thalamic input layer 4 were particularly dissimilar from those in supra- and infra-granular layers. Thus, our results suggest that the discrete global cortical states are not imposed by the ascending modulatory pathways but emerge from the multitude of weak pairwise interactions within the cortex.

                Virtually all vision studies use a fixation point to stabilize gaze, rendering stimuli on video screens fixed to retinal coordinates. This approach requires trained subjects, is limited by the accuracy of fixational eye movements, and ignores the role of eye movements in shaping visual input. To overcome these limitations, we developed a suite of hardware and software tools to study vision during natural behavior in untrained subjects. We show this approach recovers receptive fields and tuning properties of visual neurons from multiple cortical areas of marmoset monkeys. Combined with high-precision eye-tracking, it achieves sufficient resolution to recover the receptive fields of foveal V1 neurons. These findings demonstrate the power of this approach for characterizing neural response while simultaneously studying the dynamics of natural behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sonogenetic stimulation of the brain at a spatiotemporal resolution suitable for vision restoration</a></h4>

              
                Remote, precisely controlled activation of the brain is a fundamental challenge in the development of brain machine interfaces providing feasible rehabilitation strategies for neurological disorders. Low-frequency ultrasound stimulation can be used to modulate neuronal activity deep in the brain, but this approach lacks spatial resolution and cellular selectivity and loads the brain with high levels of acoustic energy. The combination of the expression of ultrasound-sensitive proteins with ultrasound stimulation (sonogenetic stimulation) can provide cellular selectivity and higher sensitivity, but such strategies have been subject to severe limitations in terms of spatiotemporal resolution in vivo, precluding their use for real-life applications. We used the expression of large-conductance mechanosensitive ion channels (MscL) with high-frequency ultrasonic stimulation for a duration of milliseconds to activate neurons selectively at a relatively high spatiotemporal resolution in the rat retina ex vivo and the primary visual cortex of rodents in vivo. This spatiotemporal resolution was achieved at low energy levels associated with negligible tissue heating and far below those leading to complications in ultrasound neuromodulation. We showed, in an associative learning test, that sonogenetic stimulation of the visual cortex generated light perception. Our findings demonstrate that sonogenetic stimulation is compatible with millisecond pattern presentation for visual restoration at the cortical level. They represent a step towards the precise transfer of information over large distances to the cortical and subcortical regions of the brain via an approach less invasive than that associated with current brain machine interfaces and with a wide range of applications in neurological disorders.

                Sonogenetics uses heterologously-expressed proteins to sensitize neurons to ultrasound, enabling selective, non-invasive, and deep brain stimulation. However, its ability to modulate specific circuits or induce behavioral changes remains to be studied and characterized. Here, we demonstrate that sonogenetics enables efficient activation of well-defined neural circuits by transcranial low-intensity, low-frequency ultrasonic stimulation with high spatiotemporal resolution. Targeted neurons in subcortical regions were made to express a mechanosensitive ion channel (MscL-G22S). Ultrasound could trigger activity in MscL-expressing neurons in the dorsal striatum without increased activation in neighboring regions, and increase locomotion in freely-moving mice. Ultrasound stimulation of MscL-expressing neurons in the ventral tegmental area could activate the mesolimbic pathway to trigger dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens and modulate appetitive conditioning. In MscL-expressing cells, neuronal responses to ultrasound pulses were rapid, reversible and repeatable. Altogether, we show that sonogenetics can selectively manipulate targeted cells to activate defined neural pathways and affect behaviors.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cold protection allows local cryotherapy in a clinical-relevant model of traumatic optic neuropathy</a></h4>

              
                Therapeutic hypothermia (TH) is potentially an important therapy for central nervous system (CNS) trauma. However, its clinical application remains controversial, hampered by two major factors: 1) Many of the CNS injury sites, such as the optic nerve (ON), are deeply buried, preventing access for local TH. The alternative is to apply TH systemically, which significantly limits the applicable temperature range. 2) Even with possible access for "local refrigeration", cold-induced cellular damage offsets the benefit of TH. Here we present a clinically translatable model of traumatic optic neuropathy (TON) by applying clinical trans-nasal endoscopic surgery to goats and non-human primates. This model faithfully recapitulates clinical features of TON such as the injury site (pre-chiasmatic ON), the spatiotemporal pattern of neural degeneration, and the accessibility of local treatments with large operating space. We also developed a computer program to simplify the endoscopic procedure and expand this model to other large animal species. Moreover, applying a cold-protective treatment, inspired by our previous hibernation research, enables us to deliver deep hypothermia (4{degrees}C) locally to mitigate inflammation and metabolic stress (indicated by the transcriptomic changes after injury) without cold-induced cellular damage, and confers prominent neuroprotection both structurally and functionally. Intriguingly, neither treatment alone was effective, demonstrating that in situ deep hypothermia combined with hibernation-mimicking cold protection constitutes a breakthrough for TH as a therapy for TON and other CNS traumas.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Robust transcriptional profiling and identification of differentially expressed genes with low input RNA sequencing of adult hippocampal neural stem and progenitor populations</a></h4>

              
                Multipotent neural stem cells (NSCs) are found in several isolated niches of the adult mammalian brain where they have unique potential to assist in tissue repair. Modern transcriptomics offer high-throughput methods for identifying disease or injury associated gene expression signatures in endogenous adult NSCs, but they require adaptation to accommodate the rarity of NSCs. Bulk RNA sequencing (RNAseq) of NSCs requires pooling several mice, which impedes application to labor-intensive injury models. Alternatively, single cell RNAseq can profile hundreds to thousands of cells from a single mouse and is increasingly used to study NSCs. The consequences of the low RNA input from a single NSC on downstream identification of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) remains largely unexplored. Here, to clarify the role that low RNA input plays in NSC DEG identification, we directly compared DEGs in an oxidative stress model of cultured NSCs by bulk and single cell sequencing. While both methods yielded DEGs that were replicable, single cell sequencing DEGs derived from genes with higher relative transcript counts compared to all detected genes and exhibited smaller fold changes than DEGs identified by bulk RNAseq. The loss of high fold-change DEGs in the single cell platform presents an important limitation for identifying disease-relevant genes. To facilitate identification of such genes, we determined an RNA-input threshold that enables transcriptional profiling of NSCs comparable to standard bulk sequencing and used it to establish a workflow for in vivo profiling of endogenous NSCs. We then applied this workflow to identify DEGs after lateral fluid percussion injury, a labor-intensive animal model of traumatic brain injury. Our work suggests that single cell RNA sequencing may underestimate the diversity of pathologic DEGs but population level transcriptomic analysis can be adapted to capture more of these DEGs with similar efficacy and diversity as standard bulk sequencing. Together, our data and workflow will be useful for investigators interested in understanding and manipulating adult hippocampal NSC responses to various stimuli.

                Background: The hypothalamic neuropeptide oxytocin (OXT) may exert anxiolytic and stress-reducing actions via modulatory effects on amygdala circuits. Animal models and initial findings in humans suggest that some of these effects are mediated by interactions with other neurotransmitter systems, in particular the serotonin (5-HT) system. Against this background, the present pharmacological resting state fMRI study aimed at determining whether effects of OXT on stress-associated amygdala intrinsic networks are mediated by 5-HT. Methods: We employed a randomized placebo-controlled double-blind parallel-group pharmacological fMRI resting state experiment during which n = 112 healthy male participants underwent a transient decrease in 5-HT signaling via acute tryptophan depletion (ATD+) or the corresponding placebo-control protocols (ATD-) before the administration of intranasal OXT or placebo intranasal spray, respectively. Results: OXT and 5-HT modulation exerted interactive effects on the coupling of the left amygdala with the ipsilateral hippocampus and adjacent midbrain. OXT increased intrinsic coupling in this pathway, while this effect of OXT was significantly attenuated during transiently decreased central serotonergic signaling induced via ATD+. In the absence of OXT or 5-HT modulation this pathway was associated with self-reported stress perception in everyday life, while an OXT-induced modulation of this pathway was following ATD- pre-treatment. Conclusions: Together, the findings provide first evidence that effects of OXT on stress-associated amygdala-hippocampal-midbrain pathways are critically mediated by the 5-HT system in men.

                Economic choices are characterized by a variety of biases. Understanding their origins is a long-term goal for neuroeconomics, but progress on this front has been limited. Here we examined choice biases observed when two goods are offered sequentially. In the experiments, rhesus monkeys chose between different juices offered simultaneously or in sequence. Choices under sequential offers were less accurate (higher variability). They were also biased in favor of the second offer (order bias) and in favor of the preferred juice (preference bias). Analysis of neuronal activity recorded in orbitofrontal cortex revealed that these phenomena emerged at different computational stages. The lower choice accuracy reflected weaker offer value signals (valuation stage), the order bias emerged during value comparison (decision stage), and the preference bias emerged late in the trial (post-comparison). Our approach, leveraging recent notions on the neural mechanisms of economic decisions, may shed light on other aspects of choice behavior.

                These experiments examined whether exposure to drugs of abuse altered the balance between hippocampal and striatal memory systems as measured long after drug treatments. Male rats received injections of morphine (5 mg/kg), cocaine (20 mg/kg), or saline for five consecutive days. One month later, rats were then trained to find food on a hippocampus-sensitive place task or a striatum-sensitive response task. Relative to saline controls, morphine-treated rats exhibited impaired place learning but enhanced response learning; prior cocaine exposure did not significantly alter learning on either task. Another set of rats was trained on a dual-solution T-maze that can be solved with either place or response strategies. While a majority (67%) of control rats used place solutions in this task, morphine treatment one month prior resulted in a shift to response solutions exclusively (100%). Prior cocaine treatment did not significantly alter strategy selection. Molecular markers related to learning and drug abuse were measured in the hippocampus and striatum one month after drug exposure in behaviorally untested rats. Protein levels of glial-fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), an intermediate filament specific to astrocytes, increased significantly in the hippocampus after morphine, but not after cocaine exposure. Exposure to morphine or cocaine did not significantly change levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) or a downstream target of BDNF signaling, glycogen synthase kinase 3{beta} (GSK3{beta}), in the hippocampus or striatum. Thus, exposure to morphine results in a long-lasting shift from hippocampal toward striatal dominance during learning. The effects of prior morphine injections on GFAP suggest that long-lasting alterations in hippocampal astrocytes may be associated with these behavioral strategy shifts.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Temporal saliency for motion direction may arise from visual stimulus-specific adaptation in avian midbrain inhibitory nucleus</a></h4>

              
                Food and predators are the most noteworthy objects for the basic survival of wild animals. In nature, both of these are often rare or deviant in both spatial and temporal domains and would soon attract an animal's attention. Although stimulus-specific adaptation (SSA) is considered to be one neural basis of salient sound detection in the temporal domain, related research on visual SSA is lacking. The avian nucleus isthmi pars magnocellularis (Imc), which plays an extremely important role in the selective attention network, is one of the best models for investigating the neural correlate of visual stimulus-specific adaptation (SSA) and detection of salient stimulus in the temporal domain. Here, we used a constant order paradigm to test the existence of SSA in the pigeon's Imc. We found that the strength of response of Imc neurons significantly decreased after repetitive motion stimuli, but recovered when the motion was switched to a novel direction, leading to the saliency detection of the novel motion direction. These results suggest that the inhibitory nucleus Imc shows visual SSA to motion direction, allowing the Imc to implement temporal saliency mapping and to determine the spatial-temporal saliency of the current stimulus. This also implies that pigeons may detect novel spatial-temporal stimuli during the early stage of sensory processing.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Embryonic valproate exposure alters mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons distribution and septal dopaminergic gene expression in domestic chicks</a></h4>

              
                In recent years, the role of the dopaminergic system in the regulation of social behavior is being progressively outlined, and dysfunctions of the dopaminergic system are increasingly associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, including ASD. To further elucidate the role of the dopaminergic system in ASD, we investigated the effects of embryonic exposure to valproic acid (VPA) on the postnatal development of the mesencephalic DA system in the domestic chick. We found that VPA affected the rostro-caudal distribution of DA neurons, without changing the expression levels of several dopaminergic markers in the mesencephalon. We also investigated a potential consequence of this altered DA neuronal distribution in the septum, a social brain area previously associated to social behaviour in several vertebrate species, describing alterations in the expression of genes linked to DA neurotransmission. These findings support the emerging hypothesis of a role of DA dysfunction in ASD pathogenesis. Together with previous studies showing impairments of early social orienting behaviour, these data also support the use of the domestic chick model to investigate the neurobiological mechanisms involved in early ASD symptoms.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural correlates of masked and unmasked tones: psychoacoustics and late auditory evoked potentials (LAEPs)</a></h4>

              
                Hearing thresholds can be used to quantify one's hearing ability. In various masking conditions, hearing thresholds can vary depending on the auditory cues. With comodulated masking noise and interaural phase disparity (IPD), target detection can be facilitated, lowering detection thresholds. This perceptual phenomenon is quantified as masking release: comodulation masking release (CMR) and binaural masking level difference (BMLD). As these measures only reflect the low limit of hearing, the relevance of masking release at supra-threshold levels is still unclear. Here, we used both psychoacoustic and electro-physiological measures to investigate the effect of masking release at supra-threshold levels. We investigated whether the difference in the amount of masking release will affect listening at supra-threshold levels. We used intensity just-noticeable difference (JND) to quantify an increase in the salience of the tone. As a physiological correlate of JND, we investigated late auditory evoked potentials (LAEPs) with electroencephalography (EEG). The results showed that the intensity JNDs were equal at the same intensity of the tone regardless of masking release conditions. For LAEP measures, the slope of the P2 amplitudes with a function of the level was inversely correlated with the intensity JND. In addition, the P2 amplitudes were higher in dichotic conditions compared to diotic conditions. Estimated the salience of the target tone from both experiments suggested that the salience of masked tone at supra-threshold levels may only be beneficial with BMLD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Three-dimensional spike localization and improved motion correction for Neuropixels recordings</a></h4>

              
                Neuropixels (NP) probes are dense linear multi-electrode arrays that have rapidly become essential tools for studying the electrophysiology of large neural popula- tions. Unfortunately, a number of challenges remain in analyzing the large datasets output by these probes. Here we introduce several new methods for extracting use- ful spiking information from NP probes. First, we use a simple point neuron model, together with a neural-network denoiser, to efficiently map single spikes detected on the probe into three-dimensional localizations. Previous methods localized indi- vidual spikes in two dimensions only; we show that the new localization approach is significantly more robust and provides an improved feature set for clustering spikes according to neural identity (spike sorting). Next, we denoise the resulting three-dimensional point-cloud representation of the data, and show that the result- ing 3D images can be accurately registered over time, leading to improved tracking of time-varying neural activity over the probe, and in turn, crisper estimates of neural clusters over time. Open source code is available at https://github. com/int-brain-lab/spikes_localization_registration.git.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The effect of the preceding masking noise on monaural and binaural release from masking</a></h4>

              
                When a target tone is preceded by a noise, the threshold for target detection can be increased or decreased depending on the type of a preceding masker. The effect of preceding masker to the following sound can be interpreted as either the result of adaptation at the periphery or at the system level. To disentangle these, we investigated the time constant of adaptation by varying the length of the preceding masker. For inducing various masking conditions, we designed stimuli that can induce masking release. Comodulated masking noise and binaural cues can facilitate detecting a target sound from noise. These cues induce a decrease in detection thresholds, quantified as comodulation masking release (CMR) and binaural masking level difference (BMLD), respectively. We hypothesized that if the adaptation results from the top-down processing, both CMR and BMLD will be affected with increased length of the preceding masker. We measured CMR and BMLD when the length of preceding maskers varied from 0 (no preceding masker) to 500 ms. Results showed that CMR was more affected with longer preceding masker from 100 ms to 500 ms while the preceding masker did not affect BMLD. In this study, we suggest that the adaptation to preceding masking sound may arise from low level (e.g. cochlear nucleus, CN) rather than the temporal integration by the higher-level processing.

	<p>Knowledge of motor cortex connectivity is of great value in cognitive neuroscience, in order to provide a better understanding of motor organization and its alterations in pathological conditions. Traditional methods provide connectivity estimations which may vary depending on the task. This work aims to propose a new method for motor connectivity assessment based on the hypothesis of a task-independent connectivity network, assuming nonlinear behavior. The model considers six cortical regions of interest (ROIs) involved in hand movement. The dynamics of each region is simulated using a neural mass model, which reproduces the oscillatory activity through the interaction among four neural populations. Parameters of the model have been assigned to simulate both power spectral densities and coherences of a patient with left-hemisphere stroke during resting condition, movement of the affected, and movement of the unaffected hand. The presented model can simulate the three conditions using a single set of connectivity parameters, assuming that only inputs to the ROIs change from one condition to the other. The proposed procedure represents an innovative method to assess a brain circuit, which does not rely on a task-dependent connectivity network and allows brain rhythms and desynchronization to be assessed on a quantitative basis.</p>

	<p>Background: We investigated evoked potential (EP) changes during superficial temporal artery to middle cerebral artery (STA-MCA) bypass surgery and their correlations with imaging and clinical findings postoperatively. Methods: This retrospective study included patients who underwent STA-MCA bypass surgery due to ischemic stroke with large artery occlusion (MB group). Patients who underwent unruptured MCA aneurysm clipping were enrolled in the control group (MC group). Median and tibial somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP), and motor evoked potentials recorded from the abductor pollicis brevis (APB-MEP) and abductor hallucis (AH-MEP) were measured intraoperatively. Modified Rankin scale (mRS) and perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI) related variables, i.e., mean transit time (MTT) and time to peak (TTP), were assessed. Results: Δmedian SSEP, ΔAPB-MEP, and ΔAH-MEP were significantly higher in the MB group than in the MC group (p = 0.027, p = 0.006, and p = 0.015, respectively). APB-MEP and AH-MEP amplitudes were significantly increased at the final measurement (p = 0.010 and p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001, respectively). The ΔTTP asymmetry index was moderately correlated with ΔAPB-MEP (r = 0.573, p = 0.005) and ΔAH-MEP (r = 0.617, p = 0.002). ΔAPB-MEP was moderately correlated with ΔMTT (r = 0.429, p = 0.047) and ΔmRS at 1 month (r = 0.514, p = 0.015). Conclusions: MEP improvement during STA-MCA bypass surgery was partially correlated with PWI and mRS and could reflect the recovery in cerebral perfusion.</p>

	<p>Although many studies have documented associations between insecure attachment and psychopathology, attachment may not confer risk for psychopathology independently, but rather through its interaction with emotional, social, and biological factors. Understanding the variables through which attachment may lead to psychopathology is therefore important. Within this domain of research, the role of physiological factors is poorly investigated. What are the relevant domains and why, when, or for whom do they influence mental disorders relating to attachment? The current systematic review aims to answer these questions. Results reveal that physiological indices of emotional regulation play a role in explaining and/or determining the relationship between attachment and psychopathology. Specifically: (1) combined with insecure attachment, higher skin conductance level (SCL), lower cardiac slowing, and respiratory sinus arrhythmia modulation (RSA) contribute to different psychopathological indicators and behavioral/psychological dysfunctions, although the latter predicts a contradictory pattern of findings; (2) insecure-avoidant attachment is more consistently linked with stress and emotional dysregulation when combined with RSA, while anxious attachment confers risk of depressive symptoms when combined with SCL. We concluded our discussion of the results of seven studies by outlining a plan to move the field forward. We discuss the quality of the assessment, methodological limitations, and future directions, highlighting the need to extend the research to clinical samples.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10969861/most-recent">Retinal patterns and the cellular repertoire of neuropsin (Opn5) retinal ganglion cells</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Obtaining a parts list of the sensory components of the retina is vital to understanding the effects of light in behavior, health, and disease. Rods, cones, and intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) are the best described photoreceptors in the mammalian retina, but recent functional roles have been proposed for retinal neuropsin (Opn5) – an atypical opsin. However, little is known about the pattern of <i>Opn5</i> expression in the retina. Using cre (<i>Opn5<sup>cre</sup>
</i>) and cre-dependent reporters, we uncover patterns of <i>Opn5</i> expression and find that <i>Opn5</i> is restricted to retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). <i>Opn5</i>-RGCs are non-homogenously distributed through the retina, with greater densities of cells located in the dorsotemporal quadrant. In addition to local topology of these cells, using cre-dependent AAV viral tracing, we surveyed their central targets and found that they are biased towards image-forming and image-stabilizing regions. Finally, molecular and electrophysiological profiling reveal that <i>Opn5</i>-RGCs comprise previously defined RGC types which respond optimally to edges and object-motion (F-mini-ONs, HD2, HD1, LEDs, ooDSRGCs, etc.). Together, these data describe the second collection of RGCs that express atypical opsins in the mouse, and expand the roles of image-forming cells in retinal physiology and function.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Stratifying the presymptomatic phase of genetic frontotemporal dementia by serum NfL and pNfH: a longitudinal multicentre study</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>While the presymptomatic stages of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) provide a unique chance to delay or even prevent neurodegeneration by early intervention, they remain poorly defined. Leveraging a large multicentre cohort of genetic FTD mutation carriers, we provide a biomarker-based stratification and biomarker cascade of the likely most treatment-relevant stage within the presymptomatic phase: the conversion stage.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We longitudinally assessed serum levels of neurofilament light (NfL) and phosphorylated neurofilament heavy (pNfH) in the GENFI cohort (n = 444), using single-molecule array technique. Subjects comprised 91 symptomatic and 179 presymptomatic subjects with mutations in the FTD genes <i>C9orf72</i>, <i>GRN</i> or <i>MAPT</i>, and 174 mutation-negative within-family controls.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In a biomarker cascade, NfL increase preceded the hypothetical clinical onset by 15 years and concurred with brain atrophy onset, while pNfH increase started close to clinical onset. The conversion stage was marked by increased NfL, but still normal pNfH levels, while both were increased at the symptomatic stage. Intra-individual change rates were increased for NfL at the conversion stage and for pNfH at the symptomatic stage, highlighting their respective potential as stage-dependent dynamic biomarkers within the biomarker cascade. Increased NfL levels and NfL change rates allowed identification of presymptomatic subjects converting to symptomatic disease and capture of proximity-to-onset. We estimate stage-dependent sample sizes for trials aiming to decrease neurofilament levels or change rates.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Blood NfL and pNfH provide dynamic stage-dependent stratification and, potentially, treatment response biomarkers in presymptomatic FTD, allowing demarcation of the conversion stage. The proposed biomarker cascade might pave the way towards a biomarker-based precision medicine approach to genetic FTD.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sleep promoting neurons remodel their response properties to calibrate sleep drive with environmental demands.</a></h4>

              
                Falling asleep at the wrong time can place an individual at risk of immediate physical harm. However, not sleeping degrades cognition and adaptive behavior. To understand how animals match sleep need with environmental demands, we used live-brain imaging to examine the physiological response properties of the Drosophila sleep homeostat (dFB) following interventions that modify sleep (sleep deprivation, starvation, time-restricted feeding, memory consolidation). We report that dFB neurons can distinguish between different types of waking and can change their physiological response-properties accordingly. That is, dFB neurons are not simply passive components of a hard-wired circuit. Rather, the dFB neurons themselves can determine their response to the activity from upstream circuits. Finally, we show that the dFB appears to contain a memory trace of prior exposure to metabolic challenges induced by starvation or time-restricted feeding. Together these data highlight that the sleep homeostat is plastic and suggests an underlying mechanism.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">An extended amygdala-midbrain circuit controlling cocaine withdrawal-induced anxiety and reinstatement</a></h4>

              
                While midbrain dopamine (DA) neuronal circuits are central to motivated behaviors, much remains unknown about our knowledge of how these circuits are modified over time by experience to facilitate selective aspects of experience-dependent plasticity. Most studies of the DA system in drug addiction focus on the role of the mesolimbic DA pathway from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) in facilitating drug-associated reward. In contrast, less is known about how midbrain DA cells and associated circuits contribute to negative affective states including anxiety that emerge during protracted withdrawal from drug administration. Here, we demonstrate the selective role of a midbrain DA projection to the amygdala (VTADA-Amygdala) for anxiety that develops during protracted withdrawal from cocaine administration but does not participate in cocaine reward or sensitization. Our rabies virus-mediated circuit mapping approach revealed a persistent elevation in spontaneous and task-related activity of GABAergic cells from the bed nucleus of the stria terminals (BNST) and downstream VTADA-Amygdala cells that could be detected even after a single cocaine exposure. Activity in BNSTGABA cells was related to cocaine-induced anxiety but not reward or sensitization, and silencing the projection from these cells to the midbrain was sufficient to prevent the development of anxiety during protracted withdrawal following cocaine administration. We observed that VTADA-Amygdala cells, but not other midbrain DA cells, were strongly activated after a challenge exposure to cocaine, and found that activity in these cells was necessary for the expression of reinstatement of cocaine place preference. Lastly, the importance of activity in VTADA-Amygdala cells extends beyond cocaine, as these cells mediate the development of anxiety states triggered by morphine and a predator odor. Our results provide an exemplar for how to identify key circuit substrates that contribute to behavioral adaptations and reveal a critical role for BNSTGABA-VTADA-Amygdala pathway in anxiety states induced by drugs of abuse or natural experiences as well as cocaine-primed reinstatement of conditioned place preference.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dopamine neuron morphology and output are differentially controlled by mTORC1 and mTORC2</a></h4>

              
                The mTOR pathway is an essential regulator of cell growth and metabolism. Midbrain dopamine neurons are particularly sensitive to mTOR signaling status as activation or inhibition of mTOR alters their morphology and physiology. mTOR exists in two distinct multiprotein complexes termed mTORC1 and mTORC2. How each of these complexes affect dopamine neuron properties and whether they act together or independently is unknown. Here we investigated this in mice with dopamine neuron-specific deletion of Rptor or Rictor, which encode obligatory components of mTORC1 or mTORC2, respectively. We find that inhibition of mTORC1 strongly and broadly impacts dopamine neuron structure and function causing somatodendritic and axonal hypotrophy, increased intrinsic excitability, decreased dopamine production, and impaired dopamine release. In contrast, inhibition of mTORC2 has more subtle effects, with selective alterations to the output of ventral tegmental area dopamine neurons. As mTOR is involved in several brain disorders caused by dopaminergic dysregulation including Parkinson's disease and addiction, our results have implications for understanding the pathophysiology and potential therapeutic strategies for these diseases.

                Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II alpha (CaMKII) is an essential player in long-term potentiation and memory formation. However, the establishment of effective molecular interventions with CaMKII to improve memory remains a long-standing challenge. Here we report a novel intrabody targeting GluN1, a subunit of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs). We identify this anti-GluN1 intrabody (termed VHH Anti-GluN1; VHHAN1) by a synthetic phage display library selection and yeast-two-hybrid screenings. We validate specific targeting of VHHAN1 to GluN1 in heterologous cells and the mouse hippocampus. We further show that adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated expression of CaMKII fused with VHHAN1 is locally enriched at excitatory postsynaptic regions of the mouse hippocampus. We also find that the AAV- and VHHAN1-mediated postsynaptic enrichment of CaMKII in the hippocampus improves contextual fear memory in mice. This novel approach opens a new avenue to enhance memory ability in health and diseases.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Gabra5LHA Mediate Astrocytic GABA-induced Obesity via Decreasing Energy Expenditure</a></h4>

              
                The lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) regulates food intake and energy expenditure. Although LHA neurons innervate adipose tissues, the identity of neurons that regulate fat is undefined. Here we identify that Gabra5-positive neurons in LHA (Gabra5LHA) polysynaptically project to brown and white adipose tissues in the periphery. Gabra5LHA are a distinct subpopulation of GABAergic neurons and show decreased pacemaker firing in diet-induced obesity (DIO) mouse model. Gene silencing of Gabra5 in LHA decreases weight gain, whereas chemogenetic inhibition of LHA suppresses energy expenditure and increases weight gain. In DIO mouse model, Gabra5LHA are tonically inhibited by nearby reactive astrocytes releasing GABA, which is synthesized by MAOB. Administration of a MAOB inhibitor, KDS2010 reduces weight gain significantly without affecting food intake, which is recapitulated by gene-silencing of astrocytic MAOB in LHA. We propose that firing of Gabra5LHA facilitates energy expenditure and selective inhibition of astrocytic GABA is a molecular target for treating obesity.

                The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) mediates a variety of complex cognitive functions via its vast and diverse connections with cortical and subcortical structures. Understanding the patterns of synaptic connectivity that comprise the mPFC local network is crucial for deciphering how this circuit processes information and relays it to downstream structures. To elucidate the synaptic organization of the mPFC, we developed a high-throughput optogenetic method for mapping large-scale functional synaptic connectivity. We show that mPFC neurons that project to the basolateral amygdala display unique spatial patterns of local-circuit synaptic connectivity within the mPFC, which distinguish them from the general mPFC cell population. Moreover, the intrinsic properties of the postsynaptic mPFC cell and anatomical position of both cells jointly account for ~7.5% of the variation in probability of connection between mPFC neurons, with anatomical distance and laminar position explaining most of this fraction in variation. Our findings demonstrate a functional segregation of mPFC excitatory neuron subnetworks, and reveal the factors determining connectivity in the mPFC.

                Sleep need drives sleep and plays a key role in homeostatic regulation of sleep. So far sleep need can only be inferred by animal behaviors and indicated by electroencephalography (EEG). Here we report that threonine 221 (T221) of the salt inducible kinase 3 (SIK3) was important for the catalytic activity and stability of SIK3. T221 phosphorylation in the mouse brain indicates sleep need: more sleep resulting in less phosphorylation and less sleep more phosphorylation during daily sleep/wake cycle and after sleep deprivation (SD). Sleep need was reduced in SIK3 loss of function (LOF) mutants and by T221 mutation to alanine (T221A). Sleep rebound after SD was also decreased in SIK3 LOF and T221A mutant mice. Other kinases such as SIK1 and SIK2 or other sites in SIK3 do not fulfil criteria to be both an indicator and a controller of sleep need. Our results reveal SIK3 T221 phosphorylation as the first and only chemical modification which indicates and controls sleep need.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Mushroom body input connections form independently of sensory activity in Drosophila melanogaster</a></h4>

              
                Associative brain centers, such as the insect mushroom body, need to represent sensory information in an efficient manner. In Drosophila melanogaster, the Kenyon cells of the mushroom body integrate inputs from a random set of olfactory projection neurons, but some projection neurons, namely those activated by a few ethologically meaningful odors, connect to Kenyon cells more frequently than others. This biased and random connectivity pattern is conceivably advantageous, as it enables the mushroom body to represent a large number of odors as unique activity patterns while prioritizing the representation of a few specific odors. How this connectivity pattern is established remains largely unknown. Here, we test whether the mechanisms patterning the connections between Kenyon cells and projection neurons depend on sensory activity or whether they are hardwired. We mapped a large number of mushroom body input connections in anosmic flies, flies lacking the obligate odorant co-receptor Orco, and in wildtype flies. Statistical analyses of these datasets reveal that the random and biased connectivity pattern observed between Kenyon cells and projection neurons forms normally in the absence of most olfactory sensory activity. This finding supports the idea that even comparatively subtle, population-level patterns of neuronal connectivity can be encoded by fixed genetic programs and are likely to be the result of evolved prioritization of ecologically and ethologically salient stimuli.

	<p>The thromboembolic ischemia model is one of the most applicable for studying ischemic stroke in humans. The aim of this study was to develop a novel thromboembolic stroke model, allowing, by affordable tools, to reproduce cerebral infarction in rats. In the experimental group, the left common carotid artery, external carotid artery, and pterygopalatine branch of maxillary artery were ligated. A blood clot that was previously formed (during a 20 min period, in a catheter and syringe, by mixing with a thromboplastin solution and CaCl2) was injected into the left internal carotid artery. After 10 min, the catheter was removed, and the incision was sutured. The neurological status of the animals was evaluated using a 20-point scale. Histological examination of brain tissue was performed 6, 24, 72 h, and 6 days post-stroke. All groups showed motor and behavioral disturbances 24 h after surgery, which persisted throughout the study period. A histological examination revealed necrotic foci of varying severity in the cortex and subcortical regions of the ipsilateral hemisphere, for all experimental groups. A decrease in the density of hippocampal pyramidal neurons was revealed. Compared with existing models, the proposed ischemic stroke model significantly reduces surgical time, does not require an expensive operating microscope, and consistently reproduces brain infarction in the area of the middle cerebral artery supply.</p>

	<p>Alcohol addiction is regarded as a series of dynamic changes to neural circuitries. A comparison of the global network during different stages of alcohol addiction could provide an efficient way to understand the neurobiological basis of addiction. Two animal models (P-rats screened from an alcohol preference family, and NP-rats screened from an alcohol non-preference family) were trained for alcohol preference with a two-bottle free choice method for 4 weeks. To examine the changes in the neural response to alcohol during the development of alcohol preference and acute stimulation, different trials were studied with resting-state fMRI methods during different periods of alcohol preference. The correlation coefficients of 28 regions in the whole brain were calculated, and the results were compared for alcohol preference related to the genetic background/training association. The variety of coherence patterns was highly related to the state and development of alcohol preference. We observed significant special brain connectivity changes during alcohol preference in P-rats. The comparison between the P- and NP-rats highlighted the role of genetic background in alcohol preference. The results of this study support the alterations of the neural network connection during the formation of alcohol preference and confirm that alcohol preference is highly related to the genetic background. This study could provide an effective approach for understanding the neurobiological basis of alcohol addiction.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">miR‐146b protects the perinatal brain against microglia‐induced hypomyelination</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>In the premature newborn, perinatal inflammation mediated by microglia contributes significantly to neurodevelopmental injuries including white matter injury (WMI). Brain inflammation alters development through neuroinflammatory processes mediated by activation of homeostatic microglia toward a pro-inflammatory and neurotoxic phenotype. Investigating immune regulators of microglial activation is crucial to find effective strategies to prevent and treat WMI.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p><i>Ex vivo</i> microglial cultures and a mouse model of WMI induced by perinatal inflammation (interleukin-1-beta, IL-1β; postnatal day 1–5) were used to uncover and elucidate the role of microRNA-146b-5p in microglial activation and WMI.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A specific reduction <i>in vivo</i> in microglia of <i>Dicer</i>, a protein required for microRNAs maturation, reduces pro-inflammatory activation of microglia and prevents hypomyelination in our model of WMI. Microglial miRNome analysis in the WMI model identified miRNA-146b-5p as a candidate modulator of microglial activation. <i>Ex vivo</i> microglial cell culture treated with the pro-inflammatory stimulus lipopolysaccharide (LPS) led to overexpression of immunomodulatory miRNA-146b-5p but its drastic reduction in the microglial extracellular vesicles (EVs). To increase miR-146b-5p expression, we employed a 3DNA nanocarrier to deliver synthetic miR-146b-5p specifically to microglia. Enhancing microglial miR-146b-5p overexpression significantly decreased LPS-induced activation, down-regulated IRAK1 and restored miRNA-146b-5p levels in EVs. In our WMI model, 3DNA miR-146b-5p treatment significantly prevented microglial activation, hypomyelination and cognitive defect induced by perinatal inflammation.</p>
<h2>Interpretations</h2>
<p>These findings support that miR-146b-5p is a major regulator of microglia phenotype and could be targeted to reduce the incidence and the severity of perinatal brain injuries and their long-term consequences.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Optimal surgical extent for memory and seizure outcome in temporal lobe epilepsy</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Postoperative memory decline is an important consequence of anterior temporal lobe resection (ATLR) for temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), and the extent of resection may be a modifiable factor. This study aimed to define optimal resection margins for cognitive outcome while maintaining a high rate of postoperative seizure freedom.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This cohort study evaluated the resection extent on postoperative structural MRI using automated voxel-based methods and manual measurements in 142 consecutive patients with unilateral drug refractory TLE (74 left, 68 right TLE) who underwent standard ATLR.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Voxel-wise analyses revealed that postsurgical verbal memory decline correlated with resections of the posterior hippocampus and inferior temporal gyrus, whereas larger resections of the fusiform gyrus were associated with worsening of visual memory in left TLE. Limiting the posterior extent of left hippocampal resection to 55% reduced the odds of significant postoperative verbal memory decline by a factor of 8.1 (95% CI 1.5-44.4, p=0.02). Seizure freedom was not related to posterior resection extent, but to the piriform cortex removal after left ATLR. In right TLE, variability of the posterior extent of resection was not associated with verbal and visual memory decline or seizures after surgery.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The extent of surgical resection is an independent and modifiable risk factor for cognitive decline and seizures after left ATLR. Adapting the posterior extent of left ATLR might optimize postoperative outcome, with reduced risk of memory impairment while maintaining comparable seizure-freedom rates. The current, more lenient, approach might be appropriate for right ATLR.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">MicroRNA regulation of critical retinal pigment epithelial functions</a></h4>

              
                MicroRNAs are short, evolutionarily conserved noncoding RNAs that are critical for the control of normal cellular physiology. In the retina, photoreceptors are highly specialized neurons that transduce light into electrical signals. Photoreceptors, however, are unable to process visual stimuli without the support of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). The RPE performs numerous functions to aid the retina, including the generation of visual chromophore and metabolic support. Recent work has underscored how microRNAs enable vision through their contributions to RPE functions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Association of cochlear outer hair cell - type II spiral ganglion afferents with protection from noise-induced hearing loss</a></h4>

              
                The medial olivocochlear (MOC) efferent feedback circuit projecting to the cochlear outer hair cells (OHCs) confers protection from noise-induced hearing loss and is generally thought to be driven by inner hair cell (IHC) - type I spiral ganglion afferent (SGN) input. Knockout of the Prph gene (PrphKO) encoding the peripherin type III intermediate filament disrupted the OHC - type II SGN innervation and virtually eliminated MOC - mediated contralateral suppression from noise delivered to the opposite ear, measured as a reduction in cubic distortion product otoacoustic emissions. Electrical stimulation of the MOC pathway elicited contralateral suppression indistinguishable between wildtype (WT) and PrphKO mice, indicating that the loss of contralateral suppression was not due to disruption of the efferent arm of the circuit; IHC - type I SGN input was also normal, based on auditory brainstem responses. High-intensity, broadband noise (108 dB SPL, 1 hour) produced permanent hearing loss in PrphKO mice, but not in WT littermates. These findings associate OHC-type II input with MOC efferent - based otoprotection at loud sound levels.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cytoskeletal assembly in axonal outgrowth and regeneration analyzed on the nanoscale</a></h4>

              
                The axonal cytoskeleton is organized in a highly periodic structure, the membrane-associated periodic skeleton (MPS), which is essential to maintain the structure and function of the axon. Here, we use stimulated emission depletion microscopy (STED) of primary rat cortical neurons in microfluidic chambers to analyze the temporal and spatial sequence of MPS formation at the distal end of growing axons and during regeneration after axotomy. We demonstrate that the MPS does not extend continuously into the growing axon but develops from patches of periodic {beta}-spectrin II arrangements that grow and coalesce into a continuous scaffold. We estimate that the underlying sequence of nucleation, elongation, and subsequent coalescence of periodic {beta}-spectrin II patches takes around 15 hours. Strikingly, we find that development of the MPS occurs faster in regenerating axons after axotomy and note marked differences in the morphology of the growth cone and adjacent axonal regions between regenerating and unlesioned axons. Moreover, we find that inhibition of the spectrin-cleaving enzyme calpain accelerates MPS formation in regenerating axons and increases the number of regenerating axons after axotomy. Taken together, we provide here a detailed nanoscale analysis of MPS development in growing axons.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Octopamine drives honeybee thermogenesis</a></h4>

              
                In times of environmental change species have two options to survive: they either relocate to a new habitat or they adapt to the altered environment. Adaptation requires physiological plasticity and provides a selection benefit. In this regard, the Western honeybee (Apis mellifera) protrudes with its thermoregulatory capabilities, which enables a nearly worldwide distribution. Especially in the cold, shivering thermogenesis enables foraging as well as proper brood development and thus survival. In this study, we present octopamine signaling as a neurochemical prerequisite for honeybee thermogenesis: we were able to induce hypothermia by depleting octopamine in the flight muscles. Additionally, we could restore the ability to increase body temperature by administering octopamine. Thus we conclude, that octopamine is necessary and sufficient for thermogenesis. Moreover, we show that these effects are mediated by {beta} octopamine receptors. The significance of our results is highlighted by the fact the respective receptor genes underlie enormous selective pressure due to adaptation to cold climates. Finally, octopamine signaling in the service of thermogenesis might be a key strategy to survive in a changing environment.

	<p>Diagnostic and screening tests may have risks such as misdiagnosis, as well as the potential benefits of correct diagnosis. Effective communication of this risk to both clinicians and patients can be problematic. The purpose of this study was to develop a metric called the “efficiency index” (EI), defined as the ratio of test accuracy and inaccuracy, to evaluate screening tests for dementia. This measure was compared with a previously described “likelihood to be diagnosed or misdiagnosed” (LDM), also based on “numbers needed” metrics. Datasets from prospective pragmatic test accuracy studies examining four brief cognitive screening instruments (Mini-Mental State Examination; Montreal Cognitive Assessment; Mini-Addenbrooke’s Cognitive Examination (MACE); and Free-Cog) were analysed to calculate values for EI and LDM, and to examine their variation with test cut-off for MACE and dementia prevalence. EI values were also calculated using a modification of McGee’s heuristic for the simplification of likelihood ratios to estimate percentage change in diagnostic probability. The findings indicate that EI is easier to calculate than LDM and, unlike LDM, may be classified either qualitatively or quantitatively in a manner similar to likelihood ratios. EI shows the utility or inutility of diagnostic and screening tests, illustrating the inevitable trade-off between diagnosis and misdiagnosis. It may be a useful metric to communicate risk in a way that is easily intelligible for both clinicians and patients.</p>

	<p>Pavlovian-to-instrumental transfer (PIT) refers to a phenomenon whereby a classically conditioned stimulus (CS) impacts the motivational salience of instrumental behavior. We examined behavioral response patterns and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) based effective connectivity during an avoidance-based PIT task. Eleven participants (8 females; Mage = 28.2, SD = 2.8, range = 25–32 years) completed the task. Effective connectivity between a priori brain regions engaged during the task was determined using hemodynamic response function group iterative multiple model estimation (HRF-GIMME). Participants exhibited behavior that was suggestive of specific PIT, a CS previously associated with a reinforcing outcome increased instrumental responding directed at the same outcome. We did not find evidence for general PIT; a CS did not significantly increase instrumental responding towards a different but related outcome. Using HRF-GIMME, we recovered effective connectivity maps among corticostriatal circuits engaged during the task. Group-level paths revealed directional effects from left putamen to right insula and from right putamen to right cingulate. Importantly, a direct effect of specific PIT stimuli on blood–oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) activity in the left putamen was found. Results provide initial evidence of effective connectivity in key brain regions in an avoidance-based PIT task network. This study adds to the literature studying PIT effects in humans and employing GIMME models to understand how psychological phenomena are supported in the brain.</p>

	<p>We investigated the role of the human medio-temporal complex (hMT+) in the memory encoding and storage of a sequence of four coherently moving random dot kinematograms (RDKs), by applying repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) during an early or late phase of the retention interval. Moreover, in a second experiment, we also tested whether disrupting the functional integrity of hMT+ during the early phase impaired the precision of the encoded motion directions. Overall, results showed that both recognition accuracy and precision were worse in middle serial positions, suggesting the occurrence of primacy and recency effects. We found that rTMS delivered during the early (but not the late) phase of the retention interval was able to impair not only recognition of RDKs, but also the precision of the retained motion direction. However, such impairment occurred only for RDKs presented in middle positions along the presented sequence, where performance was already closer to chance level. Altogether these findings suggest an involvement of hMT+ in the memory encoding of visual motion direction. Given that both position sequence and rTMS modulated not only recognition but also the precision of the stored information, these findings are in support of a model of visual short-term memory with a variable resolution of each stored item, consistent with the assigned amount of memory resources, and that such item-specific memory resolution is supported by the functional integrity of area hMT+.</p>

	<p>Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease which gives a person a high risk of becoming care-dependent. During disease progression, the amount of care concerning activities of daily living can increase, possibly resulting in transition of the people with Parkinson’s disease (PwP) to a care facility. However, there is a lack of knowledge concerning the factors leading to institutionalization of PwP and the consequences for them and their informal caregivers. The aim of this cross-sectional retrospective study was to investigate reasons leading to the transition into an institutional care facility, the process of decision-making and its effects on PwP symptoms and caregiver burden. Participating PwP had to be institutionalized for at most one year after transition at study inclusion. Participants completed a range of semiquantitative questionnaires as well as the caregiving tasks questionnaire. Fourteen patient–caregiver pairs were included. PwP suffered from late-stage PD symptoms with high dependence on help, experiencing several hospitalizations before transition. Analyses revealed a significant decrease in caregiver burden and depressive symptoms of the caregivers after PwP institutionalization. Factors influencing the transition were, e.g., fear of PwP health issues and concerns about caregivers’ health. This study presents new insights into the process of institutionalization and its influence on caregiver burden, including aspects for discussions of physicians with PwP and their caregivers for counselling the decision to move to institutional care.</p>

	<p>Parinaud’s syndrome involves dysfunction of the structures of the dorsal midbrain. We investigated the pathophysiology related to the signs and symptoms to better understand the symptoms of Parinaud’s syndrome: diplopia, blurred vision, visual field defects, ptosis, squint, and ataxia, and Parinaud’s main signs of upward gaze paralysis, upper eyelid retraction, convergence retraction nystagmus (CRN), and pseudo-Argyll Robertson pupils. In upward gaze palsy, three structures are disrupted: the rostral interstitial nucleus of the medial longitudinal fasciculus (riMLF), interstitial nucleus of Cajal (iNC), and the posterior commissure. In CRN, there is a continuous discharge of the medial rectus muscle because of the lack of inhibition of supranuclear fibers. In Collier’s sign, the posterior commissure and the iNC are mainly involved. In the vicinity of the iNC, there are two essential groups of cells, the M-group cells and central caudal nuclear (CCN) group cells, which are important for vertical gaze, and eyelid control. Overstimulation of the M group of cells and increased firing rate of the CCN group causing eyelid retraction. External compression of the posterior commissure, and pretectal area causes pseudo-Argyll Robertson pupils. Pseudo-Argyll Robertson pupils constrict to accommodation and have a slight response to light (miosis) as opposed to Argyll Robertson pupils were there is no response to a light stimulus. In Parinaud’s syndrome patients conserve a slight response to light because an additional pathway to a pupillary light response that involves attention to a conscious bright/dark stimulus. Diplopia is mainly due to involvement of the trochlear nerve (IVth cranial nerve. Blurry vision is related to accommodation problems, while the visual field defects are a consequence of chronic papilledema that causes optic neuropathy. Ptosis in Parinaud’s syndrome is caused by damage to the oculomotor nerve, mainly the levator palpebrae portion. We did not find a reasonable explanation for squint. Finally, ataxia is caused by compression of the superior cerebellar peduncle.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Ocimum basilicum (kemangi) intervention on powder and microencapsulated Spirulina platensis and its bioactive molecules [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Spirulina platensis contains several bioactive molecules such as phenol, flavonoid and phycocyanin pigments. This study unveils total phenol, flavonoid, antioxidant activity, phycocyanin content and evaluated encapsulation efficiency from Ocimum basilicum intervention on S. platensis. O. basilicum intervention aims to reduce unpleasant odors from S. platensis that will increase consumption and increase bioactive compounds.   Methods: The intervention was carried out by soaking a S. platensis control sample (SP) in O. basilicum with a ratio of 1:4 (w/v) and it was then dried (DSB) and microencapsulated by freeze drying methods (MSB) using a combination of maltodextrin and gelatin. Total flavonoid and phenolic analysis with curve fitting analysis used a linear regression approach. Antioxidant activity of samples was analysed with the 2,2’-azino-bis-3-3thylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid (ABTS) method. Data were analysed using ANOVA at significance level (p < 0.05) followed by Tukey test models using SPSS v.22.  Results: The result of this study indicated that O. basilicum intervention treatment (DSB) has the potential to increase bioactive compounds such as total phenol, antioxidant activity and phycocyanin, and flavonoid content. Intervention of O. basilicum on S. platensis (DSB) significantly increases total phenol by 49.5% and phycocyanin by 40.7%. This is due to the phenol and azulene compounds in O. basilicum which have a synergistic effect on phenol and phycocyanin in S. platensis. Microencapsulation using a maltodexrin and gelatin coating is effective in phycocyanin protection and antioxidant activity with an encapsulation efficiency value of 71.58% and 80.5%.   Conclusion: The intervention of O. basilicum on S. platensis improved the total phenol and phycocyanin content and there is potential for a pharmaceutical product for a functional food and pharmaceutical product.

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Unsupervised Methods for Detection of Neural States: Case Study of Hippocampal-Amygdala Interactions</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The hippocampus and amygdala are functionally coupled brain regions that play a crucial role in processes involving memory and learning. Because interareal communication has been reported both during specific sleep stages and in awake, behaving animals, these brain regions can serve as an archetype to establish that measuring functional interactions is important for comprehending neural systems. To this end, we analyze here a public dataset of local field potentials (LFPs) recorded in rats simultaneously from the hippocampus and amygdala during different behaviors. Employing a specific, time-lagged embedding technique, named topological causality (TC), we infer directed interactions between the LFP band powers of the two regions across six frequency bands in a time-resolved manner. The combined power and interaction signals are processed with our own unsupervised tools developed originally for the analysis of molecular dynamics simulations to effectively visualize and identify putative, neural states that are visited by the animals repeatedly. Our proposed methodology minimizes impositions onto the data, such as isolating specific epochs, or averaging across externally annotated behavioral stages, and succeeds in separating internal states by external labels such as sleep or stimulus events. We show that this works better for two of the three rats we analyzed, and highlight the need to acknowledge individuality in analyses of this type. Importantly, we demonstrate that the quantification of functional interactions is a significant factor in discriminating these external labels, and we suggest our methodology as a general tool for large, multisite recordings.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Imaging human engrams using 7 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The investigation of the physical traces of memories (engrams) has made significant progress in the last decade due to optogenetics and fluorescent cell tagging applied in rodents. Engram cells were identified. The ablation of engram cells led to the loss of the associated memory, silent memories were reactivated, and artificial memories were implanted in the brain. Human engram research lags behind engram research in rodents due to methodological and ethical constraints. However, advances in multivariate analysis techniques of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data and machine learning algorithms allowed the identification of stable engram patterns in humans. In addition, MRI scanners with an ultrahigh field strength of 7 Tesla (T) have left their prototype state and became more common around the world to assist human engram research. Although most engram research in humans is still being performed with a field strength of 3T, fMRI at 7T will push engram research. Here, we summarize the current state and findings of human engram research and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of applying 7 versus 3T fMRI to image human memory traces.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Association between media use and poor sleep quality among senior high school students: a cross-sectional study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Poor sleep quality (PSQ) is an increasing health problem among adolescents. Mobile phones and portable media devices have become a part of children’s lives and may affect their sleep duration and quality. This study aimed to explore the prevalence of PSQ and identify the association between media use and PSQ among adolescents studying in high school grades 10-12. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted in central Thailand. A multi-stage sampling technique was used to enroll 777 adolescents from eight schools from August to October 2016. The research instruments comprised factors of demographics and consumption behaviors and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index questionnaire. Multivariable logistic regression was used to calculate adjusted odds ratios (ORadj) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results: Prevalence of PSQ was 56.24%. The study subjects were mostly 16-17 years old (67.82%) and female (70.39%). Multivariable logistic regression, after controlling for possible confounders, revealed an increased odds of PSQ among those who used a social media device (OR=1.34, 95%CI=0.97-1.87), and showed a higher proportion of social media use in the PSQ group. Conclusion: A surveillance system to detect media use and PSQ should be conducted accompanied by knowledge sharing on media use among parents, teachers and adolescents. To determine causal relationships, further longitudinal studies will be required to test the association between media users and PSQ. This study may also provide some implications for health promotion on sleep quality of senior high school students.

                How does the metabolically expensive mammalian brain adapt to food scarcity? Padamsey et al. show that under food restriction, mouse visual cortical neurons save ATP by decreasing excitatory currents. Compensatory mechanisms preserve spike rate but decrease coding precision of visual information. Supplementation with the fat mass-regulated hormone leptin restores coding precision.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Behavioral control by depolarized and hyperpolarized states of an integrating neuron</a></h4>

              
                Coordinated transitions between mutually exclusive motor states are central to behavioral decisions. During locomotion, the nematode <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> spontaneously cycles between forward runs, reversals, and turns with complex but predictable dynamics. Here, we provide insight into these dynamics by demonstrating how RIM interneurons, which are active during reversals, act in two modes to stabilize both forward runs and reversals. By systematically quantifying the roles of RIM outputs during spontaneous behavior, we show that RIM lengthens reversals when depolarized through glutamate and tyramine neurotransmitters and lengthens forward runs when hyperpolarized through its gap junctions. RIM is not merely silent upon hyperpolarization: RIM gap junctions actively reinforce a hyperpolarized state of the reversal circuit. Additionally, the combined outputs of chemical synapses and gap junctions from RIM regulate forward-to-reversal transitions. Our results indicate that multiple classes of RIM synapses create behavioral inertia during spontaneous locomotion.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The hepatic AMPK-TET1-SIRT1 axis regulates glucose homeostasis</a></h4>

              
                Ten-eleven translocation methylcytosine dioxygenase 1 (TET1) is involved in multiple biological functions in cell development, differentiation, and transcriptional regulation. <i>Tet1</i> deficient mice display the defects of murine glucose metabolism. However, the role of TET1 in metabolic homeostasis keeps unknown. Here, our finding demonstrates that hepatic TET1 physically interacts with SIRT1 <i>via</i> its C-terminal and activates its deacetylase activity, further regulating the acetylation-dependent cellular trans-localization of transcriptional factors PGC-1a and FOXO1, resulting in the activation of hepatic gluconeogenic gene expression that includes <i>PPARGC1A</i>, <i>G6PC</i>, and <i>SLC2A4</i>. Importantly, the hepatic gluconeogenic gene activation program induced by fasting is inhibited in <i>Tet1</i> heterozygous mice livers. The AMPK activators metformin or AICAR-two compounds that mimic fasting-elevate hepatic gluconeogenic gene expression dependent on in turn activation of the AMPK-TET1-SIRT1 axis. Collectively, our study identifies TET1 as a SIRT1 coactivator and demonstrates that the AMPK-TET1-SIRT1 axis represents a potential mechanism or therapeutic target for glucose metabolism or metabolic diseases.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Aversive stimuli bias corticothalamic responses to motivationally significant cues</a></h4>

              
                Making predictions about future rewards or punishments is fundamental to adaptive behavior. These processes are influenced by prior experience. For example, prior exposure to aversive stimuli or stressors changes behavioral responses to negative- and positive-value predictive cues. Here, we demonstrate a role for medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) neurons projecting to the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT; mPFC→PVT) in this process. We found that a history of aversive stimuli negatively biased behavioral responses to motivationally relevant cues in mice and that this negative bias was associated with hyperactivity in mPFC→PVT neurons during exposure to those cues. Furthermore, artificially mimicking this hyperactive response with selective optogenetic excitation of the same pathway recapitulated the negative behavioral bias induced by aversive stimuli, whereas optogenetic inactivation of mPFC→PVT neurons prevented the development of the negative bias. Together, our results highlight how information flow within the mPFC→PVT circuit is critical for making predictions about motivationally-relevant outcomes as a function of prior experience.
