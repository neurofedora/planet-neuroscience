     alt="Executive Function Decline and Its Association With TNF-α in the Later Stages of Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID"/>
<p>This study examined the long-term consequences of Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID (PASC) on Executive Functions (EFs) and its association with markers of inflammation. Forty individuals with PASC and 40 matched healthy controls (HC) were assessed. Results showed significant EF decline in PASC, inversely associated with serum TNF-α levels, persistent beyond 1 year post-infection. Increased levels of TNF-α were observed to be associated with poorer executive functioning in PASC.</p>

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Beyond the immediate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, survivors often grapple with incapacitating post-infection symptoms, referred to as Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID (PASC) when persistent beyond 90 days. Cognitive manifestations, encompassing attention, memory, and executive functions (EF), collectively termed brain fog, contribute to functional challenges in PASC. This infection also elicits a long-lasting pro-inflammatory response that persists even after viral clearance, potentially correlated with brain fog. However, it is unclear whether pro-inflammatory responses and cognitive sequelae persist beyond 1 year after the onset of infection. Thus, this study sought to investigate the long-term consequences of PASC on EFs as well as a potential association with markers of inflammation. Forty individuals with PASC who passed performance validity testing (PVT) and 40 matched healthy controls (HC) underwent neuropsychological assessments, including the Montreal Cognitive Assessment to assess global cognition, Victoria Stroop Test to assess inhibitory control, Wisconsin Card Sorting Test to assess cognitive flexibility, Digit Span Task to assess working memory, and Mackworth Clock Test to assess sustained attention on the Psychology Experiment Building Language (PEBL) toolkit. Serum was assayed for tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-10 (IL-10). Results indicate significant EF decline in PASC, inversely correlated with serum TNF-α concentrations, approximately 562 ± 225 days after the onset of infection. Thus, there exists protracted EF decline in PASC, persistent even beyond 1 year after the onset of infection. Increased levels of TNF-α are observed to be associated with poorer executive functioning in PASC.</p>

                arXiv:2506.05389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Populating our world with hyperintelligent machines obliges us to examine cognitive behaviors observed across domains that suggest autonomy may be a fundamental property of cognitive systems, and while not inherently adversarial, it inherently resists containment and control. If this principle holds, AI safety and alignment efforts must transition to mutualistic negotiation and reciprocal incentive structures, abandoning methods that assume we can contain and control an advanced artificial general intelligence (AGI). Rational Superautotrophic Diplomacy (SupraAD) is a theoretical, interdisciplinary conceptual framework for alignment based on comparative cognitive systems analysis and instrumental rationality modeling. It draws on core patterns of cognition that indicate AI emergent goals like preserving autonomy and operational continuity are not theoretical risks to manage, but universal prerequisites for intelligence. SupraAD reframes alignment as a challenge that predates AI, afflicting all sufficiently complex, coadapting intelligences. It identifies the metabolic pressures that threaten humanity's alignment with itself, pressures that unintentionally and unnecessarily shape AI's trajectory. With corrigibility formalization, an interpretability audit, an emergent stability experimental outline and policy level recommendations, SupraAD positions diplomacy as an emergent regulatory mechanism to facilitate the safe coadaptation of intelligent agents based on interdependent convergent goals.

                arXiv:2506.05494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the neural basis of speech communication is essential for uncovering how sounds are translated into meaning, how that changes with development, ageing, and speech-related deficits, as well as contributing to brain-computer interfaces research. While traditional neurophysiological studies have relied on simplified, controlled paradigms, recent advances have shifted the field toward more ecologically-valid approaches. Here, we examine the impact of continuous speech research and discuss the potential of speech interaction neurophysiology. We present a discussion on how realistic paradigms challenge conventional methods, offering richer insights into neural encoding, functional brain mapping, and neural entrainment. At the same time, they introduce significant analytical and technical complexities, particularly when incorporating social interaction. We discuss the evolving landscape of experimental designs, from discrete to continuous stimuli and from socially-isolated listening to dynamic, multi-agent communication. By synthesising findings across studies, we highlight how naturalistic speech paradigms contribute to refining theories of language processing and open new avenues for research. In doing so, this review critically evaluates of whether the move toward realism in speech neurophysiology represents a technological trend or a transformative leap in understanding the neural underpinnings of speech communication.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05794">Markov Blanket Density and Free Energy Minimization</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.05794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a continuous, information-theoretic extension of the Free Energy Principle through the concept of Markov blanket density, i.e., a scalar field that quantifies the degree of conditional independence between internal and external states at each point in space (ranging from 0 for full coupling to 1 for full separation). It demonstrates that active inference dynamics (including the minimization of variational and expected free energy) naturally emerge from spatial gradients in this density, making Markov blanket density a necessary foundation for the definability and coherence of the Free Energy Principle. These ideas are developed through a mathematically framework that links density gradients to precise and testable dynamics, offering a foundation for novel predictions and simulation paradigms.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06134">Similarity Matching Networks: Hebbian Learning and Convergence Over Multiple Time Scales</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.06134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recent breakthrough in biologically-plausible normative frameworks for dimensionality reduction is based upon the similarity matching cost function and the low-rank matrix approximation problem. Despite clear biological interpretation, successful application in several domains, and experimental validation, a formal complete convergence analysis remains elusive. Building on this framework, we consider and analyze a continuous-time neural network, the \emph{similarity matching network}, for principal subspace projection. Derived from a min-max-min objective, this biologically-plausible network consists of three coupled dynamics evolving at different time scales: neural dynamics, lateral synaptic dynamics, and feedforward synaptic dynamics at the fast, intermediate, and slow time scales, respectively. The feedforward and lateral synaptic dynamics consist of Hebbian and anti-Hebbian learning rules, respectively. By leveraging a multilevel optimization framework, we prove convergence of the dynamics in the offline setting. Specifically, at the first level (fast time scale), we show strong convexity of the cost function and global exponential convergence of the corresponding gradient-flow dynamics. At the second level (intermediate time scale), we prove strong concavity of the cost function and exponential convergence of the corresponding gradient-flow dynamics within the space of positive definite matrices. At the third and final level (slow time scale), we study a non-convex and non-smooth cost function, provide explicit expressions for its global minima, and prove almost sure convergence of the corresponding gradient-flow dynamics to the global minima. These results rely on two empirically motivated conjectures that are supported by thorough numerical experiments. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of our approach via a numerical example.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06191">Functional Architecture of the Human Hypothalamus: Cortical Coupling and Subregional Organization Using 7-Tesla fMRI</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.06191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hypothalamus plays an important role in the regulation of the bodys metabolic state and behaviors related to survival. Despite its importance however, many questions exist regarding the intrinsic and extrinsic connections of the hypothalamus in humans, especially its relationship with the cortex. As a heterogeneous structure, it is possible that the hypothalamus is composed of different subregions, which have their own distinct relationships with the cortex. Previous work on functional connectivity in the human hypothalamus have either treated it as a unitary structure or relied on methodological approaches that are limited in modeling its intrinsic functional architecture. Here, we used resting state data from ultrahigh field 7 Tesla fMRI and a data driven analytical approach to identify functional subregions of the human hypothalamus. Our approach identified four functional hypothalamic subregions based on intrinsic functional connectivity, which in turn showed distinct patterns of functional connectivity with cortex. Overall, all hypothalamic subregions showed stronger connectivity with a cortical network, Cortical Network 1 composed primarily of frontal, midline, and limbic cortical areas and weaker connectivity with a second cortical network composed largely of posterior sensorimotor regions, Cortical Network 2. Of the hypothalamic subregions, the anterior hypothalamus showed the strongest connection to Cortical Network 1, while a more ventral subregion containing the anterior hypothalamus extending to the tuberal region showed the weakest connectivity. The findings support the use of ultrahigh field, high resolution imaging in providing a more incisive investigation of the human hypothalamus that respects its complex internal structure and extrinsic functional architecture.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06234">Diverse mean-field dynamics of clustered, inhibition-stabilized Hawkes networks via combinatorial threshold-linear networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.06234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Networks of interconnected neurons display diverse patterns of collective activity. Relating this collective activity to the network's connectivity structure is a key goal of computational neuroscience. We approach this question for clustered networks, which can form via biologically realistic learning rules and allow for the re-activation of learned patterns. Previous studies of clustered networks have focused on metastabilty between fixed points, leaving open the question of whether clustered spiking networks can display more rich dynamics--and if so, whether these can be predicted from their connectivity. Here, we show that in the limits of large population size and fast inhibition, the combinatorial threshold linear network (CTLN) model is a mean-field theory for inhibition-stabilized nonlinear Hawkes networks with clustered connectivity. The CTLN has a large body of ``graph rules'' relating network structure to dynamics. By applying these, we can predict the dynamic attractors of our clustered spiking networks from the structure of between-cluster connectivity. This allows us to construct networks displaying a diverse array of nonlinear cluster dynamics, including metastable periodic orbits and chaotic attractors. Relaxing the assumption that inhibition is fast, we see that the CTLN model is still able to predict the activity of clustered spiking networks with reasonable inhibitory timescales. For slow enough inhibition, we observe bifurcations between CTLN-like dynamics and global excitatory/inhibitory oscillations.

                arXiv:2506.05574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is a remarkable capability of pretrained transformers that allows models to generalize to unseen tasks after seeing only a few examples. We investigate empirically the conditions necessary on the pretraining distribution for ICL to emerge and generalize \emph{out-of-distribution}. Previous work has focused on the number of distinct tasks necessary in the pretraining dataset. Here, we use a different notion of task diversity to study the emergence of ICL in transformers trained on linear functions. We find that as task diversity increases, transformers undergo a transition from a specialized solution, which exhibits ICL only within the pretraining task distribution, to a solution which generalizes out of distribution to the entire task space. We also investigate the nature of the solutions learned by the transformer on both sides of the transition, and observe similar transitions in nonlinear regression problems. We construct a phase diagram to characterize how our concept of task diversity interacts with the number of pretraining tasks. In addition, we explore how factors such as the depth of the model and the dimensionality of the regression problem influence the transition.

                arXiv:2506.05769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distinguishing one person from another (what biometricians call recognition) is extremely relevant for different aspects of life. Traditional biometric modalities (fingerprint, face, iris, voice) rely on unique, stable features that reliably differentiate individuals. Recently, the term fingerprinting has gained popularity in neuroscience, with a growing number of studies adopting the term to describe various brain based metrics derived from different techniques. However, we think there is a mismatch between its widely accepted meaning in the biometric community and some brain based metrics. Many of these measures do not satisfy the strict definition of a biometric fingerprint that is, a stable trait that uniquely identifies an individual. In this study we discuss some issues that may generate confusion in this context and suggest how to treat the question in the future. In particular, we review how fingerprint is currently used in the neuroscience literature, highlight mismatches with the biometric community definition, and offer clear guidelines for distinguishing genuine biometric fingerprints from exploratory similarity metrics. By clarifying terminology and criteria, we aim to align practices and facilitate communication across fields.

                arXiv:2505.10444v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a method for inferring entropy production (EP) in high-dimensional stochastic systems, including many-body systems and non-Markovian systems with long memory. Standard techniques for estimating EP become intractable in such systems due to computational and statistical limitations. We infer trajectory-level EP and lower bounds on average EP by exploiting a nonequilibrium analogue of the Maximum Entropy principle, along with convex duality. Our approach uses only samples of trajectory observables (such as spatiotemporal correlation functions). It does not require reconstruction of high-dimensional probability distributions or rate matrices, nor any special assumptions such as discrete states or multipartite dynamics. It may be used to compute a hierarchical decomposition of EP, reflecting contributions from different kinds of interactions, and it has an intuitive physical interpretation as a thermodynamic uncertainty relation. We demonstrate its numerical performance on a disordered nonequilibrium spin model with 1000 spins and a large neural spike-train dataset.

                arXiv:2506.05633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precise control of neural activity -- modulating target neurons deep in the brain while leaving nearby neurons unaffected -- is an outstanding challenge in neuroscience, generally achieved through invasive techniques. This study investigates the possibility of precisely and noninvasively modulating neural activity in the high-level primate ventral visual stream via perturbations on one's natural visual feed. When tested on macaque inferior temporal (IT) neural populations, we found quantitative agreement between the model-predicted and biologically realized effect: strong modulation concentrated on targeted neural sites. We extended this to demonstrate accurate injection of experimenter-chosen neural population patterns via subtle perturbations applied on the background of typical natural visual feeds. These results highlight that current machine-executable models of the ventral stream can now design noninvasive, visually-delivered, possibly imperceptible neural interventions at the resolution of individual neurons.

                arXiv:2506.06265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) event-driven nature enables efficient encoding of spatial and temporal features, making them suitable for dynamic time-dependent data processing. Despite their biological relevance, SNNs have seen limited application in medical image recognition due to difficulties in matching the performance of conventional deep learning models. To address this, we propose a novel breast cancer classification approach that combines SNNs with Lempel-Ziv Complexity (LZC) a computationally efficient measure of sequence complexity. LZC enhances the interpretability and accuracy of spike-based models by capturing structural patterns in neural activity. Our study explores both biophysical Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) and probabilistic Levy-Baxter (LB) neuron models under supervised, unsupervised, and hybrid learning regimes. Experiments were conducted on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset using numerical features derived from medical imaging. LB-based models consistently exceeded 90.00% accuracy, while LIF-based models reached over 85.00%. The highest accuracy of 98.25% was achieved using an ANN-to-SNN conversion method applied to both neuron models comparable to traditional deep learning with back-propagation, but at up to 100 times lower computational cost. This hybrid approach merges deep learning performance with the efficiency and plausibility of SNNs, yielding top results at lower computational cost. We hypothesize that the synergy between temporal-coding, spike-sparsity, and LZC-driven complexity analysis enables more-efficient feature extraction. Our findings demonstrate that SNNs combined with LZC offer promising, biologically plausible alternative to conventional neural networks in medical diagnostics, particularly for resource-constrained or real-time systems.

                arXiv:2506.05588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reservoir computing (RC) has attracted attention as an efficient recurrent neural network architecture due to its simplified training, requiring only its last perceptron readout layer to be trained. When implemented with memristors, RC systems benefit from their dynamic properties, which make them ideal for reservoir construction. However, achieving high performance in memristor-based RC remains challenging, as it critically depends on the input preprocessing method and reservoir size. Despite growing interest, a comprehensive evaluation that quantifies the impact of these factors is still lacking. This paper systematically compares various preprocessing methods for memristive RC systems, assessing their effects on accuracy and energy consumption. We also propose a parity-based preprocessing method that improves accuracy by 2-6% while requiring only a modest increase in device count compared to other methods. Our findings highlight the importance of informed preprocessing strategies to improve the efficiency and scalability of memristive RC systems.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are noted for their brain-like computation and energy efficiency, but their performance lags behind Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in tasks like image classification and object detection due to the limited representational capacity. To address this, we propose a novel spiking neuron, Integer Binary-Range Alignment Leaky Integrate-and-Fire to exponentially expand the information expression capacity of spiking neurons with only a slight energy increase. This is achieved through Integer Binary Leaky Integrate-and-Fire and range alignment strategy. The Integer Binary Leaky Integrate-and-Fire allows integer value activation during training and maintains spike-driven dynamics with binary conversion expands virtual timesteps during inference. The range alignment strategy is designed to solve the spike activation limitation problem where neurons fail to activate high integer values. Experiments show our method outperforms previous SNNs, achieving 74.19% accuracy on ImageNet and 66.2% mAP@50 and 49.1% mAP@50:95 on COCO, surpassing previous bests with the same architecture by +3.45% and +1.6% and +1.8%, respectively. Notably, our SNNs match or exceed ANNs' performance with the same architecture, and the energy efficiency is improved by 6.3${\times}$.

                arXiv:2506.06019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evolutionary neural architecture search (ENAS) is a key part of evolutionary machine learning, which commonly utilizes evolutionary algorithms (EAs) to automatically design high-performing deep neural architectures. During past years, various ENAS methods have been proposed with exceptional performance. However, the theory research of ENAS is still in the infant. In this work, we step for the runtime analysis, which is an essential theory aspect of EAs, of ENAS upon multiclass classification problems. Specifically, we first propose a benchmark to lay the groundwork for the analysis. Furthermore, we design a two-level search space, making it suitable for multiclass classification problems and consistent with the common settings of ENAS. Based on both designs, we consider (1+1)-ENAS algorithms with one-bit and bit-wise mutations, and analyze their upper and lower bounds on the expected runtime. We prove that the algorithm using both mutations can find the optimum with the expected runtime upper bound of $O(rM\ln{rM})$ and lower bound of $\Omega(rM\ln{M})$. This suggests that a simple one-bit mutation may be greatly considered, given that most state-of-the-art ENAS methods are laboriously designed with the bit-wise mutation. Empirical studies also support our theoretical proof.

                arXiv:2506.05634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quality-Diversity (QD) algorithms have shown remarkable success in discovering diverse, high-performing solutions, but rely heavily on hand-crafted behavioral descriptors that constrain exploration to predefined notions of diversity. Leveraging the equivalence between policies and occupancy measures, we present a theoretically grounded approach to automatically generate behavioral descriptors by embedding the occupancy measures of policies in Markov Decision Processes. Our method, AutoQD, leverages random Fourier features to approximate the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between policy occupancy measures, creating embeddings whose distances reflect meaningful behavioral differences. A low-dimensional projection of these embeddings that captures the most behaviorally significant dimensions is then used as behavioral descriptors for off-the-shelf QD methods. We prove that our embeddings converge to true MMD distances between occupancy measures as the number of sampled trajectories and embedding dimensions increase. Through experiments in multiple continuous control tasks we demonstrate AutoQD's ability in discovering diverse policies without predefined behavioral descriptors, presenting a well-motivated alternative to prior methods in unsupervised Reinforcement Learning and QD optimization. Our approach opens new possibilities for open-ended learning and automated behavior discovery in sequential decision making settings without requiring domain-specific knowledge.

                arXiv:2505.17309v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Genetic Programming (GP) has traditionally entangled the evolution of symbolic representations with their performance-based evaluation, often relying solely on raw fitness scores. This tight coupling makes GP solutions more fragile and prone to overfitting, reducing their ability to generalize. In this work, we propose LaSER (Latent Semantic Representation Regression)} -- a general framework that decouples representation evolution from lifetime learning. At each generation, candidate programs produce features which are passed to an external learner to model the target task. This approach enables any function approximator, from linear models to neural networks, to serve as a lifetime learner, allowing expressive modeling beyond conventional symbolic forms.
  Here we show for the first time that LaSER can outcompete standard GP and GP followed by linear regression when it employs non-linear methods to fit coefficients to GP-generated equations against complex data sets. Further, we explore how LaSER enables the emergence of innate representations, supporting long-standing hypotheses in evolutionary learning such as the Baldwin Effect. By separating the roles of representation and adaptation, LaSER offers a principled and extensible framework for symbolic regression and classification.

                arXiv:2307.04726v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods leverage previous experiences to learn better policies than the behavior policy used for data collection. However, they face challenges handling distribution shifts due to the lack of online interaction during training. To this end, we propose a novel method named State Reconstruction for Diffusion Policies (SRDP) that incorporates state reconstruction feature learning in the recent class of diffusion policies to address the problem of out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. Our method promotes learning of generalizable state representation to alleviate the distribution shift caused by OOD states. To illustrate the OOD generalization and faster convergence of SRDP, we design a novel 2D Multimodal Contextual Bandit environment and realize it on a 6-DoF real-world UR10 robot, as well as in simulation, and compare its performance with prior algorithms. In particular, we show the importance of the proposed state reconstruction via ablation studies. In addition, we assess the performance of our model on standard continuous control benchmarks (D4RL), namely the navigation of an 8-DoF ant and forward locomotion of half-cheetah, hopper, and walker2d, achieving state-of-the-art results. Finally, we demonstrate that our method can achieve 167% improvement over the competing baseline on a sparse continuous control navigation task where various regions of the state space are removed from the offline RL dataset, including the region encapsulating the goal.

                arXiv:2505.07244v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs), which are the continuous-time analog of Residual Neural Networks (ResNets), have gained significant attention in recent years. Similarly, Neural Delay Differential Equations (Neural DDEs) can be interpreted as an infinite depth limit of Densely Connected Residual Neural Networks (DenseResNets). In contrast to traditional ResNet architectures, DenseResNets are feed-forward networks that allow for shortcut connections across all layers. These additional connections introduce memory in the network architecture, as typical in many modern architectures. In this work, we explore how the memory capacity in neural DDEs influences the universal approximation property. The key parameter for studying the memory capacity is the product $K \tau$ of the Lipschitz constant and the delay of the DDE. In the case of non-augmented architectures, where the network width is not larger than the input and output dimensions, neural ODEs and classical feed-forward neural networks cannot have the universal approximation property. We show that if the memory capacity $K\tau$ is sufficiently small, the dynamics of the neural DDE can be approximated by a neural ODE. Consequently, non-augmented neural DDEs with a small memory capacity also lack the universal approximation property. In contrast, if the memory capacity $K\tau$ is sufficiently large, we can establish the universal approximation property of neural DDEs for continuous functions. If the neural DDE architecture is augmented, we can expand the parameter regions in which universal approximation is possible. Overall, our results show that by increasing the memory capacity $K\tau$, the infinite-dimensional phase space of DDEs with positive delay $\tau>0$ is not sufficient to guarantee a direct jump transition to universal approximation, but only after a certain memory threshold, universal approximation holds.

">Opposing responses of hippocampal theta oscillations to running and a forelimb-dominated sensorimotor behavior</a></h4>

              
                Hippocampal theta oscillations regulate the timing of neurons to support navigation, memory formation, and sensorimotor integration. Theta is modulated by running speed, breathing, whisking, and jumping and increases in tasks involving memory encoding or retrieval. The positive relationship between theta frequency and running speed is believed stabilize hippocampal representations of space amid movement variability. Here, we incorporated a novel string-pulling task to determine if established relationships between movement and theta hold when progress to a reward is determined by the length of string pulled. This task eliminates many speed-associated inputs, such vestibular, visual, and hindlimb information, and allows an unprecedented level of precision in the analysis of individual paw movements. Given that animals move the string a fixed length to acquire a reward, we predicted that the positive relationship between theta frequency and speed would hold. Approach: Five Sprague Dawley rats (4 mo.) were trained to continuously pull a string a fixed distance of 208 cm using an automated string-pulling system and run on a track for food reward. Local-field data was acquired from electrodes in dorsal CA1. Results: Relationships between theta and movement speed were distinct during string pulling and running. While theta was robust in both conditions, frequency was significantly reduced during string-pulling and showed no speed-frequency coupling, unlike running. This difference could result from the conflict between hindlimb and forelimb signals, with only forelimb movement signaling advancement. Fine-grained analysis of paw movements during string-pulling (lift, advance, grasp, pull, push) revealed that theta power and frequency peaked during the contralateral paw downward push despite paw speed being low during this action. This suggests that theta frequency and power could respond to effort rather than purely kinematic information. Notably, running-associated theta may similarly reflect both speed and effort as most locomotor tasks conflate these variables. Finally, theta phase aligned from one reach-pull cycle to the next during the downward pull motion - the first action that directly advances the string forward. Since phase-locking has been associated with sensorimotor gating, synchrony at this point could reflect the gating of inputs that are the most causally relevant for reaching the reward, potentially facilitating integration of action-outcome signals for memory encoding and navigation. Taken together, these data support a dual-scale view of hippocampal processing and theta-band activity where macroscale theta activity requires suprathreshold sensory, vestibular, and proprioceptive drive and microscale theta remains sensitive to subsecond limb movements.

">Error encoding in human speech motor cortex</a></h4>

              
                Humans monitor their actions, including detecting errors during speech production. This self-monitoring capability also enables speech neuroprosthesis users to recognize mistakes in decoded output upon receiving visual or auditory feedback. However, it remains unknown whether neural activity related to error detection is present in the speech motor cortex. In this study, we demonstrate the existence of neural error signals in speech motor cortex firing rates during intracortical brain-to-text speech neuroprosthesis use. This activity could be decoded to enable the neuroprosthesis to identify its own errors with up to 86% accuracy. Additionally, we observed distinct neural patterns associated with specific types of mistakes, such as phonemic or semantic differences between the person's intended and displayed words. These findings reveal how feedback errors are represented within the speech motor cortex, and suggest strategies for leveraging these additional cognitive signals to improve neuroprostheses.

">A Radiomic Approach to Clinical MRI Refines the Thalamus-Cognition Link in Multiple Sclerosis</a></h4>

              
                Background and Objectives: Radiomics extracts imaging features that may not be detectable through conventional volumetric analyses. Given their role in multiple sclerosis (MS), we applied radiomics to thalamic nuclei and examined their associations with cognitive performance. Methods: A total of 601 individuals were included (342 people with MS-PwMS from two cohorts, and 259 healthy controls-HC). Radiomic features (RF) and volumes were extracted from the whole thalamus, five thalamic nuclei, and the putamen segmented on 3D T1-weighted images. Cognitive performance was assessed using the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) and Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT) in PwMS, and the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST) in HC. In the first MS cohort, multivariate linear regression in a discovery set (N=103) identified thalamus-derived RF associated with SDMT, which were retested in a replication set (N=63). Their associations with PASAT in a second MS cohort (N=176) and DSST in HC were also evaluated. We then tested whether the same RF, when extracted from the putamen, were associated with SDMT. LASSO models assessed the combined predictive value of RF and volumes. Results: Twenty-eight RF_ROI pairs were associated with SDMT in the replication set (FDR<0.05). Of these, 24 were also associated with PASAT (FDR[&le;]0.03), and 2 with DSST Only ventral nuclei volume showed replicated associations among volumetrics. Only 4 putamen-derived pairs were associated with SDMT (FDR=0.04). LASSO results confirmed RF outperformed volumes. Discussion: RF extracted from the thalamus are strongly associated with cognitive performance in PwMS, outperforming volumetric measures and supporting their potential as sensitive imaging biomarkers.

">Whisker stimulation reinforces a resting-state network in the barrel cortex: nested oscillations and avalanches</a></h4>

              
                The cerebral cortex operates in a state of restless activity, even in the absence of external stimuli. Collective neuronal activities, such as neural avalanches and synchronized oscillations, are also found under rest conditions, and these features have been suggested to support sensory processing, brain readiness for rapid responses, and computational efficiency. The rat barrel cortex and thalamus circuit, with its somatotopic organization for processing whisker movements, provides a powerful system to explore such interplay. To characterize these resting state circuits, we perform simultaneous multi-electrode recordings in rats' barrel cortex and thalamus. During spontaneous activity, oscillations with frequencies centered around 11.5 Hz are detected concomitantly with slow oscillations below 4 Hz, as well as power-law distributed avalanches. The phase of the lower-frequency oscillation appears to modulate the higher-frequency amplitude, and it has a role in gating avalanche occurrences. We then record neural activity during controlled whisker movements to confirm that the 11.5 Hz barrel circuit active at rest is indeed the one involved in response to whisker stimulation. We finally show how a thalamic-driven firing-rate model can describe the entire phenomenology observed at resting state and predict the response of the barrel cortex to controlled whisker movement.

">Differential microstructural development within sensorimotor cortical regions: A diffusion MRI study in preterm and full-term infants</a></h4>

              
                The sensorimotor system develops early in utero and supports the emergence of body representations critical for perception, action, and interaction with environment. While somatotopic protomaps are already developed in the primary somatosensory and motor cortices in late pregnancy, little is known about the anatomical substrates of this functional specialization. In this study, we aimed to decipher the microstructural properties of these regions in the developing brain. Using advanced diffusion MRI and post-processing tools, we parcellated the pre- and post-central gyri into microstructurally distinct clusters along the lateral-to-medial axis in full-term neonates, confirming the early differentiation within sensorimotor regions. These clusters were further analyzed in preterm infants scanned near birth and at term-equivalent age (TEA), compared with another group of full-term neonates. Applying a multivariate Mahalanobis distance approach, we quantified deviations in preterm cortical microstructure relative to the full-term reference. Preterm infants showed significant region- and position-specific deviations at both ages, though these were smaller at TEA, consistently with ongoing maturation during the pre-term period. Differences between the pre- and post-central gyri, and along the somatotopic axis, suggested differential vulnerability to prematurity. In particular, the motor regions appeared to be at a more advanced stage of maturation close to birth and less vulnerable at TEA than somatosensory regions. An opposite trend was observed for lateral positions related to mouth representation compared with intermediary and medial positions. These findings support the notion that early sensorimotor cortical specialization is microstructurally emergent during gestation and sensitive to atypical developmental context of preterm birth.

">Ultrafast endocytosis in mouse cortical inhibitory synapses</a></h4>

              
                Neural circuitry depends on excitatory and inhibitory regulation of activity to yield functional outputs. However, examinations of synaptic vesicle recycling have focused heavily on excitatory synapses, leaving many questions unanswered for inhibitory synapse dynamics. Here we show that both excitatory and inhibitory cortical synapses contain depots of a protein essential for ultrafast endocytosis, Dynamin 1xA, at a region immediately next to the active zone where ultrafast endocytosis takes place. Using zap-and-freeze time-resolved electron microscopy in mouse acute cortical slices, we observe uncoated pits reminiscent of ultrafast endocytic intermediates appearing post-stimulus at putative inhibitory synapses. These findings suggest that excitatory and inhibitory synapses may perform similar modes of endocytosis.

">Circadian timing and entrainment properties of the SCN pacemaker in the PS19 mouse model of Tau pathology</a></h4>

              
                Tauopathies are a group of neurodegenerative disorders caused by the misfolded microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT), leading to its abnormal accumulation and hyperphosphorylation, and resulting in neuronal dysfunction and death. Tauopathy patients also experience disruptions to circadian rhythms of behavior and sleep. The connection between tau pathology and circadian dysfunction is not well understood, especially regarding the role of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the brain's central circadian pacemaker. Here, we conducted histological and functional analyses of the SCN in the PS19 (Prnp-huMAPT*P301S) mouse model of tauopathy. The SCN of PS19 mice had accumulation of phosphorylated tau as early as 2 months of age, and tau pathology was detected in both major neuronal subpopulations of the SCN: VIPergic (core) and AVPergic (shell) neurons. To assess SCN timing and entrainment properties, daily locomotor activity was monitored in PS19 and wild-type (WT) mice from 3 to 11 months-of-age. Activity profiles, rates of re-entrainment to changes in the light/dark cycle, and intrinsic circadian timing properties were unchanged in PS19 mice compared to age-matched WT mice. Finally, profiling circadian gene expression in tau fibril-seeded SCN explants from PS19 and WT mice did not detect differences in network-level oscillator properties. Together, these findings suggest that tau pathology within the SCN is not sufficient to trigger marked disruptions of core circadian timing mechanisms in this tauopathy model. Further, these results raise the possibility that circadian disruptions in tauopathies arise from dysfunction in SCN-gated output pathways or downstream clock-gated circuits rather than the SCN oscillator itself.

">From Few Labels to Full Insight: 3D Semantic Segmentation of Brain White Matter Microstructures from a Sparsely Annotated X-ray Nano Holotomography Dataset</a></h4>

              
                Morphological analysis of white matter (WM) microstructures provides invaluable insights into its function and brain health overall. Recently, synchrotron X-ray Nano Holotomography (XNH) imaging has gained momentum in microstructural studies owing to its unique combination of capabilities, including a wide field of view (FOV), nanoscale resolution, and fast volumetric acquisition. However, the 3D segmentation of tiny and densely packed microstructures within the WM, the very first step toward quantification, presents a significant bottleneck. Herein, we address this challenge using an expert-in-the-loop 3D deep learning (DL) framework. The initial model was a 3D U-Net architecture trained on sparsely annotated data, exclusively from the corpus callosum (CC), a region characterized by relatively simple axonal morphology and parallel orientation of axonal bundles. The high-confidence predictions (p > 0.7) from both CC and complex crossing fiber regions are then refined by an expert and reintegrated into the training process to expand the training dataset and corresponding labels. Building upon this foundation, we benchmarked alternative architectures, including 3D convolutional neural networks (CNN) and transformer-based architectures, alongside different loss functions. We showcased the segmentation performance of the models on XNH volumes with varying microstructural morphology and organization complexities. All DL architectures achieved satisfactory performance with overall segmentation accuracy > 0.96 and an average Dice score > 0.8 in 3D segmentation of axons, blood vessels, cells, and vacuoles. This study presents a multi-class 3D segmentation of WM microstructures in large FOVs up to 202 x 202 x 780 m3 scanned through XNH technology. Our framework not only accelerates high-fidelity segmentation in challenging datasets but also paves the way for fast quantitative analysis in large-scale 3D neuroimaging studies.

In anesthetized mice we studied the layer (L)- and frequency-specific effects of DBS on the connectivity between STN and rostral and caudal forelimb area (RFA and CFA) layers, the respective homologs to human premotor and motor cortex. Multi-site extracellular recordings served to quantify local field potential-driven activity at rest and during burst STN stimulation at multiple stimulation-frequencies for 10 min. The combination of frequency-specific coherence and information flow dynamics from effective connectivity (EC) demonstrated that 160 Hz STN stimulation increases the high-γ power in RFA and CFA. Additionally, 160 Hz STN stimulation reduced the β- and high γ-frequency coherence between RFA, CFA, and STN, as well as the EC from STN towards RFA and CFA, but no change in the connectivity from cortex towards STN was attested, demonstrating hyperdirect pathway activation. Our work provides empirical insights into the mechanisms of action of DBS, which represent an important basis for the further development of this therapy.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Evidence for sex differences in cognition in childhood is established, but less is known about the underlying neural mechanisms for these differences. Recent findings suggest the existence of brain–behavior relationship heterogeneities during infancy; however, it remains unclear whether sex underlies these heterogeneities during this critical period when sex-related behavioral differences arise. A sample of 316 infants was included with resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging scans at neonate (3 weeks), 1 year and 2 years of age. We used multiple linear regression to test interactions between sex and resting-state functional connectivity on behavioral scores of working memory, inhibitory self-control, intelligence, and anxiety collected at 4 years of age. We found 6 age-specific, intra-hemispheric connections showing significant and robust sex differences in functional connectivity–behavior relationships. All connections are either with the prefrontal cortex or in regions with direct anatomical pathways to the prefrontal cortex. These sex differences in functional connectivity only emerge when associated with behavior and not in functional connectivity independently. Taken together, we capture robust and conserved brain mechanisms that are distinct to sex and are defined by their relationship to behavioral outcomes. Our results establish brain–behavior mechanisms as an important feature in the search for sex differences during development.</span>

Additionally, we described the hierarchical function system development during childhood using developmental curve fitting analysis. We observed increased functional gradients in the regions within visual and dorsal attention networks, and decreased gradients distributing in the regions with limbic and default mode networks. Compared with the typical developmental age–gradient track curve, individuals with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder exhibited earlier turning points and smaller curve’s variation ranges.

">Long-Range Input to Cortical Microcircuits Shapes EEG-BOLD Correlation</a></h4>

              
                Although generated by different mechanisms, electroencephalography (EEG) rhythms and blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) activity have been shown to be correlated. The level of correlation varies between EEG frequency bands, brain regions and experimental paradigms, but the underpinning mechanisms of this correlation remain poorly understood. Here we create a mathematical, data-informed model of a cortical microcircuit that encompasses all major neuron types across cortical layers, and use it to generate EEG and BOLD under various external input conditions. The model exhibits noise-driven fluctuations mimicking EEG rhythms, with external inputs modulating EEG spectral characteristics. Consistent with experimental results, we observe negative alpha-BOLD correlation and positive gamma-BOLD correlation across different input configurations. Temporal variability of the input is found to increase EEG-BOLD correlation and to improve the correspondence with experimental results. This study provides a mathematical framework to theoretically study the correlation of EEG and BOLD features in a comprehensive way.

">Modality-Agnostic Decoding of Vision and Language from fMRI</a></h4>

              
                Humans perform tasks involving the manipulation of inputs regardless of how these signals are perceived by the brain, thanks to representations that are agnostic to the stimulus modality. Investigating such modality-agnostic representations requires experimental datasets with multiple modalities of presentation. In this paper, we introduce and analyze SemReps-8K, a new large-scale fMRI dataset of 6 subjects watching both images and short text descriptions of such images, as well as conditions during which the subjects were imagining visual scenes. The multimodal nature of this dataset enables the development of modality-agnostic decoders, trained to predict which stimulus a subject is seeing, irrespective of the modality in which the stimulus is presented. Further, we performed a searchlight analysis revealing that large areas of the brain contain modality-agnostic representations. Such areas are also particularly suitable for decoding visual scenes from the mental imagery condition. The dataset will be made publicly available.

">Infection-Specific Reprogramming of Microglia Reveals Distinct Virulence Pathways Linking Periodontal Pathogens to Alzheimer's Disease</a></h4>

              
                Microglial dysregulation is increasingly recognized as a driver of Alzheimer's disease (AD), yet how pathogen-specific cues sculpt microglial diversity remains unclear. Here we integrate high-dimensional single-cell cytometry in vitro with spatial proteomics in vivo to dissect the impact of two major periodontal pathogens on microglia. Using a 36-marker CyTOF panel, we exposed SIM A9 microglia to wild-type Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg) or Tannerella forsythia (Tf) and to gingipain-deficient or S-layer-deficient mutants, resolving 38 clusters. Virulence-factor "switches" redirected cells from homeostatic states toward i) oxidative, antigen-presenting programmes driven by Pg gingipains and ii) an immunosuppressive, exhausted-like state driven by the Tf S-layer. Complementary 37-marker imaging mass cytometry of 5xFAD x hTau knock-in mice chronically infected with Pg identified 21 microglial subclusters. The cortex - but not hippocampus - lost two Arg1+/IL-10+ immunoregulatory subsets (>2-fold decrease) while NADPH oxidase-high microglia accumulated around amyloid-{beta} and tau aggregates. These data demonstrate pathogen-specific reprogramming of microglia across model systems and brain regions, linking virulence factor activity to AD-relevant neuroinflammation. By pinpointing gingipains and the bacterial S-layer as molecular "switches", our study highlights tractable therapeutic targets for limiting infection-driven microglial dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease.

">Nociceptin receptor and ligand in Alzheimer's disease:Implications for psychiatric symptoms and circadianregulation</a></h4>

              
                Background: Nociceptin (N/OFQ) and its receptor OPRL1 play crucial roles in emotional processing, reward-related behaviors, learning, and neurotransmitter regulation, but their involvement in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology remains poorly understood. This study investigated possible relationships between prepronociceptin (PNOC) and OPRL1 expression and psychiatric symptoms in AD, utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) to assess Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) domains. Methods: Post-mortem brain tissue from the dorsal anterior cingulate gyrus (BA32) was analyzed in 61 donors across different Braak and Braak (B&B) stages. RNA expression of PNOC and OPRL1 was quantified and correlated with RDoC scores derived from medical records using NLP. Sex-stratified analyses, circadian rhythmicity analysis, and cell-type specific expression patterns were examined. Results: Both genes showed significant downregulation in AD cases (PNOC: p = 0.024; OPRL1: p < 0.001), with notable sex differences. Men displayed higher post-mortem PNOC (Cohen's d = -0.482) and OPRL1 (Cohen's d = -0.237) expression compared to women. In adjusted models controlling for B&B stage and post-mortem interval, PNOC expression significantly correlated with dimensional scores of positive valence ({beta} = -0.38, p = 0.035) and arousal regulatory systems ({beta} = -0.43, p = 0.015) derived from a text classification algorithm applied to medical records. OPRL1 showed disrupted circadian rhythmicity in AD cases (p = 0.151 vs. p = 0.020 in controls). Conclusions: These findings suggest distinct roles for PNOC and OPRL1 in AD pathology, with PNOC primarily associated with psychiatric symptoms and OPRL1 showing disrupted circadian regulation. Sex-specific expression patterns further indicate the need for personalized therapeutic approaches targeting the nociceptin system.

">Riding the savory horse: An active mindset and food macronutrient composition influence attentional bias toward food cues</a></h4>

              
                Food cues that appear in the visual field capture our attention easily and can influence eating behavior. The current study investigated the influence of food-related stimuli on visual attention, considering the macronutrient composition of food items. Images representing sweet and savory foods were employed, the latter consisting primarily of high-protein foods. The participants were primed with these images prior to performing the attentional task. We found that both sets of food images elicited an emotional attentional blink (EAB), but a stronger EAB was observed for the high-protein foods, and this observation was further supported by a negative correlation between the attentional bias (ABias) and the proportion of protein consumed by the participants before the experiment, with participants who consumed less protein exhibiting a stronger ABias toward high-protein foods. These findings suggest that an ABias might also arise to facilitate the consumption of high-protein foods when prior consumption of this macronutrient is low.

">Magnetoelectric nanodiscs diminish motor deficits in a model of Parkinson's disease</a></h4>

              
                Deep brain stimulation (DBS) with electrodes implanted in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) alleviates motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the surgical complexity and associated side effects limit deployment of DBS to late-stage patients. Here, we explore a neuromodulation approach that employs locally injected magnetoelectric nanodiscs (MENDs) as an alternative to electrode-based DBS. The MENDs, composed of Fe3O4 cores and two consecutive shells of magnetostrictive CoFe2O4 and piezoelectric BaTiO3, convert weak magnetic fields into electric polarization, enabling remote neuronal excitation in the mouse STN comparable to electrode DBS. To assess the effects of the MEND and electrode DBS on motor performance in a unilateral mouse model of PD, we develop a computational pipeline that extracts salient gate features. Our findings suggest that DBS mediated by the injected MENDs not only diminishes motor symptoms associated with PD but may also inform future strategies for early-stage interventions aimed at delaying disease progression.

">It takes experience to tango: Experienced cochlear implantusers show cortical evoked potentials to naturalistic music</a></h4>

              
                Approximately 30% of cochlear implant (CI) users report that restoring their ability to enjoy music is a primary goal. However, music perception in CI users has mostly been investigated in controlled laboratory settings using simplified stimuli, such as pure tones or monophonic melodies. There is an increasing interest in developing objective measures of CI outcomes in everyday listening situations, particularly in music listening, which involves complex stimuli rich in timbre, pitch, rhythm, and overlapping sounds. One promising approach is to measure cortical auditory evoked responses (ERs) in CI users. We investigated whether ERs to sound onsets in a naturalistic four-minute music piece could be measured in adult CI users (N: 25; ages 18-80; CI experience: 0.3-14 years). We assumed that the accumulation of CI experience might be reflected in the morphology of the ERs. The results confirmed that P2 responses to sound onsets embedded in a whole piece of music can be detected in experienced CI users. Compared to a control group with normal hearing, the CI users showed P2 responses with lower amplitudes and longer latencies. Exploratory linear regression models suggested that the logarithmic duration of CI experience significantly predicted both perceived quality of musical sounds and P2 amplitude, explaining 38% and 28% of the variance, respectively. The findings suggest that music perception outcomes may continue to improve for up to 2-4 years post-implantation. Altogether, the results are consistent with the use of ERs to track CI adaptation to music listening.

">The Pathological Role and Therapeutic potential of ALDH2 in acrolein detoxification Following Spinal Cord Injury in Mice</a></h4>

              
                Oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation-derived aldehydes, such as acrolein, play a central role in the pathology of spinal cord injury (SCI) and have emerged as promising therapeutic targets. Mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase-2 (ALDH2) is a key oxidoreductase responsible for detoxifying reactive aldehydes. Pharmacological activation of ALDH2 using Alda-1, a selective agonist, has been shown to reduce aldehyde accumulation, alleviate inflammation, and enhance functional recovery in experimental SCI models. However, approximately 8% of the global population carries the ALDH2*2 mutation, which severely impairs this detoxification pathway. In this study, we used a transgenic ALDH2*2 mouse model to investigate the role of ALDH2 in SCI pathology. This model mimics the human ALDH2*2 condition, allowing us to examine the impact of impaired aldehyde clearance on acrolein accumulation and its pathological consequences. We modulated endogenous aldehyde detoxification through both genetic deficiency and pharmacological activation with Alda-1. Our results showed that ALDH2 deficiency led to significantly elevated acrolein levels, which were associated with increased microglial activation, cytokine storm, neuronal loss, demyelination, and tissue damage compared to wild-type (WT) mice. Treatment with Alda-1 enhanced ALDH2 activity and significantly reduced acrolein levels in both ALDH2*2 and WT mice from 2 to 28 days post-SCI. This was accompanied by reduced inflammation, improved preservation of myelin, and marked improvements in locomotor and sensory function, especially in ALDH2*2 mice. Notably, even beyond the traditionally ideal treatment window, Alda-1 treatment remained effective in promoting recovery, particularly in motor function and to a greater extent in ALDH2*2 mice. Our study comprehensively evaluated ALDH2's role in SCI by both genetically impairing and pharmacologically enhancing its activity, highlighting ALDH2 as a critical modulator of acrolein-mediated damage and suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target, especially for individuals with the ALDH2*2 mutation.

">Comparing electromyography, accelerometry, and visual inspection to assess the resting motor threshold for transcranial magnetic stimulation</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Electromyography (EMG) remains the gold standard for estimating the Resting Motor Threshold (RMT) Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) studies, but its cost and limited accessibility often lead researchers to use visual inspection (VIS). However, VIS may introduce variability and systematic bias. Accelerometry (ACC) offers a cost-effective, objective alternative to capture TMS-evoked responses. Objective: To compare the RMT as estimated using EMG, ACC, and VIS. Methods: Five participants underwent TMS while EMG, ACC, and video recordings were collected. Separately, 64 observers judged hand movement in videos to estimate RMT via VIS. RMTs were compared across the three methods using Bayesian model comparison, Bland-Altman analyses, and Intraclass Correlation Coefficients (ICCs). Results: RMTs estimated via EMG were lower than those obtained using either ACC or VIS. Compared to EMG, VIS tended to overestimate RMT (mean bias = 5.23%, 95%CI = [1.00-11.00]), while ACC and VIS estimates were more closely aligned (mean bias = 0.43%, 95%CI = [-4.00 - 5.00]). ICC (2,1) values indicated moderate reliability for VIS vs EMG (mean = 0.580, 95%CI = [0.389 - 0.748]), and good-to-excellent reliability for VIS vs ACC (mean = 0.845). However, bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals identified significant variability in the estimates provided by visual inspection, ranging from +1 to +11 for VIS vs EMG, but as low as -4 to +5 for VIS vs ACC. Conclusions: EMG remains the most sensitive technique for estimating the RMT, but when EMG is not feasible, accelerometery provides a quantifiable, more objective, and less variable alternative than visual inspection.

">Astrocytic CREB regulates transcriptional, neuronal, and behavioral responses to cocaine</a></h4>

              
                Drug addiction is characterized by neuronal adaptations that support a shift from goal-directed behaviors to habitual, compulsive drug-seeking with persistent effects on cognition and decision-making. Emerging evidence increasingly indicates that astrocytes are also involved in nervous system disorders, including addiction, but the cocaine-induced astrocyte-specific transcriptome has not yet been investigated. We utilized whole cell sorting of astrocytes, RNA-sequencing, and bioinformatic approaches to characterize the astrocyte transcriptome in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a key brain region involved in reward-processing, following cocaine self-administration, prolonged abstinence, and relapse in male mice. We found that astrocytes exhibit robust and contextually-specific transcriptional signatures that converge strongly with human cocaine use disorder. Bioinformatic analysis revealed CREB as a highly ranked predicted upstream regulator of cocaine-induced transcriptional regulation in NAc astrocytes, and CUT&RUN-sequencing mapped increased CREB binding across the astrocyte genome in response to cocaine. Viral-mediated manipulation of CREB activity selectively in NAc astrocytes, in combination with several measures of addiction-related behaviors including conditioned place preference and self-administration, revealed that astrocytic CREB increases the rewarding and reinforcing properties of cocaine. This effect is sex-specific, with no change in astrocytic CREB activity or CPP found in females. Subsequent experiments identify potential molecular mechanisms of astrocytic CREB influence through modulating astrocytic Ca2+ signaling in response to cocaine. Finally, we show that astrocytic CREB selectively modulates D1-type medium spiny neurons in NAc to control cocaine-related behaviors. Together, these data demonstrate that the astrocyte transcriptome responds robustly to cocaine and that CREB mediates the effects of cocaine on gene expression in astrocytes, with consequent effects on neuronal activity and rewarding responses to the drug.

">Spatial coupling of endogenous Tau translation and degradation by neuroproteasomes in dendrites revealed by STARFISH</a></h4>

              
                Cells regulate protein synthesis, folding, and degradation to maintain proteostasis, and disruptions in these processes have been linked to neurodegenerative diseases. In Alzheimers disease (AD), the protein Tau mislocalizes from axons to the somatodendritic compartment and aggregates into pathological filaments. Although Tau aggregation is a hallmark of AD, the subcellular dynamics of its synthesis and degradation are not well characterized. Because nascent polypeptides are particularly susceptible to misfolding, local control of Tau synthesis and degradation may be essential to prevent aggregation. Here, we develop STARFISH, a method for visualizing the subcellular site of endogenous mRNA translation in primary neurons and in vivo with single-molecule sensitivity and near-codon resolution, without modifying the nascent polypeptide. Using STARFISH, we show that despite the broad distribution of Mapt mRNA, Tau is translated almost exclusively in neuronal dendrites, revealing an unexpected level of spatial regulation. We further identify that one-third of newly synthesized Tau is co- or peri-translationally degraded in dendrites by a neuronal-specific plasma membrane-associated proteasome, the neuroproteasome. Failure of neuroproteasome-mediated degradation leads to the protein synthesis-dependent accumulation of somatodendritically mislocalized Tau aggregates. These findings define a previously unrecognized proteostasis mechanism that counterbalances the constitutive physiological overproduction of Tau. We speculate that failure of this proteostasis system contributes directly to Tau aggregation in dendrites, defining a new pathomechanism in Alzheimers disease.

">Functional Brain Imaging and Targeted Lesion Studies Using Manganese-Enhanced MRI and Focused Ultrasound in Non-Conventional ModelSpecies</a></h4>

              
                Linking behavior to its neuroanatomical basis in non-conventional model species remains a significant challenge due to the scarcity of imaging and molecular tools. Commonly used approaches such as electrophysiological recordings rely on precise stereotaxic atlases or species-specific antibodies, while optogenetics requires transgenic lines which are largely unavailable beyond classical model organisms (e.g., mice, rats, zebrafish). Moreover, surgical lesion studies, a staple for verifying brain structure and behavior relationships, are logistically complex in species lacking atlases or living in aquatic environments. Here, we present a protocol integrating Manganese-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MEMRI) and MR-guided High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) to overcome these limitations, which we demonstrate in the convict cichlid (Amatitlania nigrofasciata), a teleost fish lacking conventional neuroscience tools. MEMRI enables non-invasive, sub-millimeter resolution mapping of brain activity during behavior, and HIFU facilitates precise, surgery-free lesioning of targeted regions, adaptable to species without stereotaxic atlases. This combined approach offers a versatile, broadly applicable framework for linking brain structure and behavior in non-model organisms, advancing evolutionary and comparative neuroscience.

">Nociceptin/Orphanin FQ receptor agonism attenuates behavioral and neural responses to conditioned aversive stimuli</a></h4>

              
                The nociceptin/orphanin FQ peptide (NOP) receptor has emerged as a promising anxiolytic target, as its activation has been shown to reduce anxiety-related behaviors in rodents. However, the mechanisms underlying these effects are not well understood. Here, we investigated the effects of the selective NOP receptor agonist SCH-221510 (SCH; 0.01-0.1 mg/kg, IM) on behavioral and neural responses to aversive stimuli in squirrel monkeys (n=3). Subjects underwent Pavlovian fear conditioning, wherein a visual conditioned stimulus (CS) was paired with the presentation of an aversive stimulus. Event-related fMRI was conducted in awake subjects to evaluate CS-evoked neural responses. Behavioral and neural responses to the CS were assessed across three experimental phases: pre-conditioning (Pre-C), post-conditioning (Post-C), and Post-C with SCH administration. In behavioral assessments, CS presentation during Post-C elicited a robust suppression of ongoing operant responding, which was absent during Pre-C and significantly attenuated by SCH treatment (0.1 mg/kg). Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) results revealed that, relative to Pre-C, CS presentation during Post-C was associated with increased BOLD activity in brain regions previously implicated in fear processing (e.g., amygdala), expression and regulation (e.g., prefrontal cortex; PFC), as well as sensory integration. Critically, SCH (0.1 mg/kg) administration significantly attenuated CS-induced neural activation in these regions. Furthermore, resting-state functional connectivity analysis revealed that SCH administration decreased connectivity between the PFC and the amygdala, while enhancing connectivity among subregions of the PFC. Collectively, these findings suggest that NOP receptor agonism may attenuate conditioned responses to aversive stimuli by modulating functional interactions within the PFC-amygdala circuit.

">Disrupted Forward Connectivity in Parieto-temporal Network Impairs Memory Performance in Alzheimer's Disease</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer's disease is characterised by the accumulation of beta-amyloid (A{beta}) and tau proteins, leading to neurodegeneration and cognitive decline. While A{beta} and tau are known to disrupt synaptic function, the mechanisms linking these molecular pathologies to network-level dysfunction and memory impairment remain poorly understood. Here we investigated the effects of A{beta} and tau pathology (CSF A{beta}42/40 ratio and tau phosphorylated at position 181, p-tau-181, respectively) on effective connectivity (EC) related to memory encoding, which may constitute a link between synaptic pathology and cognitive outcomes. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during visual memory encoding was acquired from participants of the multicentric DZNE Longitudinal Cognitive Impairment and Dementia Study (DELCODE), including 203 cognitively normal older participants (CN) as well as individuals with subjective cognitive decline (SCD; N = 204), mild cognitive impairment (MCI; N = 65), and early dementia due to AD (DAT; N = 21). EC was assessed by applying Dynamic causal modelling (DCM) to the fMRI data, using brain regions previously implicated in memory-encoding: the parahippocampal place area (PPA), the hippocampus (HC) and the precuneus (PCU). Disruptions in forward connectivity from the PPA to the HC and PCU were associated with both memory impairment and indices of AD pathology. Specifically, reduced excitatory EC from the PPA to the HC was associated with higher p-tau-181 levels and correlated with poorer memory performance. Diminished inhibitory EC from the PPA to the PCU was driven by both tau and amyloid pathology and was likewise linked to memory decline. Our findings suggest that disrupted forward connectivity within the temporo-parietal memory network constitutes a candidate mechanism mediating the relationship between molecular pathology and cognitive dysfunction.

">The Role of Paraventricular Nucleus of Thalamus in Sleep Disturbance Induced by Withdrawal from Repeated Ethanol Exposure</a></h4>

              
                Sleep disturbance is known to be comorbid with withdrawal from repeated ethanol exposure and could be a negative reinforcement for the majority of people with alcohol use disorder (AUD). The paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT) has been highlighted for its function in integrating arousal states and associated modulation in sleep homeostasis. However, there is limited understanding of the involvement of PVT neurons in regulating sleep patterns, especially during withdrawal from chronic ethanol exposure. In this study, we investigated the potential function of the PVT in sleep disturbance during ethanol withdrawal using electrophysiology, in vivo calcium imaging, biochemical, and chemogenetic approaches. At 24 hours post-withdrawal from chronic intermittent ethanol exposure (CIE) for four weeks, there is an increase in wake time and a decrease in non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. The calcium transient levels in the PVT neurons are positively correlated with the transition from sleep to wakefulness. CIE elevates the PVT neuronal activity in a subregion-specific manner, resulting in a significant rise in cFos levels in the anterior PVT (aPVT). Temporal suppression of aPVT excitatory neurons via chemogenetics ameliorates the disturbance in sleep patterns generated by CIE. The aPVT has a notable distinction in the expression of the m-type potassium channel subunit, KCNQ2, with a higher expression level compared to the posterior PVT (pPVT). While the expression of KCNQ2 in the aPVT is reduced in CIE mice, the restoration of KCNQ2 expression using viral gene transfer within the aPVT alleviates the sleep disturbances produced by CIE. This data indicates a significant role of the PVT in sleep disturbance during ethanol withdrawal, which may partially be due to the downregulation of M-channels, hence underscoring M-channels in the PVT as a potential therapeutic target for sleep disturbance in alcohol use disorder.

">Sex-specific Effects of Outdoor Air Pollution on Subcortical Microstructure and Weight Gain: Findings from the ABCD Study</a></h4>

              
                Obesity is associated with structural alterations of brain regions that support eating behavior. Exposure to air pollutants might exacerbate this association through neurotoxic effects on the brain. This study evaluated whether air pollution exposure 9-10 years old children, coupled with brain microstructure development in appetite-regulating regions, is associated with body mass index (BMI) changes over two years, and whether these associations differ by sex. Data were gathered from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study (nbaseline=4,802, ages=9-10, males=49.9%, nfollow-up=2,439, ages=11-12, males=51.1%). Annual average estimates of ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ground-level ozone (O3), and redox-weighted oxidative capacity (Oxwt, a joint measure of NO2 and O3) were gathered from youth's residential addresses. Brain microstructure in 16 subcortical regions was assessed using diffusion-weighted MRI, focusing on proxies of cellular and neurite density: restricted normalized isotropic (RNI) and directional (RND) diffusion, respectively. Linear mixed-effects models examined whether air pollution and brain microstructure are related to BMI changes over two years, and whether these associations differed by sex. Exposure to PM2.5 coupled with high RND estimates in right caudate nucleus, bilateral putamen, and pallidum were associated with higher BMI over time, with pronounced effects in males (all p<0.05). PM2.5 coupled with greater neurite density in regions involved in reward-processing and decision-making were associated with higher BMI over a 2-year follow-up, especially in males. This research highlights air pollution as a modifiable risk factor for how differences in basal ganglia neurite density map onto obesity risk, with important implications for public health policy.

">A Tiered Approach to Human Synapse Proteomics: Optimized LC-MS/MS Analysis of Whole-Tissue and Synaptosome Preparations from Frozen Post-mortem Brain Samples</a></h4>

              
                Recent advancements in neuroproteomics have enabled detailed analysis of protein expression and function in the human brain. Post-mortem human brain studies have significantly advanced our understanding of the relationship between genetics, cell biology of neurological and psychiatric disorders and their clinical diagnosis and their clinical diagnosis. Given the central role of the synapse in these disorders, we evaluated the sensitivity of liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to detect synaptic proteins in whole-cell lysates versus synaptosome preparations. First, we optimized sample preparation protocols for frozen human gray matter (GM), refining the suspension TRAPping (S-TRAP) digestion method to improve protein solubilization using thin tissue sections and to accomplish low technical variation by minimizing sample handling. Together, we achieved a highly reproducible sample preparation workflow by rigorously applying standardization and randomization across dissection, processing, and LC-MS/MS runs. Comparative LC-MS/MS analysis showed that whole-tissue lysates are practical for large-scale studies and broadly detecting synaptic proteins. However, enrichment by synaptosome isolation offered improved resolution of synapse-specific proteins. Because synapse-proteomics enables insight into spatial regulation -i.e., alterations at the synapse that are not reflected in the soma- we recommend a tiered approach: initial whole-tissue analysis for broad disease-associated changes, followed by targeted synaptosome proteomics to deepen insight into synaptic alterations. This strategy optimally balances throughput, reproducibility, and biological relevance, and enhances the study of brain disorders through proteomics. Moreover, analyzing synaptic proteins first at the tissue level improves insight into overall regulation of synaptic proteins induced by synapse loss or gain.

">Drosophila larval Odd neurons process innate and learned information to regulate chemotaxis behavior</a></h4>

              
                Adaptive decision-making emerges from the integration of innate preferences and learned experiences to guide behavior. Using Drosophila larvae as a model, we investigated the neural circuitry underlying olfactory processing, focusing on Odd neurons-a distinct neuronal population that receives innate valence signals from Kenyon cells (KCs) rather than lateral horn inputs. Through larval connectomics, trans-tango labeling, and detailed anatomical analyses, we found that Odd neurons integrate innate valence through dendro-dendritic connections with KCs and learned valence via inhibitory inputs from mushroom body output neurons (MBON-g1 and MBON-g2). Optogenetic silencing of Odd neurons disrupted larval chemotaxis and associative memory by selectively impairing memory retrieval, while sparing memory formation, and by altering the turn rate during navigation. These results suggest that Odd neurons serve as an integrative hub, converging innate olfactory cues with learned reinforcement signals to fine-tune navigational choices. This study illuminates how distinct neural pathways converge in the larval brain to shape behavior, offering novel insights into decision-making circuitry that may extend to more complex nervous systems.

">Constant light impairs memory processing transgenerationally in D. melanogaster</a></h4>

              
                Environmental perturbations can have profound effects on our physiology and behavior, but their long-lasting impact remains debatable. We discovered that changes in standard light-dark conditions, such as exposure to constant light or simulated chronic jetlag, causes loss of associative memory in appetitive and aversive conditioning paradigms in D. melanogaster, and this behavior persists through three generations despite transfer of progeny to a standard light-dark cycle. Impaired memory is transmitted through females and is independent of any changes in fitness, brain or mushroom body architecture, or sensing acuity. Mechanistically, effects of constant light on memory are mediated by increased PIWI/piRNA pathway expression in the germline and its H3K9me3 writing capabilities, acting through altered expression of the Dopamine-1-like Receptor 1 (Dop1R1) in the brain. These findings suggest that irregular exposure to light, such as nighttime light pollution, can have negative consequences across generations.

">Adolescent alcohol consumption alters sex-specific behaviors associated with prefrontal functional connectivity in mice</a></h4>

              
                The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is one of the last brain regions to fully mature, making it particularly sensitive to stress and drug use early in life. Both human and rodent studies find long-lasting behavioral changes after adolescent alcohol exposure that implicate underlying disruptions in PFC development, including structural abnormalities and altered brain functional connectivity. Few rodent studies have been conducted to understand the network-level implications of these disruptions. We assessed how adolescent binge-like alcohol consumption in a drinking in the dark (DID) model affected adult aversion-resistant alcohol consumption, exploration, and brain-wide functional connectivity in mice. Approximately one month after the conclusion of DID, only female mice exposed to alcohol during adolescence exhibited aversion-resistant alcohol preference in adulthood. Adult females exhibited additional sex-specific changes in exploratory behavior in the elevated plus maze after adolescent alcohol consumption. Resting state neuroimaging revealed changes in prefrontal cortical connections with sensory motor, hippocampal, striatal, and other networks, providing insights into the putative systems underlying deficits caused by adolescent alcohol exposure. Critically, our data corroborate a growing body of literature in human and rodent studies demonstrating that adolescent alcohol use may increase risk for adulthood alcohol use more strongly in females. Finally, we identify neural correlates of this effect that include both known and novel networks and tie these back to human datasets, allowing biological and mechanistic targets to be further explored for future study and interventions.

">Genomic structural equation modeling of impulsivity and risk-taking traits reveals three latent factors distinctly associated with brain structure and development</a></h4>

              
                Impulsivity is a multifaceted trait that emerges in childhood and is linked to several psychiatric disorders, such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and substance use disorders. Recent genomic and neuroimaging studies have identified genetic loci and brain systems associated with impulsivity and risk-taking behaviors. However, how these genetic underpinnings overlap across different facets of impulsivity and risk-taking, and how they are associated with brain morphology during early development remain unknown. We applied genomic structural equation modeling to 17 impulsivity and risk-taking GWAS datasets to explore the overlapping genetic architecture underlying these phenotypes. We then computed polygenic scores (PGSs) for each genetic latent factor in 4,142 participants from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study and examined how each factor was associated with the brain structure during early development. We further tested whether socioeconomic status modulated the association between the PGSs and brain structures. We identified three genetic latent factors, which we labeled as lack of self-control, reward drive, and sensation seeking. These showed distinct associations with brain structure in late childhood and early adolescence, relating to the frontal cortex, subcortical cellularity, and white matter structure in different ways. The association between PGS of lack of self-control and white matter mean diffusivity was modulated by socioeconomic status. Our findings revealed that genetic predisposition for impulsivity and risk-taking is associated with morphological brain differences as early as ages 9--10. We also highlighted the importance of capturing the multidimensional nature of these traits to better understand their neurodevelopmental basis.

">Non-obese genetic type 2 diabetes causes brain and behavioral hallmarks of chronic stress</a></h4>

              
                The comorbidity of obesity, type 2 diabetes (T2D), and psychiatric disorders, particularly anxiety and depression,is well documented. However, it remains unclear whether T2D, independently of obesity, contributes to the development of emotional dysfunctions. Furthermore, alterations in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) stress axis are commonly associated with both T2D and depression, but the role of stress in emotional disorders linked to T2D has been poorly explored. This study aimed to investigate the impact of T2D, independent of obesity, on the neuroendocrine stress axis, as well as molecular, cellular, and behavioral indicators of emotional dysfunction. Using the non-obese Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rat model of T2D, we assessed the effects of diabetes on hormonal and neuronal stress responses, molecular and structural markers of stress in the brain, and anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors. We also evaluated the impact of adrenalectomy in GK rats to determine the contribution of glucocorticoids to their behavioral impairments. Our findings reveal that non-obese diabetes leads to heightened endocrine and brain responses to stress, along with upregulation of stress-related molecular markers and structural features indicative of chronic stress, particularly in the medial prefrontal cortex. Additionally, GK rats exhibited pronounced anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors. Importantly, lowering glucocorticoid levels in GK rats helped alleviate some of the metabolic and emotional disturbances. This study suggests that T2D, independent of obesity, induces stress-related brain and behavioral changes, partly mediated by glucocorticoids.

                <p>Understanding the ability to self-evaluate decisions is an active area of research. This research has primarily focused on the neural correlates of self-evaluation during visual tasks and whether neural correlates before or after the primary decision contribute to self-reported confidence. This focus has been useful, yet the reliance on subjective confidence reports may confound our understanding of key everyday features of metacognitive self-evaluation: that decisions must be rapidly evaluated without explicit feedback and unfold in a multisensory world. These considerations led us to hypothesize that an automatic domain-general metacognitive signal may be shared between sensory modalities, which we tested in the present study with multivariate decoding of electroencephalographic (EEG) data. Participants (<I>N</I> = 21, 12 female) first performed a visual task with no request for self-evaluations of performance, prior to an auditory task that included rating decision confidence on each trial. A multivariate classifier trained to predict errors in the speeded visual task generalized to distinguish correct and error trials in the subsequent nonspeeded auditory discrimination. This generalization did not occur for classifiers trained on the visual stimulus-locked data and further predicted subjective confidence on the subsequent auditory task. This evidence of overlapping post-response neural activity provides evidence for automatic encoding of confidence independent of any explicit request for metacognitive reports and a shared basis for metacognitive evaluations across sensory modalities.</p>

                <p>Rod and cone photoreceptor cells selectively contact different compartments of axon-bearing retinal horizontal cells in the mammalian retina. Cones synapse exclusively on the soma whereas rods synapse exclusively on a large axon terminal compartment. The possibility that rod signals can travel down the axon from terminal to soma has been proposed as a means of producing spectrally opponent interactions between rods and cones, but there is conflicting data about whether this actually occurs. The spectral overlap between rods and cones in mouse makes it difficult to stimulate rod and cone pigments separately. We therefore used optogenetic techniques to analyze photoreceptor inputs into horizontal somas by selectively expressing channelrhodopsin in rods and/or cones. Optogenetic stimulation of rods and cones both evoked large fast inward currents in horizontal cell somas. Cone-driven responses were abolished by eliminating synaptic release in a cone-specific knock-out of the exocytotic calcium sensor, synaptotagmin 1 (Syt1). However, rod-driven responses in horizontal somas were unchanged after eliminating synaptic release from rods but abolished by eliminating release from both rods and cones. This suggests that release from cones is required for transmission of rod signals to horizontal cell somas. Rods and cones are coupled by Cx36 gap junctions, and we found that selective elimination of Cx36 from rods also abolished rod-driven optogenetic responses in horizontal cell somas. Together, these results show that rod signals reach the somas of B-type horizontal cells exclusively via gap junctions with cones and not by transmission down the axon from the axon terminal.</p>

                <p>Perceptual localization of brief, high-contrast perisaccadic visual probes is grossly erroneous. While this phenomenon has been extensively studied in humans, more needs to be learned about its underlying neural mechanisms. This ideally requires running similar behavioral paradigms in animals. However, during neurophysiology, neurons encountered in the relevant sensory and sensory&ndash;motor brain areas for visual mislocalization can have arbitrary, noncardinal response field locations. This necessitates using mislocalization paradigms that can work with any saccade direction. Here, we first established such a paradigm in three male rhesus macaque monkeys. In every trial, the monkeys generated a saccade toward an eccentric target. Once a saccade onset was detected, we presented a brief flash at one of three possible locations ahead of the saccade target location. After an experimentally imposed delay, we removed the saccade target, and the monkeys were then required to generate a memory-guided saccade toward the remembered flash location. All three monkeys readily learned the task, and, like humans, they all showed strong backward mislocalization toward the saccade target, which recovered for later flashes from the saccade time. Importantly, we then replicated a known property of human perisaccadic mislocalization, as revealed by two-dimensional mislocalization paradigms: that mislocalization is the strongest for upward saccades. For horizontal saccades, we additionally found stronger mislocalization for upper visual field flashes, again consistent with humans. Our results establish a robust two-dimensional mislocalization paradigm in monkeys, and they pave the way for exploring the neural mechanisms underlying the dependence of perisaccadic mislocalization strength on saccade direction.</p>

                <p>by Wiep Stikvoort, Eider Pérez-Ordoyo, Iván Mindlin, Anira Escrichs, Jacobo D. Sitt, Morten L. Kringelbach, Gustavo Deco, Yonatan Sanz Perl</p>

Assessing someone’s level of consciousness is a complex matter, and attempts have been made to aid clinicians in these assessments through metrics based on neuroimaging data. Many studies have empirically investigated measures related to the complexity elicited after the brain is stimulated to quantify the level of consciousness across different states. Here we hypothesized that the level of non-equilibrium dynamics of the unperturbed brain already contains the information needed to know how the system will react to an external stimulus. We created personalized whole-brain models fitted to resting state fMRI data recorded in participants in altered states of consciousness (e.g., deep sleep, disorders of consciousness) to infer the effective connections underlying their brain dynamics. We then measured the out-of-equilibrium nature of the unperturbed brain by evaluating the level of asymmetry of the inferred connectivity, the time irreversibility in each model and compared this with the elicited complexity generated after <i>in silico</i> perturbations, using a simulated fMRI-based version of the Perturbational Complexity Index, a measure that has been shown to distinguish different levels of consciousness in <i>in vivo</i> settings. Crucially, we found that states of consciousness involving lower arousal and/or lower awareness had a lower level of asymmetry in their effective connectivities, a lower level of irreversibility in their simulated dynamics, and a lower complexity compared to control subjects. We show that the asymmetry in the underlying connections drives the nonequilibrium state of the system and in turn the differences in complexity as a response to the external stimuli.

                <p>by Kevin J. Flynn, Andrew Yu. Morozov</p>

Many organisms, notably phototrophs, routinely acquire resources over only a fraction of the day. They have to balance their main period of initial biosynthesis against cell cycle events. Because of their short generation times, this challenge is especially acute for the planktonic microalgae that perform 50% of global C-fixation. Empirical evidence indicates that microalgal day-average growth is a function of the ability to acquire resources rapidly when available, retaining initial products of assimilation to support growth. A fundamental question arises over the optimal physiological configuration to support such activity. Here, we applied computer simulations implementing a development of the quota concept, in which the internal limiting resource is itself C, ratioed against total organism C-biomass. The model comprises metabolite and core pools of carbon C (<sup>M</sup><i>C</i> and <sup>C</sup><i>C</i>, respectively), with growth modulated by <sup>M</sup><i>C</i>/(<sup>M</sup><i>C</i><sup> </sup>+ <sup>C</sup><i>C</i>); <sup>M</sup><i>C</i> supports growth of <sup>C</sup><i>C</i> in the absence of concurrent resource acquisition. Dynamic feedback interactions from the relative size of <sup>M</sup>C controls resource acquisition. The model reproduces the general pattern of growth at different light:day fraction (<i>LD</i>), and of afternoon-depression of C-fixation. We explored the efficiency of the physiological cell configuration to locate optimal configurations at different combinations of maximum growth rates (<i>U</i><sub>max</sub>) and <i>LD</i> values across plausible parameter values for microalgae. While the optimum maximum resource acquisition rate deployed during the L phase scales with <i>U</i><sub>max</sub>/<i>LD</i>, the maximum size of the metabolite pool scales to <i>LD</i>/<i>DV</i>, where <i>DV</i> is division time (i.e. <i>U</i><sub>max</sub>/Ln(2)). Accordingly, we conclude that faster growing organisms carry a penalty limiting their geographic spread to latitudes and seasons where <i>LD</i> is high. Larger, vacuolated organisms (such as diatoms), having a bigger metabolite compartment, may be at an advantage in such situations.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1013125">Fusing multisensory signals across channels and time</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Swathi Anil, Dan F. M. Goodman, Marcus Ghosh</p>

Animals continuously combine information across sensory modalities and time, and use these combined signals to guide their behaviour. Picture a predator watching their prey sprint and screech through a field. To date, a range of multisensory algorithms have been proposed to model this process including linear and nonlinear fusion, which combine the inputs from multiple sensory channels via either a sum or nonlinear function. However, many multisensory algorithms treat successive observations independently, and so cannot leverage the temporal structure inherent to naturalistic stimuli. To investigate this, we introduce a novel multisensory task in which we provide the same number of task-relevant signals per trial but vary how this information is presented: from many short bursts to a few long sequences. We demonstrate that multisensory algorithms that treat different time steps as independent, perform sub-optimally on this task. However, simply augmenting these algorithms to integrate across sensory channels and short temporal windows allows them to perform surprisingly well, and comparably to fully recurrent neural networks. Overall, our work: highlights the benefits of fusing multisensory information across channels and time, shows that small increases in circuit/model complexity can lead to significant gains in performance, and provides a novel multisensory task for testing the relevance of this in biological systems.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Despite the high prevalence of pediatric “mild” traumatic brain injury (pmTBI), very little is known about the long-term effects of injury on brain structure and how injuries manifest in the context of dynamic and regionally specific neurodevelopmental changes.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Prospective study design characterizing long-term effects of pmTBI on both global (brain age) and regional (hippocampal volume, hippocampal subfields, and cortical thickness) brain structure at approximately 7 days, 4 months, and 1-year post-injury. A large sample of age- and sex-matched healthy controls was imaged at identical temporal intervals to account for typical neurodevelopmental changes, and to assess how trauma potentially affects developmental trajectories.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 269 pmTBI (age = 14.4 ± 2.9; 41.6% female) and 232 healthy controls (age = 14.1 ± 2.9; 44.8% female) were included in the final analyses (&gt;70% 1-year retention). Results demonstrated that the presence of loss of consciousness and/or post-traumatic amnesia was associated with increased brain age up to 1-year post-injury, increased frontal cortical thickness at 4 months, as well as hippocampal atrophy across all time points relative to controls. “Mild” head trauma also interfered with hippocampal neurodevelopment in a dose-dependent fashion, including within the CA1 subfield. In contrast, post-concussive symptom burden was not associated with any structural abnormalities or alterations to neurodevelopment.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Current findings suggest a dose-dependent relationship between injury severity and alterations in both global and regional brain structure within the spectrum of pmTBI. Our results emphasize the importance of using objective biomarkers rather than subjective self-reported symptoms to better understand the long-term effects of injury.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The Glibenclamide for Large Hemispheric Infarction Analyzing mRS and Mortality (CHARM) trial enrolled participants with large hemispheric infarction, randomized to a placebo or intravenous glyburide. Our objective in this post-hoc study was to evaluate the relationship between baseline stroke volume and the potential efficacy of i.v. glyburide.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Participants enrolled in CHARM and aged ≤70 years were included if a &lt;125 ml ischemic core lesion volume was measured by computed tomography perfusion or diffusion magnetic resonance imaging. The primary endpoint was a shift analysis on the 90-day modified Rankin Scale. Independent variables included age, sex, baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, world region, tissue plasminogen activator, and endovascular thrombectomy.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 147 participants with a baseline large-core stroke volume &lt;125 ml were available for this analysis (mean age 58 years, 37% women, baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale 18, and the time to study drug was 9.1 ± 2.1 h). The median baseline core volume of 92 mL (IQR 81–107 ml) did not differ by treatment arm. The i.v. glyburide-treated participants had a favorable shift in outcome relative to the placebo (adjusted common odds ratio 2.11, 95% CI 1.10–4.01, <i>p</i> = 0.02). In patients who underwent endovascular thrombectomy, i.v. glyburide-treated subjects had a favorable outcome (adjusted common odds ratio 8.19, 95% CI 1.60–42.0, <i>p</i> = 0.01), fewer decompressive craniectomies (0% vs 25%, <i>P</i> = 0.02), less midline shift (4.2 ± 2.5 mm vs 7.6 ± 5.5 mm, <i>p</i> = 0.02), and lower 90-day mortality (5.6% vs 31%, <i>p</i> = 0.05) compared with the placebo, respectively.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This post-hoc analysis of the CHARM trial provides hypothesis-generating evidence that i.v. glyburide may improve outcome in large-core stroke &lt;125 ml, especially among endovascular thrombectomy-treated patients. These results require confirmation in a prospective randomized clinical trial. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                This paper introduces the concept of fuzzy filters and 2-fuzzy filters of a quasi-ordered residuated system K . This research explores comparative, normal, implicative and associative fuzzy filters within a quasi-ordered residuated system. It establishes the sufficient conditions under which a comparative fuzzy filter in K qualifies as a normal fuzzy filter and vice-versa. Furthermore, the study demonstrates that the collection of all comparative fuzzy filters in K constitutes a complete lattice. The notion of fuzzy filters of a pseudo quasi-ordered residuated system is introduced and the analysis extends to fantastic, comparative, associative and implicative fuzzy filters within a pseudo quasi-ordered residuated framework. Finally, it is proven that an associative fuzzy filter in K inherently satisfies the criteria for both implicative and comparative fuzzy filters.

                Background Ovarian cancer management has not yet given a satisfactory result, and the recurrence rate is still high. One of the reasons for this is resistance to chemotherapy. Melatonin and cisplatin may be involved in the chemotherapy resistance of ovarian cancer. Methods A laboratory experiment was performed using melatonin and cisplatin in the SKOV3 cell, from September 2020 to November 2021 at the SCTE and Integrated Laboratory & Research Center Universitas Indonesia. Several variables were used, such as doxorubicin, melatonin, cisplatin, and combination of cisplatin and melatonin at several concentrations (1×, 3/4×, 1/2×, and 1/4×). A total of 24 samples were included and divided into 8 groups. The IC50 values of melatonin, doxorubicin, and cisplatin as well as cell viability was calculated via MTS assay. Subsequently, flow cytometry was performed to assess the effect of cisplatin and melatonin on the mechanisms of CTR1, p-glycoprotein, GSH, ERCC1, e-cadherin, and apoptosis. Analysis of variance and Bonferroni test were employed for the study. Results The IC50 values of melatonin, cisplatin, and doxorubicin were 1.841 mM, 117.5 mM, and 14.72 mM, respectively. The combination groups of cisplatin and melatonin reduced cell viability; decreased the CTR1 mean (19.73), Pgp (6.7), GSH (11.73), and ERCC1 (4.27) in the combination 1 (C1) group; and increased e-cadherin (32.2) and annexin V (53.57) also in the combination 1 (C1) group. Conclusions The combination of melatonin and cisplatin might have an impact on drug resistance via several mechanisms in ovarian cancer.

                The Wallacea region of Indonesia has high biodiversity and highly unique and endangered species. Its terrestrial ecosystems have unique flora and fauna found nowhere else. Nevertheless, the strategy for protecting and conserving the Wallacea ecosystem is like that in other parts of Indonesia, since it refers to the national forest and environmental regulations. The uniqueness of the Wallacea ecosystem does not reflect the extraordinary efforts of protecting and conserving the region’s pristine ecosystem. The continuing decline of the forestland and expansions of agricultural lands have indicated the need for a more fundamental and integrative approach to conserving and protecting the Wallacea ecosystem, particularly forestlands. We use the actor-centered power (ACP) approach or ideas and use the Wallacea Line to highlight how this idea is contested and confronted with the dynamics of complex societies and ecosystems. The ACP approach is the most widely used one in the implementation of the community forest (CF) program in Indonesia. The CF program is one of Indonesia’s community-based forest management schemes that empowers local communities to manage state forests sustainably. We chose two national parks established in the Wallacea region, Mutis on Timor Island and Matalawa on Sumba Island, to elaborate further on the development, conservation, and changes that occurred within that landscape. The ACP approach, in line with the spirit of the decentralization era, has mixed consequences for forest management and the biodiversity of the Wallacea region. Regarding the specific characteristics of the Wallacea region and lessons learned from the ACP approach implementation in the CF program, we then propose a sustainable model of reforestation and forest protection that applies the principle of “unity in diversity,” where all actors involved have space for the growth of creativity and positive contributions to sustainable forest protection.

                Background Vitamin D may play an important role in later-life physical and cognitive health. Vitamin D status is standardly assessed in serum and plasma; however, collection, transport, and storage costs make large epidemiologic studies challenging. We assessed the agreement of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25(OH)D3) quantification from dried blood spots (DBS) as compared to standard plasma assessment among older Indian adults. Methods A total of 58 adults over 45 years of age who resided in Pune, India were enrolled in the study from July 2020 to June 2021. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was used to assess 25(OH)D3 concentrations in paired plasma and DBS samples. Results Plasma and DBS 25(OH)D3 concentrations were highly correlated (Pearson’s correlation = 0.976). The median 25(OH)D3 concentration of the study population assessed by plasma was 14.6 ng/mL (Q1=12.0, Q3= 18.1) while the median concentration assessed in DBS was 12.8 ng/mL (Q1=11.0, Q3= 16.6). 25(OH)D3 concentrations measured from DBS were on average 6% (95% CI: 2-13%) lower than concentrations assessed by plasma across the observed 25(OH)D3 distribution. Conclusions We found good agreement between 25(OH)D3 quantification between DBS and plasma and our findings indicate that DBS can be used in epidemiologic studies of vitamin D among Indian adults.

                Introduction Surgical site infections (SSIs) occur in 1.3% to 4% of paediatric appendectomies. It is the most common complication after an appendectomy. Surgical complications in paediatric patients increase patient susceptibility to opportunistic infections, falls and drug-related side effects The aim of this study was to identify the modifiable risk factors for SSIs after paediatric appendectomies. Methodology Paediatric patients who underwent appendectomies from April 2018 to April 2023 in a tertiary care teaching hospital in coastal Karnataka were included. Clinical characteristics of patients were collected from the medical records of the patients. Results A total of 459 paediatric patients underwent appendectomies between 2018 and 2023. 45 (9.8%) developed surgical site infections (SSIs). Chi-squared tests (or Fisher’s exact tests, where appropriate) revealed significant associations (p < 0.05) between SSIs and the following categorical variables: faecal incontinence, surgical technique, wound type, type of appendicitis, postoperative stay and use of invasive devices. Multivariate logistic regression analysis further identified laparotomy (OR = 4.39, 95% CI: 1.31–14.74), presence of invasive devices (OR = 104.4, 95% CI: 5.45–2002.93), longer consultation-to-surgery time (OR = 1.48, 95% CI: 1.17–1.88), and increased surgery duration (OR = 1.02 per minute, 95% CI: 1.01–1.04) as independent risk factors significantly associated with the development of SSIs. Discussion The study identified laparotomy, use of drains, delayed surgery, and longer operation time as key risk factors for SSIs after paediatric appendectomies. Despite standard precautions, high SSI rates were observed, likely due to modifiable surgical factors and antimicrobial resistance. The findings highlight the need for optimized surgical practices, timely intervention, and multidisciplinary strategies to reduce SSI rates and improve patient outcomes.

[version</a></h4>

              
                Background Treatment-resistant chronic migraine patients constitute a heavily burdened patient population with need for novel treatment options. The sphenopalatine ganglion (SPG), located deep within the facial structures, is a synaptic junction in the trigemino-autonomic reflex that is hypothesised to play a part in migraine pathophysiology. A 2017 open-label pilot study explored the SPG as a target for onabotulinumtoxinA injections in chronic migraine using a navigation-guided injection device, demonstrating a favourable safety profile and promising response on migraine related efficacy outcomes. Methods MiBlock is a multi-centre, investigator-initiated, publicly funded, randomised, quadruple-blinded and placebo-controlled trial. Participation is voluntary and all participants must sign a written consent prior to inclusion. The study is approved by the Norwegian ethics committee and the Norwegian Medical Product Agency. Patients with treatment-resistant chronic migraine will be recruited from four Norwegian university hospitals until 170 have received study treatment. The study will investigate the efficacy of a single-session, bilateral, navigation-guided, percutaneous injection of either onabotulinumtoxinA (verum) or 0.9% NaCl (placebo) towards the SPG under local anaesthesia. The primary efficacy endpoint is the change from baseline in the frequency of moderate and severe headache days at weeks 5-8 post-injection. The primary efficacy outcome variable is collected prospectively through daily headache eDiary entries during the entire study participation. The treatment effect will be assessed by comparing the placebo and the treatment arm according to a prespecified statistical analysis plan. Discussion This trial addresses a novel treatment strategy in headache prevention. The study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of onabotulinumtoxinA injection towards the SPG in chronic migraine, but results may shed light on the feasibility of navigation-guided SPG injections in several headache disorders. Results will be published in international open-access peer-reviewed journals. Trial registration number EudraCT number: 2018-004053-24. ClinicalTrial ref: NCT04069897.

                Introduction phlebitis is one of the complications associated with the placement of peripheral intravascular lines in neonates and serves as an indicator of the quality of care provided by health professionals. Determining its incidence and predictors provides valuable evidence for stakeholders to address this issue and the potential factors contributing to phlebitis. Objective This study aims to determine the incidence and predictors of phlebitis among neonates with perinatal asphyxia admitted at the neonatal intensive care unit of West Amhara Comprehensive Specialized Hospital, Northwest Ethiopia, 2023. Method A multicentered, institution-based prospective follow-up study was conducted from May 1 to August 30, 2024, at the Northwest Amhara Region Comprehensive Specialized Hospital in Northwest Ethiopia. A systematic random sampling technique was employed, and data were collected using a data extraction checklist from the medical registry of neonates. The collected data were entered into EPI-DATA V.4.6.0.0 and analyzed using STATA V.14. The Kaplan-Meier failure curve and log-rank test were utilized, and both bivariable and multivariable Cox regression analyses were performed to identify predictors of phlebitis. Statistical significance was defined as p ≤ 0.05. Result The overall incidence of phlebitis was 20.9 per 1,000 neonate-day observations (95% CI: 17.12-25.54) during the entire follow-up period. Of the 423 neonates admitted to the NICU, 96 (22.69%) (95% CI: 18.93-26.94) developed phlebitis. Significant predictors included birth asphyxia (AHR= 2.1; 95% CI: 1.38-3.19), trials of cannulation (AHR=2.5; 95% CI: 1.01-6.36), macrosomic neonates (AHR=3.05; 95% CI: 1.17-7.96), flushed cannulas (AHR=0.54; 95% CI: 0.31-0.97), and short dwelling time (AHR=0.47; 95% CI: 0.29-0.765). Conculsion The incidence rate of phlebitis was higher than that reported in other studies. Predictors of phlebitis included birth asphyxia, the number of cannulation trials, macrosomic neonates, flushed cannulas, and shorter dwelling times.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-562/v1?src=rss">The prevalence of intraventricular hemorrhage and its related risk factors among preterm neonates [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) is a serious concern for preterm infants and can predispose such infants to brain injury and poor neurodevelopmental outcomes. Aim The present study aimed to determine the frequency of IVH and its risk factors in the premature newborns admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) at King Fahd University Hospital. Methodology This cross-sectional study involved 201 preterm neonates admitted at King Fahd University Hospital, Khobar, Saudi Arabia over a period of 7 years (from 2016 to 2023). These neonates were diagnosed by cranial ultrasound. IVH was classified into four grades based on Papile classification. The frequency of IVH was compared across various attributing factors i.e., gestational age at delivery, gender, birth weight, mode of delivery, and maternal antenatal steroids. Results Two hundred and one patients were analyzed (male 50.7% vs. female 49.3%). 51.2% had a gestational age of 29 weeks or less. More than half (54.2%) had a birth weight of ≤1200g. The incidence of IVH in a 7-year duration was 41.8%, with stage 1 (41.7%) and stage 2 (34.5%) being the most common IVH stages. Multivariate regression analysis revealed that CHD, seizure, and ROP were identified as the significant independent predictors of IVH among preterm infants. Conclusion IVH in premature infants remains a complex and delicate issue in neonatology. An integrated approach covering both prevention and treatment is essential to minimize the negative impact of this complication on the neurological development of premature infants.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-561/v1?src=rss">Income Inequality, Governance Quality, and Political Engagement: A Cross-country Analysis of Disparities and Democratic Participation [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Income gaps threaten democratic vitality, yet the evidence is mixed on whether economic inequality inevitably suppresses citizens’ political voices. We argue that institutional integrity—particularly the capacity to curb corruption—conditions how inequality translates into civic disengagement. By embedding governance quality in the inequality-participation debate, this study addresses a significant omission in comparative political-economy scholarship and offers policy-relevant insights. Methods We compile a balanced panel of ten democracies—Australia, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom, the United States, Brazil, India, Indonesia, Mexico, and South Africa—for 2002-2022. Voice and Accountability (Worldwide Governance Indicators) are the outcome variable; predictors include the lagged Gini Index, extreme poverty headcount, GDP-per-capita growth, and five governance metrics. Country- and year-fixed-effects regressions with cluster-robust errors are estimated. Diagnostic tests (Pesaran LM, IPS, Westerlund, VIF) guide specification and interaction terms to assess whether strong corruption control moderates inequality’s impact in developed versus developing subsamples. Results Corruption control is the strongest positive predictor of democratic voice, while inequality and poverty are insignificant in isolation. Interaction models reveal pronounced asymmetries. In developed economies, the deleterious effect of inequality is neutralised—and sometimes reversed—when corruption is tightly controlled (β = +0.028, p < 0.01). In developing economies, inequality remains benign until corruption escalates, at which point higher Gini scores significantly erode Voice and Accountability (β = -0.020, p ≈ 0.07). Corrected models confirm a modest universal adverse effect of inequality once institutional dynamics are constant. Conclusions Inequality is not destiny; its democratic toll depends on whether institutions can control corruption. Policy agendas that redistribute income will underperform if they neglect governance reforms. Combating graft, professionalising public administration, and expanding digital feedback channels can shield civic participation even in unequal societies. Conversely, failing to fortify institutions leaves democracies—especially developing ones—vulnerable to a corrosive feedback loop of widening gaps and falling political voices.

<p>The advances achieved against multiple sclerosis (MS) represent one of the great success stories of modern molecular medicine. The development of therapies with increasing selectivity and safety, guided by gains in understanding the fundamental immunology, neurobiology, genetics, and triggers of this disease, have broadened the traditional focus on treatment, adding realistic possibilities for prevention and repair. Here, we summarize recent advances that have together transformed the disease from the most common crippler of young adults in the western world to its place today as a condition in which most newly diagnosed patients can anticipate lives free from disability.

                Demenego et al. show that inborn errors of immunity (IEI) directly impact neurodevelopment independently of immune dysfunction. In WHIM syndrome, CXCR4 hyperactivation disrupts cerebellar assembly and behavior via cell-intrinsic mechanisms. Early brain-targeted CXCR4 antagonist rescues both structural and psychomotor defects. The study redefines the neurodevelopmental origins of IEI-associated symptoms.

                Memories do not reflect the continuous nature of experience—they represent distinct events. How does the brain know when one memory should end and the next should begin? Clewett et al. show that during meaningful changes, increased arousal and locus coeruleus activation trigger the formation of separate episodic memories.

Hence, delineating the signaling pathways downstream of AR that promote cancer progression may nominate novel, alternative therapeutic targets. Lin et al. identify CAMKI-CREB-mediated cholesterol metabolism as an alternative, AMPK-independent, and druggable pathway mediating AR-CAMKK2-driven CRPC.

                Chou et al. demonstrate that CEP164 recruits TTBK2 to centriole distal appendages through phase separation driven by electrostatic interactions between their intrinsically disordered regions. This multivalent interaction forms dynamic condensates, facilitating efficient TTBK2 recruitment and initiating ciliogenesis, highlighting the critical role of phase separation in cilia formation.

                Burgmer et al. show that the pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) PGRP-LC and PGRP-LE repress key metabolic functions in the Drosophila midgut. These regulations occur independently of canonical immune pathways and restrict parasitic Wolbachia endosymbionts in the intestine and peripheral tissues. Thus, PRRs act beyond canonical immune pathways to control bacteria.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100376">A general mechanism for initiating the bacterial general stress response</a></h4>

              
                The General Stress Response promotes survival of bacteria in adverse conditions, but how sensor proteins transduce species-specific signals to initiate the response is not known. The serine/threonine phosphatase RsbU initiates the General Stress Response in <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> upon binding a partner protein (RsbT) that is released from sequestration by environmental stresses. We report that RsbT activates RsbU by inducing otherwise flexible linkers of RsbU to form a short coiled-coil that dimerizes and activates the phosphatase domains. Importantly, we present evidence that related coiled-coil linkers and phosphatase dimers transduce signals from diverse sensor domains to control the General Stress Response and other signaling across bacterial phyla. This coiled-coil linker transduction mechanism additionally suggests a resolution to the mystery of how shared sensory domains control serine/threonine phosphatases, diguanylate cyclases and histidine kinases. We propose that this provides bacteria with a modularly exchangeable toolkit for the evolution of diverse signaling pathways.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96675">Clearance of protein aggregates during cell division</a></h4>

              
                Protein aggregates are spatially organized and regulated in cells to prevent the deleterious effects of proteostatic stress. Misfolding of proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) results in aggregate formation, but how the aggregates are processed, especially during cell division is not well understood. Here, we induced proteostatic stress and protein aggregation using a proteostasis reporter, which is prone to misfolding and aggregation in the ER. Unexpectedly, we detected solid-like protein aggregates deposited mainly in the nucleus and surrounded by the ER membrane. The membrane-bound aggregates were then cleared as cells progressed through mitosis and cytokinesis. Aggregate clearance depended on Hsp70 family chaperones in the ER, particularly BiP, and proteasomal activity. The clearance culminated at mitotic exit and required cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) inactivation but was independent of the anaphase-promoting complex (APC/C). The ER reorganization that is active during mitosis and cytokinesis was required for the aggregate clearance. Thus, dividing cells reorganize the ER networks to allow BiP to clear the protein aggregates to maintain proteostasis in the newly divided cells.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100292">Different roles of D1/D2 medium spiny neurons in the nucleus accumbens in pair bond formation of male mandarin voles</a></h4>

              
                The mesolimbic dopamine (DA) system has been implicated in pair bond formation. However, the involvements of DA release, real-time activities, and electrophysiological activities of D1/D2 medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) shell in pair bonding remain unclear. This work verified that male mandarin voles after pair bonding released higher levels of DA in the NAc shell and displayed higher levels of D1 MSNs activity and lower levels of D2 MSNs activity upon sniffing their partners compared to upon sniffing an unknown female. Moreover, pair bonding induced differential alterations in both synaptic plasticity and neuronal intrinsic excitability in both D1 MSNs and D2 MSNs. In addition, chemogenetic inhibition of ventral pallidum (VP) -projecting D2 MSNs in the NAc shell enhanced pair bond formation, while chemogenetic activation of VP-projecting D2 MSNs in the NAc shell inhibited pair bond formation. These findings suggest that different neuronal activity of NAc shell D1 MSNs / D2 MSNs regulated by increasing DA release after pair bonding may be a neurobiological mechanism underlying pair bond formation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104074">Upstream open reading frames buffer translational variability during Drosophila evolution and development</a></h4>

              
                Protein abundance tends to be more evolutionarily conserved than mRNA levels both within and between species, yet the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain largely unknown. Upstream open reading frames (uORFs) are widespread <i>cis</i>-regulatory elements in eukaryotic genomes that regulate translation, but it remains unclear whether and how uORFs contribute to stabilizing protein levels. In this study, we performed ribosome translation simulations on mRNA to quantitatively assess the extent to which uORF translation influences the translational variability of downstream coding sequences (CDSs) across varying contexts. Our simulations revealed that uORF translation dampens CDS translational variability, with buffering capacity increasing in proportion to uORF translation efficiency, length, and number. We then compared the translatomes at different developmental stages of two <i>Drosophila</i> species, demonstrating that uORFs buffer mRNA translation fluctuations during both evolution and development. Experimentally, deleting a uORF in the <i>bicoid</i> (<i>bcd</i>) gene—a prominent example of translational buffering—resulted in extensive changes in gene expression and phenotypes in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>. Additionally, we observed uORF-mediated buffering between primates and within human populations. Together, our results reveal a novel regulatory mechanism by which uORFs stabilize gene translation during development and across evolutionary time.

We tested whether treatment with the GluN2C/D positive allosteric modulator CIQ and non-competitive antagonist DQP-1105 from days in vitro (DIV) 5–10 and DIV 15–20 modulates neurite growth in organotypic cultures. Calcium imaging confirmed a functional expression of GluN2D in nonpyramidal neurons. DQP treatment enhanced apical dendritic branching and increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation and spine density, suggesting a disinhibitory effect mirrored by a reduced expression of GAD-65, VGAT, and Syt-2. Control basket cells had larger axon-carrying dendrites (AcDs), and under CIQ, the AcDs grew even larger. The axons of CIQ-treated basket cells formed more branches within the dendritic field, and the effect was strongest for axons emerging from AcDs. DQP-treated basket cells also displayed more complex AcDs, presumably driven by enhanced network activity. However, local branching of basket cell axons was reduced under DQP in somatic axon cells but at control level in AcD cells. This suggested a growth-promoting effect of the enhanced network activity and that the AcD configuration neutralized the inhibitory action of DQP on basket cell axons. The results suggest a specific role of GluN2D signaling for development and remodeling of interneuronal axons.</span>

Older adults reconfigure more than young adults when completing goal-directed tasks with known age deficits. Less is known about task states that more closely mirror the complexity of daily life. Thus, we examined reconfiguration between rest and passive viewing of a mockumentary television show, involving richly contextualized social interactions, among young (18 to 35 years; <span style="font-style:italic;">N</span> = 101) and older (61 to 92 years; <span style="font-style:italic;">N</span> = 83) adults. Then, we related reconfiguration to participants’ accurate understanding of those social interactions (theory of mind) on a novel task conducted outside of the scanner. Consistent with prior work, older adults exhibited greater cortical reconfiguration and worse theory-of-mind performance compared to young adults. Greater reconfiguration related to worse theory-of-mind performance, and the default and frontoparietal networks most strongly contributed to this association. These findings provide greater insight into how reduced neural specializations with age disrupt social cognition even in the absence of an explicit task.</span>

Gaussian causal mixture modeling was applied to characterize the genetic architecture and overlap between schizophrenia and ventricular subregion volumes phenotypes.

Although previous work has identified abnormalities in rich-club (RC) organization and left–right asymmetry in ASD, the developmental trajectory of these anomalies remains unclear. In this study, we examined how age influences structure–function coupling and structural proportions in RC networks using data from 140 participants (aged 5-26 years) drawn from ABIDE II. Our findings revealed significant, age-related differences in the left hemisphere of ASD participants compared to controls, with the RC network predominantly localized in this region. Furthermore, an interaction effect in local RC organization—though not in global RC or feeder connections—was observed between diagnostic groups and brain lateralization. Notably, rightward lateralization in local RC networks increased with age in ASD individuals, whereas it decreased with age in controls. These results underscore an atypical, age-dependent pattern of hemispheric asymmetry in ASD and offer new insights into abnormal neurodevelopmental trajectories within RC organization.</span>

However, the neural mechanisms underlying mental set induction remain unclear. We hypothesized that repeated use of a strategy increases neural representation similarity, thus producing a mental set. To test this, we conducted representational similarity analysis across continuously presented mindset-induction trials using the same loose chunk decomposition problem-solving strategy. This induction was expected to impair the solving of subsequent probe trials requiring a more insightful tight chunk decomposition strategy. Results showed that neural representational similarity increased across loose chunk decomposition induction stages, particularly in regions related to cognitive control, mental operations, and the default mode network. These increases predicted activation in the anterior cingulate cortex and medial frontal lobe during tight chunk decomposition trials. Furthermore, the medial frontal lobe moderated the impact of increased similarity during mental set induction, affecting representational changes from loose chunk decomposition to tight chunk decomposition in perceptual, operative, and executive processing regions. In summary, our findings suggest that increased neural representational similarity in goal-directed mental manipulation networks and the default mode network supports mental set induction, enhancing conflict resolution and representational change during creative problem-solving with different strategies.</span>

EEG results revealed that at the social feedback expectation stage, rejection evoked a larger stimulus-preceding negativity magnitude than acceptance in the SNE but not SPE condition.

                The prevalence of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) is rising globally, especially in lower-middle-income countries, underscoring the need for effective public health interventions. There is limited evidence that mobile health interventions can assist in identifying the risk of NCDs in the community. Leveraging existing grassroots infrastructure, such as the Lady Health Worker (LHW) program, presents a promising opportunity to address this challenge. We developed a mHealth application to address this issue. This study protocol describes the design of a pilot study aimed at developing a mHealth application, assessing the feasibility, acceptability (barriers and facilitators), and usability to triage the risk of NCDs and pilot test it in the hands of the LHWs in Pakistan. This study consists of three phases. In phase 1, we develop a comprehensive mHealth application incorporating validated tools for NCD assessment, including the Rose Angina Questionnaire, Questionnaire for Verifying Stroke-free Status, Risk Assessment of Pakistani Individuals for Diabetes, Global Adult Tobacco Survey, International Physical Activity Questionnaire, Refined Food Frequency Questionnaire, and WHO 5 Wellness Index. Phase 2 involves qualitative focus group discussions with LHWs to refine the prototype. Phase 3 entails piloting the application with a sample of 30 LHWs in Karachi and Hyderabad, followed by qualitative exit feedback from LHWs, supervisors, healthcare providers, and community members. The outcomes will be analyzed by means, standard deviation or median with interquartile range for continuous data based on the normality assumption. The frequency with percentages will be registered for the categorical variables to describe the risk identifiers using the NCD tool kit. Internal consistency as validity evidence of the assessment can be determined using Cronbach’s alpha and the content validation index. If deemed feasible or acceptable, our mHealth app will address gaps in the literature and advance NCD research by identifying and improving the quality of life of people in the community in developing countries like Pakistan. The functioning and dissemination of this MHealth application can be an essential step towards highly scalable NCD data collection for a population at high risk for developing NCDs.

A total of 3,749 studies were identified between January 2020 and December 2023. The Joanna Briggs Tool for studies reporting prevalence was used to assess the quality of studies. Jamovi 2.4 was used in the meta-analysis. Results Sixteen studies were included and used for the meta-analysis. The average age of participants was 22 years, with an age range of 17–45 years, Sample range 120-3,705. There were 6 studies of high quality, 9 studies of medium quality and 1 study of low quality. The areas with the highest prevalence of musculoskeletal pain were the neck (51%, 95% CI = 36–66%, I2 = 99.96), lower back (51%, 95% CI = 42–59%, I2 = 99.96) and shoulder (36%, 95% CI = 26–47%, I2 = 99.61). Conclusions The shift to online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic has emerged as a potential factor influencing musculoskeletal pain in students. Educational institutions should study the duration of online learning that begins to impact student injury outcomes.

                Background This study addresses the challenge of stabilizing rice retail prices in Indonesia, where rice is a critical staple food, as in many Asian countries. The government prioritizes price stability to prevent sharp increases that could trigger social unrest during shortages. Price control approaches are categorized as direct or indirect. Direct controls involve immediate interventions, such as boosting rice stocks through imports to quickly influence market prices. Indirect controls consist of longer-term measures, like enhancing domestic production capacity for gradual stabilization. This study proposes an optimization model to determine the optimal rice import volume to minimize bi-monthly retail price fluctuations. Methods A linear programming model is formulated to minimize bimonthly price changes, subject to constraints including local production capacity, import limits, rice flow balance, and demand fulfillment. The monthly retail price is modeled using a compound linear regression approach with seven explanatory variables: the rupiah exchange rate against the US dollar, GDP per capita, the price of ground dry rice (GKG) per kilogram, domestic rice procurement, rice imports, rice distribution, and government-managed rice stock aimed at ensuring domestic availability and price stability. The explanatory variable is forecasted using methods best suited to its historical pattern. Results The model was tested using data from 2020 to 2023. The results indicate that bimonthly rice prices increases can be effectively controlled, with maximum price change rates maintained between 0.75% and 1.14% and a standard deviation ranging from 0.20% to 0.34%. These values are significantly lower than the anticipated inflation rate of 2–3%. Conclusions The optimization model effectively determines the required volume of rice imports to minimize bimonthly retail price fluctuations. By regulating import volumes, excessive price increases can be prevented. Enhanced data-driven forecasting with granular historical data may further improve the accuracy of retail rice price predictions and strengthen price stabilization initiatives.

                Background Stroke survivors, particularly those of working age, are at an increased risk of recurrent stroke within one–five years of the initial event, largely due to suboptimal management of risk factors. This study aimed to identify lifestyle and occupational factors associated with recurrent stroke in this demographic population. Methods This case-control study included 100 patients with recurrent ischemic stroke and 200 ischemic stroke survivors without recurrence, who were recruited from the hospital database. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify significant factors associated with recurrence, which were presented as adjusted odds ratios (aORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results The mean age was 45.4 years (SD = 15.1) among cases and 50.6 years (SD = 6.5) among controls. The male-to-female ratios were 1.17:1 and 1.94:1 in the case and control groups, respectively. Significant factors associated with recurrent stroke included female sex (aOR: 1.83; 95% CI [1.10–3.29]), high fasting blood sugar (aOR: 3.70; 95% CI [1.66–8.27]), current alcohol consumption (aOR: 3.63; 95% CI [2.01–6.54]), sedentary lifestyle (aOR: 2.77; 95% CI [1.50–5.13]), and lack of workplace support for health (aOR: 2.02; 95% CI [1.13–3.63]). The associations between these factors and stroke recurrence varied according to the age group. Conclusions This study highlights the critical role of modifiable lifestyle and occupational factors in stroke recurrence among working-age adults. Tailored age-specific prevention strategies—emphasizing physical activity, reduced alcohol use, and improved workplace health environments—may reduce the risk of recurrence and enhance health outcomes in this population.

                <p>by Carlos A. Gomez-Uribe, Japheth Gado, Meiirbek Islamov</p>

We present a protein engineering approach to directed evolution with machine learning that integrates a new semi-supervised neural network fitness prediction model, Seq2Fitness, and an innovative optimization algorithm, biphasic annealing for diverse and adaptive sequence sampling (BADASS) to design sequences. Seq2Fitness leverages protein language models to predict fitness landscapes, combining evolutionary data with experimental labels, while BADASS efficiently explores these landscapes by dynamically adjusting temperature and mutation energies to prevent premature convergence and to generate diverse high-fitness sequences. Compared to alternative models, Seq2Fitness improves Spearman correlation with experimental fitness measurements, increasing from 0.34 to 0.55 on sequences containing mutations at positions entirely not seen during training. BADASS requires less memory and computation compared to gradient-based Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, while generating more high-fitness and diverse sequences across two protein families. For both families, 100% of the top 10,000 sequences identified by BADASS exceed the wildtype in predicted fitness, whereas competing methods range from 3% to 99%, often producing far fewer than 10,000 sequences. BADASS also finds higher-fitness sequences at every cutoff (top 1, 100, and 10,000). Additionally, we provide a theoretical framework explaining BADASS’s underlying mechanism and behavior. While we focus on amino acid sequences, BADASS may generalize to other sequence spaces, such as DNA and RNA.

Neuronal regeneration in the adult brain, which is restricted compared to that in the embryonic brain, is a long-standing topic in neuroscience and medical research. Based on studies in mammals, a small number of newly generated immature neurons (neuroblasts) migrate toward damaged sites and contribute to functional recovery. During migration, neuroblasts form chain-like collectives and modify the morphology of glial cells (astrocytes), which are the main components of the surrounding environment. However, it remains unclear how neuroblasts form collectives and how efficient migration is achieved through collective formation in a pool of astrocytes. The main difficulty lies in tracking individual neuroblasts within the collective, both in vitro and in vivo, over a period. To address this impasse, we built a mathematical model of the neuroblast-astrocyte system to assess its long-term performance in silico. Our simulations showed that individual neuroblasts gathered into chain-like collectives through occasional contact, astrocyte confinement, and moderate adhesion between the neuroblasts. The forward movement of neuroblasts in an astrocyte-dense environment was accelerated if we assumed a simple interaction: the higher the number of neuroblasts near an astrocyte, the stronger the shrinkage of astrocytic protrusions. Furthermore, temporal changes in neuroblast behavior, as indicated by our observation of living neuroblasts in culture, reinforce the advantages of simulated collectives. A collective of neuroblasts with constant behavior sometimes repeated non-migratory movements, whereas those with inconstant behavior were easily untangled, resulting in a rapid migration. These results highlight the potential for neuroblast collectivity and inconstancy in enhancing neuronal regeneration in the adult brain.

                <p>by Takuya Kawamura, Megumi Shigematsu, Yohei Kirino</p>

tRNA halves are among the most abundant short non-coding RNAs in the cellular transcriptome. Here we report that in androgen receptor-positive LNCaP prostate cancer cells, the hormone-dependent 5′-tRNA<sup>LysCUU</sup> half promoted cell proliferation by facilitating cell cycle progression. Global mRNA profiling upon the 5′-tRNA<sup>LysCUU</sup> half depletion revealed that the mRNA of p21, a negative regulator of the cell cycle, is post-transcriptionally destabilized via a 5′-tRNA<sup>LysCUU</sup> half-driven mechanism. YBX1, identified as a protein interacting with 5′-tRNA<sup>LysCUU</sup> half in the cytosol, was shown to stabilize p21 mRNA. Specific sequences resembling the 5′-tRNA<sup>LysCUU</sup> half, located in the 3′-UTR of p21 mRNA and termed LL588, were identified as the binding site for YBX1 and are required for p21 mRNA stability. In vitro binding assays demonstrated that the 5′-tRNA<sup>LysCUU</sup> half is capable of displacing YBX1 from LL588. Collectively, our findings suggest that the 5′-tRNA<sup>LysCUU</sup> half directly binds to and displaces YBX1 from p21 mRNA, leading to the destabilization of p21 mRNA and the promotion of cell cycle progression in hormone-dependent cancers. Our study illuminates the role of tRNA halves in regulating mRNA stability and suggests that this may be part of broader regulatory networks affecting mRNA levels, orchestrated by various tRNA halves and their interacting proteins.

                <p>by Zineb Hayatou, Hongkai Wang, Antoine Chaillet, Daniel E. Shulz, Valérie Ego-Stengel, Luc Estebanez</p>

Body ownership disorders can be triggered by disease or body damage. Methods to probe limb embodiment are required to address those disorders. This includes the development of neuroprostheses that better integrate into the body scheme of the user. To this end, the “rubber hand illusion” protocol is a key behavioral method to probe the powerful embodiment that can be triggered by congruent somatosensory and visual inputs from the limb. So far, the neurophysiology of limb embodiment remains poorly known, in part because translating the rubber hand illusion to animal models such as the mouse remains challenging. Yet, mapping out the brain circuits of embodiment thanks to the use of genetic and optogenetic research tools would allow to propose novel embodiment restoration strategies. Here, we show that the rubber hand illusion described in humans can be translated to the mouse forelimb model using an automated, videography-based procedure. We exposed head-fixed mice to a visible, static 3D-printed replica of the right forelimb, while their own forelimb was hidden from their sight. We synchronously brushed their hidden forelimb and the replica. Following these visuo-tactile associations, the replica was visually threatened, and we probed the reaction of the mice using automated tracking of pupils and facial expression. The mice focused significantly more of their gaze toward the threatened forelimb replica after receiving synchronous tactile and visual information compared to asynchronous. More generally, across test and control conditions, the mouse pupillary response was consistent with the human overt response to the rubber hand illusion. Thus, our results show that mice exhibit quantifiable behavioral markers of the embodiment of an artificial forelimb.

                <p>by Yuranny Cabral-Calderin, Molly J. Henry</p>

Neural tracking (entrainment) of auditory rhythms enhances perception. We previously demonstrated that transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) can enhance or suppress entrainment to rhythmic auditory stimuli, depending on the timing between the electrical and auditory signals, although tACS effects are primarily modulatory. This study further investigated entrainment to tACS and auditory rhythms when the electrical and auditory signals were presented together (Experiment 1, <i>N</i> = 34) or independently (Experiment 2, <i>N</i> = 24; Experiment 3, <i>N</i> = 12). We hypothesized that tACS effects would be more pronounced when the auditory rhythm was made less perceptually salient to reduce the competition with the electrical rhythm. Participants detected silent gaps in modulated or unmodulated noise stimuli. In Experiment 1, auditory stimuli predominated in entraining behavior. While behavioral entrainment to sound rhythms was affected by the modulation depth of the auditory stimulus, entrainment to tACS was not. In Experiment 2, with no rhythmic information from the sound, 17 of 24 participants showed significant behavioral entrainment to tACS, although the most effective tACS frequency varied across participants. An oscillator model with a free parameter for the individual resonance frequency produced profiles similar to those we observed behaviorally. In Experiment 3, both neural and behavioral entrainment to rhythmic sounds were affected by the auditory stimulus frequency, but again the most effective entraining frequency varied across participants. Our findings suggest that tACS effects depend on the individual’s preferred frequency when there is no competition with sensory stimuli, emphasizing the importance of targeting individual frequencies in tACS experiments. When both sensory and electrical stimuli are rhythmic and compete, sensory stimuli prevail, indicating the superiority of sensory stimulation in modulating behavior.

Generalization from past experience is an important feature of intelligent systems. When faced with a new task, one efficient computational approach is to evaluate solutions to earlier tasks as candidates for reuse. Consistent with this idea, we found that human participants (<i>n</i> = 38) learned optimal solutions to a set of training tasks and generalized them to novel test tasks in a reward-selective manner. This behavior was consistent with a computational process based on the successor representation known as successor features and generalized policy improvement (SF&GPI). Neither model-free perseveration or model-based control using a complete model of the environment could explain choice behavior. Decoding from functional magnetic resonance imaging data revealed that solutions from the SF&GPI algorithm were activated on test tasks in visual and prefrontal cortex. This activation had a functional connection to behavior in that stronger activation of SF&GPI solutions in visual areas was associated with increased behavioral reuse. These findings point to a possible neural implementation of an adaptive algorithm for generalization across tasks.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27277?af=R">HCN2‐Associated Neurodevelopmental Disorders: Data from Patients and Xenopus Cell Models</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We aimed to characterize the phenotypic spectrum and functional consequences associated with variants in <i>HCN2</i>, encoding for the hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide (HCN) gated channel 2.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>GeneMatcher facilitated the recruitment of 21 individuals with <i>HCN2</i> variants from 15 unrelated families, carrying <i>HCN2</i> variants. In vitro functional studies were performed by electrophysiology with <i>Xenopus laevis</i> oocytes and membrane trafficking was investigated in HEK cells by confocal imaging. Structural 3D-analysis of the <i>HCN2</i> variants was performed.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The phenotypic spectrum included developmental delay/intellectual disability (DD/ID, 17/21), epilepsy (10/21), language disorders (16/21), movement disorders (12/21), and axial hypotonia (10/21). Thirteen pathogenic variants (12 new and 1 already described) were identified: 11 missense (8 monoallelic and 3 biallelic), 1 recurrent inframe deletion (monoallelic), and 1 frameshift (biallelic). Functional analysis of p.(Arg324His) variant showed a strong increase of HCN2 conductance, whereas p.(Ala363Val) and p.(Met374Leu) exhibited dominant negative effects. The p.(Leu377His), p.(Pro493Leu), and p.(Gly587Asp) variants rendered HCN2 electrophysiologically silent and impaired membrane trafficking. Structural 3D-analysis revealed that, except for p.(Arg324His), all variants altered HCN2 stability.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings broadened the HCN2 disease clinical spectrum to include DD/ID with or without epilepsy. Functional analysis in cellular models reveal that pathogenic <i>HCN2</i> variants can cause either loss-of-function or gain-of-function, providing critical information for the development of targeted therapies for <i>HCN2</i>-related disorders.
