              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Proton-transporting heliorhodopsins from marine giant viruses</a></h4>

              
                Rhodopsins convert light into signals and energy in animals and microbes. Heliorhodopsins (HeRs), a recently discovered new rhodopsin family, are widely present in archaea, bacteria, unicellular eukaryotes, and giant viruses, but their function remains unknown. Here, we report that a viral HeR from Emiliania huxleyi virus 202 (V2HeR3) is a light-activated proton transporter. V2HeR3 absorbs blue-green light, and the active intermediate contains the deprotonated retinal Schiff base. Site-directed mutagenesis study revealed that E191 in TM6 constitutes the gate together with the retinal Schiff base. E205 and E215 form a PAG of the Schiff base, and mutations at these positions converted the protein into an outward proton pump. Three environmental viral HeRs from the same group as well as a more distantly related HeR exhibited similar proton-transport activity, indicating that HeR functions might be diverse similarly to type-1 microbial rhodopsins. Some strains of <i>E. huxleyi</i> contain one HeR that is related to the viral HeRs, while its viruses <i>Eh</i>V-201 and <i>Eh</i>V-202 contain two and three HeRs, respectively. Except for V2HeR3 from <i>Eh</i>V-202, none of these proteins exhibit ion transport activity. Thus, when expressed in the <i>E. huxleyi</i> cell membranes, only V2HeR3 has the potential to depolarize the host cells by light, possibly to overcome the host defense mechanisms or to prevent superinfection. The neuronal activity generated by V2HeR3 suggests that it can potentially be used as an optogenetic tool, similarly to type-1 microbial rhodopsins.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Structural model of microtubule dynamics inhibition by kinesin-4 from the crystal structure of KLP-12 –tubulin complex</a></h4>

              
                Kinesin superfamily proteins are microtubule-based molecular motors driven by the energy of ATP hydrolysis. Among them, the kinesin-4 family is a unique motor that inhibits microtubule dynamics. Although mutations of kinesin-4 cause several diseases, its molecular mechanism is unclear because of the difficulty of visualizing the high-resolution structure of kinesin-4 working at the microtubule plus-end. Here, we report that KLP-12, a <i>C. elegans</i> kinesin-4 ortholog of KIF21A and KIF21B, is essential for proper length control of <i>C. elegans</i> axons, and its motor domain represses microtubule polymerization in vitro. The crystal structure of the KLP-12 motor domain complexed with tubulin, which represents the high-resolution structural snapshot of the inhibition state of microtubule-end dynamics, revealed the bending effect of KLP-12 for tubulin. Comparison with the KIF5B-tubulin and KIF2C-tubulin complexes, which represent the elongation and shrinking forms of microtubule ends, respectively, showed the curvature of tubulin introduced by KLP-12 is in between them. Taken together, KLP-12 controls the proper length of axons by modulating the curvature of the microtubule ends to inhibit the microtubule dynamics.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Factors associated with the intention of telehealth service utilization among Bangladeshi people: a cross-sectional study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Telehealth is comprised of telecommunications and electronic information systems to support and maintain long-distance healthcare services. Although it has not been thoroughly explored, the intention of using the service among the general public is critical to its success. We investigated the factors associated with the intention to utilize telehealth services among the general population of Bangladesh. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted between May 22, 2021 and June 15, 2021 in Bangladesh, where the total number of participants was 1038. The Pearson chi-square test and Kruskal-Wallis H tests were used to examine the unadjusted relationship between the explanatory variables and the intention to use telehealth services. A multinomial logistic regression model was fitted to determine the adjusted association. Shapiro-Wilk tests were used to check the normality of continuous data. Data were processed and analyzed by software STATA-16. Results: The probability of utilizing the service increased significantly with increasing knowledge, perceived benefit, and predisposition levels among respondents. However, when perceived concern increased, the likelihood of utilizing the service dropped significantly. Age, marital status, educational status, profession, residence, and perceived health status were significantly associated with the participants’ intention to utilize the telehealth service. Conclusions: The influencing aspects of telehealth service utilization should be recognized by the respective authorities. Possible activities to enhance usability among people are also recommended.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Prediction of the effects of the top 10 synonymous mutations from 26645 SARS-CoV-2 genomes [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) had led to a global pandemic since December 2019. SARS-CoV-2 is a single-stranded RNA virus, which mutates at a higher rate. Multiple works had been done to study nonsynonymous mutations, which change protein sequences.  However, there is little study on the effects of SARS-CoV-2 synonymous mutations, which may affect viral fitness. This study aims to predict the effect of synonymous mutations on the SARS-CoV-2 genome.   Methods: A total of 26645 SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences retrieved from Global Initiative on Sharing all Influenza Data (GISAID) database were aligned using MAFFT. Then, the mutations and their respective frequency were identified.  Multiple RNA secondary structures prediction tools, namely RNAfold, IPknot++ and MXfold2 were applied to predict the effect of the mutations on RNA secondary structure and their base pair probabilities was estimated using MutaRNA. Relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) analysis was also performed to measure the codon usage bias (CUB) of SARS-CoV-2.  Results: A total of 150 synonymous mutations were identified. The synonymous mutation identified with the highest frequency is C3037U mutation in the nsp3 of ORF1a.. Of these top 10 highest frequency synonymous mutations, C913U, C3037U, U16176C and C18877U mutants show pronounced changes between wild type and mutant in all 3 RNA secondary structure prediction tools, suggesting these mutations may have some biological impact on viral fitness. These four mutations show changes in base pair probabilities. All mutations except U16176C change the codon to a more preferred codon, which may result in higher translation efficiency. Conclusion:   Synonymous mutations in SARS-CoV-2 genome may affect RNA secondary structure, changing base pair probabilities and possibly resulting in a higher translation rate. However, lab experiments are required to validate the results obtained from prediction analysis.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: A successful case of toxic epidermal necrolysis treated with plasmapheresis therapy [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Toxic epidermal necrosis (TEN) is rare and can be life-threatening for patients. Appropriate management of TEN patients could give optimal results and prevent complications. One treatment modality for TEN is plasmapheresis, which is rarely available in most cases with severe TEN. Here we reported a successful treatment of severe TEN with plasmapheresis. A 40-year-old woman under tuberculosis therapy complained of shortness of breath that began four days prior to hospital admission and worsened ever since. The patient's skin was peeling with red spots and rashes all over the body for a week. During the examination, the patient was compos mentis, and the SCORTEN score was 2 with 12.1% risk of mortality rate. Dermatological examination of the face, trunk and extremities found extensive erosions, loose bullae filled with clear fluid, brown crusts, and generalized distribution with more than 30% epidermolysis. The patient was diagnosed with toxic epidermal necrolysis caused by antituberculosis therapy. We treated the patient by discontinuing the suspected drugs and administering the corticosteroids, but no improvement was observed. The patient underwent two cycle plasmaphereses with 5% albumin, resulting in 1.2 liter of plasma exchange. Re-epithelialization was observed after three days, and the patient was discharged on day 8. This case-report highlights the important role of plasmapheresis in treating the TEN patients. However, a study with larger sample sizes is warranted to validate the efficacy of plasmapheresis in TEN.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor differentially controls mossy cell activity across the dentate gyrus longitudinal axis</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Understanding the role of dentate gyrus (DG) mossy cells (MCs) in learning and memory has rapidly evolved due to increasingly precise methods for targeting MCs and for in vivo recording and activity manipulation in rodents. These studies have shown MCs are highly active in vivo, strongly remap to contextual manipulation, and that their inhibition or hyperactivation impairs pattern separation and location or context discrimination. Less well understood is how MC activity is modulated by neurohormonal mechanisms, which might differentially control the participation of MCs in cognitive functions during discrete states, such as hunger or satiety. In this study, we demonstrate that glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), a neuropeptide produced in the gut and the brain that regulates food consumption and hippocampal-dependent mnemonic function, might regulate MC function through expression of its receptor, GLP-1R. RNA-seq demonstrated that most, though not all, <i>Glp1r</i> in hippocampal principal neurons is expressed in MCs, and in situ hybridization revealed strong expression of <i>Glp1r</i> in hilar neurons. <i>Glp1r-ires-Cre</i> mice crossed with Ai14D reporter mice followed by co-labeling for the MC marker GluR2/3 revealed that almost all MCs in the ventral DG expressed <i>Glp1r</i> and that almost all <i>Glp1r</i>-expressing hilar neurons were MCs. However, only ~60% of dorsal DG MCs expressed <i>Glp1r</i>, and <i>Glp1r</i> was also expressed in small hilar neurons that were not MCs. Consistent with this expression pattern, peripheral administration of the GLP-1R agonist exendin-4 (5 μg/kg) increased cFos expression in ventral but not dorsal DG hilar neurons. Finally, whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from ventral MCs showed that bath application of exendin-4 (200 nM) depolarized MCs and increased action potential firing. Taken together, this study adds to known MC activity modulators a neurohormonal mechanism that may preferentially affect ventral DG physiology and may potentially be targetable by several GLP-1R pharmacotherapies already in clinical use.</p>

<p>Responses to chronic social stress are highly sex-dependent, although central monoamine signalling is modified in both.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Psychosocial stress promotes and links mood and cardiovascular disorders in a sex-specific manner. However, findings in animal models are equivocal, in some cases opposing human dimorphisms. We examined central nervous system (CNS), behavioral, endocrine, cardiac, and hepatic outcomes in male or female C57Bl/6 mice subjected to chronic social stress (56 days of social isolation, with intermittent social confrontation encounters twice daily throughout the final 20 days). Females exhibited distinct physiological and behavioral changes, including relative weight loss, and increases in coronary resistance, hepatic inflammation, and thigmotaxic behavior in the open field. Males evidence reductions in coronary resistance and cardiac ischemic tolerance, with increased circulating and hippocampal monoamine levels and emerging anhedonia. Shared CNS gene responses include reduced hippocampal <i>Maoa</i> and increased <i>Htr1b</i> expression, while unique responses include repression of hypothalamic <i>Ntrk1</i> and upregulation of cortical <i>Nrf2</i> and <i>Htr1b</i> in females; and repression of hippocampal <i>Drd1</i> and hypothalamic <i>Gabra1</i> and <i>Oprm</i> in males. Declining cardiac stress resistance in males was associated with repression of cardiac leptin levels and metabolic, mitochondrial biogenesis, and anti-inflammatory gene expression. These integrated data reveal distinct biological responses to social stress in males and females, and collectively evidence greater biological disruption or allostatic load in females (consistent with propensities to stress-related mood and cardiovascular disorders in humans). Distinct stress biology, and molecular to organ responses, emphasize the importance of sex-specific mechanisms and potential approaches to stress-dependent disease.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">How the immune system shapes neurodegenerative diseases</a></h4>

              
                Neurodegenerative diseases are a major cause of death and disability worldwide and are influenced by many factors including age, genetics, and injuries. While these diseases are often thought to result from the accumulation and spread of aberrant proteins, recent studies have demonstrated that they can be shaped by the innate and adaptive immune system. Resident myeloid cells typically mount a sustained response to the degenerating CNS, but peripheral leukocytes such as T and B cells can also alter disease trajectories.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Molecular characteristics and laminar distribution of prefrontal neurons projecting to the mesolimbic system</a></h4>

              
                Prefrontal cortical influence over the mesolimbic system – including the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and the ventral tegmental area (VTA) – is implicated in various cognitive processes and behavioral malfunctions. The functional versatility of this system could be explained by an underlying anatomical complexity; however, the detailed characterization of the medial prefrontal cortical (mPFC) innervation of the NAc and VTA is still lacking. Therefore, combining classical retrograde and conditional viral tracing techniques with multiple fluorescent immunohistochemistry, we sought to deliver a precise, cell- and layer-specific anatomical description of the cortico-mesolimbic pathways in mice. We demonstrated that NAc- (mPFC<sub>NAc</sub>) and VTA-projecting mPFC (mPFC<sub>VTA</sub>) populations show different laminar distribution (layers 2/3–5a and 5b–6, respectively) and express different molecular markers. Specifically, calbindin and Ntsr1 are specific to mPFC<sub>NAc</sub> neurons, while mPFC<sub>VTA</sub> neurons express high levels of Ctip2 and FoxP2, indicating that these populations are mostly separated at the cellular level. We directly tested this with double retrograde tracing and <i>Canine adenovirus type 2</i>-mediated viral labeling and found that there is indeed minimal overlap between the two populations. Furthermore, whole-brain analysis revealed that the projection pattern of these populations is also different throughout the brain. Taken together, we demonstrated that the NAc and the VTA are innervated by two, mostly nonoverlapping mPFC populations with different laminar distribution and molecular profile. These results can contribute to the advancement in our understanding of mesocorticolimbic functions and its disorders in future studies.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Structure of Geobacter OmcZ filaments suggests extracellular cytochrome polymers evolved independently multiple times</a></h4>

              
                While early genetic and low-resolution structural observations suggested that extracellular conductive filaments on metal reducing organisms such as <i>Geobacter</i> were composed of Type IV pili, it has now been established that bacterial <i>c</i>-type cytochromes can polymerize to form extracellular filaments capable of long-range electron transport. Atomic structures exist for two such cytochrome filaments, formed from the hexaheme cytochrome OmcS and the tetraheme cytochrome OmcE. Due to the highly conserved heme packing within the central OmcS and OmcE cores, and shared pattern of heme coordination between subunits, it has been suggested that these polymers have a common origin. We have now used cryo-EM to determine the structure of a third extracellular filament, formed from the <i>Geobacter sulfurreducens</i> octaheme cytochrome, OmcZ. In contrast to the linear heme chains in OmcS and OmcE from the same organism, the packing of hemes, heme:heme angles, and between-subunit heme coordination is quite different in OmcZ. A branched heme arrangement within OmcZ leads to a highly surface exposed heme in every subunit, which may account for the formation of conductive biofilm networks, and explain the higher measured conductivity of OmcZ filaments. This new structural evidence suggests that conductive cytochrome polymers arose independently on more than one occasion from different ancestral multiheme proteins.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Amygdala-cortical collaboration in reward learning and decision making</a></h4>

              
                Adaptive reward-related decision making requires accurate prospective consideration of the specific outcome of each option and its current desirability. These mental simulations are informed by stored memories of the associative relationships that exist within an environment. In this review, I discuss recent investigations of the function of circuitry between the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and lateral (lOFC) and medial (mOFC) orbitofrontal cortex in the learning and use of associative reward memories. I draw conclusions from data collected using sophisticated behavioral approaches to diagnose the content of appetitive memory in combination with modern circuit dissection tools. I propose that, via their direct bidirectional connections, the BLA and OFC collaborate to help us encode detailed, outcome-specific, state-dependent reward memories and to use those memories to enable the predictions and inferences that support adaptive decision making. Whereas lOFC→BLA projections mediate the encoding of outcome-specific reward memories, mOFC→BLA projections regulate the ability to use these memories to inform reward pursuit decisions. BLA projections to lOFC and mOFC both contribute to using reward memories to guide decision making. The BLA→lOFC pathway mediates the ability to represent the identity of a specific predicted reward and the BLA→mOFC pathway facilitates understanding of the value of predicted events. Thus, I outline a neuronal circuit architecture for reward learning and decision making and provide new testable hypotheses as well as implications for both adaptive and maladaptive decision making.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Multiple ciliary localization signals control INPP5E ciliary targeting</a></h4>

              
                Primary cilia are sensory membrane protrusions whose dysfunction causes ciliopathies. INPP5E is a ciliary phosphoinositide phosphatase mutated in ciliopathies like Joubert syndrome. INPP5E regulates numerous ciliary functions, but how it accumulates in cilia remains poorly understood. Herein, we show INPP5E ciliary targeting requires its folded catalytic domain and is controlled by four conserved ciliary localization signals (CLSs): LLxPIR motif (CLS1), W383 (CLS2), FDRxLYL motif (CLS3) and CaaX box (CLS4). We answer two long-standing questions in the field. First, partial CLS1-CLS4 redundancy explains why CLS4 is dispensable for ciliary targeting. Second, the essential need for CLS2 clarifies why CLS3-CLS4 are together insufficient for ciliary accumulation. Furthermore, we reveal that some Joubert syndrome mutations perturb INPP5E ciliary targeting, and clarify how each CLS works: (i) CLS4 recruits PDE6D, RPGR and ARL13B, (ii) CLS2-CLS3 regulate association to TULP3, ARL13B, and CEP164, and (iii) CLS1 and CLS4 cooperate in ATG16L1 binding. Altogether, we shed light on the mechanisms of INPP5E ciliary targeting, revealing a complexity without known parallels among ciliary cargoes.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Deep learning based feature extraction for prediction and interpretation of sharp-wave ripples in the rodent hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                Local field potential (LFP) deflections and oscillations define hippocampal sharp-wave ripples (SWR), one of the most synchronous events of the brain. SWR reflect firing and synaptic current sequences emerging from cognitively relevant neuronal ensembles. While spectral analysis have permitted advances, the surge of ultra-dense recordings now call for new automatic detection strategies. Here, we show how one-dimensional convolutional networks operating over high-density LFP hippocampal recordings allowed for automatic identification of SWR from the rodent hippocampus. When applied without retraining to new datasets and ultra-dense hippocampus-wide recordings, we discovered physiologically relevant processes associated to the emergence of SWR, prompting for novel classification criteria. To gain interpretability, we developed a method to interrogate the operation of the artificial network. We found it relied in feature-based specialization, which permit identification of spatially segregated oscillations and deflections, as well as synchronous population firing typical of replay. Thus, using deep learning based approaches may change the current heuristic for a better mechanistic interpretation of these relevant neurophysiological events.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Distinct architectural requirements for the parS centromeric sequence of the pSM19035 plasmid partition machinery</a></h4>

              
                Three-component ParABS partition systems ensure stable inheritance of many bacterial chromosomes and low-copy-number plasmids. ParA localizes to the nucleoid through its ATP-dependent non-specific DNA binding activity, whereas centromere-like <i>parS</i>-DNA and ParB form partition complexes that activate ParA-ATPase to drive the system dynamics. The essential <i>parS</i> sequence arrangements vary among ParABS systems, reflecting the architectural diversity of their partition complexes. Here, we focus on the pSM19035 plasmid partition system that uses a ParB<sub>pSM</sub> of the ribbon-helix-helix (RHH) family. We show that <i>parS<sub>pSM</sub></i> with four or more contiguous ParB<sub>pSM</sub>-binding sequence repeats is required to assemble a stable ParA<sub>pSM</sub>-ParB<sub>pSM</sub> complex and efficiently activate the ParA<sub>pSM</sub>-ATPase, stimulating complex disassembly. Disruption of the contiguity of the <i>parS<sub>pSM</sub></i> sequence array destabilizes the ParA<sub>pSM</sub>-ParB<sub>pSM</sub> complex and prevents efficient ATPase activation. Our findings reveal the unique architecture of the pSM19035 partition complex and how it interacts with nucleoid-bound ParA<sub>pSM</sub>-ATP.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">NPAS4 supports drug-cue associations and relapse-like behavior through regulation of the cell type-specific activation balance in the nucleus accumbens</a></h4>

              
                Use of addictive substances creates powerful drug-cue associations that often trigger relapse. Drug seeking is gated in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) by competing activation of D1 dopamine receptor-expressing medium spiny neurons (D1-MSNs) that promote, and D2 dopamine receptor-expressing neurons (D2-MSNs) that oppose, drug seeking. We show here that the ensemble of neurons in the NAc that induce the neuronal activity-regulated transcription factor, Neuronal PAS Domain Protein 4 (NPAS4), is required for cocaine-context associations. In addition, NPAS4 functions within NAc D2-MSNs to govern the activation balance of NAc D1-MSNs and D2-MSNs necessary for drug-context memories and cue-induced cocaine, but not sucrose, seeking. NPAS4 regulates drug-cue associations and preponderant D1-MSN activation by influencing a program of gene expression that blocks cocaine-induced potentiation of prefrontal cortical excitatory drive onto D2-MSNs. Together our findings reveal that NPAS4 is a key player governing NAc MSN cell-type activation balance and promoting drug-cue associations and relapse vulnerability.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">How inhibitory and excitatory inputs gate output of the inferior olive</a></h4>

              
                The inferior olive provides the climbing fibers to Purkinje cells in the cerebellar cortex, where they elicit all-or-none complex spikes and control major forms of plasticity. Given their important role in both short-term and long-term coordination of cerebellum-dependent behaviors, it is paramount to understand the factors that determine the output of olivary neurons. Here, we investigate how the inhibitory and excitatory inputs to the olivary neurons interact with each other, generating spiking patterns of olivary neurons that ride on their intrinsic oscillations. Using dual color optogenetic stimulation and whole cell recordings we demonstrate how intervals between the inhibitory input from the cerebellar nuclei and excitatory input from the mesodiencephalic junction affect phase and gain of the olivary output at both the sub- and suprathreshold level. When the excitatory input is activated approximately 50 ms after the inhibitory input, the phase of the intrinsic oscillations becomes remarkably unstable and the excitatory input can hardly generate any olivary spike. Instead, when the excitatory input is activated approximately 150 ms after the inhibitory input, the excitatory input can optimally drive olivary spiking, riding on top of the first cycle of the subthreshold oscillations that have been powerfully reset by the preceding inhibitory input. Simulations of a large-scale network model of the inferior olive highlight to what extent the synaptic interactions penetrate in the neuropil, generating quasi-oscillatory spiking patterns in large parts of the olivary subnuclei, the size of which also depends on the relative timing of the inhibitory and excitatory inputs.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Anxiety-like behaviors in mice unmasked: Revealing sex differences in anxiety using a novel light-heat conflict test</a></h4>

              
                Anxiety and chronic pain afflict hundreds of millions worldwide. Both anxiety and pain are more prevalent in females (vs. males). Unfortunately, robust sex differences in human anxiety are not recapitulated in rodent tests, and results from rodent pain studies frequently fail to translate clinically. Therefore, there is a need to develop tests that reflect the differential salience of anxiety or pain-related stimuli between the sexes. Accordingly, here we introduce the Thermal Increments Dark-Light (TIDAL) conflict test. The TIDAL test places an anxiety-relevant stimulus (dark vs. illuminated chamber) in conflict with a heat-related stimulus (incrementally heated vs. isothermic chamber); mice freely explore the dark-heating and illuminated-isothermic chambers. Here, we aim to determine whether the TIDAL conflict test reveals in mice underappreciated sex differences in anxiety and/or heat sensitivity. We establish in three distinct experiments that females on the TIDAL conflict test persist substantially longer on the dark-heated plate, suggesting that females (vs. males) exhibit elevated anxiety-like behavior. Mice more strongly prefer the dark plate on the TIDAL conflict test compared to control thermal place preference with both chambers illuminated. We also reveal that mice exposed to TIDAL for a second session exhibit signs of learning. Therefore, our new TIDAL conflict test reliably unmasks the relative salience of anxiety (vs. heat sensitivity): mice that are female exhibit robust anxiety-like behaviors not consistently observed in classical tests. Future studies should incorporate TIDAL and other conflict tests to better understand rodent behavior and to identify mechanisms underlying anxiety and pain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Resting EEG power spectra across middle to late life: Associations with age, cognition, APOE-ε4 carriage and cardiometabolic burden</a></h4>

              
                We investigated how resting EEG measures are associated with risk factors for late-life cognitive impairment and dementia, including age, Apolipoprotein E e4 (APOE-e4) carriage and cardiometabolic burden. Resting EEG was recorded from 86 adults (50-80 years of age). Participants additionally completed the Addenbrookes Cognitive Examination (ACE) III and had blood drawn to assess APOE-e4 carriage status and cardiometabolic burden. EEG power spectra were decomposed into sources of periodic and aperiodic activity to derive measures of aperiodic component slope and alpha (7-14 Hz) and beta (15-30 Hz) peak power and peak frequency. The aperiodic component slope was correlated with ACE-III scores but not age. Alpha peak frequency decreased with age. Individuals with higher cardiometabolic burden had lower alpha peak frequencies and lower beta peak power. APOE-e4 carriers had lower beta peak frequencies. Our findings suggest that the slope of the aperiodic component of resting EEG power spectra is more closely associated with cognitive performance (which generally declines with age) rather than chronological age, where these have been conflated in previous work.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Prefrontal representation of affective stimuli: importance of stress, sex, and context</a></h4>

              
                Major depressive disorder diminishes health-related quality-of-life and disproportionality impacts females. Negative life events predict the onset of depressive symptoms including negative mood, anhedonia, and social withdrawal. While the neurobiology of affective illness is not completely understood, structural and functional changes in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) associate with mood and anxiety disorders. Rodent studies have investigated the prefrontal impact of chronic stress, a preclinical model of mood disruption. However, ex vivo slice and postmortem histological studies have focused largely on males and yielded mixed results. Although genetically-defined recordings in behaving animals of both sexes have not been reported. Here, we hypothesized that chronic variable stress (CVS) would reduce the neural processing of affective stimuli in the infralimbic region of rodent vmPFC region. To test this hypothesis, we targeted expression of a fluorescent calcium indicator, GCaMP6s, to infralimbic pyramidal cells. In males, CVS reduced infralimbic responses to social interaction and restraint stress but increased responses to novel objects and food reward. In contrast, females did not have CVS-induced changes in infralimbic activity, which was partially dependent on ovarian status. Collectively, these results indicate that both male and female vmPFC pyramidal cells encode social, stress, and reward stimuli. However, chronic stress effects are sex-dependent and behavior-specific. Ultimately, these findings extend the understanding of chronic stress-induced prefrontal dysfunction and indicate that sex is a critical factor for cortical processing of affective stimuli.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Pyfiber: an open source python library that facilitates the merge of operant behavior and fiber photometry- focus on intravenous self-administration</a></h4>

              
                Background- Advances in in vivo fluorescent imaging have exploded with the recent developments of genetically encoded calcium indicators (GECIs) and fluorescent biosensors. Their use with a bulk imaging technique such as fiber photometry (FP) can be highly beneficial in identifying neuronal signatures in behavioral neuroscience experiments. Popularity of FP has grown rapidly. Initially applied to classical conditioning, its integration into operant behavior paradigms is progressing. However, in operant behavior, protocols can be complex including numerous scheduled events, while behavioral responses can occur in diverse and non-predictable manners. To optimize data processing and analysis, there is a need for a flexible tool to extract and relate behavioral and fiber photometry data occurring over operant sessions. New Method- Applied to cocaine intravenous self-administration (using ImetronicR polymodal apparati) and FP recordings in the prelimbic cortex (using Doric Lenses photometry system) in the rat, we established Pyfiber, an outline and open source data analysis python library that facilitates the merge of fiber photometry (using Doric Lenses) with operant behavior (using ImetronicR). It allows relating activity changes within a neuronal population to the various behavioral responses and events occurring during operant behavior. Results- We show some of the possibilities and benefits of the analytical tool Pyfiber, which helps to: 1. Extract the different types of events that occur in an operant session, 2. Extract and process the fiber photometry signals, 3. Select events of interest and align them to the corresponding fiber photometry signals, 4. Apply the most appropriate type of FP signal normalization and signal analysis according to the studied type of event or behavioral response, 5. Run data extraction and analysis on multiple individuals and sessions at the same time, 6. Collect results in an easily readable format for statistical analysis. From our data and through the use of Pyfiber, we show that we can successfully record and easily analyze calcium transients surrounding events occurring during a cocaine self-administration paradigm in the rat. Comparison with Existing Method(s)- While other analytical tools can be used for streamlined fiber photometry analysis, they are either too rigid and specific or too flexible, requiring extensive coding to properly fit the data sets. Additionally, current tools do not permit easy exploration of multiple types of events in parallel- something that is possible with Pyfiber. Conclusions- This work established an open source resource that facilitates the pairing of fiber photometry recordings (using Doric Lenses photometry system) with operant behavior (using ImetronicR polymodal apparati), setting a solid foundation in analyzing the relationship between different dimensions of operant behavior with fluorescent signals from brain regions of interest.

                We acquire perceptual skills through training to adapt ourself to the changing environment. Accomplishing an effective skill acquisition is a main purpose of perceptual learning research. However, different perceptual trainings may interfere with each other, and thus limit the application of perceptual learning outside of laboratories. Here, we trained human participants on an orientation discrimination task. We observed a proactive interference effect that the first training blocked the second training at its untrained location. This was a more pronounced effect than the well-known location specificity in perceptual learning. We introduced a short reactivation of the first training before the second training and successfully eliminated the proactive interference when the second training was inside the reconsolidation time window of the reactivated first training. Interestingly, we found that practicing an irrelevant task at the location of the second training immediately after the reactivation of the first training could also restore the effect of the second training but in a smaller magnitude, even if the second training was conducted outside of the reconsolidation window. These results demonstrated that reactivation could facilitate the integration of multiple perceptual trainings at two levels, depending on the activated representations during the reconsolidation process. It can integrate previously trained and untrained locations to release the training-induced attentional suppression or the different trainings at these locations to facilitate the generalization of training effects between them. The findings provide us with new insight into the roles of long-term memory mechanisms in perceptual learning.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Disentangled multi-subject and social behavioral representations through a constrained subspace variational autoencoder (CS-VAE)</a></h4>

              
                Effectively modeling and quantifying behavior is essential for our understanding of the brain. Modeling behavior in naturalistic settings in social and multi-subject tasks in a unified manner remains a significant challenge. Modeling the behavior of different subjects performing the same task requires partitioning the behavioral data into features that are common across subjects, and others that are distinct to each subject. Modeling social interactions between multiple individuals in a freely-moving setting requires disentangling effects due to the individual as compared to social investigations. To achieve flexible disentanglement of behavior into interpretable latent variables with individual and across-subject or social components, we build on a semi-supervised approach to partition the behavioral subspace, and propose a novel regularization based on the Cauchy-Schwarz divergence to the model. Our model, known as the constrained subspace variational autoencoder (CS-VAE), successfully models distinct features of the behavioral videos across subjects, as well as continuously varying differences in social behavior. Our approach vastly facilitates the analysis of the resulting latent variables in downstream tasks such as uncovering disentangled behavioral motifs and the efficient decoding of a novel subject's behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">An automated BIDS-App for brain segmentation of human fetal functional MRI data</a></h4>

              
                Fetal functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) offers critical insight into the developing brain and could aid in predicting developmental outcomes. As the fetal brain is surrounded by heterogeneous tissue, it is not possible to use adult- or child-based segmentation toolboxes. Manually-segmented masks can be used to extract the fetal brain; however, this comes at significant time costs. Here, we present a new BIDS App for masking fetal fMRI, funcmasker-flex, that overcomes these issues with a robust 3D convolutional neural network (U-net) architecture implemented in an extensible and transparent Snakemake workflow. Open-access fetal fMRI data with manual brain masks from 159 fetuses (1103 total volumes) were used for training and testing the U-net model. We also tested generalizability of the model using 82 locally acquired functional scans from 19 fetuses, which included over 2300 manually segmented volumes. Dice metrics were used to compare performance of funcmasker-flex to the ground truth manually segmented volumes, and segmentations were consistently robust (all Dice metrics [&ge;]0.74). The tool is freely available and can be applied to any BIDS dataset containing fetal bold sequences. Funcmasker-flex reduces the need for manual segmentation, even when applied to novel fetal functional datasets, resulting in significant time-cost savings for performing fetal fMRI analysis.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Longitudinal assessment of water-reaching reveals altered cortical activity and fine motor coordination defects in a Huntington Disease model</a></h4>

              
                Huntington Disease (HD), caused by dominantly inherited expansions of a CAG repeat results in characteristic motor dysfunction. Although gross motor and balance defects have been extensively characterized in multiple HD mouse models using tasks such as rotarod, beam walking and gait analysis, little is known about forelimb deficits. Here we use a high-throughput alternating reward/non-reward water-reaching task conducted daily over ~2 months to simultaneously monitor forelimb impairment and mesoscale cortical changes in GCaMP activity, comparing female zQ175 (HD) and wildtype (WT) littermate mice, starting at ~5.5 months of age. Behavioral analysis of the water-reaching task reveals that HD mice, despite learning the water-reaching task as proficiently as WT mice, take longer to learn the alternating event sequence. Although WT mice displayed no significant changes in cortical activity and reaching trajectory throughout the testing period, HD mice exhibited an increase in cortical activity - especially in the secondary motor and retrosplenial cortices - over time, as well as longer and more variable reaching trajectories by ~7 months of age. HD mice also experienced a progressive reduction in successful performance rates. Tapered beam and rotarod tests before and/or after water-reaching assessment confirmed these early and manifest stages of HD characterized by the absence and presence of failed water-reaching trials, respectively. Reduced DARPP-32 (marker for striatal medium spiny neurons) expression in HD mice further confirmed disease pathology. The water-reaching task can be used to inform HD and potentially other movement disorder onset, therapeutic intervention windows and test drug efficacy.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Canonical and Replicable Multi-Scale Intrinsic Connectivity Networks in 100k+ Resting-State fMRI Datasets</a></h4>

              
                Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) has shown considerable promise for improving our understanding of brain function and characterizing various mental and cognitive states in the healthy and disordered brain. However, the lack of accurate and precise estimations of comparable functional patterns across datasets, individuals, and ever-changing brain states in a way that captures both individual variation and inter-subject correspondence limits the clinical utility of rsfMRI and its application to single-subject analyses. We posit that using reliable network templates and advanced group-informed network estimation approaches to accurately and precisely obtain individualized (dynamic) networks that retain cross-subject correspondence while maintaining subject-specific information is one potential solution to overcome the aforementioned barrier when considering cross-study comparability, independence of subject-level estimates, the limited data available in single studies, and the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of rsfMRI. Toward this goal, we first obtained a reliable and replicable network template. We combined rsfMRI data of over 100k individuals across private and public datasets and selected around 58k that meet quality control (QC) criteria. We then applied multi-model-order independent component analysis (ICA) and subsampling to obtain reliable canonical intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs) across multiple spatial scales. The selected ICNs (i.e., network templates) were also successfully replicated by independently analyzing the data that did not pass the QC criteria, highlighting the robustness of our adaptive template to data quality. We next studied the feasibility of estimating the corresponding subject-specific ICNs using a multivariate-spatially constrained ICA as an example of group-informed network estimation approaches. The results highlight that several factors, including ICNs themselves, data length, and spatial resolution, play key roles in successfully estimating the ICNs at the subject level. Large-scale ICNs, in general, require less data to achieve a specific level of spatial similarity with their templates (as well as within- and between-subject spatial similarity). Moreover, increasing data length can reduce an ICN's subject-level specificity, suggesting longer scans might not always be desirable. We also show spatial smoothing can alter results, and the positive linear relationship we observed between data length and spatial smoothness (we posit that it is at least partially due to averaging over intrinsic dynamics or individual variation) indicates the importance of considering this factor in studies such as those focused on optimizing data length. Finally, the consistency in the spatial similarity between ICNs estimated using the full-length of data and subset of it across different data lengths may suggest that the lower within-subject spatial similarity in shorter data lengths is not necessarily only defined by lower reliability in ICN estimates; rather, it can also be an indication of brain dynamics (i.e., different subsets of data may reflect different ICN dynamics), and as we increase the data length, the result approaches the average (also known as static) ICN pattern, and therefore loses its distinctiveness.

                The lateralisation of 8-12 Hz alpha activity is a canonical signature of human spatial cognition that is typically studied under strict fixation requirements. Yet, even during attempted fixation, the brain produces small involuntary eye movements known as microsaccades. Here we report how spontaneous microsaccades -- made in the absence of incentives to look elsewhere -- can themselves drive transient lateralisation of EEG alpha power according to microsaccade direction. This transient lateralisation of posterior alpha power occurs similarly following start and return microsaccades and is driven by increased alpha power ipsilateral to microsaccade direction. This reveals new links between spontaneous microsaccades and human electrophysiological brain activity, and highlights how microsaccades are an important factor to consider in studies relating alpha activity to spatial cognition.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Genetic tools that target mechanoreceptors produce reliable labeling of bladder afferents</a></h4>

              
                Mechanosensitive bladder sensory neurons are critical for sensing bladder distention, but their role in bladder pain and bladder pathology is poorly understood, due in part, to the challenges of identifying mechanoreceptors in tissue sections. A lot of what is known about how disease alters sensory innervation of the bladder comes from studies that traditionally focus on nociceptive nerve terminals. In seeking tools to characterize the role of non-nociceptive afferents in the bladder, we first examined neurofilament heavy (NFH), a marker for medium to large-diameter myelinated A fibers, in combination with the common marker for peptidergic nociceptors, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). While there was partial overlap between NFH and CGRP, 87% of NFH fibers were CGRP-negative, underscoring the abundance of non-nociceptive A fibers nerve terminals in the bladder. Two mouse lines that have been used for genetic labeling of mechanoreceptors of the skin were tested for their ability to label bladder afferents. Once crossed to Cre-dependent reporter lines, tyrosine kinase B (TrkB) TrkBCreER2 mice can be used to label A-delta mechanoreceptors while receptor tyrosine kinase ret protooncogene (Ret) RetCreER2 mice can label a combination of A-beta mechanoreceptors and non-peptidergic nociceptors in adult mice (late Ret). Both mouse lines produced successful labeling of bladder nerve terminals demonstrating partial overlap with NFH and minimal overlap with CGRP. Thus, we have identified new genetic strategies to investigate CGRP-negative subpopulations of bladder afferents that remain largely uncharacterized in studies that target peptidergic nociceptors. These tools can help elucidate the role of mechanosensitive afferents in bladder pathophysiology and urologic chronic pain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Multichannel neural spike sorting with spike reduction and positional feature</a></h4>

              
                Sorting neural voltages measured from a multichannel neural probe to extract the single unit activities of neuronal firing, especially in real-time, remains a significant technical challenge, largely due to the large amount of acquired data and the technical difficulties involved in processing and classifying these neural spikes promptly. Most neural spike sorting algorithms focus on sorting neural spikes post hoc for high sorting accuracy, and reducing the processing time generally is not the chief concern. Here we report on two signal processing modifications to our previously developed single-channel real-time spike sorting (Enhanced Growing Neural Gas) algorithm, which is largely based on graph network. Duplicated neural spikes were eliminated and represented by the neural spike with the strongest signal profile, significantly reducing the amount of neural data to be processed. In addition, the channel from which the representing neural spike was recorded was used as an additional feature to differentiate between neural spikes recorded from different neurons having similar temporal features. With these two modifications, the Graph nEtwork Multichannel (GEMsort) neural spike sorting algorithm can rapidly sort neural spikes without requiring significant computer processing power and system memory storage. The parallel processing architecture of GEMsort is particularly suitable for digital hardware implementation to improve processing speed and recording channel scalability. Multichannel synthetic neural spikes and actual neural recordings with Neuropixels probes were used to evaluate the sorting accuracies of the GEMsort algorithm.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Ultrafast (>400 Hz) network oscillations induced in thalamorecipient cortical layers by optogenetic activation of thalamocortical axons</a></h4>

              
                Oscillations of extracellular voltage, reflecting synchronous rhythmic activity in large populations of neurons, are a ubiquitous feature in the mammalian brain and are thought to subserve critical, if not fully understood cognitive functions. Oscillations at different frequency bands are hallmarks of specific brain or behavioral states. At the higher end of the scale, ultrafast (400-600 Hz) oscillations in the somatosensory cortex, in response to peripheral stimulation, were observed in human and a handful of animal studies; however, their synaptic basis and functional significance remain largely unexplored. Here we report that brief optogenetic activation of thalamocortical axons ex-vivo elicited precisely reproducible, ~410 Hz local field potential wavelets ("ripplets") in middle layers of mouse somatosensory (barrel) cortex. Fast-spiking (FS) inhibitory interneurons were exquisitely synchronized with each other and fired spike bursts in anti-phase with ripplets, while excitatory neurons fired only 1-2 spikes per stimulus. Both subtypes received shared excitatory inputs at ripplet frequency, and bursts in layer 5 FS cells required intact connection with layer 4, suggesting that layer 4 excitatory cells were driving FS bursts in both layers. Ripplets may be a ubiquitous cortical response to exceptionally salient sensory stimuli, and could provide increased bandwidth for encoding and transmitting sensory information. Lastly, optogenetically-induced ripplets are a uniquely accessible model system for studying synaptic mechanisms of fast and ultrafast oscillations.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Random Tactile Noise Stimulation Reveals Beta-Rhythmic Impulse Response Function of the Somatosensory System</a></h4>

              
                Both passive tactile stimulation and motor actions result in dynamic changes in beta-band (15-30 Hz Hz) oscillations over somatosensory cortex. Similar to alpha-band (8-12 Hz) power decrease in the visual system, beta-band power also decreases following stimulation of the somatosensory system. This relative suppression of alpha and beta oscillations is generally interpreted as an increase in cortical excitability. Here, next to traditional single-pulse stimuli, we employed a random intensity continuous right index finger tactile stimulation (white noise), which enabled us to uncover an impulse response function (IRF) of the somatosensory system. Contrary to previous findings, we demonstrate a burst-like initial increase rather than decrease of beta activity following white noise stimulation (human participants, N = 18, 8 female). These beta bursts, on average, lasted for 3 cycles and their frequency was correlated with resonant frequency of somatosensory cortex, as measured by a multi-frequency steady-state somatosensory evoked potential (SSSEP) paradigm. Furthermore, beta-band bursts shared spectro-temporal characteristics with evoked and resting-state beta oscillations. Taken together, our findings not only reveal a novel oscillatory signature of somatosensory processing that mimics the previously reported visual IRFs, but also point to a common oscillatory generator underlying spontaneous beta bursts in the absence of tactile stimulation and phase-locked beta bursts following stimulation, the frequency of which is determined by the resonance properties of the somatosensory system.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">ApoE4 causes severe COVID-19 outcomes via downregulation of ACE2</a></h4>

              
                The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2); host cell entry by this virus relies on the interaction between the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of its spike glycoprotein and the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor on cell membranes. In addition to serving as a receptor for SARS-CoV-2, ACE2 was originally discovered as a protective factor in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) that catalyses the degradation of angiotensin II (Ang II) to Ang 1-7, which is involved in multiple organ pathology. Recent genetic and clinical studies reported that ApoE4 expression is associated with increased susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and the development of severe COVID-19, but the underlying mechanism is currently unclear. In the present study, by using immunofluorescence staining, molecular dynamics simulations, proximity ligation assay (PLA) and coimmunoprecipitation (Co-IP) combined with a biolayer interferometry (BLI) assay, we found that ApoE interacts with both the spike protein and ACE2 but does not show obvious isoform-dependent binding effects. These data suggest that ApoE4 increases SARS-CoV-2 infectivity in a manner that may not depend on differential interactions with the spike protein or ACE2. Importantly, further immunoblotting and immunofluorescence staining results showed that ApoE4 significantly downregulates ACE2 protein expression in vitro and in vivo and subsequently decreases the conversion of Ang II to Ang 1-7, which could worsen tissue lesions; these findings provide a possible explain by which ApoE4 exacerbates COVID-19 disease.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A matter of availability: Neural representations of task-relevant stimulus features are sharper when stimuli are memorized rather than perceived.</a></h4>

              
                Our visual environment is relatively stable over time and an optimized visual system ought to capitalize on this by not devoting any representational resources to objects that are still present. Subjective experience, however, suggests that externally available (i.e., perceived) information is more strongly represented in neural signals than memorized information. To distinguish between these possibilities, we use EEG multivariate pattern analysis to quantify the strength of representation of task-relevant features (color or spatial frequency) in anticipation of a change-detection task. Perceptual availability was manipulated between experimental blocks by either keeping the stimulus on the screen during a two second delay period (perception) or removing it shortly after its initial presentation for the same time period (memory). We find that task-relevant (i.e., attended) memorized features are more strongly represented than irrelevant features. More importantly, we find significantly weaker representations for available (perceived and attended) features than for unavailable (memorized and attended) features. Contrary to what subjective experience suggests, our findings demonstrate that vividly perceived and attended stimuli elicit weaker neural representations (in terms of detectable multivariate information) than stimuli maintained in visual working memory. We hypothesize that an efficient visual system spends little of its limited resources on the internal representation of information that is externally available anyway.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Predictive neural representations of naturalistic dynamic input</a></h4>

              
                Our capacity to interact with our dynamic world in a timely manner (e.g., catch a ball) suggests that our brain generates predictions of unfolding external dynamics. While theories assume such neural predictions, empirical evidence typically only captures a snapshot or indirect consequence of prediction, and uses simple static stimuli of which predictability is manipulated. However, the rich dynamics of predictive representations remain largely unexplored. We present a novel dynamic extension to representational similarity analysis (RSA) that uses temporally variable models to capture naturalistic dynamic stimuli, and demonstrate both lagged and predictive neural representations in source-reconstructed MEG data. Interestingly, the predictive representations show a hierarchical pattern, such that higher-level stimulus features are predicted earlier in time, while lower-level features are predicted closer in time to the actual sensory input. This promising new approach opens the door for addressing important outstanding questions on how our brain represents and predicts our dynamic world.

	<p>Temporal interference transcranial alternating current stimulation (TI-tACS) is a new technique of noninvasive brain stimulation. Previous studies have shown the effectiveness of TI-tACS in stimulating brain areas in a selective manner. However, its safety in modulating human brain neurons is still untested. In this study, 38 healthy adults were recruited to undergo a series of neurological and neuropsychological measurements regarding safety concerns before and after active (2 mA, 20/70 Hz, 30 min) or sham (0 mA, 0 Hz, 30 min) TI-tACS. The neurological and neuropsychological measurements included electroencephalography (EEG), serum neuron-specific enolase (NSE), the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), the Purdue Pegboard Test (PPT), an abbreviated version of the California Computerized Assessment Package (A-CalCAP), a revised version of the Visual Analog Mood Scale (VAMS-R), a self-assessment scale (SAS), and a questionnaire about adverse effects (AEs). We found no significant difference between the measurements of the active and sham TI-tACS groups. Meanwhile, no serious or intolerable adverse effects were reported or observed in the active stimulation group of 19 participants. These results support that TI-tACS is safe and tolerable in terms of neurological and neuropsychological functions and adverse effects for use in human brain stimulation studies under typical transcranial electric stimulation (TES) conditions (2 mA, 20/70 Hz, 30 min).</p>

	<p>Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a very common disorder in children and adults. A connection with sleep disorders, and above all, disorders of the circadian rhythm are the subject of research and debate. The circadian system can be represented on different levels. There have been a variety of studies examining 24-h rhythms at the behavioral and endocrine level. At the molecular level, these rhythms are based on a series of feedback loops of core clock genes and proteins. In this paper, we compared the circadian rhythms at the behavioral, endocrine, and molecular levels between children with ADHD and age- and BMI-matched controls, complementing the previous data in adults. In a minimally invasive setting, sleep was assessed via a questionnaire, actigraphy was used to determine the motor activity and light exposure, saliva samples were taken to assess the 24-h profiles of cortisol and melatonin, and buccal mucosa swaps were taken to assess the expression of the clock genes BMAL1 and PER2. We found significant group differences in sleep onset and sleep duration, cortisol secretion profiles, and in the expression of both clock genes. Our data suggest that the analysis of circadian molecular rhythms may provide a new approach for diagnosing ADHD in children and adults.</p>

	<p>Background: Epilepsy (Ep) is a chronic neural disease. The diagnosis of epilepsy depends on detailed seizure history and scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) examinations. The automatic recognition of epileptic EEG is an artificial intelligence application developed from machine learning (ML). Purpose: This study compares the classification effects of two kinds of classifiers by controlling the EEG data source and characteristic values. Method: All EEG data were collected by GSN HydroCel 256 leads and high-density EEG from Xiangya Third Hospital. This study used time-domain features (mean, kurtosis and skewness processed by empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and three IMFs), a frequency-domain feature (power spectrum density, PSD) and a non-linear feature (Shannon entropy). Support vector machine (SVM) and gradient-boosting decision tree (GBDT) classifiers were used to recognize epileptic EEG. Result: The result of the SVM classifier showed an accuracy of 72.00%, precision of 73.98%, and an F1_score of 82.28%. Meanwhile, the result of the GBDT classifier showed a sensitivity of 98.57%, precision of 89.13%, F1_score of 93.40%, and an AUC of 0.9119. Conclusion: The comparison of GBDT and SVM by controlling the variables of the feature values and parameters of a classifier is presented. GBDT obtained the better classification accuracy (90.00%) and F1_score (93.40%).</p>

In microglia, due to the limitations of current single-omics data analysis, risk genes, the regulatory mechanisms, the mechanisms of action of immune responses and the exploration of drug targets for AD immunotherapy are still unclear. Therefore, we proposed a method to integrate multi-omics data based on the construction of gene regulatory networks (GRN), by combining weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) with single-cell regulatory network inference and clustering (SCENIC). This enables snRNA-seq data and bulkRNA-seq data to obtain data on the deeper intermolecular regulatory relationships, related genes, and the molecular mechanisms of immune-cell action. In our approach, not only were central transcription factors (TF) STAT3, CEBPB, SPI1, and regulatory mechanisms identified more accurately than with single-omics but also immunotherapy targeting central TFs to drugs was found to be significantly different between patients. Thus, in addition to providing new insights into the potential regulatory mechanisms and pathogenic genes of AD microglia, this approach can assist clinicians in making the most rational treatment plans for patients with different risks; it also has significant implications for identifying AD immunotherapy targets and targeting microglia-associated immune drugs.</p>

	<p>Background: Emergence delirium (ED) usually occurs in children after surgery with an incidence of 10&amp;amp;minus;80%. Though ED is mostly self-limited, its potential injuries cannot be ignored. Whether electroencephalography (EEG)-parameter-guided anesthesia could reduce the incidence of ED in pediatric surgery has not been fully discussed to date. Methods: Fifty-four boys aged 2&amp;amp;ndash;12 years undergoing elective hypospadias surgery under sevoflurane anesthesia were selected. In the EEG-parameter-guided group (E group), sevoflurane was used for anesthesia induction and was maintained by titrating the spectral edge frequency (SEF) to 10&amp;amp;ndash;15 and combining the monitoring of density spectral array (DSA) power spectra and raw EEG. While in the control group (C group), anesthesiologists were blinded to the SedLine screen (including SEF, DSA, and raw EEG) and adjusted the intraoperative drug usage according to their experience. Patients with a Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium (PAED) score &amp;amp;gt; 10 were diagnosed with ED, while patients with a PAED score &amp;amp;gt; 2 were diagnosed with emergence agitation (EA). Results: Finally, a total of 37 patients were included in this trial. The incidence of ED in the E group was lower than in the C group (5.6% vs. 36.8%; p = 0.04), while the incidence of EA was similar in the two groups (61% vs. 78.9%; p = 0.48). Intraoperative parameters including remifentanil dosage and the decrease in mean arterial pressure (MAP) were not different between the two groups (p &amp;amp;gt; 0.05), but the mean end-tidal sevoflurane concentration (EtSevo) was lower in the E group than in the C group (p &amp;amp;gt; 0.05). Moreover, during PACU stay, the extubation time and discharge time of the groups were similar, while the PAED scores within 5 min from extubation and the Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, and Consolability (FLACC) scores within 30 min from extubation were lower in the E group than in the C group. Conclusion: EEG-parameter-guided anesthesia management reduced the incidence of ED in children. Studies with larger sample sizes are needed to obtain more convincing results.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Altered tau in rTg4510 mice after a single interfaced CHIMERA traumatic brain injury</a></h4>

              
                Traumatic brain injury (TBI) in an established risk factor for neurodegenerative disease. In this report, we used the Closed Head Injury Model of Engineered Rotational Acceleration (CHIMERA) to study the effects of a single moderate-severe TBI in rTg4510 mice, a mouse model of tauopathy. Fifteen male rTg4510 mice were impacted at 4.0J at 4-mo of age using interfaced CHIMERA and compared to sham controls. Immediately after injury, moderate-severe TBI induced significant mortality (7/15; 47%), and a prolonged duration of loss of righting reflex. At 2-mo post-injury, surviving mice displayed significant histological evidence of microgliosis (Iba1) and axonal injury (Neurosilver). Western blotting showed that TBI mice had a reduced p-GSK-3{beta} (S9):GSK-3{beta} ratio, suggesting greater tau kinase activity. However, tauopathy in surviving TBI mice showed a divergent response, with 3/8 mice having a very low level of tau protein in brain lysates (i.e. lower than sham), and were thus analyzed separately from the other 5/8 TBI mice that maintained the expected level of total tau. Compared to sham controls, TBI mice with normal tau levels had increased p-tau (PHF1 and AT8), increased autophagolysosome accumulation (p62 and Cathepsin D) and decreased hippocampal size. These findings were not observed in TBI mice with low total tau levels. These observations suggest that TBI leads to chronic white matter injury and altered GSK-3{beta} activity. However, post-injury tauopathy and autophagolysosome accumulation diverged in surviving mice through mechanisms that remain to be defined.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The locus coeruleus mediates behavioral flexibility</a></h4>

              
                Behavioral flexibility refers to the ability to adjust behavioral strategies in response to changing environmental contingencies. A major hypothesis in the field posits that the activity of neurons in the locus coeruleus (LC) plays an important role in mediating behavioral flexibility. To test this hypothesis, we developed a novel context-dependent bilateral tactile detection task where mice responded to left and right whisker deflections in a rule-dependent manner and exhibited varying degrees of flexible switching behavior. Recording from optogenetically-tagged neurons in the LC during task performance revealed a prominent graded correlation between baseline LC activity and behavioral flexibility, where higher baseline activity following a rule change was associated with faster behavioral switching to the new rule. Increasing baseline LC activity with optogenetic activation improved task performance and accelerated task switching. Overall, our study provides strong evidence to demonstrate that LC activity mediates behavioral flexibility.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Development of the alpha rhythm is linked to visual white matter pathways and visual detection performance</a></h4>

              
                Alpha is the strongest electrophysiological rhythm in awake humans at rest. Despite its predominance in the EEG signal, strong variations can be observed in alpha properties during development, with an increase of alpha frequency over childhood and adulthood. Here we tested the hypothesis that these changes of alpha rhythm are related to the maturation of visual white matter pathways. We capitalized on a large dMRI-EEG dataset (dMRI n=2,747, EEG n=2,561) of children and adolescents (age range: 5-21 years old) and showed that maturation of the optic radiation specifically accounts for developmental changes of alpha frequency. Behavioral analyses also confirmed that variations of alpha frequency are related to maturational changes in visual perception. The present findings demonstrate the close link between developmental variations in white matter tissue properties, electrophysiological responses, and behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Effects of stimulus rate and periodicity on auditory cortical entrainment to continuous sounds</a></h4>

              
                The neural mechanisms underlying the exogenous coding and neural entrainment to rapid auditory stimuli have seen a recent surge of interest. However, few studies have characterized how parametric changes in stimulus presentation alter entrained responses. Applying inter-trial phase-locking (ITPL) and phase-locking value (PLV) analyses applied to high-density human electroencephalogram (EEG) data, we investigated the degree to which the brain entrains to speech vs. non-speech (i.e., click) sounds within and across tokens. Passive cortico-acoustic tracking was investigated in N=24 normal young adults utilizing EEG time-frequency and source analyses that isolated neural activity stemming from both auditory temporal cortices. We parametrically manipulated the rate and periodicity of repetitive, continuous speech and click stimuli to investigate how speed and jitter in ongoing sounds stream affect oscillatory entrainment. Both stimulus domains showed rightward hemisphere asymmetry in phase-locking strength with stronger and earlier responses to speech vs. clicks. Neuronal synchronization to speech was enhanced at 4.5 Hz (the putative universal rate of speech) and showed a differential pattern to that of clicks, particularly at higher rates. Phase-locking to speech decreased with increasing jitter but entrainment to speech remained superior to clicks. Surprisingly, click were invariant to periodicity manipulations. Our findings provide evidence that the brain's neural entrainment to complex sounds is enhanced and more sensitized when processing speech relative to non-speech sounds. That this specialization is apparent even under passive listening suggests a priority of the auditory system for synchronizing to behaviorally-relevant signals.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cell type-specific basal forebrain GABAergic neuronal activity with olfactory task performance, learning, and decision-making</a></h4>

              
                Sensory perception relies on the flexible detection and interpretation of stimuli across variable contexts, conditions, and behavioral states. The basal forebrain is a hub for behavioral state regulation, supplying dense cholinergic and GABAergic projections to various brain regions involved in sensory processing. Of GABAergic neurons in the basal forebrain, parvalbumin (PV) and somatostatin (SST) subtypes serve opposing roles regulating behavioral states. To elucidate the role of basal forebrain circuits in sensory-guided behavior, we investigated GABAergic signaling dynamics during odor-guided decision-making. We used fiber photometry to record cell type-specific basal forebrain activity during an odor discrimination task and correlate temporal patterns of PV and SST neuronal activity with olfactory task performance. We found that PV-expressing GABAergic neurons are activated by odors and are selectively suppressed by reward. However, SST-expressing GABAergic neurons are activated during both odor and reward delivery. Notably, odor and reward responses of PV and SST neurons are uniquely correlated with behavioral measures of odor discrimination and decision bias. Additionally, as mice undergo discrimination learning, the magnitude of reward-related excitation decreases in SST neurons, while reward-related suppression increases in PV neurons. Finally, we show that chemogenetic inhibition of SST neurons alters decision bias to favor reward-seeking. These results suggest that subtypes of GABAergic basal forebrain neurons are differentially involved in decision-making, and that their bidirectional activity impacts decision making during olfactory guided behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Characterization of b-value dependent T2 relaxation rates for probing neurite microstructure</a></h4>

              
                Brain tissue microstructure is characterized by heterogeneous diffusivity and transversal relaxation rates. Standard diffusion MRI (dMRI) is acquired using a single echo time (TE) and only provides information about heterogeneous diffusivity in the underlying tissue. Combined relaxation diffusion MRI (rdMR) integrates dMRI with multiple TEs to probe the coupling between relaxation rate and diffusivity. This work introduces a method to model rdMRI data signals by characterizing the apparent relaxation rate related to dMRI with different b-values. The proposed approach can extrapolate dMRI signals to ultra-long or ultra-short TEs to increase or reduce signals from intra-neurite water to improve the characterization of neurite microstructure without solving multi-compartment models. The performance of the proposed method was examined using an in vivo dataset acquired from a clinical scanner to estimate neurite sizes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural responses to movie naturalistic stimuli are related to listening demand in cochlear implant users</a></h4>

              
                There is a weak relationship between clinical and self-reported speech perception outcomes in cochlear implant (CI) listeners. Such poor correspondence may be due to differences in clinical and "real-world" listening environments and stimuli. Speech sounds in the real world are often accompanied by visual cues, background environmental noise and is generally in the context of a connected conversation. The aims of this study were to determine if brain responses to naturalistic speech could index speech perception and listening demand in CI users. Accordingly, we recorded high density EEG while CI users listened/watched a naturalistic stimulus (i.e., the television show, "The Office"). We used continuous EEG to quantify "speech neural tracking" (i.e., TRFs, temporal response functions) to the television show audio track and additionally 8-12 Hz (alpha) brain rhythms commonly related to listening effort. Background noise at three different signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), +5, +10, and +15 dB were presented to vary the difficulty of following the television show mimicking a natural noisy environment. The task included an additional condition of audio-only (no video). After each condition, participants subjectively rated listening demand and the degree of words and conversations they felt they could understand. Fifteen CI users reported progressively higher degrees of listening demand and less words and conversation with increasing background noise. Listening demand and conversation understanding in the audio-only condition was comparable to that of the highest noise condition (+5 dB). The addition of the background noise reduced the degree of speech neural tracking. Mixed effect modeling showed that listening demand and conversation understanding were correlated to cortical speech tracking such that high demand and low conversation understanding lower associated with lower amplitude TRFs. In the high noise condition, greater listening demand was negatively correlated to parietal alpha power such that higher demand was related to lower alpha power. No significant correlations were observed between TRF/alpha and clinical speech perception scores. These results are similar to previous findings showing little relationship between speech perception and quality of life in CI users. However, the physiological responses to complex natural speech may anticipate aspects of quality-of-life measures such as self-perceived listening demand.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Regulation of neuropathic pain by microglial Orai1 channels</a></h4>

              
                Microglia are important mediators of neuroinflammation that underlies neuropathic pain. However, the molecular checkpoints controlling microglial reactivity are not well-understood. We investigated the role of Orai1 channels for microglia-mediated neuroinflammation following nerve injury and find that deletion of Orai1 in microglia attenuates Ca2+ signaling and the production of inflammatory cytokines by proalgesic agonists. Conditional deletion of Orai1 attenuated microglia proliferation in the dorsal horn, spinal cytokines levels, and potentiation of excitatory neurotransmission following peripheral nerve injury. These cellular effects were accompanied by mitigation of pain hyperalgesia in Orai1 knockout mice. A small-molecule Orai1 inhibitor, CM4620, similarly mitigated allodynia in male mice. Surprisingly, these protective effects were not seen in female mice, revealing striking sexual dimorphism in Orai1 regulation of microglial reactivity and hyperalgesia. These findings indicate that Orai1 channels are key regulators of the sexually dimorphic role of microglia for the neuroinflammation that underlies neuropathic pain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Arc ubiquitination regulates endoplasmic reticulum-mediated Ca2+ release and CaMKII signaling</a></h4>

              
                Synaptic plasticity relies on rapid, yet spatially precise signaling to alter synaptic strength. Arc is a brain enriched protein that is rapidly expressed during learning-related behaviors and is essential for regulating metabotropic glutamate receptor-mediated long-term depression (mGluR-LTD). We previously showed that disrupting the ubiquitination capacity of Arc enhances mGluR-LTD; however, the mechanism by which this occurs and its consequences on other mGluR-mediated signaling events is unknown. Here we show that disrupting Arc ubiquitination on key amino acid residues leads to derangements in Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) during pharmacological activation of Group I mGluRs. These alterations were observed in all neuronal subregions except secondary branchpoints. Deficits in Arc ubiquitination increased Arc self-association and enhanced its interaction with calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IIb (CaMKIIb) and constitutively active forms of CaMKII. Notably, these interactions were also excluded at secondary branchpoints. Finally, disruptions in Arc ubiquitination were found to increase Arc interaction with the integral ER protein Calnexin. These results suggest a previously unknown role for Arc ubiquitination in the fine tuning of ER-mediated Ca2+ signaling that is needed for mGluR-LTD, which, in turn, regulates CaMKII-dependent regulation of Arc.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Assembly of neuron- and radial glial cell-derived extracellular matrix molecules promotes radial migration of developing cortical neurons</a></h4>

              
                Radial neuronal migration is a key neurodevelopmental event for proper cortical laminar organization. Newly born neurons migrate in a complex three-dimensional environment generated by the extracellular matrix (ECM), secreted factors, and neighboring cells. However, the molecular mechanisms by which the ECM controls radial migration remain largely unknown. We herein identified neurocan (NCAN), a risk factor for neuropsychiatric disorders, as a major chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan produced by developing cortical neurons. NCAN binds to both radial glial cell-derived tenascin-C (TNC) and hyaluronan (HA), a large linear polysaccharide, forming a ternary complex of NCAN, TNC, and HA. Developing cortical neurons make contact with the ternary complex during migration. The enzymatic or genetic disruption of the ternary complex impairs radial migration by suppressing the multipolar-to-bipolar transition. Furthermore, TNC in the ternary complex promotes neuronal morphological maturation. The present results provide evidence for the cooperative role of neuron- and radial glial cell-derived ECM molecules in cortical development.

                Brain region- and cell-specific transcriptomic and epigenomic molecular features are associated with heritability for neuropsychiatric traits, but a systematic view, considering cortical and subcortical regions, is lacking. Here, we provide an atlas of chromatin accessibility and gene expression in neuronal and non-neuronal nuclei across 25 distinct human cortical and subcortical brain regions from 6 neurotypical controls. We identified extensive gene expression and chromatin accessibility differences across brain regions, including variation in alternative promoter-isoform usage and enhancer-promoter interactions. Genes with distinct promoter-isoform usage across brain regions are strongly enriched for neuropsychiatric disease risk variants. Using an integrative approach, we characterized the function of the brain region-specific chromatin co-accessibility and gene-coexpression modules that are robustly associated with genetic risk for neuropsychiatric disorders. In addition, we identified a novel set of genes that is enriched for disease risk variants but is independent of cell-type specific gene expression and known susceptibility pathways. Our results provide a valuable resource for studying molecular regulation across multiple regions of the human brain and suggest a unique contribution of epigenetic modifications from subcortical areas to neuropsychiatric disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The Role of the Posterior Medial Network in Language Comprehension: Dissociating Construction of Episodic versus Semantic Representations</a></h4>

              
                Language comprehension involves the construction of complex mental representations, i.e., event representations, reflecting current events or situation models. The construction of these representations requires manipulation of both semantic and episodic content and has been widely associated with the functioning of the posterior medial network, a subsystem of the default network. However, it is still unknown the extent to which activity in posterior medial network reflects construction of the variable episodic versus semantic content of event representations. In this fMRI study, we establish the unique neural correlates of (1) episodic richness and (2) semantic coherence measured during a narrative reading task. Interestingly, we observed a functional fractionation within the posterior medial network in terms of brain regions whose activity was modulated by semantic or episodic content. Specifically, the number of episodic details in the narratives modulated the activity in the left angular gyrus and the retrosplenial cortex/ventral posterior cingulate cortex. Semantic coherence, in contrast, modulated neural responses in the right anterior temporal lobe/middle temporal gyrus, but also in brain regions within the posterior medial network, such as the dorsal posterior cingulate cortex. These results provide the first demonstration of functional dissociations within the posterior medial network in terms of brain regions involved in the construction of semantic versus episodic representational content during a language comprehension task.

	<p>The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of dietary fatty acid (FA) saturation and carbon chain length on brain bile acid (BA) metabolism and neuronal number in a pig model of pediatric NAFLD. Thirty 20-day-old Iberian pigs, pair-housed in pens, were randomly assigned to receive one of three hypercaloric diets for 10 weeks: (1) lard-enriched (LAR; n = 5 pens), (2) olive-oil-enriched (OLI, n = 5), and (3) coconut-oil-enriched (COC; n = 5). Pig behavior and activity were analyzed throughout the study. All animals were euthanized on week 10 and frontal cortex (FC) samples were collected for immunohistochemistry, metabolomic, and transcriptomic analyses. Data were analyzed by multivariate and univariate statistics. No differences were observed in relative brain weight, neuronal number, or cognitive functioning between diets. Pig activity and FC levels of neuroprotective secondary BAs and betaine decreased in the COC and OLI groups compared with LAR, and paralleled the severity of NAFLD. In addition, OLI-fed pigs showed downregulation of genes involved in neurotransmission, synaptic transmission, and nervous tissue development. Similarly, COC-fed pigs showed upregulation of neurogenesis and myelin repair genes, which caused the accumulation of medium-chain acylcarnitines in brain tissue. In conclusion, our results indicate that secondary BA levels in the FCs of NAFLD pigs are affected by dietary FA composition and are associated with metabolic and transcriptomic markers of brain injury. Dietary interventions that aim to replace saturated FAs by medium-chain or monounsaturated FAs in high-fat hypercaloric diets may have a negative effect on brain health in NAFLD patients.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Association of presynaptic loss with Alzheimer's disease and cognitive decline</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Increased presynaptic dysfunction measured by CSF growth-associated protein-43 (GAP43) may be observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but how CSF GAP43 increases relate to AD-core pathologies, neurodegeneration, and cognitive decline in AD remains further investigation.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We analyzed 731 elderly adults with baseline β-amyloid (Aβ) PET, CSF GAP43, CSF phosphorylated tau181 (p-Tau<sub>181</sub>) and <sup>18</sup>F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET, and longitudinal residual hippocampal volume (rHCV) and cognitive assessments. Among them, 377 individuals had longitudinal FDG PET, and 326 individuals had simultaneous longitudinal CSF GAP43, Aβ PET, and CSF p-Tau<sub>181</sub> data. We compared baseline and slopes of CSF GAP43 among different stages of AD as well as their associations with Aβ PET, CSF p-Tau<sub>181</sub>, rHCV, FDG PET, and cognition cross-sectionally and longitudinally.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Regardless of Aβ positivity and clinical diagnosis, CSF p-Tau<sub>181</sub>-positive individuals showed higher CSF GAP43 concentrations (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and faster rates of CSF GAP43 increases (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) compared to the CSF p-Tau<sub>181</sub>-negative individuals. Moreover, higher CSF GAP43 concentrations and faster rates of CSF GAP43 increases were strongly related to CSF p-Tau<sub>181</sub> independent of Aβ PET. They were related to more rapid hippocampal atrophy, hypometabolism, and cognitive decline (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and predicted the progression from MCI to dementia (area under the curve (AUC) for baseline, 0.704; AUC for slope, 0.717) over a median four years of follow-up.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Tau aggregations rather than Aβ plaques primarily drive presynaptic dysfunction measured by CSF GAP43, which may lead to sequential neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment in AD or neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Sleep problems are prevalent in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), can be observed before diagnosis, and are associated with increased restricted and repetitive behaviors. Therefore, sleep abnormalities may be a core feature of the disorder, but the developmental trajectory remains unknown. Animal models provide a unique opportunity to understand sleep ontogenesis in ASD. Previously we showed that adult mice with a truncation in the high-confidence ASD gene <i>Shank3</i> (Shank3<sup>∆C</sup>) recapitulate the clinical sleep phenotype. In this study we used longitudinal electro-encephalographic (EEG) recordings to define, for the first time, changes in sleep from weaning to young adulthood in an ASD mouse model. We show that Shank3<sup>∆C</sup> male mice sleep less overall throughout their lifespan, have increased rapid eye movement (REM) sleep early in life despite significantly reduced non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, and have abnormal responses to increased sleep pressure that emerge during a specific developmental period. We demonstrate that the ability to fall asleep quickly in response to sleep loss develops normally between 24 and 30 days in mice. However, mutants are unable to reduce sleep latency after periods of prolonged waking and maintain the same response to sleep loss regardless of age. This phenomenon seems independent of homeostatic NREM sleep slow-wave dynamics. Overall, our study recapitulates both preclinical models and clinical studies showing that reduced sleep is consistently associated with ASD and suggests that problems falling asleep may reflect abnormal development of sleep and arousal mechanisms.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Alpha oscillations reflect similar mapping mechanisms for localizing touch on hands and tools</a></h4>

              
                Numerous studies have suggested that tools become incorporated into a representation of our body. A prominent hypothesis suggests that our brain re-uses body-based computations when we use tools. However, little is known about how this is implemented at the neural level. Here we used the ability to localize touch on both tools and body parts as a case study to fill this gap. Neural oscillations in the alpha (8-13 Hz) and beta (15-25 Hz) frequency bands are involved in mapping touch on the body in distinct reference frames. Alpha activity reflects the mapping of touch in external coordinates, whereas beta activity reflects the mapping of touch in skin-centered coordinates. Here, we aimed at pinpointing the role of these oscillations during tool-extended sensing. We recorded participants' oscillatory activity while tactile stimuli were applied to either hands or the tips of hand-held rods. The posture of the hands/tool-tips was uncrossed or crossed at participants' body midline in order for us to disentangle brain responses related to different coordinate systems. We found that alpha-band activity was modulated similarly across postures when localizing touch on hands and on tools, reflecting the position of touch in external space. Source reconstruction also indicated a similar network of cortical regions involved for tools and hands. Our findings strongly suggest that the brain uses similar oscillatory mechanisms for mapping touch on the body and tools, supporting the idea of neural processes being repurposed for tool-use.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural Adaptation and Fractional Dynamics as a Window to Underlying Neural Excitability</a></h4>

              
                The relationship between macroscale electrophysiological recordings and the dynamics of underlying neural activity remains unclear. We have previously shown that low frequency EEG activity (<1 Hz) is decreased at the seizure onset zone (SOZ), while higher frequency activity (1-50 Hz) is increased. These changes result in power spectral densities (PSDs) with flattened slopes near the SOZ, which are assumed to be areas of increased excitability. We wanted to understand possible mechanisms underlying PSD changes in brain regions of increased excitability. We hypothesize that these observations are consistent with changes in adaptation within the neural circuit. We developed a theoretical framework and tested the effect of adaptation mechanisms, such as spike frequency adaptation and synaptic depression, on excitability and PSDs using filter-based neural mass models and conductance-based models. We compared the contribution of single timescale adaptation and multiple timescale adaptation. We found that adaptation with multiple timescales alters the PSDs. Multiple timescales of adaptation can approximate fractional dynamics, a form of calculus related to power laws, history dependence, and non-integer order derivatives. Coupled with input changes, these dynamics changed circuit responses in unexpected ways. Increased input without synaptic depression increases broadband power. However, increased input with synaptic depression may decrease power. The effects of adaptation were most pronounced for low frequency activity (< 1Hz). Increased input combined with a loss of adaptation yielded reduced low frequency activity and increased higher frequency activity, consistent with clinical EEG observations from SOZs. Spike frequency adaptation and synaptic depression, two forms of multiple timescale adaptation, affect low frequency EEG and the slope of PSDs. These neural mechanisms may underlie changes in EEG activity near the SOZ and relate to neural hyperexcitability. Neural adaptation may be evident in macroscale electrophysiological recordings and provide a window to understanding neural circuit excitability.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dissociated amplitude and phase effects of alpha oscillation in a nested structure of rhythm- and sequence-based temporal expectation</a></h4>

              
                The human brain can utilize various information to form temporal expectation and optimize perceptual performance. Here we show dissociated amplitude and phase effects of pre-stimulus alpha oscillation in a nested structure of rhythm- and sequence-based expectation. A visual stream of rhythmic stimuli was presented in a fixed sequence such that their temporal positions could be predicted by either the low-frequency rhythm, the sequence, or the combination. The behavioral modelling indicated that rhythmic and sequence information additively led to increased accumulation of sensory evidence and alleviated threshold for the perceptual discrimination of the expected stimulus. The electroencephalographical (EEG) results showed that the alpha amplitude was dominated by rhythmic information, with the amplitude fluctuating in the same frequency of the oscillation entrained by the rhythmic information (i.e., phase-amplitude coupling). The alpha phase, however, was affected by both rhythmic and sequence information. Importantly, rhythm-based expectation improved the perceptual performance by decreasing the alpha amplitude, whereas sequence-based expectation did not further decrease the amplitude on top of rhythm-based expectation. Moreover, rhythm-based and sequence-based expectation collaboratively improved the perceptual performance by biasing the alpha oscillation toward the optimal phase. Our findings suggested flexible coordination of multiscale brain oscillations in dealing with a complex environment.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Balancing true and false detection of intermittent sensory targets by adjusting the inputs to the evidence accumulation process</a></h4>

              
                Decisions about noisy stimuli are widely understood to be made by accumulating evidence up to a decision bound that can be adjusted according to task demands. However, relatively little is known about how such mechanisms operate in continuous monitoring contexts requiring intermittent target detection. Here, we examined neural decision processes underlying detection of 1-second coherence-targets within continuous random dot motion, and how they are adjusted across contexts with Weak, Strong, or randomly Mixed weak/strong targets. Our prediction was that decision bounds would be set lower when weak targets are more prevalent. Behavioural hit and false alarm rate patterns were consistent with this, and were well-captured by a bound-adjustable leaky accumulator model. However, beta-band EEG signatures of motor preparation contradicted this, instead indicating lower bounds in the Strong-target context. We thus tested two alternative models in which decision bound dynamics were constrained directly by Beta measurements, respectively featuring leaky accumulation with adjustable leak, and non-leaky accumulation of evidence referenced to an adjustable sensory-level criterion. We found that the latter model best explained both behaviour and neural dynamics, highlighting novel means of decision policy regulation and the importance of neurally-informed modelling.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Perception as a hierarchical competition: a model that differentiates imagined, veridical, and hallucinated percepts</a></h4>

              
                Mental imagery can be understood as the process by which a thought becomes experienced with sensory characteristics. Yet, it's not clear why mental images have diminished sensory features compared to veridical percepts, nor if and how mental images are phenomenologically distinct from hallucinations, another type of non-veridical sensory experience. Current evidence suggests that externally- and internally-generated percepts both depend on similar neural systems. If so, it's plausible that imagined and veridical stimuli should interfere with one another. Here we propose that considering how externally-generated stimuli (i.e. sensory input) and internally-generated stimuli (i.e. thoughts) might compete could be sufficient to differentiate veridical, imagined, and hallucinated percepts. To predict the perceptual consequences of competition, we constructed a computational model of a serially-connected, hierarchical system with bidirectional information flow, emulating the primate visual system. We simulated mental imagery as top-down generative feedback in our model, both with and without competition from bottom-up sensory input. Without competition, imagined stimuli formed the dominant representation at each level of the hierarchy. Yet, when competing sensory input was present, imagined stimuli were outcompeted at lower levels while remaining dominant at higher levels, with an equilibrium point in between. We interpret our findings under a framework whereby low-level, high-dimensional stimulus information (e.g. in the early visual cortex) contributes most to the sensory aspects of perceptual experience, while high-level, low-dimensional stimulus information (e.g. towards temporal regions) contributes most to the abstract, amodal aspects of perceptual experience. Our findings suggest that ongoing bottom-up sensory input during waking life may prevent imagined stimuli from outcompeting and overriding our sensory experience of veridical stimuli. In contrast, dampening or eradicating sensory input could cause internally-generated stimuli to dominate sensory experience. We further discuss how our model can explain individual differences in mental imagery quality, account for phenomena such as daydreaming and hallucinations, and model mental imagery in multiple sensory modalities.

                All drugs of abuse induce long-lasting changes in synaptic transmission and neural circuit function that underlie substance use disorders. Here, we demonstrate that dopaminergic neuronal activity-regulated myelin plasticity is a key modulator of dopaminergic circuit function and opioid reward. Oligodendroglial lineage cells respond to dopaminergic neuronal activity evoked by either optogenetic stimulation or by morphine administration specifically within the reward center ventral tegmental area (VTA), but not along the axonal projections in the medial forebrain bundle nor within the target nucleus accumbens (NAc). Genetic blockade of oligodendrogenesis dampens NAc dopamine release dynamics, which is critical for reward learning, and impairs behavioral conditioning to morphine. Our findings identify dopaminergic neuronal activity-regulated myelin plasticity as an important circuit modification that is required for opioid reward.

                Mapping molecular structure to odor perception is a key challenge in olfaction. Here, we use graph neural networks (GNN) to generate a Principal Odor Map (POM) that preserves perceptual relationships and enables odor quality prediction for novel odorants. The model is as reliable as a human in describing odor quality: on a prospective validation set of 400 novel odorants, the model-generated odor profile more closely matched the trained panel mean (n=15) than did the median panelist. Applying simple, interpretable, theoretically-rooted transformations, the POM outperformed chemoinformatic models on several other odor prediction tasks, indicating that the POM successfully encoded a generalized map of structure-odor relationships. This approach broadly enables odor prediction and paves the way toward digitizing odors.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Imaging through Windansee electrode arrays reveals a small fraction of local neurons following surface MUA</a></h4>

              
                Prior studies have shown that neuronal spikes can be recorded with microelectrode arrays placed on the cortical surface. However, the etiology of these spikes remains unclear. Because the top cortical layer (layer 1) contains very few neuronal cell bodies, it has been proposed that these spikes originate from neurons with cell bodies in layer 2. To address this question, we combined two-photon calcium imaging with electrophysiological recordings from the cortical surface in awake mice using chronically implanted PEDOT:PSS electrode arrays on transparent parylene C substrate. Our electrode arrays (termed Windansee) were integrated with cortical windows offering see-through optical access while also providing measurements of local field potentials (LFP) and multiunit activity (MUA) from the cortical surface. To enable longitudinal data acquisition, we have developed a mechanical solution for installation, connectorization, and protection of Windansee devices aiming for an unhindered access for high numerical aperture microscope objectives and a lifetime of several months while worn by a mouse. Contrary to the common notion, our measurements revealed that only a small fraction of layer 2 neurons from the sampled pool (~13%) faithfully followed MUA recorded from the surface above the imaging field-of-view. Surprised by this result, we turned to computational modeling for an alternative explanation of the MUA signal. Using realistic modeling of neurons with back-propagating dendritic properties, we computed the extracellular action potential at the cortical surface due to firing of local cortical neurons and compared the result to that due to axonal inputs to layer 1. Assuming the literature values for the cell/axon density and firing rates, our modeling results show that surface MUA due to axonal inputs is over an order of magnitude larger than that due to firing of layer 2 pyramidal neurons. Thus, a combination of surface MUA recordings with two-photon calcium imaging can provide complementary information about the input to a cortical column and the local circuit response. Cortical layer I plays an important role in integration of a broad range of cortico-cortical, thalamocortical and neuromodulatory inputs. Therefore, detecting their activity as MUA while combining electrode recording with two-photon imaging using optically transparent surface electrode arrays would facilitate studies of the input/output relationship in cortical circuits, inform computational circuit models, and improve the accuracy of the next generation brain-machine interfaces.

                Although the botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs) are among the most toxic compounds found in nature, their molecular mechanism of action is far from being elucidated. A key event is the conformational transition due to the acidification of the interior of synaptic vesicles, and leading to the translocation of the BoNT catalytic domain into the neuronal cytosol. To investigate these conformational variations, homology modelling and atomistic simulations are combined to explore the internal dynamics of the subtypes BoNT/A1, the most-used in medical applications, and BoNT/E1, the most kinetically efficient. This first simulation study of di-chain BoNTs in closed and open states includes the effects of neutral and acidic pH. The conformational mobility is driven by domains displacements; the ganglioside binding site in the receptor binding domain, the translocation domain (HCNT) switch and the belt  helix visit multiple conformations depending on the primary sequence and on the pH. Fluctuations of the belt  helix are observed for closed conformations of the toxins and at acidic pH, and patches of more accessible residues appear in the same conditions in the core translocation domain HCNT. These findings suggest that during translocation, the larger mobility of belt could be transmitted to HCNT, leading to a favorable interaction of HCNT residues with the non-polar membrane environment.

                Discriminating between temporal features in sensory stimuli is critical to complex behavior and decision making. However, how sensory cortical circuit mechanisms contribute to discrimination between subsecond temporal components in sensory events is unclear. To elucidate the mechanistic underpinnings of timing in primary visual cortex (V1), we recorded from V1 using 2-photon calcium imaging in awake-behaving mice performing a go/no-go discrimination timing task, which was composed of patterns of subsecond audio-visual stimuli. In both conditions, activity during the early stimulus period was temporally coordinated with the preferred stimulus. However, while network activity increased in the preferred condition, network activity was increasingly suppressed in the nonpreferred condition over the stimulus period. Our results demonstrate that discrimination between subsecond intervals that are contained in rhythmic patterns can be accomplished by local networks and suggest the contribution of neural resonance as a mechanism.

                Background: Mutations in the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene are the most frequent cause of familial Parkinson's disease (PD). The incomplete penetrance of LRRK2 mutations suggest that additional hits are required for disease onset. We hypothesized that chronic low-grade inflammation interacts with LRRK2 G2019S, the most frequent PD-associated mutation, to activate peripheral and central immune reactions and drive age-dependent neurodegeneration. Methods and Results: We exposed wild-type and LRRK2 G2019S mice to a low chronic dose of lipopolysaccharide, and we performed a longitudinal analysis of central and peripheral immune reactions and neurodegeneration. Low-dose inflammation triggered nigrostriatal degeneration, macrophage/monocyte brain infiltration, and astro-/microgliosis. LRRK2 G2019S mice showed an early dysregulation of peripheral cytokines, increased CD4+ T-cell infiltration and -synuclein aggregation in the colon. Interestingly, peripheral immune activation and colonic -synuclein aggregation precede astro-/microgliosis and neurodegeneration. Conclusions: Our study suggests an early role of the peripheral immune system and the gut in LRRK2 PD and provides a novel model to study early therapeutic immune targets and biomarkers.

                TRPA1 expressed in peripheral sensory neurons is important for nociception. Pharmacological inhibition or genetic ablation of TRPA1 profoundly reduces normal behavioural sensitivity to noxious cold and mechanical stimulation, as well as sensory neuron responses to mechanical stimulation. TRPA1 inhibition also reverses cold and mechanical hypersensitivities in chronic pain models in vivo. Here we demonstrate that these striking effects of TRPA1 inactivation result from an increased constitutive activity of kappa opioid receptors (KOR) co-expressed with TRPA1 in sensory neurons. Inhibition of KOR in Trpa1-/- mice restores nociception and neuronal activity to the levels observed in wild-type mice and reverses the analgesic effects of TRPA1 antagonism in naive mice and in neuropathic and inflammatory pain conditions. TRPA1 regulation of KOR activity in sensory neurons provides a novel mechanism to produce peripherally mediated analgesia. Our findings suggest that TRP channel regulation of constitutive GPCR activity, may be a process of general physiological importance.

                Membrane cholesterol binds to and modulates the function of the specific SLC6 transporters. Here we investigate how cholesterol binds to and modulates the rate of glycine transport by the SLC6 glycine transporter GlyT2, and how this impacts lipid inhibition of GlyT2. Bioactive lipid inhibitors of GlyT2 are analgesics that bind to the lipid allosteric site of the outward facing GlyT2 conformation that is accessible from the extracellular solution. Using molecular dynamics simulations, mutagenesis and cholesterol depletion experiments, we show that bioactive lipid inhibition of glycine transport is modulated by the recruitment of membrane cholesterol to a cholesterol binding site formed by transmembrane helices 1, 5 and 7. Recruitment involves cholesterol flipping from its membrane orientation, and insertion of the 3' hydroxyl group into the cholesterol binding cavity to interact with the base of the lipid allosteric site and the bound inhibitor. The recruitment of membrane cholesterol by allosteric GlyT2 inhibitors is a potential avenue for the development of high-potency, specific pain analgesics and could provide alternative therapeutics that target GlyT2 and other SLC6 neurotransmitter transporters.

                Neurotransmitter release at presynaptic active zones (AZs) requires concerted protein interactions within a dense 3D nano-hemisphere. Among the complex protein mesh- work the (M)unc-13 family member Unc-13 of Drosophila melanogaster is essential for docking of synaptic vesicles and transmitter release. We employ MiMIC-based gene editing using GFSTF (EGFP-FlAsH-StrepII-TEV- 3xFlag) to endogenously tag all annotated Drosophila Unc-13 isoforms enabling visualization of endogenous Unc-13 expression within the central and peripheral nervous system. Electrophysiological characterization using two-electrode voltage clamp (TEVC) reveals that evoked and spontaneous synaptic transmission remain unaffected in unc-13 GFSTF 3 rd instar larvae and acute presynaptic homeostatic potentiation (PHP) can be induced at control levels. Furthermore, multi-color structured-illumination shows precise co-localization of Unc-13 GFSTF , Bruchpilot and GluRIIA-receptor subunits within the synaptic mesoscale. Localization microscopy in combination with HDBSCAN algorithms detect Unc-13 GFSTF nanoclusters that move towards the AZ center during PHP with unaltered Unc-13 GFSTF protein levels.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Re-expression of CA1 and entorhinal activity patterns preserves temporal context memory at long timescales</a></h4>

              
                Converging, cross-species evidence indicates that memory for time is supported by hippocampal area CA1 and entorhinal cortex. However, limited evidence characterizes how these regions preserve temporal memories over long timescales (e.g., months). At long timescales, memoranda may be encountered in multiple temporal contexts, potentially creating interference. Here, using 7T fMRI, we measured CA1 and entorhinal activity patterns as human participants viewed thousands of natural scene images distributed, and repeated, across many months. We show that memory for an image's original temporal context was predicted by the degree to which CA1/entorhinal activity patterns from the first encounter with an image were re-expressed during re-encounters occurring minutes to months later. Critically, temporal memory signals were dissociable from predictors of recognition confidence, which were carried by distinct medial temporal lobe expressions. These findings suggest that CA1 and entorhinal cortex preserve temporal memories across long timescales by coding for and reinstating temporal context information.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy Spectral Registration Using Deep Learning</a></h4>

              
                A novel convolutional neural network based spectral registration (CNN-SR) approach is introduced to achieve efficient and accurate simultaneous frequency-and-phase correction (FPC) of single-voxel MEGA-PRESS magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) data. For this approach, one neural network was trained and validated using a published simulated and in vivo MEGA-PRESS MRS dataset with a wide-range of artificial frequency (0-20 Hz) and phase (0-90{degrees}) offsets applied. The proposed CNN-SR approach was subsequently tested and compared to the sequential FPC deep learning approaches and demonstrated more effective and accurate performance. Furthermore, a large random Gaussian signal-to-noise ratio (SNR 20 and SNR 2.5) and line broadening (0-20 ms) was introduced to the original simulated dataset to investigate our model performance compared to the other deep learning models. The testing showed that CNN-SR was a more accurate quantification tool and resulted in a lower SNR when compared with the other deep learning methods, due to having smaller mean absolute errors in both frequency and phase offset predictions. For Off spectra, the CNN-SR model was capable of correcting frequency offsets with 0.014 {+/-} 0.010 Hz and phase offsets with 0.104 {+/-} 0.076{degrees} absolute errors on average for unseen simulated data with SNR 20 and correcting frequency offsets with 0.678 {+/-} 0.883 Hz and phase offsets with 2.367 {+/-} 2.616{degrees} absolute errors on average at very low SNR (2.5) and line broadening (0-20 ms) introduced. In addition, we tested the simulated dataset with additional SNR and line broadening on a more refined model (CNN-SR+) where the pre-trained CNN-SR was further optimized by minimizing the difference between individual spectra and a common template with unsupervised learning. The performance on Off spectra was improved to 0.058 {+/-} 0.050 Hz for correcting frequency offsets and to 0.416 {+/-} 0.317{degrees} for correcting phase offsets. We further evaluated the ability of our model to process the published Big GABA in vivo dataset and CNN-SR+ achieved the best performance. Moreover, additional frequency and phase offsets (i.e., small, moderate, large) were applied to the in vivo dataset, and CNN-SR+ also demonstrated better performance for FPC when compared to the other deep learning models. These results indicate the utility of using deep learning for spectral registration and demonstrate the application of unsupervised learning in further improving the model to achieve state-of-the-art performance.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Associations between thinner retinal neuronal layers and suboptimal brain structural integrity: Are the eyes a window to the brain?</a></h4>

              
                We investigated the extent to which measures of retinal neuronal thickness capture variability in the structural integrity of the brain in a large population-based cohort followed from birth to midlife. Using data from the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study (n=1037; analytic n=828, aged 45 years), we specifically tested for associations between optical coherence tomography-measured retinal neuronal layers and MRI-measured structural brain integrity. We found that Study members who had thinner retinal neuronal layers had thinner average cortex, smaller total cortical surface area, smaller subcortical grey matter volumes, larger volume of white matter hyperintensities as well as older looking brains. This suggests that retinal neuronal thickness reflects differences in midlife structural brain integrity consistent with accelerated cognitive decline and increased risk for later dementia, further supporting the proposition that the retina may be a biomarker of brain aging as early as midlife.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">CRF Neurons Establish Resilience via Stress-History-Dependent BNST Modulation</a></h4>

              
                Cumulative stress is a major risk factor for developing major depressive disorder (MDD), yet not everyone experiencing chronic stress develops MDD. In those who do not, it is unclear at what point, or by what mechanism, a trajectory of stable resiliency emerges. Utilizing a 10-day repeated social defeat stress model (RSDS) for MDD, we observed that a critical period between 7 and 10 daily defeats marks the phenotypical divergence of resilient from susceptible mice. In response to ongoing stress, corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) neurons of the oval nucleus of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNSTov) display a sustained increased firing rate in resilient, but not susceptible mice. This neurophysiological adaptation was self-sustaining, but only after 7 critical stress exposures, indicating that the process of developing resilience is dependent on stress history. Our study reveals a novel process by which individuals might persist in the face of adversity by way of stress-provoked activation, not inhibition of a key CRF limbic region that establishes a pathway to resilience.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Lifespan differences in visual short-term memory load-modulated functional connectivity</a></h4>

              
                Working memory is critical to higher-order executive processes and declines throughout the adult lifespan. However, our understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying this decline is limited. Recent work suggests that functional connectivity between frontal control and posterior visual regions may be critical, but examinations of age differences therein have been limited to a small set of brain regions and extreme group designs (i.e., comparing young and older adults). In this study, we build on previous research by using a lifespan cohort and a whole-brain approach to investigate working memory load-modulated functional connectivity in relation to age and performance. The article reports on analysis of the Cambridge Centre for Ageing and Neuroscience (Cam-CAN) data. Participants from a population-based lifespan cohort (N=111, age 23-86) performed a visual short-term memory task during functional magnetic resonance imaging. Visual short-term memory was measured with a delayed recall task for visual motion with three different loads. Whole-brain load-modulated connectivity was estimated using psychophysiological interactions in a hundred regions of interest, sorted into seven networks (Schaefer et al., 2018, Yeo et al., 2011). Results showed that load-modulated functional connectivity was strongest within the dorsal attention network followed by the visual network during encoding and maintenance. With increasing age, load-modulated functional connectivity strength decreased throughout the cortex. Within the dorsal attention network, increased load-modulated connectivity strength was related to better task performance in an age-invariant way. Our results demonstrate the widespread negative impact of age on the modulation of functional connectivity by working memory load. Older adults might already be close to ceiling in terms of their resources at the lowest load and therefore less able to further increase connectivity with increasing task demands.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Toward a generalizable deep CNN for neural drive estimation across muscles and participants</a></h4>

              
                High-density electromyography (HD-EMG) decomposition algorithms are used to identify individual motor unit spike trains. Numerous studies have used this neural code of movements to predict motor intent. It has advanced from offline to online decomposition, from isometric to dynamic contractions, leading to a wide range of neural-machine interface applications. However, current online methods need offline retraining when applied to the same muscle on a different day or to a different person, which limits their applications in a real-time neural-machine interface. We proposed a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) framework for neural drive estimation, which captures general spatiotemporal properties of motor unit action potentials to generalize its application without retraining to HD-EMG data recorded in separate sessions, muscles, and participants. We recorded HD-EMG signals from the vastus medialis and vastus lateralis muscles while participants performed isometric contractions during two separate sessions. We identified motor unit spike trains (MUSTs) from HD-EMG signals using a blind source separation (BSS) method, and then used the cumulative spike train (CST) of these motor units and the HD-EMG signals to train and validate the deep CNN. On average, the correlation coefficients between CST from BSS and that from deep CNN were 0.977{+/-}0.007 for leave-one-out across-sessions-and-muscles validation and 0.985{+/-}0.005 for leave-one-out across-participants validation. When trained with more than four datasets, the performance of deep CNN saturated at 0.979{+/-}0.001 for cross-validations across muscles, sessions, and participants. Therefore, we can conclude that the deep CNN is generalizable across the aforementioned conditions without retraining. We could potentially generate a robust deep CNN to estimate neural drive to muscles for a neural-machine interface.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Excitation creates a distributed pattern of cortical suppression due to varied recurrent input</a></h4>

              
                To support perception, visual cortex transforms sensory-related input, creating neural activity patterns that represent features of the sensory world. These cortical input-output transformations can potentially be strongly influenced by local, recurrent connections between neurons, yet how recurrent connections affect transformations has been unclear. Here we study recurrent influences in mouse V1 by stimulating excitatory neurons and using simulations to determine which features of connectivity can explain the observations. We find that strong visual stimuli suppress many neurons, resulting in a salt-and-pepper pattern of neurons with suppressed and elevated firing. Stimulating excitatory cells optogenetically produces a similar salt-and-pepper pattern of suppression. Cells with suppressed firing are distributed across the cortex, though there is a surround region a few hundred microns from the stimulation center where suppressed neurons outnumber excited neurons. A balanced-state cortical model, with strong heterogeneous recurrent coupling and variability in neurons' inputs, replicates the observed firing rate distributions and dynamics, and also explains prior reports of suppression from single-cell stimulation. Together, the results show this cortical suppression arises via a recurrent network mechanism: excitatory input produces a diverse pattern of neural responses that is substantially different than the pattern of inputs.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Biologic that disrupts PDE11A4 homodimerization in hippocampus CA1 reverses age-related proteinopathies in PDE11A4 and cognitive decline of social memories</a></h4>

              
                Age-related proteinopathies in phosphodiesterase 11A (PDE11A), an enzyme that degrades 3,5-cAMP/cGMP and is enriched in the ventral hippocampal formation (VHIPP), drive age-related cognitive decline (ARCD) of social memories. In the VHIPP, age-related increases in PDE11A4 occur specifically within the membrane compartment and ectopically accumulate in filamentous structures termed ghost axons. Previous in vitro studies show that disrupting PDE11 homodimerization by expressing an isolated PDE11A-GAFB domain, which acts as a negative sink for monomers, selectively degrades membrane-associated PDE11A4 and prevents the punctate accumulation of PDE11A4. Therefore, we determined if disrupting PDE11A4 homodimerization in vivo via the expression of an isolated PDE11A4-GAFB domain would be sufficient to reverse 1) age-related accumulations of PDE11A4 in VHIPP ghost axons and 2) ARCD of social memories. Indeed, in vivo lentiviral expression of the isolated PDE11A4-GAFB domain in hippocampal CA1 reversed the age-related accumulation of PDE11A4 in ghost axons, reversed ACRD of social transmission of food preference memory (STFP), and improved remote long-term memory for social odor recognition (SOR) without affecting memory for non-social odor recognition. In vitro studies suggest that disrupting homodimerization of PDE11A4 does not directly alter the catalytic activity of the enzyme but may reverse age-related decreases in cGMP by dispersing the accumulation of the enzyme independently of other intramolecular mechanisms previously established to disperse PDE11A4 (e.g., phosphorylation of PDE11A4 at serine 162). Altogether, these data suggest that a biologic designed to disrupt PDE11A4 homodimerization may serve to ameliorate age-related deficits in hippocampal cyclic nucleotide signaling and subsequent ARCD of remote social memory.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Age and musical training effects on auditory short-term, long-term, and working memory</a></h4>

              
                Cognitive aging is characterized by a gradual decline in cognitive functioning. One of the most worrying deficits for older adults is a decreased capacity to memorize and remember new information. In this study, we assessed auditory short-term memory (STM), long-term memory (LTM), and working memory (WM) abilities of young and older adults using musical and numerical tasks. Additionally, we measured musical training and tested whether this capacity influences memory performance. Regarding STM, young adults scored higher than older adults when making same/different judgements of rhythmic sequences, but their performance was alike for melodic sequences. Higher levels of musical training were associated with enhanced STM capacity for melodic sequences. In relation to LTM, young adults outperformed older adults in identifying new musical sequences. Moreover, younger and older individuals with high musical training outperformed those with low musical training. No group differences were found in the recognition of previously memorized musical sequences. Finally, we found no group differences in WM capacity, although there was a non-significant tendency for young adults to outperform older adults. Overall, we found that aging differently affects several types of auditory memory and that, for certain musical memory tasks, a higher level of musical training provides significant advantages.

                Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neuroinflammatory disease of the central nervous system (CNS). Although classically considered a demyelinating disease, neuroaxonal injury occurs in both the acute and chronic phases and represents a pathologic substrate of disability not targeted by current therapies. Nitric oxide (NO) generated by CNS macrophages and microglia contributes to neuroaxonal injury in all phases of MS, but candidate therapies that prevent NO-mediated injury have not been identified. Here, we demonstrate that the multifunctional protein glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) is robustly nitrosylated in the CNS in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model of MS. GAPDH nitrosylation is blocked in vivo with daily administration of CGP3466b, a CNS-penetrant compound with an established safety profile in humans. Consistent with the known role of nitrosylated GAPDH (SNO-GAPDH) in neuronal cell death, blockade of SNO-GAPDH with CGP3466b attenuates neurologic disability and reduces axonal injury in EAE independent of effects on the immune system. Our findings suggest that SNO-GAPDH contributes to neuroaxonal injury during neuroinflammation and identify CGP3466b as a candidate neuroprotective therapy in MS.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Pten regulates endocytic trafficking of cell adhesion and signaling molecules to pattern the retina</a></h4>

              
                The retina is an exquisitely patterned tissue, with neuronal somata positioned at regular intervals to completely sample the visual field. Cholinergic amacrine cells are spectacular exemplars of precision, distributing in two radial layers and tangentially, forming regular mosaics. Here, we investigated how the intracellular phosphatase Pten and the cell adhesion molecule Dscam cooperate to regulate amacrine cell patterning. Using double mutants to test epistasis, we found that Pten and Dscam function in parallel pathways to regulate amacrine cell positioning. Mechanistically, Pten regulates endocytic remodeling of cell adhesion molecules (Dscam, Megf10, Fat3), which are aberrantly redistributed in Pten conditional-knock-out (cKO) amacrine cells. Furthermore, extracellular vesicles derived from multivesicular endosomes have altered proteomes in PtencKO retinas. Consequently, Wnt signaling is elevated in PtencKO retinal amacrine cells, the pharmacological disruption of which phenocopies PtencKO patterning defects. Pten thus controls endocytic trafficking of critical cell adhesion/signaling molecules to control amacrine cell spacing.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A model-free approach to link neural activity to behavioral tasks</a></h4>

              
                Brains are not engineered solutions to a well-defined problem but arose through selective pressure acting on random variation. It is therefore unclear how well a model chosen by an experimenter can relate neural activity to experimental conditions. Here we developed "Model-free identification of neural encoding (MINE)" using convolutional neural networks (CNN) to relate aspects of tasks to neural activity. Although flexible, CNNs are difficult to interpret. We use Taylor decomposition approaches and explainable machine learning techniques to understand the mapping from task features to activity. We apply MINE to a published cortical dataset as well as experiments designed to probe thermoregulatory circuits in zebrafish. MINE allowed us to characterize neurons according to their receptive field and computational complexity, features which anatomically segregated in the brain. We also identified a new class of neurons that integrate thermosensory and behavioral information which eluded us previously when using traditional clustering and regression-based approaches.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The Entorhinal-DG/CA3 Pathway in the Medial Temporal Lobe Retains Visual Working Memory of a Simple Surface Feature</a></h4>

              
                Classic models consider working memory (WM) and long-term memory as distinct mental faculties that are supported by different neural mechanisms. Yet, there are significant parallels in the computation that both types of memory require. For instance, the representation of precise item-specific memory requires the separation of overlapping neural representations of similar information. This computation has been referred to as pattern separation, which can be mediated by the entorhinal-DG/CA3 pathway of the medial temporal lobe (MTL) in service of long-term episodic memory. However, although recent evidence has suggested that the MTL is involved in WM, the extent to which the entorhinal-DG/CA3 pathway supports precise items-pecific WM has remained elusive. Here, we combine an established orientation WM task with high-resolution fMRI to test the hypothesis that the entorhinal-DG/CA3 pathway retains visual WM of a simple surface feature. Participants were retrospectively cued to retain one of the two studied orientation gratings during a brief delay period and then tried to reproduce the cued orientation as precisely as possible. By modeling the delay-period activity to reconstruct the retained WM content, we found that the anterior-lateral entorhinal cortex (aLEC) and the hippocampal DG/CA3 subfield both contain item-specific WM information that is associated with subsequent recall fidelity. Together, these results highlight the contribution of MTL circuitry to item-specific WM representation.

	<p>Previous voxel-based morphometry (VBM) studies investigating tinnitus have reported structural differences in a variety of spatially distinct gray matter regions. However, the results have been highly inconsistent and sometimes contradictory. In the current study, we conducted a combined image- and coordinate-based meta-analysis of VBM studies investigating tinnitus to identify robust gray matter differences associated with tinnitus, as well as examine the possible effects of hearing loss on the outcome of the meta-analysis. The PubMed and Web of Science databases were searched for studies published up to August 2021. Additional manual searches were conducted for studies published up to December 2021. A whole-brain meta-analysis was performed using Seed-Based d Mapping with Permutation of Subject Images (SDM-PSI). Fifteen studies comprising 423 individuals with tinnitus and either normal hearing or hearing loss (mean age 50.94 years; 173 females) and 508 individuals without tinnitus and either normal hearing or hearing loss (mean age 51.59 years; 234 females) met the inclusion criteria. We found a small but significant reduction in gray matter in the left inferior temporal gyrus for groups of normal hearing individuals with tinnitus compared to groups of hearing-matched individuals without tinnitus. In sharp contrast, in groups with hearing loss, tinnitus was associated with increased gray matter levels in the bilateral lingual gyrus and the bilateral precuneus. Those results were dependent upon matching the hearing levels between the groups with or without tinnitus. The current investigation suggests that hearing loss is the driving force of changes in cortical gray matter across individuals with and without tinnitus. Future studies should carefully account for confounders, including hearing loss, hyperacusis, anxiety, and depression, to identify gray matter changes specifically related to tinnitus. Ultimately, the aggregation of standardized individual datasets with both anatomical and useful phenotypical information will permit a better understanding of tinnitus-related gray matter differences, the effects of potential comorbidities, and their interactions with tinnitus.</p>

	<p>Some neural models achieve outstanding results in image recognition, semantic segmentation and natural language processing. However, their classification performance on structured and small-scale datasets that do not involve feature extraction is worse than that of traditional algorithms, although they require more time to train. In this paper, we propose a brain-like neural model with interactive stimulation (NMIS) that focuses on data classification. It consists of a primary neural field and a senior neural field that play different cognitive roles. The former is used to correspond to real instances in the feature space, and the latter stores the category pattern. Neurons in the primary field exchange information through interactive stimulation and their activation is transmitted to the senior field via inter-field interaction, simulating the mechanisms of neuronal interaction and synaptic plasticity, respectively. The proposed NMIS is biologically plausible and does not involve complex optimization processes. Therefore, it exhibits better learning ability on small-scale and structured datasets than traditional BP neural networks. For large-scale data classification, a nearest neighbor NMIS (NN_NMIS), an optimized version of NMIS, is proposed to improve computational efficiency. Numerical experiments performed on some UCI datasets show that the proposed NMIS and NN_NMIS are significantly superior to some classification algorithms that are widely used in machine learning.</p>

	<p>Genetic influences on acute responses to psychoactive drugs may contribute to individual variability in addiction risk. ABCB1 is a human gene that encodes P-glycoprotein, an ATP-dependent efflux pump that may influence the pharmacokinetics of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the primary psychoactive component of cannabis. Using data from 48 young adults (aged 19&amp;amp;ndash;25 years) reporting 1&amp;amp;ndash;4 days of cannabis use per week who completed a placebo-controlled human laboratory experiment, we tested the hypothesis that the rs2235048 polymorphism of ABCB1 would influence acute responses to smoked cannabis. C-allele carriers reported on average greater frequency of weekly cannabis use compared to the TT genotype carriers (TC/CC mean &amp;amp;plusmn; SEM = 2.74 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.14, TT = 1.85 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.24, p = 0.004). After smoking a single cannabis cigarette to their desired high, C-allele carriers had higher area-under-the-curve (AUC) of both THC metabolites (11-OH-THC TC/CC = 7.18 &amp;amp;plusmn; 9.64, TT = 3.28 &amp;amp;plusmn; 3.40, p = 0.05; THC-COOH TC/CC = 95.21 &amp;amp;plusmn; 116.12, TT = 45.92 &amp;amp;plusmn; 42.38, p = 0.043), and these results were impact by self-reported ethnicity. There were no significant differences in self-reported subjective drug effects except for a greater AUC of visual analogue scale rating of drug liking (TC/CC = 35,398.33 &amp;amp;plusmn; 37,233.72, TT = 15,895.56 &amp;amp;plusmn; 13,200.68, p = 0.017). Our preliminary findings suggest that further work in a larger sample should investigate whether human ABCB1 influences cannabis-related phenotypes and plays a role in the risk of developing a cannabis use disorder.</p>

	<p>Bone cancer pain (BCP) is one of the typical and distressing symptoms in cancer patients. Morphine is a widely used analgesic drug for BCP; however, long-term morphine administration will lead to analgesic tolerance. Our previous study indicated that spinal glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) exerts analgesic effects in rats with BCP. In this study, BCP was established by inoculated Walker 256 carcinoma cells into rat tibias, while morphine tolerance (MT) was induced by intrathecally injecting morphine twice daily from the 9th to 15th postoperative day (POD) in BCP rats. The BCP rats developed mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia on POD 5 and it lasted to POD 15. The analgesic effect of morphine was decreased after repeat administration. Western blots and immunochemistry tests showed that GDNF was gradually decreased in the spinal cord after the development of MT in rats with BCP, and GDNF was colocalized with the &amp;amp;mu; opioid receptor (MOR) in the superficial laminate of the spinal cords. The overexpression of GDNF by lentivirus significantly attenuated MT, and restored the expression of MOR in the spinal cord. In summary, our results suggest that the reduction of GDNF expression participated in the development of MT in rats with BCP and could be a promising therapeutic option for BCP.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A training curriculum for retrieving, structuring, and aggregating information derived from the biomedical literature and large-scale data repositories. [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Biomedical research over the past two decades has become data and information rich. This trend has been in large part driven by the development of systems-scale molecular profiling capabilities and by the increasingly large volume of publications contributed by the biomedical research community. It has therefore become important for early career researchers to learn to leverage this wealth of information in their own research. Methods: Here we describe in detail a training curriculum focusing on the development of foundational skills necessary to retrieve, structure, and aggregate information available from vast stores of publicly available information. It is provided along with supporting material and an illustrative use case. The stepwise workflow encompasses; 1) Selecting a candidate gene; 2) Retrieving background information about the gene; 3) Profiling its literature; 4) Identifying in the literature instances where its transcript abundance changes in blood of patients; 5) Retrieving transcriptional profiling data from public blood transcriptome and reference datasets; and 6) Drafting a manuscript, submitting it for peer-review, and publication. Results: This resource may be leveraged by instructors who wish to organize hands-on workshops. It can also be used by independent trainees as a self-study toolkit. The workflow presented as proof-of-concept was designed to establish a resource for assessing a candidate gene’s potential utility as a blood transcriptional biomarker. Trainees will learn to retrieve literature and public transcriptional profiling data associated with a specific gene of interest. They will also learn to extract, structure, and aggregate this information to support downstream interpretation efforts as well as the preparation of a manuscript. Conclusions: This resource should support early career researchers in their efforts to acquire skills that will permit them to leverage the vast amounts of publicly available large-scale profiling data.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Facilitating bias in cost-effectiveness analysis: CHEERS 2022 and the creation of assumption-driven imaginary value claims in health technology assessment [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                The current standards for health technology cost-effectiveness assessment rest on the creation of lifetime assumption-driven modeled simulations for imaginary pricing and consequent patient access recommendations. A recent BMJ paper reports a detailed assessment of 8,192 cost-effectiveness analyses, concluding that industry-sponsored modeled claims were more likely to publish incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) below a USD 50,000 threshold than non-industry sponsored studies, supporting the claim that the product was cost-effective. This is unsurprising; indeed, the opposite can occur with a modeled claim deliberately resulting in ICER is excess of USD 50,000. This methodology is well entrenched with the recently published Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) 2022 guidance for creating imaginary cost-effectiveness modeled claims ensuring the opportunity for deliberately manipulated cost-effectiveness claims. This overlooks limitations imposed by fundamental measurement, rendering assumption-driven simulations redundant analytical exercises. Manipulation of ICERs and claims for cost-effectiveness are mathematically impossible; including cost-utility thresholds, because the preference or utilities supporting creation of quality-of-life years (QALYs) are ordinal scores. Nevertheless, with the promotion of CHEERS 2022, the belief in imaginary modeled value claims is both facilitated and reinforced. With CHEERS 2022, there is a concerted effort, largely in self-interest, to perpetuate the current belief system. This is a self-defeating strategy. Rather than admitting to the deficiencies of assumption-driven simulated imaginary claims, leaders are maintaining that health system decision makers can ignore standards of normal science and fundamental measurement in value claims for pharmaceutical products. This disregard of standards that are commonplace in the sciences and mainstream social sciences perpetuates the opportunity for self-serving modeled claims; where models are a marketing vehicle leading to sponsored systematic bias in formulary submissions. This supports the need for a NEW START paradigm for health technology assessment, focusing on evaluable single-attribute value claims, meeting the required standards for normal science and fundamental measurement.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: A digital workflow in the treatment of bruxism in a young patient [version 2; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Bruxism is increasingly common in today's stressful world and affects mainly young patients. It is a combined disease that involves dentition and its supporting structures, muscles, ligaments and the temporomandibular joint (TMJ). Here we present a complete combined analog and digital clinical protocol in a patient with parafunction. A young patient sought help due to impaired aesthetics, as a result of abraded tooth surfaces and severe symptoms of TMJ. We implemented a therapeutic protocol of six stages: deprogramming of the muscles and determination of treatment position and digital optimization; realization of the morphological plan for the upper dentition; non-invasive repositioning of the lower jaw by splint therapy; splint placement and follow-up; morphological planning of the lower dentition and replacement of the splint with fixed prosthesis with follow-up; and completion of the case with ceramic restorations. The digitally modeled temporary constructions for the upper jaw were made of PMMA and placed in the patient's mouth together with the splint on the lower jaw, made of Ceramill Splintec. After an adaptation period, all restorations were replaced by permanent zirconia. We achieved restoration of the defects of the dental arches and hard dental tissues and recovery to normal height of the lower third of the face (vertical dimension occlusion), fixed a stable and balanced position of the lower jaw, and repaired the normal physiological position of the TMJ for the patient. Аfter a multi-stage treatment we received a result satisfying the patient, the dentist and the dental technician. Aesthetics and function were restored, and clinical symptoms were removed from the TMJ.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">An observational cross-sectional study on breast cancer patients’ knowledge of their disease: A likely cause of depression and anxiety [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: This study aimed to assess breast cancer awareness among patients undergoing active treatment for breast cancer at Day Hospital, assess their quality of life (QoL), and explore the association between minor knowledge of the disease and higher levels of anxiety. Methods: This prospective observational study included patients with breast cancer undergoing active treatment at the Instituto Português de Oncologia Coimbra. The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C30, QLQ-INFO25, and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) were completed, and demographic and clinical data were collected and processed using SPSSÒ. Results: In total, 188 patients with breast cancer were included. A vast majority had a positive perception of their QoL, with a higher average value compared to “cognitive functioning” (c=77.22±22.53), “social functioning” (76.86±25.41), and “physical functioning” (75.67±17.24). Regarding the information received, an overall “score” below the “cut-off line” (47.96±14.40) was observed. When evaluating “satisfaction” in isolation, the average value for “satisfaction with the information received” was 53.55±23.99, and patients perceived that the information received was beneficial to them (67.38±23.87) and did not wish to have received less information (99.47±7.29). With decreased functionality, higher levels of depression and anxiety were observed (p<0.0001). Regarding “information related to illness and anxiety/depression”, it was noted that as satisfaction with information decreased, patients tended to have higher levels of anxiety/depression (p<0.013). Conclusions: It is necessary to create dedicated spaces for information and clinical clarification, with regular assessments of patients’ perceptions. The information provided must be reinforced through written or digital support, or brochures.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Characterization of a novel variant in the HR1 domain of MFN2 in a patient with ataxia, optic atrophy and sensorineural hearing loss [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Pathogenic variants in MFN2 cause Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) type 2A (CMT2A) and are the leading cause of the axonal subtypes of CMT. CMT2A is characterized by predominantly distal motor weakness and muscle atrophy, with highly variable severity and onset age. Notably, some MFN2 variants can also lead to other phenotypes such as optic atrophy, hearing loss and lipodystrophy. Despite the clear link between MFN2 and CMT2A, our mechanistic understanding of how dysfunction of the MFN2 protein causes human disease pathologies remains incomplete. This lack of understanding is due in part to the multiple cellular roles of MFN2. Though initially characterized for its role in mediating mitochondrial fusion, MFN2 also plays important roles in mediating interactions between mitochondria and other organelles, such as the endoplasmic reticulum and lipid droplets. Additionally, MFN2 is also important for mitochondrial transport, mitochondrial autophagy, and has even been implicated in lipid transfer. Though over 100 pathogenic MFN2 variants have been described to date, only a few have been characterized functionally, and even then, often only for one or two functions. Method: Several MFN2-mediated functions were characterized in fibroblast cells from a patient presenting with cerebellar ataxia, deafness, blindness, and diffuse cerebral and cerebellar atrophy, who harbours a novel homozygous MFN2 variant, D414V, which is found in a region of the HR1 domain of MFN2 where few pathogenic variants occur. Results: We found evidence for impairment of several MFN2-mediated functions. Consistent with reduced mitochondrial fusion, patient fibroblasts exhibited more fragmented mitochondrial networks and had reduced mtDNA copy number. Additionally, patient fibroblasts had reduced oxygen consumption, fewer mitochondrial-ER contacts, and altered lipid droplets that displayed an unusual perinuclear distribution. Conclusion: Overall, this work characterizes D414V as a novel variant in MFN2 and expands the phenotypic presentation of MFN2 variants to include cerebellar ataxia.

                Background: The shipping industry is widely regarded as a slow adapting industry, for any innovation to be made there needs to be a real demand. One of these innovations is the electronic Bill of Lading. The need for an alternative to the expensive and slow traditional Bill of Lading has been rising since the beginning of the century. Now the digital revolution naturally introduced the electronic Bill of Lading, but its unclear legal status and different regulations in different countries make it hard to establish a worldwide solution. Nevertheless, there has been progress and the current focus on standardization along with the many advantages of blockchain technology may take it a step closer to a worldwide adoption. Methods: This paper aims to provide information about the most relevant providers of electronic bills of lading, with a clear focus on the underlying technology, in order to make a grounded analysis about each technological solution individually and in general. Results and Conclusions: The information presented was gathered by searching existing literature and public information from the technology providers, focusing on the technology and avoiding law matters.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Women’s access to health care for non-communicable diseases in South Africa: A scoping review. [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as obesity, hypertension (HPT), and type II diabetes (T2D) are of increasing concern in South Africa (SA), with women being more at risk. Authors conducted a scoping review to identify and map the evidence available about the barriers of access to obesity, HPT, and T2D care among women in SA. Methods: Arksey and O'Malley's framework for scoping review was used. The search of the literature was completed in the Scopus, Web of Science, and PubMed databases between April and May 2022. Only studies conducted among women in SA were eligible for inclusion. Identified barriers were mapped onto Levesque’s framework of access to health care to determine which points along the chain of accessing NCD health care among women are mostly impacted. Results: Seven articles were included in the review: qualitative (n=2), quantitative (n=2), mixed methods (n=2), and grey literature (n=1). The included studies reported barriers of access to HPT and T2D care only, and no study reported barriers to obesity care. Supply-side barriers included lack of knowledge about available services, physician heavy workloads, medicine stock-outs, limited availability of testing equipment, unaffordable transport costs, travelling longer distances, inefficiently longer waiting times, and delayed referral. Demand-side barriers included women having low self-awareness of NCD status, concerns about confidentiality, perceived discrimination, and poverty. Conclusions: Access to HPT and T2D services is impacted from perception of need to benefitting from care. Articles included identified barriers affecting the availability and accommodation dimension of access to care, suggesting that HPT and T2D care is often unavailable or that women are unable to reach health facilities or service providers. There is need for more and better-quality research about access to NCD health care in SA, especially among women having a disproportionately high burden of obesity, T2D, and HPT.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Differences in the length of postoperative care of endoscopic endonasal surgery in simple and complex surgical procedure groups [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The rapid development of endoscopic endonasal surgery has made the procedure widely used in nasal and sinus surgery. Endoscopic endonasal surgery is a minimally invasive procedure, but the possibility of postoperative damage to the sinonasal mucosa cannot be ruled out. The aim of this study was to analyze the difference in the length of postoperative care between complex and simple endoscopic endonasal surgeries which can be used as a reference in planning postoperative care.   Methods: This was a retrospective cross-sectional observational study. The participants were divided into two groups, i.e., simple, and complex surgical procedures groups. The simple procedure group consisted of middle meatal anstrostomy, uncinectomy, endoscopic septoplasty, and endoscopic turbinoplasty. The complex procedure group included frontal sinusotomy, sphenoidectomy, as well as anterior and posterior ethmoidectomy. The length of postoperative care between the two groups were measured and analyzed using the Chi-square test.   Results: The median length of care in the complex procedure group was significantly longer than that in the simple procedure group (p = 0.028), 12 weeks and 9 weeks, respectively. The number of postoperative outpatient visits was significantly less in the simple procedure group compared with the complex procedure group (Median 4 vs. 5; p=0.015). There was a significant correlation between length of care and the endonasal endoscopic surgical procedure group (p = 0.023).   Conclusions: The complex endoscopic endonasal surgery group required a longer length of care and more postoperative outpatient visit than the simple procedure group.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Optimal anti-amyloid-beta therapy for Alzheimer’s disease via a personalized mathematical model</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Wenrui Hao, Suzanne Lenhart, Jeffrey R. Petrella</p>

With the recent approval by the FDA of the first disease-modifying drug for Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), personalized medicine will be increasingly important for appropriate management and counseling of patients with AD and those at risk. The growing availability of clinical biomarker data and data-driven computational modeling techniques provide an opportunity for new approaches to individualized AD therapeutic planning. In this paper, we develop a new mathematical model, based on AD cognitive, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and MRI biomarkers, to provide a personalized optimal treatment plan for individuals. This model is parameterized by biomarker data from the AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort, a large multi-institutional database monitoring the natural history of subjects with AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Optimal control theory is used to incorporate time-varying treatment controls and side-effects into the model, based on recent clinical trial data, to provide a personalized treatment regimen with anti-amyloid-beta therapy. In-silico treatment studies were conducted on the approved treatment, aducanumab, as well as on another promising anti-amyloid-beta therapy under evaluation, donanemab. Clinical trial simulations were conducted over both short-term (78 weeks) and long-term (10 years) periods with low-dose (6 mg/kg) and high-dose (10 mg/kg) regimens for aducanumab, and a single-dose regimen (1400 mg) for donanemab. Results confirm those of actual clinical trials showing a large and sustained effect of both aducanumab and donanemab on amyloid beta clearance. The effect on slowing cognitive decline was modest for both treatments, but greater for donanemab. This optimal treatment computational modeling framework can be applied to other single and combination treatments for both prediction and optimization, as well as incorporate new clinical trial data as it becomes available.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Dynamical modeling of the H3K27 epigenetic landscape in mouse embryonic stem cells</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Kapil Newar, Amith Zafal Abdulla, Hossein Salari, Eric Fanchon, Daniel Jost</p>

The Polycomb system via the methylation of the lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K27) plays central roles in the silencing of many lineage-specific genes during development. Recent experimental evidence suggested that the recruitment of histone modifying enzymes like the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) at specific sites and their spreading capacities from these sites are key to the establishment and maintenance of a proper epigenomic landscape around Polycomb-target genes. Here, to test whether such mechanisms, as a minimal set of qualitative rules, are quantitatively compatible with data, we developed a mathematical model that can predict the locus-specific distributions of H3K27 modifications based on previous biochemical knowledge. Within the biological context of mouse embryonic stem cells, our model showed quantitative agreement with experimental profiles of H3K27 acetylation and methylation around Polycomb-target genes in wild-type and mutants. In particular, we demonstrated the key role of the reader-writer module of PRC2 and of the competition between the binding of activating and repressing enzymes in shaping the H3K27 landscape around transcriptional start sites. The predicted dynamics of establishment and maintenance of the repressive trimethylated H3K27 state suggest a slow accumulation, in perfect agreement with experiments. Our approach represents a first step towards a quantitative description of PcG regulation in various cellular contexts and provides a generic framework to better characterize epigenetic regulation in normal or disease situations.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">High-order functional redundancy in ageing explained via alterations in the connectome in a whole-brain model</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Marilyn Gatica, Fernando E. Rosas, Pedro A. M. Mediano, Ibai Diez, Stephan P. Swinnen, Patricio Orio, Rodrigo Cofré, Jesus M. Cortes</p>

The human brain generates a rich repertoire of spatio-temporal activity patterns, which support a wide variety of motor and cognitive functions. These patterns of activity change with age in a multi-factorial manner. One of these factors is the variations in the brain’s connectomics that occurs along the lifespan. However, the precise relationship between high-order functional interactions and connnectomics, as well as their variations with age are largely unknown, in part due to the absence of mechanistic models that can efficiently map brain connnectomics to functional connectivity in aging. To investigate this issue, we have built a neurobiologically-realistic whole-brain computational model using both anatomical and functional MRI data from 161 participants ranging from 10 to 80 years old. We show that the differences in high-order functional interactions between age groups can be largely explained by variations in the connectome. Based on this finding, we propose a simple neurodegeneration model that is representative of normal physiological aging. As such, when applied to connectomes of young participant it reproduces the age-variations that occur in the high-order structure of the functional data. Overall, these results begin to disentangle the mechanisms by which structural changes in the connectome lead to functional differences in the ageing brain. Our model can also serve as a starting point for modeling more complex forms of pathological ageing or cognitive deficits.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Characteristics and neural correlates of emotional behavior during prefrontal seizures</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To characterize clinical expression and intracerebral electroencephalographic (EEG) correlates of emotional expression during prefrontal epileptic seizures.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed a decriptive analysis of seizure semiology in patients explored with stereo-electroencephalography (SEEG) for pharmacoresistant prefrontal epilepsy, using a semi-quantitative score for seizure-related emotional behavior. Two independent observers scored occurrence and intensity of objective emotional features (face/body movements/vocalization/overall appearance), testing inter-observer reliability. Intracerebral electrophysiological changes were documented. Cluster analysis and principal component analysis (PCA) compared behavioral signs with neural SEEG correlates. For each patient, the clinical and anatomo-electrophysiological scores were established, based on a prototypical emotional seizure.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Forty-two patients (469 seizures) were included. Inter-observer correlation for emotional signs was satisfactory (Kappa 0.6-0.8). Prevalence of any subjective and/or objective ictal emotional phenomena was 79% (33/42); objective emotional signs occurred in 27/42 (64%). Negatively valenced emotional semiology (ictal feeling of fear, defence and/or aggressive behaviors) was much more prevalent than positively-valenced, prosocial behaviors. Cluster analysis and PCA identified 4 groups with different occurrence of emotional signs and cerebral correlates. Two main clusters of negatively valenced behavior were identified: “active threat response”, associated with seizure organizations involving posterior orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cingulate, dorsolateral and/or ventrolateral prefrontal cortex; and “passive fear”, associated with amygdala, other mesial temporal structures and posterior orbitofrontal cortex.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Emotional behaviors, especially fear/threat response, are common in prefrontal seizures, reflecting the role of the prefrontal cortex in emotion control. Different cortical seizure localizations were associated with “passive fear” and “active threat response” seizure behaviors at group level.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Ganaxolone versus phenobarbital for neonatal seizure management</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Seizures are more common in the neonatal period than at any other stage of life. Phenobarbital is the first-line treatment for neonatal seizures and is at best effective in about 50% of babies, but may contribute to neuronal injury. Here we assessed the efficacy of phenobarbital versus the synthetic neurosteroid, ganaxolone, to moderate seizure activity and neuropathology in neonatal lambs exposed to perinatal asphyxia.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Asphyxia was induced via umbilical cord occlusion in term lambs at birth. Lambs were treated with ganaxolone (5mg/kg/bolus then 5mg/kg/d for 2d) or phenobarbital (20mg/kg/bolus then 5mg/kg/d for 2d) at 6h. Abnormal brain activity was classified as stereotypic evolving (SE) seizures, epileptiform discharges (ED) and epileptiform transients (ET) using continuous amplitude-integrated electroencephalogram (aEEG) recordings. At 48h, lambs were euthanized for brain collection.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Asphyxia caused abnormal brain activity including SE seizures that peaked at 18-20h, EDs and ETs, and induced neuronal degeneration and neuroinflammation. Ganaxolone treatment was associated with an 86.4% reduction in the number of seizures compared to the asphyxia group. The total seizure duration in the asphyxia+ganax group was less than the untreated asphyxia group. There was no difference in the number of SE seizures between the asphyxia and asphyxia+pheno groups or duration of SE seizures. Ganaxolone treatment, but not phenobarbital, reduced neuronal degeneration within hippocampal CA1 and CA3 regions, and cortical neurons and, ganaxolone reduced neuroinflammation within the thalamus.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Ganaxolone provided better seizure control than phenobarbital in this perinatal asphyxia model and was neuroprotective for the newborn brain, affording a new therapeutic opportunity for treatment of neonatal seizures.</p>

                <b>Background:</b> Large-scale neuronal network breakdown underlies memory impairment in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the differential trajectories of the relationships between network organization and memory across pathology and cognitive stages in AD remain elusive. We determined whether and how the influences of individual-level structural and metabolic covariance network integrity on memory varied with amyloid pathology across clinical stages without assuming a constant relationship.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Viscoelastic properties of suspended cells measured with shear flow deformation cytometry</a></h4>

              
                Numerous cell functions are accompanied by phenotypic changes in viscoelastic properties, and measuring them can help elucidate higher-level cellular functions in health and disease. We present a high-throughput, simple and low-cost microfluidic method for quantitatively measuring the elastic (storage) and viscous (loss) modulus of individual cells. Cells are suspended in a high-viscosity fluid and are pumped with high pressure through a 5.8 cm long and 200 μm wide microfluidic channel. The fluid shear stress induces large, near ellipsoidal cell deformations. In addition, the flow profile in the channel causes the cells to rotate in a tank-treading manner. From the cell deformation and tank treading frequency, we extract the frequency-dependent viscoelastic cell properties based on a theoretical framework developed by R. Roscoe that describes the deformation of a viscoelastic sphere in a viscous fluid under steady laminar flow. We confirm the accuracy of the method using atomic force microscopy-calibrated polyacrylamide beads and cells. Our measurements demonstrate that suspended cells exhibit power-law, soft glassy rheological behavior that is cell cycle-dependent and mediated by the physical interplay between the actin filament and intermediate filament networks.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Data-driven, participatory characterization of farmer varieties discloses teff breeding potential under current and future climates</a></h4>

              
                In smallholder farming systems, traditional farmer varieties of neglected and underutilized species (NUS) support the livelihoods of millions of growers and consumers. NUS combine cultural and agronomic value with local adaptation, and transdisciplinary methods are needed to fully evaluate their breeding potential. Here, we assembled and characterized the genetic diversity of a representative collection of 366 Ethiopian teff (<i>Eragrostis tef</i>) farmer varieties and breeding materials, describing their phylogenetic relations and local adaptation on the Ethiopian landscape. We phenotyped the collection for its agronomic performance, involving local teff farmers in a participatory variety evaluation. Our analyses revealed environmental patterns of teff genetic diversity and allowed us to identify 10 genetic clusters associated with climate variation and with uneven spatial distribution. A genome-wide association study was used to identify loci and candidate genes related to phenology, yield, local adaptation, and farmers’ appreciation. The estimated teff genomic offset under climate change scenarios highlighted an area around lake Tana where teff cropping may be most vulnerable to climate change. Our results show that transdisciplinary approaches may efficiently propel untapped NUS farmer varieties into modern breeding to foster more resilient and sustainable cropping systems.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Keratinocyte PIEZO1 modulates cutaneous mechanosensation</a></h4>

              
                Epidermal keratinocytes mediate touch sensation by detecting and encoding tactile information to sensory neurons. However, the specific mechanotransducers that enable keratinocytes to respond to mechanical stimulation are unknown. Here, we found that the mechanically-gated ion channel PIEZO1 is a key keratinocyte mechanotransducer. Keratinocyte expression of PIEZO1 is critical for normal sensory afferent firing and behavioral responses to mechanical stimuli in mice.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Vaccination decreases the risk of influenza A virus reassortment but not genetic variation in pigs</a></h4>

              
                Although vaccination is broadly used in North American swine breeding herds, managing swine influenza is challenging primarily due to the continuous evolution of influenza A virus (IAV) and the ability of the virus to transmit among vaccinated pigs. Studies that have simultaneously assessed the impact of vaccination on the emergence of IAV reassortment and genetic variation in pigs are limited. Here, we directly sequenced 28 bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples collected from vaccinated and unvaccinated pigs co-infected with H1N1 and H3N2 IAV strains, and characterized 202 individual viral plaques recovered from 13 BALF samples. We identified 54 reassortant viruses that were grouped in 17 single and 16 mixed genotypes. Notably, we found that prime-boost vaccinated pigs had less reassortant viruses than nonvaccinated pigs, likely due to a reduction in the number of days pigs were co-infected with both challenge viruses. However, direct sequencing from BALF samples revealed limited impact of vaccination on viral variant frequency, evolutionary rates, and nucleotide diversity in any IAV coding regions. Overall, our results highlight the value of IAV vaccination not only at limiting virus replication in pigs but also at protecting public health by restricting the generation of novel reassortants with zoonotic and/or pandemic potential.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Hemocyte differentiation to the megacyte lineage enhances mosquito immunity against Plasmodium</a></h4>

              
                Activation of <i>Toll</i> signaling in <i>Anopheles gambiae</i> by silencing <i>Cactus</i>, a suppressor of this pathway, enhances local release of hemocyte-derived microvesicles (HdMv), promoting activation of the mosquito complement-like system, which eliminates <i>Plasmodium</i> ookinetes. We uncovered the mechanism of this immune enhancement. <i>Cactus</i> silencing triggers a <i>Rel1</i>-mediated differentiation of granulocytes to the megacyte lineage, a new subpopulation of giant cells, resulting in a dramatic increase in the proportion of circulating megacytes. Megacytes are very plastic cells that are massively recruited to the basal midgut surface in response to <i>Plasmodium</i> infection. We show that <i>Toll</i> signaling modulates hemocyte differentiation and that megacyte recruitment to the midgut greatly enhances mosquito immunity against <i>Plasmodium</i>.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Crosstalk between AML and stromal cells triggers acetate secretion through the metabolic rewiring of stromal cells</a></h4>

              
                Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) cells interact and modulate components of their surrounding microenvironment into their own benefit. Stromal cells have been shown to support AML survival and progression through various mechanisms. Nonetheless, whether AML cells could establish beneficial metabolic interactions with stromal cells is underexplored. By using a combination of human AML cell lines and AML patient samples together with mouse stromal cells and a MLL-AF9 mouse model, here we identify a novel metabolic crosstalk between AML and stromal cells where AML cells prompt stromal cells to secrete acetate for their own consumption to feed the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) and lipid biosynthesis. By performing transcriptome analysis and tracer-based metabolic NMR analysis, we observe that stromal cells present a higher rate of glycolysis when co-cultured with AML cells. We also find that acetate in stromal cells is derived from pyruvate via chemical conversion under the influence of reactive oxygen species (ROS) following ROS transfer from AML to stromal cells via gap junctions. Overall, we present a unique metabolic communication between AML and stromal cells and propose two different molecular targets, ACSS2 and gap junctions, that could potentially be exploited for adjuvant therapy.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Brain atlas for glycoprotein hormone receptors at single-transcript level</a></h4>

              
                There is increasing evidence that anterior pituitary hormones, traditionally thought to have unitary functions in regulating single endocrine targets, act on multiple somatic tissues, such as bone, fat, and liver. There is also emerging evidence for anterior pituitary hormone action on brain receptors in mediating central neural and peripheral somatic functions. Here, we have created the most comprehensive neuroanatomical atlas on the expression of TSHR, LHCGR and FSHR. We have used RNAscope, a technology that allows the detection of mRNA at single-transcript level, together with protein level validation, to document <i>Tshr</i> expression in 173 and <i>Fshr</i> expression in 353 brain regions, nuclei and sub-nuclei identified using the <i>Atlas for the Mouse Brain in Stereotaxic Coordinates</i>. We also identified <i>Lhcgr</i> transcripts in 401 brain regions, nuclei and sub-nuclei. Complementarily, we used ViewRNA, another single-transcript detection technology, to establish the expression of <i>FSHR</i> in human brain samples, where transcripts were co-localized in <i>MALAT1</i> positive neurons. In addition, we show high expression for all three receptors in the ventricular region-with yet unknown functions. Intriguingly, <i>Tshr</i> and <i>Fshr</i> expression in the ependymal layer of the third ventricle was similar to that of the thyroid follicular cells and testicular Sertoli cells, respectively. In contrast, <i>Fshr</i> was localized to NeuN-positive neurons in the granular layer of the dentate gyrus in murine and human brain-both are Alzheimer's disease vulnerable regions. Our atlas thus provides a vital resource for scientists to explore the link between the stimulation or inactivation of brain glycoprotein hormone receptors on somatic function. New actionable pathways for human disease may be unmasked through further studies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Ventral temporal and posteromedial sulcal morphology in autism spectrum disorder</a></h4>

              
                Two recent parallel research tracks link tertiary sulcal morphology sulci that emerge last in gestation and continue to develop after birth with functional features of the cerebral cortex and cognition, respectively. The first track identified a relationship between the mid fusiform sulcus (MFS) in ventral temporal cortex (VTC) and cognition in individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The second track identified a new tertiary sulcus, the inframarginal sulcus (IFRMS), that serves as a tripartite landmark within the posteromedial cortex (PMC). As VTC and PMC are structurally and functionally different in individuals with ASD compared to neurotypical controls (NTs), here, we integrated these two tracks with a twofold approach. First, we tested if there are morphological differences in VTC and PMC sulci between 50 NTs and 50 individuals with ASD. Second, we tested if tertiary sulcal morphology was linked to cognition in ASD individuals. Our twofold approach replicates and extends recent findings in five ways. First, in terms of replication, the standard deviation (STD) of MFS cortical thickness (CT) was increased in ASDs compared to NTs. Second, MFS length was shorter in ASDs compared to NTs. Third, the CT STD effect extended to other VTC and PMC sulci. Fourth, a subset of VTC and PMC morphological features were correlated between regions in ASD. Fifth, IFRMS depth was negatively associated with ADOS GS score. These results empirically support a relationship between later-developing, tertiary sulci and ASD, providing a novel framework to study the relationship between brain structure and cognition in additional neurodevelopmental disorders in future studies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Conceptual associations generate sensory predictions</a></h4>

              
                A crucial ability of the human brain is to learn and exploit probabilistic associations between stimuli to facilitate perception and behavior by predicting future events. While studies have shown how perceptual relationships are used to predict sensory inputs, relational knowledge is often between concepts rather than percepts (e.g., we learned to associate cats with dogs, rather than specific images of cats and dogs). Here we asked if and how sensory responses to visual input may be modulated by predictions derived from conceptual associations. To this end we exposed participants to arbitrary word pairs (e.g., car and dog) repeatedly, creating an expectation of the second word, conditional on the occurrence of the first. In a subsequent session, we exposed participants to novel word-picture pairs, while measuring fMRI BOLD responses. All word-picture pairs were equally likely, but half of the pairs conformed to the previously formed conceptual (word-word) associations, whereas the other half violated this association. Results showed suppressed sensory responses throughout the ventral visual stream, including early visual cortex, to pictures that corresponded to the previously expected words compared to unexpected words. This suggests that the learned conceptual associations were used to generate sensory predictions that modulated processing of the picture stimuli. Moreover, these modulations were tuning-specific, selectively suppressing neural populations tuned towards the expected input. Combined, our results suggest that recently acquired conceptual priors are generalized across domains and used by the sensory brain to generate feature specific predictions, facilitating processing of expected visual input.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The spatiotemporal dynamics of semantic integration in the human brain</a></h4>

              
                Language depends critically on the integration of lexical information to derive semantic concepts. The neurobiology of this fundamental aspect of human cognition remains mostly unknown. Limitations of spatiotemporal resolution have previously rendered it difficult to disentangle processes involved in semantic integration from independent computations such as tracking word meaning and establishing referents. We utilized intracranial recordings (n = 58) during the presentation of orthographic descriptions that were either referential or non-referential to a common object. Referential contexts enabled high frequency broadband gamma activation (70-150 Hz) of a distributed network including the inferior frontal sulcus (IFS), medial parietal cortex (MPC) and medial temporal lobe (MTL) in the left, language-dominant hemisphere. Components of this network (IFS, MPC), alongside posterior superior temporal sulcus, showed greater engagement for trials that did not progressively isolate a limited set of referents, relative to trials that did. IFS and posterior middle temporal gyrus activity was modulated by semantic coherence, regardless of whether the sentence picked out a common object. Centered around IFS and spreading out dorsally towards middle frontal gyrus and ventrally towards anterior/posterior inferior frontal gyrus, we uncovered a cortical mosaic of functional specialization for reference, coherence and semantic narrowing. Early processing windows implicated IFS in all aspects of semantics, and in later windows sub-portions of IFS exposed a clearer functional tessellation with some remaining overlap. This work unveils how lateral fronto-temporal regions make distinctly rich semantic contributions and are involved jointly in semantic integration and conflict resolution, depending on the sub-region and processing stage.

                A paradox of testosterone effects is seen in adolescents vs. adults in social emotional approach-avoidance behavior. During adolescence, high testosterone levels are associated with increased anterior prefrontal (aPFC) involvement in emotion control, whereas during adulthood this neuro-endocrine relation is reversed. Rodent work shows that, during puberty, testosterone transitions from a neuro-developmental to a social-sexual activating hormone. In this study, we explored whether this functional transition is also present in human adolescents and young adults. Using a prospective longitudinal design, we investigated the role of testosterone on neural control of social emotional behavior during the transitions from middle to late adolescence and into young adulthood. Seventy-one individuals (tested at ages 14, 17, and 20 years) performed an fMRI-adapted approach-avoidance (AA) task involving automatic and controlled actions in response to social emotional stimuli. In line with predictions from animal models, the effect of testosterone on aPFC engagement decreased between middle and late adolescence, and shifted into an activational role by young adulthood - impeding neural control of emotions. This change in testosterone function was accompanied by increased testosterone-modulated amygdala reactivity. These findings qualify the testosterone-dependent maturation of the prefrontal-amygdala circuit supporting emotion control during the transition from middle adolescence into young adulthood.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Hippocampal-cortical functional connectivity during memory encoding and retrieval</a></h4>

              
                Memory encoding and retrieval are critical sub-processes of episodic memory. While the hippocampus is involved in both, its connectivity with the neocortex during memory processing in humans has been elusive. This is partially due to variations in demands in common memory tasks, which inevitably recruit cognitive processes other than episodic memory. Conjunctive analysis of data from different tasks with the same core elements of encoding and retrieval can reduce the intrusion of patterns related to subsidiary perceptual and cognitive processing. Leveraging data from two large-scale functional resonance imaging studies with different episodic memory tasks (514 and 237 participants), we identified core hippocampal-cortical networks active during memory processing. Anterior and posterior hippocampus had distinct connectivity profiles, which were stable across resting state and memory tasks. Whereas no encoding-specific connectome emerged across tasks, during retrieval hippocampal connectivity was increased with areas known to be active during recollection, including medial prefrontal, inferior parietal, and parahippocampal cortices. This indicates that the stable functional connectivity of the hippocampus along its longitudinal axis is superposed by increased functional connectivity with the recollection network during retrieval, while encoding connectivity likely reflects contextual factors.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A recurrent neural network model of prefrontal brain activity during a working memory task</a></h4>

              
                When multiple items are held in short-term memory, cues that retrospectively prioritise one item over another (retro-cues) can facilitate subsequent recall. However, the neural and computational underpinnings of this effect are poorly understood. One recent study recorded neural signals in the macaque lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) during a retro-cueing task, contrasting delay-period activity before (pre-cue) and after (post-cue) retrocue onset. They reported that in the pre-cue delay, the individual stimuli were maintained in independent subspaces of neural population activity, whereas in the post-cue delay, the prioritised items were rotated into a common subspace, potentially allowing a common readout mechanism. To understand how such representational transitions can be learnt through error minimisation, we trained recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with supervision to perform an equivalent cued-recall task. RNNs were presented with two inputs denoting conjunctive colour-location stimuli, followed by a pre-cue memory delay, a location retrocue, and a post-cue delay. We found that the orthogonal-to-parallel geometry transformation observed in the macaque LPFC emerged naturally in RNNs trained to perform the task. Interestingly, the parallel geometry only developed when the cued information was required to be maintained in short-term memory for several cycles before readout, suggesting that it might confer robustness during maintenance. We extend these findings by analysing the learning dynamics and connectivity patterns of the RNNs, as well as the behaviour of models trained with probabilistic cues, allowing us to make predictions for future studies. Overall, our findings are consistent with recent theoretical accounts which propose that retrocues transform the prioritised memory items into a prospective, action-oriented format.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Growth hormone receptor (GHR) in AgRP neurons regulatesthermogenesis in aged mice in a sex-specific manner</a></h4>

              
                Evidence for hypothalamic regulation of energy homeostasis and thermoregulation in brown adipose tissue (BAT) during aging has been well recognized, yet the central molecular mediators involved in this process are poorly understood. The arcuate hypothalamus (ARC), orexigenic agouti-related peptide (AgRP) neurons control nutrient intake, energy homeostasis, and BAT thermogenesis. To determine the roles of growth hormone receptor (GHR) signaling in the AgRP neurons we used mice with the AgRP-specific GHR deletion (AgRP{Delta}GHR). We found that female AgRP{Delta}GHR mice were resistant to temperature adaptation, and their body core temperature remained significantly lower when held at 10{degrees}C, 22{degrees}C, or 30{degrees}C, compared to control mice. Low body core temperature in female AgRP{Delta}GHR mice has been associated with significant reductions in Ucp1 and Pgc1 expression in the BAT. Further, neuronal activity in AgRP in response to cold exposure was blunted in AgRP{Delta}GHR females, while the number of Fos+ AgRP neurons was increased in control females exposed to cold. Global transcriptome from BAT identified increased expression of genes related to immune responses and chemokine activity and decreased expression of genes involved in triglycerides synthesis and metabolic pathways in AgRP{Delta}GHR females. Importantly, these were the same genes that are downregulated by thermoneutrality in control mice but not in the AgRP{triangleup}GHR animals. Collectively, these data demonstrate a novel circuit of thermal regulation between the hypothalamic AgRP-GHR and BAT and provide insight into the brain systems that are critical for the thermogenic vitality of the elderly.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neuronal C-Reactive Protein Mediates Neuropathic Pain by Activating Nociceptive FcγRI-Coupled Signaling</a></h4>

              
                Background: Neuropathic pain is difficult to treat in clinical practice, and the underlying mechanisms are insufficiently elucidated. Previous studies have demonstrated that Fc{gamma} receptor I (Fc{gamma}RI) is expressed in the neurons of the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) and may be involved in chronic pain. Methods: Chronic constriction injury (CCI) was used to induce neuropathic pain in rats. Primary neuron-specific Fcgr1 conditional knockout (CKO) rats were established by crossing rats carrying a Fcgr1loxP+/+ with the PirtCRE+ line. Behavioral and molecular studies were conducted to evaluate the differences between wild-type and CKO rats after CCI. Results: We first revealed that CCI activated neuronal Fc{gamma}RI-related signaling in the DRG. CCI-induced neuropathic pain was alleviated in CKO rats. C-reactive protein (CRP) was increased in the DRG after nerve injury. Intraganglionic injection or overexpression of the recombinant CRP protein in the DRG evoked pain accompanied and activated neuronal Fc{gamma}RI. CRP-evoked pain was significantly reduced in CKO rats. Furthermore, microinjection of native IgG into the DRG alleviated neuropathic pain and the activation of neuronal Fc{gamma}RI-related signaling. Conclusions: Our results indicate that the activation of neuronal CRP/Fc{gamma}RI-related signaling plays an important role in the development of pain in CCI. Our findings may provide novel insights into the neuroimmune responses after peripheral nerve injury and might suggest potential therapeutic targets for neuropathic pain.

                Background: Cholesterol is essential for growth and maintenance of mammalian cells. It is stored as cholesteryl esters by the enzymes acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferases 1 & 2 (ACAT 1 & 2 ) (Sterol O-acyltransferase 1 & 2 ; SOATs in GenBank). ACAT1 blockade (A1B) in macrophages ameliorates various pro-inflammatory responses elicited by lipopolysaccharides (LPS) or by cholesterol loading. In mouse and human brains, Acat1 expression dominates over Acat2 and Acat1 is elevated in many neurodegenerative diseases and in acute neuroinflammation. However, the possible effects of ACAT1 blockade in neuroinflammation, regulated by mediators such as Toll-Like Receptor 4 (TLR4), has not been studied. Methods: We conducted LPS-induced acute neuroinflammation experiments in control vs myeloid specific or neuron specific Acat1 knockout (KO) mice. Furthermore, we evaluated LPS-induced neuroinflammation in the microglial cell line N9 with or without pre-treatment of the small molecule ACAT1-specific inhibitor K-604. Biochemical and microscopy assays were used to monitor inflammatory responses and the fate of TLR4. Results: In vivo studies revealed that Acat1 inactivation in myeloid cell lineage, but not in neurons, markedly attenuated LPS-induced activation of various pro-inflammatory response genes in hippocampus and cortex. Studies in cell culture showed that pre-incubating cells with K-604 significantly ameliorated the pro-inflammatory responses induced by LPS. In cells acutely treated with LPS (for 30 min), pre-incubation with K-604 significantly increased the endocytosis of TLR4, the major transmembrane signaling receptor that mediates LPS-dependent acute neuroinflammation. In cells chronically treated with LPS (for 24-48 hrs), pre-incubation with K-604 significantly decreased the total TLR4 protein content, presumably due to enhanced trafficking of TLR4 to the lysosomes for degradation. For ex vivo evidence, we isolated microglia from adult mice, and found that in mice without LPS stimulation, myeloid Acat1 inactivation altered cellular distribution of TLR4; in mice with LPS stimulation, myeloid Acat1 inactivation decreased the cellular content of TLR4. Conclusion: Blocking ACAT1 in mouse microglia alters the fate of TLR4 and suppresses its ability to participate in pro-inflammatory signaling cascade in response to LPS.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Astrocytic TDP-43 dysregulation impairs memory by modulating antiviral pathways and interferon-inducible chemokines</a></h4>

              
                TDP-43 pathology is prevalent in dementia but the cell type-specific effects of TDP-43 are not clear and therapeutic strategies to alleviate TDP-43-linked cognitive decline are lacking. We found that patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) or frontotemporal dementia (FTD) have aberrant TDP-43 accumulation in hippocampal astrocytes. In mouse models, induction of widespread or hippocampus-targeted accumulation in astrocytic TDP-43 caused progressive memory loss and localized changes in antiviral gene expression. These changes were cell-autonomous and correlated with impaired astrocytic defense against infectious viruses. Among the changes, astrocytes had elevated levels of interferon-inducible chemokines and neurons had elevated levels of the corresponding chemokine receptor CXCR3 in presynaptic terminals. CXCR3 stimulation altered presynaptic function and promoted neuronal hyperexcitability, akin to the effects of astrocytic TDP-43, and blockade of CXCR3 reduced this activity. Ablation of CXCR3 also prevented TDP-43-linked memory loss. Thus, astrocytic TDP-43 dysfunction contributes to cognitive impairment through aberrant chemokine-mediated astrocytic-neuronal interactions.

                The importance of dyslipidemia in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients is increasingly recognised as a potential key mechanism driving disease onset, progression and survival. Evidence in familial ALS models suggests that lipid composition is significantly affected, however clinically relevant models have yet to be investigated. Using a powerful lipidomic approach, we uncover significant dysregulation of glycosphingolipid (GSL) metabolism in both the spinal cord and skeletal muscles of transgenic TDP-43Q331K mice. Treatment with the selective glucocerebrosidase 2 (GBA2) inhibitor ambroxol at symptom onset significantly improved motor and gait functions in TDP-43Q331K mice. Ambroxol treatment preserved motor neurons and neuromuscular junctions which was associated with modulation of GSL metabolism. Our study establishes significant lipid dysregulation in a clinically relevant model of ALS. Importantly, we show positive therapeutic outcomes in a mouse model of TDP-43 proteinopathy, suggesting that ambroxol may be a promising candidate to treat underlying dyslipidemia and symptoms of ALS.

	<p>Objective: To assess the effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on the gait and postural control ability of patients with executive dysfunction (ED) after stroke. Methods: A total of 18 patients with ED after stroke were randomly assigned into two groups, including an experimental group and a sham group. Patients in both groups received routine rehabilitation therapy, and patients in the experimental group underwent rTMS on the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) for 2 weeks (5 HZ, 80%MT, 1200 pulses). In the sham group, patients experienced sham stimulation treatment, in which the coil was placed vertically with the head. Before and after treatment, patients in both groups were subjected to Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) scoring, Fugl&amp;amp;ndash;Meyer assessment of lower extremity (L-FMA), Stroop color-word test (SCWT), gait analysis, foot plantar pressure test, 10-m walking test (10MWT), Berg balance scale (BBS), and timed up and go test (TUGT). In the SCWT, it was attempted to record the time of each card (SCWT-T), the correct number (SCWT-C), Stroop interference effect-time (SIE-T), and SIE correct count (SIE-C). The TUGT was categorized into four stages: getting up (GT), walking straight (WT), turning around (TT), and sitting down (ST), in which the total time of TUGT was calculated. Results: After two weeks of treatment, the evaluation indexes were improved in the two groups, some of which were statistically significant. In the experimental group, SCWT-T, SIE-T, SIE-C, GT, WT, TT, ST, and TUGT were significantly improved after treatment (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). SCWT-C, L-FMA score, 10MWT, GT, WT, stride length, step width, foot plantar pressure, pressure center curve, and activities of daily living were not statistically different from those before treatment (p &amp;amp;gt; 0.05). After treatment, SCWT-T, SIE-C, SIE-T, BBS score, TT, and ST in the experimental group were significantly shorter than those before treatment, with statistical differences (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). Compared with the sham group, SCWT-C, L-FMA score, 10MWT, GT, WT, TUGT, stride length, step width, foot plantar pressure, pressure center curve, and motor skills were not significantly improved (p &amp;amp;gt; 0.05). Conclusion: It was revealed that post-stroke rTMS treatment of patients with ED could improve executive function, improve postural control function, and reduce the risk of falling. In addition, rTMS of DLPFC could be a therapeutic target for improving postural control ability and reducing the risk of falling.</p>

	<p>This study aimed to investigate the association between serum iron (SI) and postoperative delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH). We retrospectively analyzed 985 consecutive adult patients diagnosed with aSAH. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were recorded. Univariate and multivariate analyses were employed to assess the association between SI and DCI. Propensity-score matching (PSM) analysis was implemented to reduce confounding. Postoperative DCI developed in 14.38% of patients. Lower SI upon admission was detected in aSAH patients with severe clinical conditions and severe aSAH. SI was negatively correlated with WFNS grade (r = &amp;amp;minus;0.3744, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) and modified Fisher (mFisher) grade (r = &amp;amp;minus;0.2520, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Multivariable analysis revealed lower SI was independently associated with DCI [odds ratios (OR) 0.281, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.177&amp;amp;ndash;0.448, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001], while WFNS grade and mFisher grade were not. The receiver-operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis of SI for DCI gave an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.7 and an optimal cut-off of 7.5 &amp;amp;mu;mol/L (95% CI 0.665 to 0.733, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001). PSM demonstrated the DCI group had a significantly lower SI than the non-DCI group (10.91 &amp;amp;plusmn; 6.86 vs. 20.34 &amp;amp;plusmn; 8.01 &amp;amp;mu;mol/L, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Lower SI remained a significant independent predictor for DCI and an independent poor prognostic factor of aSAH in multivariate analysis (OR 0.363, 95% CI 0.209&amp;amp;ndash;0.630, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). The predictive performance of SI for poor outcome had a corresponding AUC of 0.718 after PSM. Lower SI upon admission is significantly associated with WFNS grade, mFisher grade, and predicts postoperative DCI and poor outcome at 90 days following aSAH.</p>

	<p>Prior experience represents a prerequisite for memory consolidation across various memory systems. In the context of olfaction, sleep was found to enhance the consolidation of odors in adults but not in typically developing children (TDC), likely due to differences in pre-experience. Interestingly, unmedicated children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), a neurodevelopmental condition related to dopamine dysfunction, showed lower perceptive thresholds for odors, potentially allowing for more odor experience compared to TDC. We investigated sleep-associated odor memory consolidation in ADHD. Twenty-eight children with ADHD and thirty age-matched TDC participated in an incidental odor recognition task. For the sleep groups (ADHD: n = 14, TDC: n = 15), the encoding of 10 target odorants took place in the evening, and the retention of odorants was tested with 10 target odorants and 10 distractor odorants the next morning. In the wake groups (ADHD: n = 14, TDC: n = 15), the time schedule was reversed. Odor memory consolidation was superior in the ADHD sleep group compared to the TDC sleep and the ADHD wake groups. Intensity and familiarity ratings during encoding were substantially higher in ADHD compared to TDC. Sleep-associated odor memory consolidation in ADHD is superior to TDC. Abundant pre-experience due to lower perceptive thresholds is suggested as a possible explanation. Olfaction might serve as a biomarker in ADHD.</p>

	<p>Collateral status has prognostic and treatment implications in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients. Unlike CTA, grading collaterals on MRA is not well studied. We aimed to evaluate the accuracy of assessing collaterals on pretreatment MRA in AIS patients against DSA. AIS patients with anterior circulation proximal arterial occlusion with baseline MRA and subsequent endovascular treatment were included. MRA collaterals were evaluated by two neuroradiologists independently using the Tan and Maas scoring systems. DSA collaterals were evaluated by using the American Society of Interventional and Therapeutic Neuroradiology grading system and were used as the reference for comparative analysis against MRA. A total of 104 patients met the inclusion criteria (59 female, age (mean &amp;amp;plusmn; SD): 70.8 &amp;amp;plusmn; 18.1). The inter-rater agreement (k) for collateral scoring was 0.49, 95% CI 0.37&amp;amp;ndash;0.61 for the Tan score and 0.44, 95% CI 0.26&amp;amp;ndash;0.62 for the Maas score. Total number (%) of sufficient vs. insufficient collaterals based on DSA was 49 (47%) and 55 (53%) respectively. Using the Tan score, 45% of patients with sufficient collaterals and 64% with insufficient collaterals were correctly identified in comparison to DSA, resulting in a poor agreement (0.09, 95% CI 0.1&amp;amp;ndash;0.28). Using the Maas score, only 4% of patients with sufficient collaterals and 93% with insufficient collaterals were correctly identified against DSA, resulting in poor agreement (0.03, 95% CI 0.06&amp;amp;ndash;0.13). Pretreatment MRA in AIS patients has limited concordance with DSA when grading collaterals using the Tan and Maas scoring systems.</p>

	<p>Background: Sketching while narrating is an effective interview technique for eliciting information and cues to deceit. The current research examined the effects of introducing a Model Sketch in investigative interviews andis pre-registered on https://osf.io/kz9mc (accessed on 18 January 2022). Methods: Participants (N = 163) completed a mock mission and were asked to tell the truth or to lie about it in an interview. In Phase 1 of the interview, participants provided either a free recall (control condition), sketched and narrated with exposure to a Model Sketch (Model Sketch-present condition), or sketched and narrated without exposure to a Model Sketch (Model Sketch-absent condition). In Phase 2, all participants provided a free recall without sketching. Results: Truth tellers reported significantly more information than lie tellers. The Model Sketch elicited more location details than a Free recall in Phase 1 and more veracity differences than the other Modality conditions in Phase 2. Conclusion: The Model Sketch seems to enhance the elicitation of information and to have carryover veracity effects in a follow-up free recall.</p>

	<p>Background: Autistic traits are commonly viewed as dimensional in nature, and as continuously distributed in the general population. In this respect, the identification of predictive values of markers such as subtle autism-related alterations in brain morphology for parameter values of autistic traits could increase our understanding of this dimensional occasion. However, currently, very little is known about how these traits correspond to alterations in brain morphology in typically developing individuals, particularly during a time period where changes due to brain development processes do not provide a bias. Therefore, in the present study, we analyzed brain volume, cortical thickness (CT) and surface area (SA) in a cohort of 14&amp;amp;ndash;15-year-old adolescents (N = 285, female: N = 162) and tested their predictive value for autistic traits, assessed with the social responsiveness scale (SRS) two years later at the age of 16&amp;amp;ndash;17 years, using a regression-based approach. We found that autistic traits were significantly predicted by volumetric changes in the amygdala (r = 0.181), cerebellum (r = 0.128) and hippocampus (r = &amp;amp;minus;0.181, r = &amp;amp;minus;0.203), both in boys and girls. Moreover, the CT of the superior frontal region was negatively correlated (r = &amp;amp;minus;0.144) with SRS scores. Furthermore, we observed a significant association between the SRS total score and smaller left putamen volume, specifically in boys (r = &amp;amp;minus;0.217), but not in girls. Our findings suggest that neural correlates of autistic traits also seem to lie on a continuum in the general population, are determined by limbic&amp;amp;ndash;striatal neuroanatomical brain areas, and are partly dependent on sex. As we imaged adolescents from a large population-based cohort within a small age range, these data may help to increase the understanding of autistic-like occasions in otherwise typically developing individuals.</p>

	<p>Purpose: Although the association between residential location and survival in patients with different cancer types has been established, the conclusions are contentious, and the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we reviewed the impact of residence on the survival of patients with glioblastoma (GBM). Methods: We conducted a retrospective study to compare the impact of rural and urban residence on the survival rates of patients with GBM diagnosed in Riyadh City and outside Riyadh. All patients in this study were treated in a tertiary care hospital, and their survival rates were analyzed in relation to their residence and other related factors, namely radiotherapy timing. Results: Overall, 125 patients were included: 61 from Riyadh City and 64 from outside. The majority of patients in both groups were aged &amp;amp;gt;50 years (p = 0.814). There was no statistically significant difference between the groups in the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (p = 0.430), seizure (p = 0.858), or initiation timing of radiotherapy (p = 0.781). Furthermore, the median survival rate in the Riyadh group versus the other group was 14.4 months and 12.2 months, respectively, with no statistical significance (p = 0.187). Conclusions: Our study showed that residential location had no significant effect on GBM prognosis. However, further studies with a larger sample size are required to delineate the other factors of referral within the healthcare system to facilitate the management of these patients within a specific timeframe.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Estimation of heterogeneous instantaneous reproduction numbers with application to characterize SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Massachusetts counties</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Zhenwei Zhou, Eric D. Kolaczyk, Robin N. Thompson, Laura F. White</p>

The reproductive number is an important metric that has been widely used to quantify the infectiousness of communicable diseases. The time-varying instantaneous reproductive number is useful for monitoring the real-time dynamics of a disease to inform policy making for disease control. Local estimation of this metric, for instance at a county or city level, allows for more targeted interventions to curb transmission. However, simultaneous estimation of local reproductive numbers must account for potential sources of heterogeneity in these time-varying quantities—a key element of which is human mobility. We develop a statistical method that incorporates human mobility between multiple regions for estimating region-specific instantaneous reproductive numbers. The model also can account for exogenous cases imported from outside of the regions of interest. We propose two approaches to estimate the reproductive numbers, with mobility data used to adjust incidence in the first approach and to inform a formal priori distribution in the second (Bayesian) approach. Through a simulation study, we show that region-specific reproductive numbers can be well estimated if human mobility is reasonably well approximated by available data. We use this approach to estimate the instantaneous reproductive numbers of COVID-19 for 14 counties in Massachusetts using CDC case report data and the human mobility data collected by SafeGraph. We found that, accounting for mobility, our method produces estimates of reproductive numbers that are distinct across counties. In contrast, independent estimation of county-level reproductive numbers tends to produce similar values, as trends in county case-counts for the state are fairly concordant. These approaches can also be used to estimate any heterogeneity in transmission, for instance, age-dependent instantaneous reproductive number estimates. As people are more mobile and interact frequently in ways that permit transmission, it is important to account for this in the estimation of the reproductive number.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Brain-to-brain communication during musical improvisation: a performance case study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Understanding and predicting others' actions in ecological settings is an important research goal in social neuroscience. Here, we deployed a mobile brain-body imaging (MoBI) methodology to analyze inter-brain communication between professional musicians during a live jazz performance. Specifically, bispectral analysis was conducted to assess the synchronization of scalp electroencephalographic (EEG) signals from three expert musicians during a three-part 45 minute jazz performance, during which a new musician joined every five minutes. The bispectrum was estimated for all musician dyads, electrode combinations, and five frequency bands. The results showed higher bispectrum in the beta and gamma frequency bands (13-50 Hz) when more musicians performed together, and when they played a musical phrase synchronously. Positive bispectrum amplitude changes were found approximately three seconds prior to the identified synchronized performance events suggesting preparatory cortical activity predictive of concerted behavioral action. Moreover, a higher amount of synchronized EEG activity, across electrode regions, was observed as more musicians performed, with inter-brain synchronization between the temporal, parietal, and occipital regions the most frequent. Increased synchrony between the musicians' brain activity reflects shared multi-sensory processing and movement intention in a musical improvisation task.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Midazolam prevents the adverse outcome of neonatal asphyxia</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Birth asphyxia (BA) is the most frequent cause of neonatal death as well as CNS injury. BA is often associated with neonatal seizures, which only poorly respond to anti-seizure medications and may contribute to the adverse neurodevelopmental outcome. Using a non-invasive rat model of BA, we have recently reported that the potent benzodiazepine, midazolam, prevents neonatal seizures in ~50% of rat pups. In addition to its anti-seizure effect, midazolam exerts anti-inflammatory actions, which is highly relevant for therapeutic intervention following BA. The two major aims of the present study were to examine (1) whether midazolam reduces the adverse outcome of BA, and (2) whether this effect is different in rats that did or did not exhibit neonatal seizures after drug treatment.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Behavioral and cognitive tests were performed over 14 months after asphyxia, followed by immunohistochemical analyses.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>All vehicle-treated rats had seizures after asphyxia and developed behavioral and cognitive abnormalities, neuroinflammation in gray and white matter, neurodegeneration in the hippocampus and thalamus, and hippocampal mossy fiber sprouting in subsequent months. Administration of midazolam (1 mg/kg i.p.) directly after asphyxia prevented post-asphyctic seizures in ~50% of the rats and resulted in the prevention or decrease of neuroinflammation and the behavioral, cognitive, and neurodegenerative consequences of asphyxia. Except for neurodegeneration in the thalamus, seizures did not seem to contribute to the adverse outcome of asphyxia.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The disease-modifying effect of midazolam identified here strongly suggests that this drug provides a valuable option for improving the treatment and outcome of BA.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Association of cortical superficial siderosis with post‐stroke epilepsy</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To assess whether post-stroke epilepsy (PSE) is associated with neuroimaging findings of hemosiderin in a case-control study and whether the addition of hemosiderin markers improves the risk stratification models of PSE.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed a post-hoc analysis of PROgnosis of POST-Stroke Epilepsy (PROPOSE) study enrolling PSE patients at our hospital from November 2014 to September 2019. PSE was diagnosed when one unprovoked seizure was experienced more than 7 days after the index stroke, as proposed by the International League Against Epilepsy. As controls, consecutive acute stroke patients with no history or absence of any late seizure or continuing antiseizure medications at least 3 months after stroke were retrospectively enrolled during the same study period. We examined cortical microbleeds and cortical superficial siderosis (cSS) using gradient-echo T2*-weighted images. A logistic regression model with ridge penalties was tuned using 10-fold cross-validation. We added the item of cSS to the existing models (SeLECT and CAVE) for predicting PSE and evaluated performance of new models.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The study included 180 patients with PSE (67 women; median age, 74 years) and 1183 controls (440 women; median age, 74 years). The cSS frequency was higher in PSE than control groups (48.9% vs 5.7%, p&lt;0.0001). Compared with the existing models, the new models with cSS (SeLECT-S and CAVE-S) demonstrated significantly better predictive performance of PSE [net reclassification improvement, 0.63 (<i>p</i>=0.004) for SeLECT-S and 0.88 (<i>p</i>=0.001) for CAVE-S at the testing data].</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>cSS was associated with PSE, stratifying stroke survivors at high risk of PSE.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Transverse myelitis following SARS‐CoV‐2 vaccination: a pharmacoepidemiological study in the World Health Organization's database</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Background</h2>
<p>Transverse Myelitis (TM) has recently been associated by health authorities with Ad26.COV2.S (Janssen/Johnson & Johnson), one of the five U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or European Medicines Agency (EMA) labelled SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. It is unknown whether a similar association exists for the other FDA or EMA labelled SARS-CoV-2 vaccines (BNT162b2 [Pfizer/BioNTech], mRNA-1273 [Moderna], ChAdOx1nCov-19 [Oxford–AstraZeneca], and NVX-CoV2373 [Novavax]). This study aimed to evaluate the association between SARS-CoV-2 vaccine class and TM.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This observational, cross-sectional, pharmacovigilance cohort study examined individual case safety reports from VigiBase®, the World Health Organization’s pharmacovigilance database. We first conducted a disproportionality analysis with the Information Component (IC) using the reports of TM that occurred within 28 days following exposure to FDA or EMA labelled SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, from December 1, 2020 (first adverse event related to a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine) to March 27, 2022. Secondly, we analyzed the clinical features of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine-associated TM cases reported in VigiBase®.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>TM was significantly associated both with the messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA)-based (n=364; IC<sub>025</sub>=0.62) and vector-based (n=136; IC<sub>025</sub>=0.52) SARS-CoV-2 vaccines that are authorized by the FDA or the EMA.</p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>Findings from this observational, cross-sectional pharmacovigilance study showed that mRNA-based and vector-based FDA/EMA labelled SARS-CoV-2 vaccines may be associated with TM. However, because TM remains a rare event, with a previously reported rate of 0.28 cases per one million vaccine doses, the risk-benefit ratio in favor of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 virus remains unchallenged. Rather, this study suggests that clinicians should consider the diagnosis of TM in patients presenting with early signs of spinal cord dysfunction after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Uncovering natural variation in root system architecture and growth dynamics using a robotics-assisted phenomics platform</a></h4>

              
                The plant kingdom contains a stunning array of complex morphologies easily observed above-ground, but more challenging to visualize below-ground. Understanding the magnitude of diversity in root distribution within the soil, termed root system architecture (RSA), is fundamental to determining how this trait contributes to species adaptation in local environments. Roots are the interface between the soil environment and the shoot system and therefore play a key role in anchorage, resource uptake, and stress resilience. Previously, we presented the GLO-Roots (Growth and Luminescence Observatory for Roots) system to study the RSA of soil-grown <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> plants from germination to maturity (Rellán-Álvarez et al. 2015). In this study, we present the automation of GLO-Roots using robotics and the development of image analysis pipelines in order to examine the temporal dynamic regulation of RSA and the broader natural variation of RSA in Arabidopsis, over time. These datasets describe the developmental dynamics of two independent panels of accessions and reveal highly complex and polygenic RSA traits that show significant correlation with climate variables of the accessions' respective origins.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Ait1 regulates TORC1 signaling and localization in budding yeast</a></h4>

              
                The target of rapamycin complex I (TORC1) regulates cell growth and metabolism in eukaryotes. Previous studies have shown that nitrogen and amino acid signals activate TORC1 via the highly conserved small GTPases, Gtr1/2 (RagA/C in humans), and the GTPase activating complex SEAC/GATOR. However, it remains unclear if, and how, other proteins/pathways regulate TORC1 in simple eukaryotes like yeast. Here we report that the previously unstudied GPCR-like protein, Ait1, binds to TORC1-Gtr1/2 in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> and holds TORC1 around the vacuole during log-phase growth. Then, during amino acid starvation, Ait1 inhibits TORC1 via Gtr1/2 using a loop that resembles the RagA/C binding domain in the human protein SLC38A9. Importantly, Ait1 is only found in the <i>Saccharomycetaceae/codaceae</i>, two closely related families of yeast that have lost the ancient TORC1 regulators Rheb and TSC1/2. Thus, the TORC1 circuit found in the <i>Saccharomycetaceae/codaceae</i>, and likely other simple eukaryotes, has undergone significant rewiring during evolution.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of the ribonucleotide reductase family reveals an ancestral clade</a></h4>

              
                Ribonucleotide reductases (RNRs) are used by all free-living organisms and many viruses to catalyze an essential step in the <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis of DNA precursors. RNRs are remarkably diverse by primary sequence and cofactor requirement, while sharing a conserved fold and radical-based mechanism for nucleotide reduction. Here, we structurally aligned the diverse RNR family by the conserved catalytic barrel to reconstruct the first large-scale phylogeny consisting of 6,779 sequences that unites all extant classes of the RNR family and performed evo-velocity analysis to independently validate our evolutionary model. With a robust phylogeny in-hand, we uncovered a novel, phylogenetically distinct clade that is placed as ancestral to the classes I and II RNRs, which we have termed clade Ø. We employed small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), cryogenic-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), and AlphaFold2 to investigate a member of this clade from <i>Synechococcus</i> phage S-CBP4 and report the most minimal RNR architecture to-date. Based on our analyses, we propose an evolutionary model of diversification in the RNR family and delineate how our phylogeny can be used as a roadmap for targeted future study.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Most cancers carry a substantial deleterious load due to Hill-Robertson interference</a></h4>

              
                Cancer genomes exhibit surprisingly weak signatures of negative selection<sup>1,2</sup>. This may be because selective pressures are relaxed or because genome-wide linkage prevents deleterious mutations from being removed (Hill-Robertson interference)<sup>3</sup>. By stratifying tumors by their genome-wide mutational burden, we observe negative selection (dN/dS ~ 0.56) in low mutational burden tumors, while remaining cancers exhibit dN/dS ratios ~1. This suggests that most tumors do not remove deleterious passengers. To buffer against deleterious passengers, tumors upregulate heat shock pathways as their mutational burden increases. Finally, evolutionary modeling finds that Hill-Robertson interference alone can reproduce patterns of attenuated selection and estimates the total fitness cost of passengers to be 46% per cell on average. Collectively, our findings suggest that the lack of observed negative selection in most tumors is not due to relaxed selective pressures, but rather the inability of selection to remove deleterious mutations in the presence of genome-wide linkage.
