              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23922">Non-stationary dynamics of interspike intervals in neuronal populations</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2512.23922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the joint dynamics of membrane potential and time since the last spike in a population of integrate-and-fire neurons using a population density framework. This leads to a two-dimensional Fokker-Planck equation that captures the evolution of the full neuronal state, along with a one-dimensional hierarchy of equations for the moments of the inter-spike interval (ISI). The formalism allows us to characterize the time-dependent ISI distribution, even when the population is far from stationarity, such as under time-varying external input or during network oscillations. By performing a perturbative expansion around the stationary state, we also derive an analytic expression for the linear response of the ISI distribution to weak input modulations.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24439">Complexity and dynamics of partially symmetric random neural networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2512.24439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural circuits exhibit structured connectivity, including an overrepresentation of reciprocal connections between neuron pairs. Despite important advances, a full understanding of how such partial symmetry in connectivity shapes neural dynamics remains elusive. Here we ask how correlations between reciprocal connections in a random, recurrent neural network affect phase-space complexity, defined as the exponential proliferation rate (with network size) of the number of fixed points that accompanies the transition to chaotic dynamics. We find a striking pattern: partial anti-symmetry strongly amplifies complexity, while partial symmetry suppresses it. These opposing trends closely track changes in other measures of dynamical behavior, such as dimensionality, Lyapunov exponents, and transient path length, supporting the view that fixed-point structure is a key determinant of network dynamics. Thus, positive reciprocal correlations favor low-dimensional, slowly varying activity, whereas negative correlations promote high-dimensional, rapidly fluctuating chaotic activity. These results yield testable predictions about the link between connection reciprocity, neural dynamics and function.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24654">Muscle Synergy Patterns During Running: Coordinative Mechanisms From a Neuromechanical Perspective</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2512.24654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Running is a fundamental form of human locomotion and a key task for evaluating neuromuscular control and lower-limb coordination. In recent years, muscle synergy analysis based on surface electromyography (sEMG) has become an important approach in this area. This review focuses on muscle synergies during running, outlining core neural control theories and biomechanical optimization hypotheses, summarizing commonly used decomposition methods (e.g., PCA, ICA, FA, NMF) and emerging autoencoder-based approaches. We synthesize findings on the development and evolution of running-related synergies across the lifespan, examine how running surface, speed, foot-strike pattern, fatigue, and performance level modulate synergy patterns, and describe characteristic alterations in populations with knee osteoarthritis, patellofemoral pain, and stroke. Current evidence suggests that the number and basic structure of lower-limb synergies during running are relatively stable, whereas spatial muscle weightings and motor primitives are highly plastic and sensitive to task demands, fatigue, and pathology. However, substantial methodological variability remains in EMG channel selection, preprocessing pipelines, and decomposition algorithms, and direct neurophysiological validation and translational application are still limited. Future work should prioritize standardized processing protocols, integration of multi-source neuromusculoskeletal data, nonlinear modeling, and longitudinal intervention studies to better exploit muscle synergy analysis in sports biomechanics, athletic training, and rehabilitation medicine.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24969">Large language models and the entropy of English</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2512.24969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use large language models (LLMs) to uncover long-ranged structure in English texts from a variety of sources. The conditional entropy or code length in many cases continues to decrease with context length at least to $N\sim 10^4$ characters, implying that there are direct dependencies or interactions across these distances. A corollary is that there are small but significant correlations between characters at these separations, as we show from the data independent of models. The distribution of code lengths reveals an emergent certainty about an increasing fraction of characters at large $N$. Over the course of model training, we observe different dynamics at long and short context lengths, suggesting that long-ranged structure is learned only gradually. Our results constrain efforts to build statistical physics models of LLMs or language itself.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12895">From self-organizing systems to subjective temporal extension</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2404.12895v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The self-simulational theory of temporal extension describes an information-theoretically formalized mechanism by which the width of subjective temporality emerges from the architecture of self-modelling. In this paper, the perspective of the free energy principle will be assumed to cast the emergence of subjective temporal extension from first principles of the physics of self-organization and to formalize subjective temporal extension using information geometry. Using active inference, a deep parametric generative model of temporal inference is simulated, which realizes the described dynamics on a computational level. Two variations of time-perception naturally emerge from the simulated computational model. This concerns the intentional binding effect (i.e., the compression of the temporal interval between voluntarily initiated actions and subsequent sensory consequences) and empirically documented alterations of subjective time experience in deep states of meditative absorption (i.e., in minimal phenomenal experience). Generally, numerous systematic and domain-specific alterations of subjective temporal experience are computationally explained in a unified manner, as enabled by integration with current active inference accounts mapping onto the respective domains. This concerns, next to attentional and central tendency effects, the temporality-modulating role of valence, impulsivity, boredom, flow-states, near death-experiences, and various psychopathologies, amongst others. The self-simulational theory of temporal extension, from the perspective of the free energy principle, explains how the width of the subjective temporal moment emerges and varies from first principles, accounting for why sometimes, subjective time seems to fly, and sometimes, moments feel like eternities; with the computational mechanism being readily deployable synthetically.

                arXiv:2508.08435v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in artificial neural networks for machine learning, and language modeling in particular, have established a family of recurrent neural network (RNN) architectures that, unlike conventional RNNs with vector-form hidden states, use two-dimensional (2D) matrix-form hidden states. Such 2D-state RNNs, known as Fast Weight Programmers (FWPs), can be interpreted as a neural network whose synaptic weights (called fast weights) dynamically change over time as a function of input observations, and serve as short-term memory storage; corresponding synaptic weight modifications are controlled or programmed by another network (the programmer) whose parameters are trained (e.g., by gradient descent). In this Primer, we review the technical foundations of FWPs, their computational characteristics, and their connections to transformers and state space models. We also discuss connections between FWPs and models of synaptic plasticity in the brain, suggesting a convergence of natural and artificial intelligence.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05041">Dynamical Learning in Deep Asymmetric Recurrent Neural Networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2509.05041v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate recurrent neural networks with asymmetric interactions and demonstrate that the inclusion of self-couplings or sparse excitatory inter-module connections leads to the emergence of a densely connected manifold of dynamically accessible stable configurations. This representation manifold is exponentially large in system size and is reachable through simple local dynamics, despite constituting a subdominant subset of the global configuration space. We further show that learning can be implemented directly on this structure via a fully local, gradient-free mechanism that selectively stabilizes a single task-relevant network configuration. Unlike error-driven or contrastive learning schemes, this approach does not require explicit comparisons between network states obtained with and without output supervision. Instead, transient supervisory signals bias the dynamics toward the representation manifold, after which local plasticity consolidates the attained configuration, effectively shaping the latent representation space. Numerical evaluations on standard image classification benchmarks indicate performance comparable to that of multilayer perceptrons trained using backpropagation. More generally, these results suggest that the dynamical accessibility of fixed points and the stabilization of internal network dynamics constitute viable alternative principles for learning in recurrent systems, with conceptual links to statistical physics and potential implications for biologically motivated and neuromorphic computing architectures.

                arXiv:2512.23728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian inference provides a principled framework for understanding brain function, while neural activity in the brain is inherently spike-based. This paper bridges these two perspectives by designing spiking neural networks that simulate Bayesian inference through message passing for Bernoulli messages. To train the networks, we employ spike-timing-dependent plasticity, a biologically plausible mechanism for synaptic plasticity which is based on the Hebbian rule. Our results demonstrate that the network's performance closely matches the true numerical solution. We further demonstrate the versatility of our approach by implementing a factor graph example from coding theory, illustrating signal transmission over an unreliable channel.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24977">SymSeqBench: a unified framework for the generation and analysis of rule-based symbolic sequences and datasets</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2512.24977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sequential structure is a key feature of multiple domains of natural cognition and behavior, such as language, movement and decision-making. Likewise, it is also a central property of tasks to which we would like to apply artificial intelligence. It is therefore of great importance to develop frameworks that allow us to evaluate sequence learning and processing in a domain agnostic fashion, whilst simultaneously providing a link to formal theories of computation and computability. To address this need, we introduce two complementary software tools: SymSeq, designed to rigorously generate and analyze structured symbolic sequences, and SeqBench, a comprehensive benchmark suite of rule-based sequence processing tasks to evaluate the performance of artificial learning systems in cognitively relevant domains. In combination, SymSeqBench offers versatility in investigating sequential structure across diverse knowledge domains, including experimental psycholinguistics, cognitive psychology, behavioral analysis, neuromorphic computing and artificial intelligence. Due to its basis in Formal Language Theory (FLT), SymSeqBench provides researchers in multiple domains with a convenient and practical way to apply the concepts of FLT to conceptualize and standardize their experiments, thus advancing our understanding of cognition and behavior through shared computational frameworks and formalisms. The tool is modular, openly available and accessible to the research community.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23926">Identification of fixations and saccades in eye-tracking data using adaptive threshold-based method</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2512.23926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Properties of ocular fixations and saccades are highly stochastic during many experimental tasks, and their statistics are often used as proxies for various aspects of cognition. Although distinguishing saccades from fixations is not trivial, experimentalists generally use common ad-hoc thresholds in detection algorithms. This neglects inter-task and inter-individual variability in oculomotor dynamics, and potentially biases the resulting statistics. In this article, we introduce and evaluate an adaptive method based on a Markovian approximation of eye-gaze dynamics, using saccades and fixations as states such that the optimal threshold minimizes state transitions. Applying this to three common threshold-based algorithms (velocity, angular velocity, and dispersion), we evaluate the overall accuracy against a multi-threshold benchmark as well as robustness to noise. We find that a velocity threshold achieves the highest baseline accuracy (90-93\%) across both free-viewing and visual search tasks. However, velocity-based methods degrade rapidly under noise when thresholds remain fixed, with accuracy falling below 20% at high noise levels. Adaptive threshold optimization via K-ratio minimization substantially improves performance under noisy conditions for all algorithms. Adaptive dispersion thresholds demonstrate superior noise robustness, maintaining accuracy above 81% even at extreme noise levels ({\sigma} = 50 px), though a precision-recall trade-off emerges that favors fixation detection at the expense of saccade identification. In addition to demonstrating our parsimonious adaptive thresholding method, these findings provide practical guidance for selecting and tuning classification algorithms based on data quality and analytical priorities.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23945">Decoupling Constraint from Two Direction in Evolutionary Constrained Multi-objective Optimization</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2512.23945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-world Constrained Multi-objective Optimization Problems (CMOPs) often contain multiple constraints, and understanding and utilizing the coupling between these constraints is crucial for solving CMOPs. However, existing Constrained Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithms (CMOEAs) typically ignore these couplings and treat all constraints as a single aggregate, which lacks interpretability regarding the specific geometric roles of constraints. To address this limitation, we first analyze how different constraints interact and show that the final Constrained Pareto Front (CPF) depends not only on the Pareto fronts of individual constraints but also on the boundaries of infeasible regions. This insight implies that CMOPs with different coupling types must be solved from different search directions. Accordingly, we propose a novel algorithm named Decoupling Constraint from Two Directions (DCF2D). This method periodically detects constraint couplings and spawns an auxiliary population for each relevant constraint with an appropriate search direction. Extensive experiments on seven challenging CMOP benchmark suites and on a collection of real-world CMOPs demonstrate that DCF2D outperforms five state-of-the-art CMOEAs, including existing decoupling-based methods.

Abstract: Simulation optimization (SO) is frequently challenged by noisy evaluations, high computational costs, and complex, multimodal search landscapes. This paper introduces Tabu-Enhanced Simulation Optimization (TESO), a novel metaheuristic framework integrating adaptive search with memory-based strategies. TESO leverages a short-term Tabu List to prevent cycling and encourage diversification, and a long-term Elite Memory to guide intensification by perturbing high-performing solutions. An aspiration criterion allows overriding tabu restrictions for exceptional candidates. This combination facilitates a dynamic balance between exploration and exploitation in stochastic environments. We demonstrate TESO's effectiveness and reliability using an queue optimization problem, showing improved performance compared to benchmarks and validating the contribution of its memory components.

                arXiv:2512.24559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a genetic programming approach to automatically discover convergence acceleration methods for discrete ordinates solutions of neutron transport problems in slab geometry. Classical acceleration methods such as Aitken's delta-squared and Wynn epsilon assume specific convergence patterns and do not generalize well to the broad set of transport problems encountered in practice. We evolved mathematical formulas specifically tailored to SN convergence characteristics in this work. The discovered accelerator, featuring second differences and cross-product terms, achieved over 75 percent success rate in improving convergence compared to raw sequences - almost double that observed for classical techniques for the problem set considered. This work demonstrates the potential for discovering novel numerical methods in computational physics via genetic programming and attempts to honor Prof. Ganapol's legacy of advancing experimental mathematics applied to neutron transport.

Abstract: The hippocampus appears to implement two core but highly distinct functions in the brain: long term memory retrieval and planning and spatial navigation. Naively, these functions appear very different algorithmically. In this short note, we demonstrate that two powerful algorithms that have each independently been proposed to underlie the hippocampal operation for each function -- personalized page-rank for memory retrieval, and successor representations for planning and navigation, are in fact isomorphic and utilize the same underlying representation -- the stationary distribution of a random walk on a graph. We hypothesize that the core computational function of the hippocampus is to compute this representation on arbitrary input graphs.

                arXiv:2512.24506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recurrent networks are typically trained with backpropagation through time (BPTT). However, BPTT requires storing the history of all states in the network and then replaying them sequentially backwards in time. This computation appears extremely implausible for the brain to implement. Real Time Recurrent Learning (RTRL) proposes an mathematically equivalent alternative where gradient information is propagated forwards in time locally alongside the regular forward pass, however it has significantly greater computational complexity than BPTT which renders it impractical for large networks. E-prop proposes an approximation of RTRL which reduces its complexity to the level of BPTT while maintaining a purely online forward update which can be implemented by an eligibility trace at each synapse. However, works on RTRL and E-prop ubiquitously investigate learning in a single layer with recurrent dynamics. However, learning in the brain spans multiple layers and consists of both hierarchal dynamics in depth as well as time. In this mathematical note, we extend the E-prop framework to handle arbitrarily deep networks, deriving a novel recursion relationship across depth which extends the eligibility traces of E-prop to deeper layers. Our results thus demonstrate an online learning algorithm can perform accurate credit assignment across both time and depth simultaneously, allowing the training of deep recurrent networks without backpropagation through time.

                arXiv:2512.24792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks that cause misclassification when specific perturbations are added to input images. This vulnerability also threatens the reliability of DNN-based monocular depth estimation (MDE) models, making robustness enhancement a critical need in practical applications. To validate the vulnerability of DNN-based MDE models, this study proposes a projection-based adversarial attack method that projects perturbation light onto a target object. The proposed method employs physics-in-the-loop (PITL) optimization -- evaluating candidate solutions in actual environments to account for device specifications and disturbances -- and utilizes a distributed covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy. Experiments confirmed that the proposed method successfully created adversarial examples that lead to depth misestimations, resulting in parts of objects disappearing from the target scene.

Abstract: Neural architecture search (NAS), which automates the architectural design process of deep neural networks (DNN), has attracted increasing attention. Multimodal DNNs that necessitate feature fusion from multiple modalities benefit from NAS due to their structural complexity; however, constructing an architecture for multimodal DNNs through NAS requires a substantial amount of labeled training data. Thus, this paper proposes a self-supervised learning (SSL) method for architecture search of multimodal DNNs. The proposed method applies SSL comprehensively for both the architecture search and model pretraining processes. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method successfully designed architectures for DNNs from unlabeled training data.

                arXiv:2512.25034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discriminative approaches to classification often learn shortcuts that hold in-distribution but fail even under minor distribution shift. This failure mode stems from an overreliance on features that are spuriously correlated with the label. We show that generative classifiers, which use class-conditional generative models, can avoid this issue by modeling all features, both core and spurious, instead of mainly spurious ones. These generative classifiers are simple to train, avoiding the need for specialized augmentations, strong regularization, extra hyperparameters, or knowledge of the specific spurious correlations to avoid. We find that diffusion-based and autoregressive generative classifiers achieve state-of-the-art performance on five standard image and text distribution shift benchmarks and reduce the impact of spurious correlations in realistic applications, such as medical or satellite datasets. Finally, we carefully analyze a Gaussian toy setting to understand the inductive biases of generative classifiers, as well as the data properties that determine when generative classifiers outperform discriminative ones.

                arXiv:2512.11843v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Practically everything computers do is better, faster, and more power-efficient than the brain. For example, a calculator performs numerical computations more energy-efficiently than any human. Yet modern AI models are a thousand times less efficient than the brain. These models rely on larger and larger artificial neural networks (ANNs) to boost their encoding capacity, requiring GPUs to perform large-scale matrix multiplications. In contrast, the brain's spiking neural networks (SNNs) exhibit factorially explosive encoding capacity and compute through the polychronization of spikes rather than explicit matrix-vector products, resulting in lower energy requirements. This manifesto proposes a paradigm for framing popular AI models in terms of spiking networks and polychronization, and for interpreting spiking activity as nature's way of implementing look-up tables. This suggests a path toward converting AI models into a novel class of architectures with much smaller size yet combinatorially large encoding capacity, offering the promise of a thousandfold improvement in performance.

                arXiv:2512.04296v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) provides a scalable alternative to full-model adaptation by updating only a small subset of parameters in large pre-trained models. We introduce GRASP - GRouped Activation Shared Parameterization - a lightweight PEFT framework that partitions the D-dimensional token representations of selected layers into K << D groups and learns a shared scaling and shifting vector for each group. This grouped modulation reduces the number of trainable parameters significantly while preserving the ability of the model to learn task-specific features. Building on this formulation, we further propose StochGRASP, which learns Gaussian distributions as perturbations to the pre-trained weights rather than deterministic values. This probabilistic parameterization along with a noise-aware loss function formulation enables modelling hardware-level variability in programmed weights and significantly improves robustness under non-ideal inference conditions-an important requirement for deployment on edge-based emerging AI hardware. Across GLUE (RoBERTa-base & RoBERTa-large) and E2E NLG (GPT-2 Medium), GRASP matches or exceeds the performance of established PEFT methods while achieving an order of magnitude reduction in trainable parameters compared to LoRA and BitFit. Under varying levels of noise, StochGRASP consistently outperforms deterministic variants, demonstrating its suitability for energy-efficient and noise-prone hardware platforms.

                <p>by Danfeng Chen, John D. Storey</p>

The admixture model is widely applied to estimate and interpret population structure among individuals. Here we consider a “standard admixture” model that assumes the admixed populations are unrelated and also a generalized model, where the admixed populations themselves are related via coancestry (or covariance) of allele frequencies. The generalized model yields a potentially more realistic and substantially more flexible model that we call “super admixture”. This super admixture model provides a one-to-one mapping in terms of probability moments with the kinship model, the latter of which is a general model of genome-wide relatedness and structure based on identity-by-descent. We introduce a method to estimate the super admixture model that is based on method of moments, does not rely on likelihoods, is computationally efficient, and scales to massive sample sizes. We apply the method to several human data sets and show that the admixed populations are indeed substantially related, implying the proposed method captures a new and important component of evolutionary history and structure in the admixture model. We show that the fitted super admixture model estimates relatedness between all pairs of individuals at a resolution similar to the kinship model. The super admixture model therefore provides a tractable, forward-generating probabilistic model of complex structure and relatedness that should be useful in a variety of scenarios.

                Shortly after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, President Biden rightly characterized the current era of great power competition as one that occurs between democracies vs autocracies; thus, democracies need a new kind of deterrence concept against emboldened autocrats, as exemplified in Mikael Wigell’s ‘democratic deterrence’ that calls for greater apprehension of –and confidence in—democratic advantage argument in the public consciousness. Democratic middle powers in general could play an important part in the aforementioned democratic deterrence in their own respective capacities, and the third largest democracy, in particular, has the potential to play a unique role in promoting a democratic advantage narrative, especially in the case of the compatibility of democracy with Islam through the principle of Maqashid Sharia. This study makes three recommendations for Indonesia to fulfill its potential role. First, Indonesia needs to accelerate its democratic consolidation process by raising the public’s emancipative values, especially through cognitive mobilization but allied with religions. Second, democratic advantage apprehension must be integrated within traditional foreign policy principles, as the two are not at all contradictory. Finally, the West in general, and United States in particular, need to be more appreciative and supportive of Indonesia’s effort to play a middle-power stabilizing role in the Indo-Pacific, whether in the forms of economic or defense cooperation.

                Abstract* Background Frankincense (Boswellia carterii) is a natural resin rich in biologically active compounds, especially boswellic acids, which contribute to its anti-inflammatory and therapeutic properties. Plant extracts have become valuable in the green synthesis of metal nanoparticles because they act as safe, low-cost and stabilizing agents, offering an environmentally friendly alternative to conventional chemical methods. Methods In this study, silver oxide nanoparticles were prepared using an aqueous extract of Boswellia carterii. The extract was obtained by dissolving 1 g of crude resin in 100 mL of deionized water, heating at 50°C, and filtering to remove insoluble material. A 1 mM solution of silver nitrate was prepared by dissolving 0.015 g of AgNO₃ in 100 mL of water. The silver solution was added gradually to the warm extract under continuous stirring, and the mixture was heated up to 140°C for 50 minutes until a dark brown color appeared, indicating nanoparticle formation. The product was then centrifuged, washed several times, and left to dry. Structural characterization was carried out using X-ray diffraction, and the crystallite size was calculated using the Scherrer equation. Particle morphology was examined by scanning electron microscopy. Results The antibacterial activity of the synthesized nanoparticles was evaluated against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Streptococcus species at concentrations of 60%, 80%, and 100%. The XRD results confirmed the formation of silver oxide with an orthorhombic crystalline structure corresponding to standard reference data, with an average crystallite size of 80.6 nm. SEM images revealed that the particles were relatively uniform in distribution, with diameters ranging from 55.84 to 82.17 nm. Antibacterial testing showed clear inhibition zones measuring between 14.5 and 23 mm for both bacterial strains, with a stronger effect observed against Streptococcus. Conclusion These findings demonstrate that Boswellia carterii extract can serve as an effective natural agent for the green synthesis of silver oxide nanoparticles, producing particles with suitable structural characteristics and notable antibacterial activity.

                Orthogonality is an important concept in normed spaces, and many generalizations of this concept have been proposed. In this paper, we introduce a new concept of orthogonality in normed spaces, denoted by ϼ LM -orthogonality, which is related to ϼ ∗ -orthogonality. The fundamental properties of this new concept are systematically analyzed, including symmetry, non-negativity, scalar homogeneity, linear independence of orthogonal vectors, the Cauchy–Schwarz type inequality, the zero property, and other characteristics. We also explain the relationship between this new definition and some other well-known types of orthogonality.

                The fundamental tasks of function approximation and numerical integration on the sphere from scattered data nodes present significant challenges, including the curse of dimensionality, the instability of high-degree polynomial methods, and the limitations of existing approaches that often require specially structured node sets. This paper introduces a novel framework that seamlessly integrates Weighted Least Squares (WLS) polynomial approximation, using spherical harmonics and Voronoi-based weights, with a consensus-based optimization strategy for decentralized computation, specifically designed for large, distributed datasets. Our results show that this method provides stable and accurate approximation even with high-degree polynomials on arbitrary, unstructured node sets, ensuring a well-conditioned system. It also leads to the construction of a novel quadrature rule with provably positive weights, guaranteeing stability for numerical integration. We derive rigorous theoretical error bounds that explicitly connect the accuracy of the method to the density of the node set and the polynomial degree. Extensive numerical experiments confirm that our framework outperforms standard least squares and classical scattered-data quadrature rules in both stability and accuracy. We conclude that this consensus-based WLS framework offers a robust, scalable, and distributed solution for a wide range of spherical problems, with significant potential impact in scientific computing and data analysis.

                Background The context of this study is the ethical dilemma faced by humanitarian organizations’ (HOs’) executives. This study examines the ways in which regulators determine the degree to which program expense allocations should be limited or prohibited, whereas there is a lack of consensus in the literature. California has moderate regulations on the expense allocations of not-for-profit organizations’(NFPs’) programs. These regulations can influence those of other states and foreign countries. Methods Actual data from Japan, a country with regulations influenced by California, can provide clues on how to resolve disagreements. Through the adoption of a combination of mechanism design and k-means clustering, this study explains how regulators can optimize regulations on HOs’ program expense allocations. Results The k-means clustering results were calculated. There were 966 cases in the first cluster and 37 in the second cluster. The cluster center of the first cluster was 9,343 in JPY, and the cluster center of the second cluster was 160,581 in JPY. The required number of repeats was 12. 34% is the breakpoint ratio for sanctions to be imposed. Conclusions A way to achieve this goal is to intentionally limit the scale of imposed sanctions on expense allocations while maintaining some necessary sanctions to maintain mutual trust within the donation market. The identified research gap is lying around HOs. Transparency also has the dark side and stakeholders have competing interest, while transparency is usually necessary for NFPs to be accountable. This is the gap. While the findings here contradict the views of some rating organizations, intentional adoption of moderate regulations fulfills the research gap.

                Background: Quantitative measurements of vitreous inflammation using vitreous/retinal pigment epithelium-relative intensity (VIT/RPE-Relative Intensity) have been described recently. In proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR), inflammation plays a central role in the pathogenesis, inducing retinal fibrosis and contraction. However, no attempts have yet to be made to analyze the severity of inflammation in PVR progression. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted by reviewing OCT image sets obtained from patients divided into four groups: (1) proliferative vitreoretinopathy, (2) intermediate and posterior uveitis, (3) panuveitis, (4) normal healthy eyes in Cipto Mangunkusumo Kirana Eye Hospital between April 2021 – December 2021. OCT images were then analyzed in the ImageJ software for VIT/RPE-relative intensity. Results: A total of 19 PVR eyes, 12 intermediate-posterior uveitis eyes, 16 panuveitis eyes, and 28 normal healthy eyes were recruited for this study. The VIT/RPE-Relative Intensity was significantly higher in PVR eyes (0.415±0.178) than in intermediate-posterior uveitis (0.236±0.043, p=0.002) and panuveitis eyes (0.30±0.07, p=0.023). Compared to the normal eyes, PVR and both uveitis groups have significantly higher VIT/RPE relative intensity (p = <0.001 in each group). Conclusions: VIT/RPE-relative intensity may offer quantitative measurements of vitreous inflammation in the role of the pathogenesis of PVR. Comparison with cellular inflammation in the vitreous is required to validate this finding.

                Background The objective of this systematic review was to analyze the effects of physical activity (PA) intervention as an adjuvant strategy to pharmacological treatment in people with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) and non-remitted depression (NRD). Methods A search strategy was conducted from five databases: PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Scopus, SPORTDiscus, and Web of Science. The Physiotherapy Evidence Database and Oxford’s Evidence Levels were used to classify the quality appraisal. Results Of the 10777 records, 11 randomized controlled studies met the inclusion criteria. The main outcome for this analysis was the effect of physical activity (PA) or exercise on depressive symptoms in people with TRD and NRD diagnosis. According to the FITT (Frequency, Intensity, Time, and Type) principle, there was some variability in the PA intervention. However, except for one article, all were classified as excellent in terms of quality description. Conclusions This review highlights the potential of PA intervention as an adjuvant program to improve various traits in TRD and NRD. The remission of depression seems to be higher after PA intervention, showing improvements in quality of life, sleep quality, executive function, and vitality.

                Abstract* Background Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) is a myeloproliferative neoplasm driven by the BCR–ABL1 fusion gene. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), such as imatinib and nilotinib, have transformed CML management by significantly improving hematologic and molecular responses. However, real-world data from low- to middle-income countries, including Indonesia, remain limited. Objective This study aimed to evaluate early hematologic responses after three months of TKI therapy in CML patients and to assess the influence of demographic and clinical factors on treatment outcomes. Methods A retrospective cohort study was conducted at Wahidin Sudirohusodo Hospital, Makassar, reviewing medical records of 43 adult CML patients treated with imatinib or nilotinib from January to December 2024. Hematologic parameters were analyzed at baseline and monthly for three months. Associations between treatment response and patient characteristics were assessed using GLM-Repeated Measures and MANOVA. Results Both TKI regiments significantly improved hematologic parameters (p < 0.001), with reductions in leukocyte counts and increases in hemoglobin and hematocrit. No significant interaction was found between time and treatment type (p > 0.05), indicating comparable efficacy. Patients receiving nilotinib showed a higher rate of complete response (60%) than those on imatinib (32.1%), though not statistically significant (p = 0.078). Body weight and BMI significantly influenced hematologic improvements (p < 0.05), while age did not. Conclusion Imatinib and nilotinib both effectively induce early hematologic responses in CML patients. While nilotinib showed a trend toward superior outcomes, statistical equivalence suggests both remain viable options. BMI and body weight are important predictors of response, highlighting the need for individualized treatment strategies. Further large-scale studies with extended follow-up are warranted to confirm long-term benefits and refine patient-specific therapy.

                Background This study aimed to document the occurrence of the Egyptian fruit bat Rousettus aegyptiacus in King Salman Bin Abdulaziz Royal Nature Reserve (KSRNR), Hail region, Saudi Arabia, where its presence had not previously been confirmed. Methods Field surveys were conducted in the Hail region, and direct observations were documented using photographic and video evidence. The colony was visually counted in the field during a single daytime visit from an estimated distance of 15 meters. Results More than 50 individuals, including adults and juveniles, were observed roosting in a rock crevice. The photographic documentation confirms the presence of a colony of R. aegyptiacus in this area, extending the known distribution of the species into a previously unrecorded region of Saudi Arabia. Conclusions These findings provide the first photographic record of R. aegyptiacus in KSRNR and highlight the species’ ecological use of arid rock crevices. The results emphasize the need for targeted surveys and long-term monitoring to better understand the distribution and conservation of this species in desert environments.

                Recent urban planning in Southeast Asia has incorporated the theme of transforming cities to ‘smart city’ status. However, the central question raised in this study is whether the ASEAN’s conception of smart cities is genuinely sustainable. Based on the backdrop of Southeast Asia’s disparity in economic performances and diversity in its political, social, economic, and environmental dimensions, this study updates Crumpton’s 2021 study on the ‘quintuple helix model’ and argues that new observations but old patterns are found in the ASEAN Smart Cities Network’s way of developing cities in Southeast Asia. Utilizing qualitative and quantitative methods and considering data among the ten ASEAN member states in the past four years, this study revisits and updates the current state of Southeast Asia and how this corresponds to the challenges of constructing smart cities in democratic, semi-authoritarian, and authoritarian settings.

                Introduction Tobacco consumption is a leading public health concern in Latin America, contributing significantly to mortality and economic burdens. Despite national regulations, tobacco use remains prevalent in Ecuador, particularly among certain populations. The Galapagos Archipelago provides a unique setting to assess tobacco-related knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) among its residents. Objective This study aimed to determine tobacco consumption prevalence and evaluate the knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding tobacco use and its alternatives in the resident population of the Galapagos Islands. Methods A descriptive study was conducted using validated instruments, the Global Adult Tobacco Survey (GATS) and the Global Youth Tobacco Survey (GYTS). Surveys were administered between March and June 2023 to a sample of adults and teenagers, with data collected anonymously. Results A total of 436 participants were surveyed. Among adults (n=222), 25.2% were smokers, predominantly male (60.7%). In the teenage group (n=214), 6.1% reported current smoking. Smoking initiation occurred at a mean age of 17 years in adults and 15 years in teenagers. Most smokers recognized the health risks associated with tobacco, but awareness of specific diseases varied. Although 57.9% of adult smokers attempted to quit, few received professional assistance. Public support for smoke-free policies was high, yet smoking in restricted areas remained common. Conclusion Tobacco consumption in the Galapagos Archipelago is higher than the national average, especially among adults. Despite awareness of health risks, cessation efforts remain insufficient. Strengthened public health policies and targeted interventions are needed to reduce tobacco use and mitigate its health and environmental impact.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1482/v1?src=rss">DERMOSAN: Development of an interactive software tool in Streamlit for dermatological diagnosis assisted by convolutional neural networks (CNNs) [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Abstract* Background Artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted dermatological diagnosis has become increasingly important due to its ability to support clinical decision-making and reduce diagnostic variability among specialists. This paper presents DERMOSAN, an interactive software tool developed in Streamlit, based on a convolutional neural network (CNN), designed for the automatic classification of dermatological diseases using clinical images. Methods A public Kaggle dataset with 27,153 dermatological images distributed across ten clinical categories was used. The model was built on the ResNet152 architecture with transfer learning, implemented in TensorFlow and Keras. The images were divided into training (80%), validation (10%), and test (10%) subsets, applying class weighting to mitigate data imbalance. The tool integrates a Streamlit-based graphical interface that enables real-time image upload, local processing, and probabilistic diagnosis visualization. Results The model achieved 95% accuracy in training, 83% in validation, and 92.3% in testing. The confusion matrix showed better performance in the most representative classes. The developed interface allows for automatic diagnosis along with confidence scores and complementary clinical suggestions, facilitating quick and reproducible visual interpretation. Conclusions DERMOSAN is a stage of software development aimed at integrating deep learning models into accessible clinical environments. Although the system does not include clinical validation, it represents a step toward the creation of reproducible, open-source tools for AI-assisted diagnosis.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1481/v1?src=rss">The Short Version of Wealth Portfolio Index of Indonesians Living in Flood-Prone Regions [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background This study aims to develop a short version of the wealth portfolio index by incorporating expenditure data, addressing the need for practical socioeconomic assessment tools in flood-prone regions of Indonesia. We followed the line of the national socioeconomic survey, which included comprehensive data on food and non-food expenditures, household assets, and housing characteristics. Method To construct and validate the short-form measure, a random sample of residents (N=700) was collected from flood-prone areas in Bima, Manado, and Pontianak. The study employed nonlinear principal components analysis in the form of categorical principal component analysis (CATPCA), which is suitable for integrating variables measured on differing scales. Results The CATPCA analysis supports a two-dimensional wealth portfolio index consisting of total 24 items, reflecting both asset ownership and expenditure patterns relevant to the target population. Discussion The emergence of two distinct dimensions highlights the multidimensional nature of socioeconomic status in environments with recurrent flooding. Based on the current finding, we suggest to use the short-form index which provides robust item coverage while facilitating efficient household-level assessments in diverse Indonesian communities, especially in flood-prone areas.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1480/v1?src=rss">Do hotel green practices influence customer satisfaction? Evidence from the Indian hospitality sector [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background The study investigates the impact of Hotel Green Practices (HGP) on customers’ Willingness to Pay (WTP) for the sustainable initiative, Customer Loyalty (CL), and Customer Satisfaction (CS) in the hotel industry. Although green practices have gained considerable importance in hotel operations, empirical studies that simultaneously assess their direct and mediated effects on customer satisfaction remain limited. To address this gap, the present research integrates HGP, WTP, CL, and CS into a unified structural framework and examines the mediating roles of WTP and CL in explaining consumers’ satisfaction with hotel green practices. Methods Data were collected from the guests who stayed in star rated hotels of Delhi, India, between 9th to 29th October 2025. Convenience sampling was used, and a self-administered questionnaire served as the data collection tool. Measurement items were adapted from well-established scales in hospitality and consumer behaviour research. Data were analysed using SmartPLS 4, and PLS-SEM was employed to examine the structural relationships, as well as the explanatory and predictive capabilities of the proposed model. Results The structural analysis demonstrated that HGP has a significant impact on both WTP and CL. A direct, although weaker, positive association was also observed between HGP and CS. Both mediators WTP, and CL contributed significantly to CS, with CL has the strongest effect, followed by WTP. Mediation analysis confirmed partial mediation, with indirect effects surpassing the direct effect of HGP on CS. The model showed substantial explanatory power, particularly for CS (R2 = 0.627), and demonstrated strong predictive relevance, with Q2 values exceeding the recommended threshold of 0.35. Conclusions The findings suggest that HGP has positive impact on CS, CL, and customers’ WTP. Furthermore, customer loyalty emerged as a strong mediating variable between hotel green practices and customer satisfaction relationship. Overall, these results highlight the importance of adopting sustainability practices in hotel operations, as they not only strengthen customer loyalty and customer satisfaction, but also influence customers to pay premium price for the hotel’s sustainable initiatives.

                Background The study of theory for analytic univalent and multivalent functions is an old subject in mathematics, particularly in complex analysis, that has captivated a great deal of scholars owing to the sheer sophistication of its geometrical features as well as its many research possibilities. The study of univalent functions is one of many significant elements of complex analysis for both single and multiple variables. Investigators have become keen on the conventional investigation of this topic since at least 1907. Numerous scholars in the area of complex analysis have emerged since then, including Euler, Gauss, Riemann, Cauchy, and other people. Geometric function theory combines geometry and analysis. Methods This study employs the differential subordination technique to derive multiple characteristics from the new linear operator M σ , μ n , ς Υ ( s ) . The concept of the differential subordination subclass of analytical univalent functions is analyzed. Results In this section, We studied some results on differential subordination and superordination using a specific class of univalent functions stated on a specific space of univalent functions stated on the open unit disc. Using properties of the operator, we discovered a number of properties of superordinations and subordinations related to the idea of the Hadamard product. We investigated several aspects of superordinations and subordinations using a new operator M σ , μ n , ς Υ ( s ) . Conclusions A new operator M σ , μ n , ς Υ ( s ) : Λ ⟶ Λ has been established in this paper connected to the Dziok-Srivastava operator T σ n and the Hadamard product corresponding to the Komatu integral operator Ω μ ς . The difference operator M σ , μ n , ς ϒ ( s ) can have specific properties derived by applying the differential subordination technique. And the objective of this paper is to make use of the connection ( β 1 μ + 1 ) M σ , μ n + 1 , ς ϒ ( s ) = w ( M σ , μ n , ς ϒ ( s ) ) ′ + β 1 μ ( M σ , μ n , ς ϒ ( s ) ) .

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1478/v1?src=rss">Assessing nonlinearities in the GFP random mutagenesis landscape using the Power Transform [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Abstract* Background Epistasis, a non-additive contribution of mutations to fitness, complicates genotype-to-phenotype prediction and is often confounded by nonlinearities in phenotype measurements. The Power Transform method, particularly Box-Cox, has been used to reduce epistasis in small, combinatorially complete datasets by linearizing phenotypic scales. However, its applicability to large landscapes, especially those generated by (quasi-)random mutagenesis, remains unclear. Methods Here, we apply both Box-Cox and Yeo-Johnson Power Transforms to the extensively characterized green fluorescent protein (GFP) fitness landscape, which contains hundreds of thousands of two- and three-dimensional combinatorially complete datasets. Results When applied to individual hypercubes, Box-Cox reduces pairwise epistasis by 19.4% on average, whereas Yeo-Johnson – despite accommodating negative values – slightly increases epistasis (by 4.45%). Moreover, in a notable fraction of hypercubes, both methods increase the magnitude of epistatic coefficients, indicating that Power Transform does not universally reduce nonlinearity at the local scale. In contrast, applying Yeo-Johnson to the largest connected component of the GFP landscape (20,872 genotypes) successfully reduces both pairwise (by 3.86%) and third-order epistasis (by 11.6%), with the majority of coefficients decreasing in magnitude. Conclusions Our results demonstrate that Power Transform can be extended to large, real-world landscapes generated by random mutagenesis, but only when applied to connected sublandscapes. Our findings highlight a critical distinction between global and local linearization and caution against assuming that Power Transform always diminishes epistasis.

                Background Choosing an optimal business location is a critical decision that can significantly impact an organization’s success. Many businesses fail because their initiators were not properly guided with informed counsels prior to the commencement. Methods This study employed stratified random sampling to collect data from a sample of 1200 business units across the southern and middle belt regions of Nigeria. Using statistical tools such as factor analysis, empirical literature review, and ordinal logistic regression, the study explores accounting perspectives from type and locational factors necessary in making impactful business decisions. These include analyzing the turnover potential of various business types and locations. Results The study found that business success and sustainability are sensitive to factors such as culture, government regulation, religion, and population density. The findings also indicate that the choice of business type—such as consumer goods, industrial goods, foodstuff, supermarkets—and their locations in rural or urban areas all have significant implications for business survival. Conclusion By integrating accounting and statistical perspectives, businesses can make more informed and strategic location decisions. These decisions can leverage the analytical advantages of understanding business types and locations, ultimately improving operational efficiency and profitability.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-136/v4?src=rss">Molecular Characterization of Dermatophyte species from rural tertiary care hospital: A Study Protocol [version 4; peer review: 1 approved, 4 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Dermatophytes are the keratinophilic fungi which infect humans and is the most recurring type of disease. The high level of transmissibility creates an epidemiological risk and emphasises the significance of these illnesses. However, a growing number of reports describing dermatophytes can cause deep infections in diabetic and immunocompromised patients, by invading deep layers like the dermis and hypodermis. Despite the prevalence and significance of dermatophytes in clinical mycology, it is not always possible to accurately diagnose this specific infection due to its overlapping structures among species of dermatophytes. Since it is difficult to identify species that exhibit weak characteristics in the morphological highlights, identification of the dermatophyte is often relied on its morphological analysis, which is a laborious process and demands skill. The massive shift in genetic variation, the source of infection, and epidemiological research can be discovered using molecular approaches. Therefore, the development of an accurate laboratory test for dermatophyte species identification is essential for the prevention and efficient management of dermatophytoses. One such methodology allows use of PCR technology which has many methods for molecular level characterization which is rapid, efficient, and capable of producing DNA polymorphisms specific to various dermatophyte species based on distinctive band patterns seen by agarose gel electrophoresis. The RAPD-PCR approach will be used in this study protocol to molecularly characterize the dermatophytes for precise speciation of the sample. In addition to improving knowledge of fungal biology and pathology with a focus on adaptive mechanisms to combat difficult conditions from host counteractions, there is a need to improve awareness of the importance of these diseases through accurate epidemiological data. The advantages of molecular approaches for characterizing objects over traditional methods are their sensitivity and specificity.

                Purpose To report the impact of front surface eccentricity (FSE) of scleral lenses (SCLs) on the visual performance of eyes exhibiting refractive surgery-induced higher-order aberrations (HOAs) Method A female teenager presented to the clinic with blurring of vision and dependency on spectacles even after undergoing Small Incision Lenticule Extraction (SMILE) in both eyes (BE). Her presenting uncorrected high contrast distance visual acuity (HCDVA) was 20/60 in the right eye (RE) and 20/40 in the left eye (LE). On examination, the cornea showed a ring-shaped area of ablation with faint scarring and a well-apposed lenticule-extraction site. Subjective refraction improved the HCDVA to 20/20p in RE and 20/25 in LE but the patient was not satisfied with the quality of vision. Ocular aberrometry revealed an increase in total HOAs as the underlying cause of unsatisfactory vision. Result A contact lens trial was recommended for BE to enhance visual quality. Rigid corneal lenses (RCLs) were tried, but the patient was intolerant to them. Large diameter SCLs of different FSEs (0, 0.6, and 0.8) were tried to reduce these aberrations. SCL with FSE 0 yielded the most favourable visual outcome. Conclusion With this case report, we hypothesize that the eccentricity of SCL can be selected according to the asphericity (at 6 mm) of the posterior corneal surface. This case also re-emphasizes the impact of SCL with varying FSEs on reducing HOAs and enhancing visual quality in eyes where conventional RCLs yield suboptimal results.

                Background Research comparing inclusive education implementation in non-Western contexts, such as Indonesia and Oman, remains limited. Both countries share cultural similarities yet differ significantly in their education governance. Understanding these differences is crucial for improving inclusive education policies and practices. Methods This study employed qualitative document analysis, reviewing 33 policy and implementation documents from Indonesia and Oman. The analysis focused on five dimensions: service models, teacher training, curriculum adaptation, community involvement, and cultural attitudes. Results and Conclusions Findings reveal that Oman’s centralized system provides consistent policy coordination but limits community participation and school flexibility. Indonesia’s decentralized system allows greater local innovation and community involvement but leads to disparities in implementation quality. Both countries struggle with teacher training, curriculum adaptation, and cultural stigma against disabilities. Effective inclusive education requires a balanced approach combining adaptive centralization and equitable decentralization, ongoing teacher development, flexible curricula, active community engagement, and cultural transformation. These insights offer practical recommendations to strengthen inclusive education in diverse socio-political contexts.

                Background Chronic arsenic exposure interferes with hippocampal-dependent cognition through glutamate excitotoxicity, which in turn interferes with the regulation of receptors and transporters. Bromelain, a combination of proteolytic enzymes derived from Ananas comosus, is known to have neuroprotective effects; however, the mechanisms by which it counteracts glutamate-mediated toxicity in the brain are poorly understood. This study investigated the potential of bromelain to normalize glutamatergic homeostasis and cognitive function in arsenic-treated rats by specifically examining the NMDA receptor subunit NR2A and glutamate transporters GLT-1, EAAC1, and xCT. Methods Seventy-two adult male Wistar rats (200-220 g) were randomly divided into nine groups (n=8 each): control, arsenic-only (20 mg/kg/day sodium arsenite, administered via oral gavage for 14 days), bromelain-only (5, 10, or 15 mg/kg/day, oral gavage), arsenic plus bromelain (at the same doses), and arsenic plus donepezil (2 mg/kg/day, intraperitoneal). Sodium arsenite (20 mg/kg/day, p.o.) was administered for 14 days to induce neurotoxicity, followed by bromelain (5–15 mg/kg/day, p.o.) or donepezil (2 mg/kg/day) for an additional 14 days (post-exposure) treatment. Glutamate concentration was measured using sandwich Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay [ELISA] and total RNA was isolated to perform RT-qPCR to evaluate the expression of NR2A, GLT-1, EAAC1, and xCT. Results Arsenic exposure impaired spatial memory, increased brain tissue glutamate, and reduced NR2A and transporter gene expression. Post-exposure bromelain treatment partially/fully normalized these outcomes, with the most consistent effects at 10 mg/kg. Findings are based on mRNA expression and tissue glutamate. Conclusions Bromelain provides multi-target neuroprotection in arsenic neurotoxicity, rescuing glutamatergic homeostasis by coordinated upregulation of NMDA receptor NR2A and the transport network (GLT-1, EAAC1, xCT), accompanied by spatial learning and memory improvement. The demonstrated dose-response, showed numerically greater effects over 15 mg/kg donepezil, although direct superiority comparisons were not pre-specified. Also, the lack of overt adverse effects support its translational potential as a safe, plant-based adjunct to excitotoxic diseases and toxin-exposed populations.

                Background The global age-standardised suicide rate is estimated at 8.9/100 000, while South Africa is at 23.5/100 000. The prehospital Emergency Medical Services is located within this burden of health. Emergency Care providers have a duty to assess, treat and transport healthcare consumers with suicidality, when attending to the suicide caseload. The aim was to appraise suicidality case frequency and typology and estimate the scope of the challenge faced by a jurisdictional emergency medical service and its care providers. Methods Using a retrospective cross-sectional design and a novel data collection instrument, a census of three years of Ambulance Incident Management Records was undertaken in a rural district of the Western Cape, South Africa. Results Of 413,712 records, 2,976 (N) mental health-related incidents were sampled. Fourteen percent (n = 412) were assessed to have descriptors of suicidal ideation (n = 227), attempted suicide (n = 83) or death by suicide (n = 102). There were, on average, 2.8 deaths by suicide per month over the 3-year study period in the Garden Route District. Women were reported to mostly ingest poison and overdose on medication, while men used strangulation and were 5 times more likely to die by suicide than women. Conclusion This study estimates the prehospital suicide and suicidality burden for the Western Cape Government Emergency Medical Services, elucidating an under-researched health concern within the South African prehospital space. Further study is required on the risk of emergency care provider stigmatisation towards suicide and suicidality cases, while auditing the need to assess policy, praxis, medical surveillance, EC provider clinical capacity and victim needs and experiences. Suicidality and suicide in Southern Africa could require a ‘Syndemic’ approach for the emergency service to interrupt suicidality and advance professional relevance.

                Background Pulmonary infections caused by Aspergillus fumigatus are a global health concern. In the lungs, A. fumigatus employs a variety of virulence and adaptation mechanisms that allows it to survive and evade local immune responses. A. fumigatus protein kinases co-ordinately regulate adaptation to the lung environment and antifungal agents. However, to improve our understanding of the role of these fungal protein kinases in subverting the antifungal responses exhibited by specific host cells, in vitro infection models should be developed. Here, we describe a functional genomics approach to evaluate the role of A. fumigatus protein kinases upon infection of airway epithelial cells, leveraging the use of our existing library of A. fumigatus deletion mutants for kinase functions and bar-seq. Methods We infected A549 alveolar epithelial cells with a pool of 111 A. fumigatus barcoded null mutant strains in genes encoding protein kinases and used bar-seq to identify which of these are involved in fungal survival upon A549 infection. To assess the optimal method for understanding host-pathogen interactions, three approaches aimed at removing extracellular conidia were evaluated: pharmacological treatment with the antifungal nystatin, washes of unbound conidia, and differential fluorescent staining of extracellular and intracellular conidia followed by cell sorting. The identified candidates were further validated using targeted approaches. Results Our data revealed new roles for A. fumigatus protein kinases during infection of airway epithelial cells. Modification of the experimental setup allowed us to differentiate between the genes associated with uptake and those required to withstand other stresses imposed by exposure to mammalian cells. Conclusions This protocol provides a new platform to ascribe pathogenicity-associated functions to A. fumigatus genes and allows prioritization for downstream experiments in mice, potentially reducing the number of studies needed in live animals. This is particularly pertinent, as genome-wide barcoded collections with thousands of strains have become available.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-794/v2?src=rss">Identification of Viral Variants from Functional Genomics Data [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Virus mutants are commonly used for studying the role of individual viral proteins in infections and are increasingly investigated with functional genomics experiments of infected cells that use sequencing-based assays such as RNA-seq or ATAC-seq. However, existing mutant virus strains are often poorly documented, in particular if they have been created decades ago. Identifying viral variants directly in the functional genomics experiments avoids additional genome sequencing and allows confirming the presence of specific mutations directly in the experiment of interest. Methods We present a pipeline to directly identify mutations in viral genomes from sequencing-based functional genomics data. The pipeline combines existing SNP callers with novel methods for identifying deletions, insertions, and corresponding inserted sequences. These novel methods address the problem that existing structural variant callers performed poorly on functional genomics data with large variations in read coverage. Results We evaluated the pipeline on RNA-seq data for infection with knockout mutants for important proteins of Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1). Comparison of the variants identified by our pipeline with the descriptions of the original publications showed that we could correctly recover the introduced mutations. Conclusions Our pipeline offers researchers a fast and easy way to identify variants in the viral genome without additional genome sequencing. The pipeline is implemented as a workflow for the workflow management system Watchdog and is available at https://github.com/watchdog-wms/watchdog-wms-workflows/ (workflow VariantCallerPipeline).

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is an established risk factor for dementia, although the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Our previous research demonstrated that a single severe TBI in wild-type (WT) mice induces a prion-like form of tau (tau<sup>TBI</sup>) that spreads throughout the brain, leading to memory deficits. Here, we investigated whether similar self-propagating tau<sup>TBI</sup> conformers are generated in humans after severe TBI.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We biochemically assessed tau and phosphorylated tau (P-tau) levels in human brain contusions surgically removed acutely after severe TBI. Inoculation studies were performed using human TBI brain homogenates in WT and tau knockout (KO) mice to investigate the role of endogenous tau in tau<sup>TBI</sup> propagation. Cognitive function was evaluated using the novel object recognition test, the radial arm water maze, and the Y-maze. Pathological changes in the brain of the inoculated mice were analyzed by histological and biochemical analyses, and targeted transcriptomics.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Inoculation of human TBI brain homogenates in WT mice caused widespread tau deposition and cognitive impairment, hippocampal synaptic loss, and disease-associated transcriptomic changes. Effects were similar upon secondary inoculation in WT but not tau KO mice, confirming a tau-dependent mechanism.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Severe TBI induces transmissible tau<sup>TBI</sup> conformers in humans acutely after injury, potentially exacerbating post-traumatic pathology, and increasing the risk for dementia later in life. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

<p>This study investigated the anatomical structure of spinal cord segments and their association with vertebrae in Korean water deer and Siberian roe deer. Morphometric analyses revealed that the direction of spinal segmental shifts changes around the cervical and lumbar enlargements, indicating that reduced growth at these enlargements determines the segmental positional relationship between the spinal cord and vertebrae.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The length of the spinal cord differs from that of the vertebral column in vertebrates, and their segmental positional relationship exhibits significant variability and complexity. However, research on the spinal cord structure of the Korean water deer and Siberian roe deer remains unexplored. This study aimed to investigate the anatomical structure of spinal cord segments and their association with vertebrae in these species, as well as to compare the findings with those from previously studied species. Morphometric analyses of the spinal cords and vertebrae were conducted using various measurement parameters. Notably, the cervical enlargement extended from C6 to T1, and the lumbar enlargement from L4 to S1, with significant decreases in spinal segment length observed in these regions. Transitions were noted around these enlargements, including shifts from caudal to cranial in spinal segments relative to vertebral segments and from acute to more obtuse trapezoidal shapes in dorsal rootlets. We propose that reduced growth rates at enlargements determine the positional relationship between the spinal cord and vertebrae. Since this study provides the first anatomical characterization of the spinal cord in these two deer species, our findings advance our understanding of spinal cord structure in Cervidae. Furthermore, through comparative analysis with previous studies, these findings elucidate the segmental positional relationship between the spinal cord and vertebral column, providing a foundation for further morphological and embryological studies across various species.</p>

                Background The emergence of antifungal resistance in fungal pathogens highlights the need for local epidemiological data to guide empirical therapy in clinical settings. Fungal research and anti-fungal drug resistance studies are limited in developing countries; hence, there is a need for burden estimation in low- and middle-income countries. This study aimed to determine the spectrum of fungal pathogens and the anti-fungal resistance profile of fungal pathogens isolated from the respiratory and urinary tracts of prison inmates in Nairobi, Kenya. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted in which sputum and urine samples were obtained from inmates presenting with symptoms of respiratory and urogenital infections at a prison outpatient clinic. One hundred and sixty-two samples were collected and subjected to fungal investigation using standard protocols. Susceptibility to fluconazole, itraconazole, and voriconazole was assessed using standard broth microdilution. Clinical and sociodemographic data were obtained using a structured questionnaire. Results From the 162, 94 samples were positive for fungal pathogens, with an overall prevalence of 58%. Seventeen (11%) of the isolated fungi were Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus flavus and Histoplasma. There was a statistically significant difference between fungal pathogens isolated from the respiratory and urogenital tracts in both sexes (p<0.05). Antifungal susceptibility testing against itraconazole showed 2 of Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus fumigatus were resistant. Two isolates (16.7%) one each of A.flavus and A. fumigatus, respectively , tested positive for the resistance gene cyp51a. Conclusion Mycological agents are significant causes of respiratory and UTI infections among prison inmates, which could be attributed to prison conditions and misdiagnosis as bacterial infections. This highlights the need for specific control measures to reduce exposure to fungal infections in prisons and in the general population.

                Background Abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) in premenopausal women is frequent, yet distinguishing benign from malignant causes remains clinically challenging. Endometrial thickness (ET) measured by transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) is well established in postmenopausal bleeding but less validated in premenopausal women due to cyclical variations. This study aimed to assess the diagnostic accuracy and prognostic value of ET, supplemented by Kaplan–Meier survival analysis, in predicting endometrial malignancy among premenopausal women with AUB. Methods We conducted a retrospective analytical study including premenopausal women presenting with AUB at Charles Nicolle Hospital, Tunis, Tunisia (2016–2024). All underwent TVUS followed by endometrial sampling (hysteroscopy or curettage) and definitive histological confirmation on hysterectomy specimens. Sonographic features were described using International Endometrial Tumor Analysis (IETA) criteria. Diagnostic performance of ET was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Kaplan-Meir survival analysis was applied to time-to-consultation and time-to-diagnosis, not survival outcomes. Results ROC analysis identified ET as the strongest predictor of endometrial malignancy (AUC = 0.842, p < 0.001). An optimal cutoff of >9 mm achieved 69.2% sensitivity, 87.1% specificity, and a negative predictive value of 97.7%, effectively ruling out malignancy in patients with ET ≤9 mm. Although the positive predictive value was modest (26.5%), ET reliably stratified risk for further invasive evaluation. Kaplan–Meier analysis demonstrated that ET >9 mm was associated with earlier consultation (mean 27.7 vs. 70.3 months, p < 0.0001) and shorter time-to-diagnosis (median 12 months vs. not reached, p < 0.0001), reflecting a more aggressive clinical course. Conclusions ET >9 mm is a robust, non-invasive potential prognostic marker in premenopausal AUB, identifying high-risk women requiring urgent evaluation while safely excluding malignancy in low-risk patients.

                Background People need critical thinking skills to make well-informed health choices and avoid waste and unnecessary suffering. However, educational interventions can have adverse effects, which is often overlooked. We created a framework of potential harms of interventions to improve critical thinking about health choices. The objective was to identify potential effects and articulate potential mechanisms. We intended to use the framework to inform the development and evaluation of an intervention in Kenya, Rwanda, and Uganda. Methods We created an initial framework drawing on two earlier frameworks. We surveyed external experts using Likert-scale and open-ended items, including researchers, educators, and others, in a variety of relevant fields. We emailed the survey to an international advisory network, and all other experts recommended by respondents. We analyzed the quantitative data using descriptive statistics. We conducted a thematic analysis of the qualitative data. We revised the framework based on those results. To identify any effects missing from the revised framework, we individually interviewed a convenience sample of one teacher from each of Kenya, Rwanda, and Uganda. Results We received responses from 38 of 70 external experts (54%). The quantitative survey data suggested respondents agreed with the initial framework overall. However, the qualitative data led to substantial revisions. The revised framework consists of categories of adverse outcomes; outcomes within each category; sub-outcomes; individuals, groups, and populations that might experience each adverse outcome; beneficial outcomes corresponding with adverse outcomes; and potential mechanisms of adverse effects. There are six categories: decision-making harms, psychological harms, equity harms, group and social harms, waste, and other harms. In the interviews with teachers, we did not identify any effects missing from the revised framework. Conclusions As far as we know, the framework is the first tool of its kind for education research. It can be improved upon and adapted.

                <p>Nature Communications, Published online: 31 December 2025; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-67732-2">doi:10.1038/s41467-025-67732-2</a></p>Despite extensive structural studies elucidating how antigens are anchored to antigen-presenting molecules and presented to T cells, little is known about the display mechanism of the lipid-antigen-presenting molecule CD1c. Here, by combining structural immunology, lipidomics, and biophysical analysis, the authors reveal that the CD1c binding cleft accommodates two different lipids, one of them with a bulky headgroup positioned sideways for display to T cells, rather than upwards, different from the conventional upright antigen-presentation mode

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96987">JAK-STAT pathway activation compromises nephrocyte function in a Drosophila high-fat diet model of chronic kidney disease</a></h4>

              
                Chronic kidney disease is a major health issue and is gaining prevalence. Using a <i>Drosophila</i> model for chronic kidney disease, we show that a high-fat diet (HFD) disrupts the slit diaphragm filtration structure in nephrocytes, the fly functional equivalent of mammalian podocytes. The structural disruption resulted in reduced filtration function in the affected nephrocytes. We demonstrate that HFD activates the JAK-STAT pathway in nephrocytes, which has previously been linked to diabetic kidney disease. JAK-STAT activation was initiated by increased expression and release of the adipokine, Upd2, from the fat body. This leptin-like hormone is a known ligand of JAK-STAT. Both genetic and pharmacological inhibition of JAK-STAT restored nephrocyte HFD-associated dysfunction. Altogether, our study reveals the importance of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway in the adipose tissue−nephrocyte axis and its contribution to HFD-associated nephropathy. These findings open new avenues for intervention in treating diabetic nephropathy and chronic kidney disease.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/107765">The evolution of interdisciplinarity and internationalization in scientific journals</a></h4>

              
                There is a widely held perception that science is becoming more international—through multi-national collaborations—and interdisciplinary, drawing on knowledge from multiple domains. However, these hypothesized trends have not yet been quantitatively characterized. With the publication metadata from OpenAlex, we examine trends in two groups of journals: disciplinary journals in natural sciences, life sciences, social sciences, and multidisciplinary journals that publish articles in multiple fields. Supporting existing perceptions, we find an almost universal trend towards increasing internationalization of both sets of journals. Nevertheless, we find disparities: medicine journals are less international than journals in other disciplines and do not increase their levels of internationalization, whereas physics journals appear to be segregating between those that are international and those that are not. We also find that multidisciplinary journals have undergone significant shifts in their disciplinary focuses over the past century, whereas disciplinary journals appear to have largely maintained their degree of interdisciplinarity.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90849">Hybridization breaks species barriers in long-term coevolution of a cyanobacterial population</a></h4>

              
                Bacterial species often undergo rampant recombination yet maintain cohesive genomic identity. Ecological differences can generate recombination barriers between species and sustain genomic clusters in the short term. But can these forces prevent genomic mixing during long-term coevolution? Cyanobacteria in Yellowstone hot springs comprise several diverse species that have coevolved for hundreds of thousands of years, providing a rare natural experiment. By analyzing more than 300 single-cell genomes, we show that despite each species forming a distinct genomic cluster, much of the diversity within species is the result of hybridization driven by selection, which has mixed their ancestral genotypes. This widespread mixing is contrary to the prevailing view that ecological barriers can maintain cohesive bacterial species and highlights the importance of hybridization as a source of genomic diversity.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/107758">Neisseria gonorrhoeae LIN codes provide a robust, multi-resolution lineage nomenclature</a></h4>

              
                Investigation of the bacterial pathogen <i>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</i> is complicated by extensive horizontal gene transfer: a process which disrupts phylogenetic signals and impedes our understanding of population structure. The ability to consistently identify <i>N. gonorrhoeae</i> lineages is important for surveillance of this increasingly antimicrobial resistant organism, facilitating efficient communication regarding its epidemiology; however, conventional typing systems fail to reflect <i>N. gonorrhoeae</i> strain taxonomy in a reliable and stable manner. Here, a <i>N. gonorrhoeae</i> genomic lineage nomenclature, based on the barcoding system of Life Identification Number (LIN) codes, was developed using a refined 1430 core gene MLST (cgMLST). This hierarchical LIN code nomenclature conveys lineage information at multiple levels of resolution within one code, enabling it to provide immediate context to an isolate’s ancestry, and to relate to familiar, previously used typing schemes such as Ng cgMLST v1, 7-locus MLST, or NG-STAR clonal complex (CC). Clustering with LIN codes accurately reflects gonococcal diversity and population structure, providing insight into associations between genotype and phenotype for traits such as antibiotic resistance. These codes are automatically assigned and publicly accessible via the <a href="https://pubmlst.org/organisms/neisseria-spp">https://pubmlst.org/organisms/neisseria-spp</a> database.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/108049">Decision-making components and times revealed by the single-trial electroencephalogram</a></h4>

              
                Decision-making stems from a sequence of information processing steps between the onset of the stimulus and the response. Despite extensive research, uncertainty remains about the actual cognitive sequence involved that leads to the reaction time. Using the hidden multivariate pattern method, we modeled the single-trial electroencephalogram of participants performing a decision task as a sequence of an unknown number of events estimated as trial-recurrent, time-varying, stable topographies. We provide evidence for five events occurring during participants’ decision-making with two visual encoding events and three events capturing respectively attention orientation, decision, and motor execution. This interpretation is supported by the observation that a targeted manipulation of stimulus intensity yields Piéron’s law in the interval between encoding and attention orientation, and Fechner’s law in the interval between attention orientation and decision commitment. The final decision-related event is represented in the brain as a ramping signal in parietal areas whose timing, amplitude, and build-up predict the participants’ decision accuracy.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106658">Coordinated spinal locomotor network dynamics emerge from cell-type-specific connectivity patterns</a></h4>

              
                Even without detailed instruction from the brain, spinal locomotor circuitry generates coordinated behavior characterized by left–right alternation, segment-to-segment propagation, and variable-speed control. While existing models have emphasized the contributions of cellular- and network-level properties, the core mechanisms underlying rhythmogenesis remain incompletely understood. Further, neither family of models has fully accounted for recent experimental results in zebrafish and other organisms pointing to the importance of cell-type-specific intersegmental connectivity patterns and recruitment of speed-selective subpopulations of interneurons. Informed by these experimental findings and others, we developed a hierarchy of increasingly detailed models of the locomotor network. We find that coordinated locomotion emerges in an inhibition-dominated network in which connectivity is determined by intersegmental phase relationships among interneurons and variable-speed control is implemented by recruitment of speed-selective subpopulations. Further, while structured excitatory connections are not necessary for rhythmogenesis, they are useful for increasing peak locomotion frequency, albeit at the cost of smooth transitions at intermediate frequencies, suggesting a basic computational trade-off between speed and control. Together, this family of models shows that network-level interactions are sufficient to generate coordinated, variable-speed locomotion, providing new interpretations of intersegmental excitatory and inhibitory connectivity, as well as the basic, recruitment-based mechanism of speed control.

">Stable fusion of bone marrow-derived cells with Purkinje neurons enables long-term nuclear integration and neuronal repair</a></h4>

              
                Developing effective strategies to replace or restore injured neurons could significantly revolutionise the treatment of currently incurable neurodegenerative disorders. Studies have shown that bone marrow-derived cells (BMDCs) can migrate into the brain and fuse with damaged Purkinje neurons (PNs), restoring their structure and function. Yet, despite over two decades of research, the temporal dynamics and functional stability of these fusion events in vivo remain poorly defined, largely due to reliance on static, post-mortem histological analyses that provide only a single snapshot in time. Here, using in vivo two-photon imaging of the intact cerebellum in EGFP-bone marrow chimeric mice, we visualised the dynamics of BMDC-PN interactions both in real time and longitudinally to monitor the physiological characteristics of fused PNs. Notably, we provide definitive evidence that fused cells are not transient but remain stable over extended periods in the living brain. Moreover, we demonstrate sustained transcriptional activity of donor-derived genes within fused PNs, indicating partial or complete functional integration of the BMDC nucleus. Given their accessibility and genetic tractability, BMDCs represent a practical and promising platform for targeted delivery of therapeutic genes to PNs, opening new avenues for treating neurodegenerative disease.

">Adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) induce dose-dependent neonatal ventriculomegaly following intracerebroventricular administration</a></h4>

              
                Cell-type-speci[fi]c expression of synthetic/endogenous proteins or genetic sequences has signi[fi]cantly advanced our understanding of the central nervous system (CNS). Adeno-associated virus (AAV)-delivery to cerebrospinal [fl]uid (CSF) mediates transfection of target cells to enable sustained delivery of secretory proteins into the CSF, o[ff]ering promising avenues for both CNS therapy and mechanistic studies. However, despite the advantages afforded by AAV tropism-based cellular selectivity and transgene delivery, both preclinical studies and clinical trials report short- and long-term adverse e[ff]ects, particularly immune activation. Especially relevant for CSF biology, CNS immune insults raise the risk of CSF dysregulation, including hydrocephalus. These risks may be exacerbated in pediatric populations, where ongoing CNS development, including immature meninges, choroid plexus (ChP), and skull structures, may further impair any ability to compensate for CSF dysregulation. To systematically address these risks and provide guidelines for minimizing CNS immune insults by AAVs, we test the dose-dependent e[ff]ects of intracerebroventricular (ICV) injections of 3 AAV serotypes (AAV2/5, AAV2/4, and AAV.PHP.eB) to neonatal (P0.5) CD1 mouse pups. Histological analysis veri[fi]ed AAV2/5 tropism limited to ChP epithelial cells (CPECs), whereas AAV.PHP.eB transfected both CPECs and ependymal regions. By contrast, AAV2/4 shows limited transfection in the brain. Further, we [fi]nd that ICV injections of all 3 AAV serotypes at the high dose (4x109 genome copy GC/pup) induced ventriculomegaly by P7.5, while the low dose (1x109 GC/pup) was well tolerated. Additionally, high-dose AAV2/5 tropism became more permissive, transfecting the ChP and also ependymal cells and some neurons. Longitudinal MRI of P0.5 pups with high-dose AAV2/5 ICV injections highlighted quick progression of ventriculomegaly. CSF ELISA analysis detected elevated proin[fl]ammatory cytokine CCL2 in AAV2/5 and AAV2/4 high-dose groups, indicating CNS inflammation. Moreover, decreased CSF TTR concentrations in high-dose groups suggest ChP dysfunction. We further revealed that earlier in utero high-dose ICV AAV2/5 injections at E13.5 induced even more severe ventriculomegaly and that adult animals were also susceptible to ventriculomegaly after high-dose AAV ICV delivery. Taken together, our data emphasize critical safety considerations of CSF-based AAV delivery, particularly during brain development. Further, these results call for an optimized dosage for perinatal ICV AAV applications.

">Volume Electron Microscopy of Cortical Organoids: Methods for Region Identification, Connectome Reconstruction, and Organelle Segmentation</a></h4>

              
                Volume electron microscopy (vEM) has become a powerful tool for 3D ultrastructural analysis of neural circuits, yet its application to human brain organoids remains limited, particularly for connectomic studies. Here, we established a comprehensive and scalable workflow for applying vEM to human cortical organoids, integrating correlative light and electron microscopy, large-area SEM mosaic imaging, focused ion beam-scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) validation. By systematically comparing two embedding protocols in use, we demonstrated that the DeFelipe and Fairen (1993)/Cano-Astorga et al. (2024) method provides optimal compatibility with toluidine blue-stained semithin sectioning and enables reliable synapse segmentation and neurite tracing. In contrast, the Deerinck et al. (2010) protocol offers enhanced membrane contrast but limits postsynaptic density visualization. Using FIB-SEM imaging of peripheral, neuropil-like regions of cortical organoids, we achieved accurate 3D reconstruction of synapses, neurites and intracellular organelles, enabling quantitative assessment of synaptic apposition surfaces, neurite trajectories, and organelle distribution across defined cellular compartments. Together, our results demonstrate for the first time the feasibility of micro-connectomic reconstruction in human cortical organoids at nanometer resolution. This methodological framework expands the applicability of vEM to organoid systems and provides a robust foundation for future studies of human brain development, disease modeling, and therapeutic evaluation at the synaptic and subcellular level.

">Distinct neural processing of real versus unreal optic flow in the human brain</a></h4>

              
                Visual perception of self-movement relies on optic flow, a global motion pattern generated by self-movement in a rigid 3D environment. Such optic flow conveys both 2D features (e.g., radial velocity fields and centers of motion) and 3D structural information (e.g., motion perspective). However, many previous neuroimaging studies have used simplified 2D radial motion as "real" optic flow, leaving it unclear whether such "unreal" stimuli adequately capture how the brain processes ecologically valid self-movement information. Previous behavioral work has shown that sensitivity to expansion and contraction reverses depending on whether optic flow is ecologically valid (L. Li et al., 2025), raising the question of how such differences are represented in the human brain. We conducted two functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments to systematically compare cortical processing of real versus unreal optic flow. The two stimulus types were strictly matched in 2D global features and local motion signals, differing only in whether they preserved 3D structure consistent with self-movement. To minimize task-related influences, participants performed a task-irrelevant fixation point color-change detection task during scanning. Experiment 1 used a block design in which participants viewed expanding and contracting optic flow at different motion coherence levels. Experiment 2 presented real and unreal optic flow within the same scanning session to directly test neural sensitivity to ecological validity. Multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA) revealed that, among multiple visual and optic flow-responsive regions, the human dorsal medial superior temporal area (MST) exhibited robust and consistent sensitivity to the ecological validity of optic flow. Specifically, under real optic flow, decoding accuracy for motion coherence in MST was significantly higher for expansion than for contraction, whereas this preference was reversed under unreal optic flow. Neural threshold estimates derived from fMR-metric functions further supported this pattern reversal, indicating systematic modulation of MST sensitivity by ecological structure. Experiment 2 further demonstrated that, regardless of motion pattern, MST reliably distinguished real from unreal optic flow, with decoding accuracy increasing as motion coherence increased. These findings indicate that MST encodes not only motion patterns themselves but also whether optic flow conforms to the ecological structure of self-movement. Together, these results indicate that MST responses are not determined solely by 2D radial motion features, but are modulated by whether optic flow preserves 3D structure consistent with self-movement. This work clarifies a long-standing conflation between simplified radial motion and real optic flow and highlights the importance of ecological structure in shaping dorsal-stream motion representations related to self-movement perception.

">Fast and slow architectures of cortical dynamics in human brain</a></h4>

              
                The most critical attribute of the brain is its ability to coordinate perception, thoughts, and action across different timescales. A prominent theory holds that the cortex is organized along a unidimensional hierarchy, where higher-order regions operate over longer intrinsic timescales than sensory areas, a view inferred from analytical methods that assume a single, dominant timescale per region. However, whether cortical dynamics are governed by such a singular hierarchy, or instead by multiple concurrent timescales, has remained unclear due to this fundamental methodological constraint. Here, developing an assumption-free spectral analysis of human intracranial recordings, we discover a fundamental dissociation: cortical dynamics are organized into a fast spectral component (~10-100 Hz) and a slow component (<~1-10 Hz). Crucially, only the fast component spatially recapitulates the classic sensory-to-transmodal functional gradient, whereas the slow component lacks gradient and is coupled to cardiac-related neural activity. This dual-timescale architecture, stable across distinct conscious states, demonstrates human cortical dynamics are organized into parallel processing channels, not a single temporal hierarchy. This framework provides a new foundation for understanding dynamical subsystems that link to brain physiology and cognition.

">Ciliary sensing in tanycytes couples nutrient availability to metabolic regulation</a></h4>

              
                Body homeostasis relies on accurate communication between the brain and the periphery. Disruption of this communication can contribute to disease. Tanycytes are located at the interface of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), bloodstream, and hypothalamus, where they sense circulating nutrients and regulate neuroendocrine axes and metabolism. However, the mechanisms by which they sense CSF signals remain largely unclear. Recent evidence that tanycytes possess primary cilia -- key sensory organelles -- led us to hypothesize that tanycytic cilia function as sensory antennae that detect metabolic cues in the CSF. Here, we demonstrate that tanycytic cilia exhibit distinct morphologies across subtypes and physiological states. They respond dynamically to hormonal and nutrient availability; notably, excess oleic acid shortens cilia, promotes lipid droplet accumulation, and reduces Ca2+ responses to ATP and glucose. Disrupting cilia via knockdown of intraflagellar transport (IFT) genes produced similar defects and impaired autophagy. Finally, selective Ift88 knockout in tanycytes increased body weight and reduced thermogenic activity in female mice. These findings identify tanycytic cilia as key sensors regulating energy balance.

">Discovery of Abundant Nano-scale Lymphatic-like Vessels in Brains</a></h4>

              
                As one of the most metabolically active organs, the high metabolic demands of the brain require a highly efficient system for waste clearance. However, it remains unclear whether the brain possesses such an efficient system, and if so, what are the features of the system. Over a decade ago, a glymphatic system was proposed to describe neurofluid transport through cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and perivascular spaces (PVS), complemented by dural and meningeal lymphatic pathways. Nonetheless, it is still elusive whether transport within the CSF and PVS occurs as a structured form of flow. Moreover, unlike the abundance of blood capillaries in the brain, only a low density of lymphatic vessels has been observed. Such a low density of lymphatic vessels is unlikely to support the level of efficiency required for effective metabolic waste clearance in the brain. By combining expansion microscopic imaging with CRANAD-3, a pan-beta-amyloid fluorescence probe, we discovered abundant nano-scale lymphatic-like vessels (NLVs) in the brain parenchyma of both mouse and human. The majority of these vessels have diameters less than 1000 nanometers and show moderate positivity for several lymphatic biomarkers, including LYVE-1, Prox-1, PDPN, and VEGFR3. The NLVs coil around blood vessels and possible connections between blood vessels were observed. Notably, we also found that some NLVs travel through several layers in the cortex and display distinct orientation patterns in different cortical layers. Our discovery reveals a previously hidden vascular system, and raises the possibility that such an abundant and structured web of tubular structures could enable highly efficient means to enhance waste clearance, and could thus play a crucial role in supporting the high metabolic demands of brains.

">Memory schema reorganization induced by the deliberate processing in the executive network supported by widespread amplified activity</a></h4>

              
                Schema accommodation is the reorganization of a preexisting memory schema to deeply accept new information incongruent with it. Although it is crucial for flexible intelligence, it occurs infrequently, making its neural basis difficult to study. To overcome this, we conducted an fMRI experiment using a newly developed experimental paradigm, the reversal description task. The results suggest that the schema changes that occurred during the task were global reorganizations rather than local adjustments. Moreover, the executive network responsible for deliberate processing played a central role, with the support of widespread amplified activity. Furthermore, reinforcement learning-based control implemented in these neural substrates, in cooperation with the caudate nucleus, emerged as a candidate mechanism for the deliberative schema update. These findings indicate that memory reorganization involves not only automatic but also deliberate processes, in which the desired global structure is explored through the control operation performed by these neural bases.

">Expression of the human immunomodulatory protein, human B7-1 (CD80), accelerates neuroinflammation, synaptic loss, microvascular instability and lethality in a murine model of Alzheimers Disease</a></h4>

              
                Immune-mediated inflammatory processes play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimers disease (AD). However, immune loci exhibit significant sequence diversity, with human proteins sharing only 45% to 70% identity with their murine orthologs. This divergence contributes to the inability of many established mouse models to accurately capture key neuroinflammatory mechanisms relevant to human AD. We recently identified that the human, but not murine, immunomodulatory protein B71 (CD80) activates the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75), a function arising from evolutionary divergence in human B71. This discovery provides an opportunity to directly interrogate the role of this interaction in disease progression using a well-characterized murine model of mutant A{beta} overexpression (CRND8). We generated a mouse line in which murine B71 was replaced with a chimeric human:murine B71 that retains normal interactions with CTLA-4 and CD28, while gaining the ability to bind p75, and evaluated its effects in CRND8 mice. Expression of human:murine B71 in vivo resulted in increased lethality, accelerated neuroinflammation of resident glia, more rapid synaptic and dendritic loss, and enhanced microvascular compromise in the subiculum compared to CRND8 mice expressing murine B71. Together, these findings identify the human B71:p75 interaction as a previously unrecognized contributor to AD pathogenesis and a potential therapeutic target in a brain region critical for learning and memory that is affected in early stages of disease.

">Aberrant medial entorhinal cortex dynamics link tau pathology to spatial memory impairment</a></h4>

              
                Early Alzheimer's disease (AD) manifests spatial memory impairment and tau accumulation in the entorhinal cortex (EC). However, how EC neural activity contributes to memory deficits in tauopathy remains unclear. Here, we combined in vivo two-photon calcium imaging with virtual reality to examine medial EC (MEC) activity in PS19 tauopathy mice during 10 days of spatial learning. PS19 males exhibited pronounced learning deficits and their MEC neurons showed impaired speed modulation, unstable spatial encoding, and weakened representations in cue-poor relative to cue-rich regions, suggesting disrupted path integration. These deficits were most prominent in pyramidal cells, which accumulated higher levels of phosphorylated tau than stellate cells, particularly in males. Notably, MEC activity robustly predicted learning performance, especially via non-grid and pyramidal cells, and distinguished PS19 from wild-type mice. Together, these findings identify MEC dysfunction as a key neural correlate of spatial memory decline in AD-related tauopathy, with potential diagnostic and therapeutic implications.

">Postmortem brain MRI reveals differential associations of subcortical and limbic volumes with cortical thinning and neuropathology patterns</a></h4>

              
                The impact of different neuropathologies on deep brain structures remains to be understood. In this study, we investigate subcortical and limbic volumetry in neurodegenerative diseases involving concomitant co-pathologies (p-tau, alpha-synuclein and TDP-43). We acquired neuropathological measures and brain segmentations from ex vivo postmortem analysis of 132 donors with Alzheimer disease (AD; n=60), Lewy body disease (LBD; n=26), Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration with TDP-43 (FTLD-TDP; n=21) and FTLD-Tau (n=25). Compared with AD and LBD, individuals with FTLD-TDP and FTLD-Tau exhibited significantly reduced thalamic and striatal volumes. Disease-specific cortico-subcortical and cortico-limbic associations were observed: AD showed widespread cortico-subcortical and cortico-limbic morphometric associations, whereas LBD demonstrated more restricted parieto-occipital cortical-limbic associations. FTLD-TDP was characterized by predominant cortico-subcortical associations, while FTLD-Tau showed stronger cortico-limbic coupling. Pathology/structure analyses revealed that in AD and FTLD-Tau, hippocampal volume was associated with p-tau burden, neuronal loss, and gliosis. In LBD, thalamic alpha-synuclein severity was associated with both subcortical and limbic volumes, whereas no significant volumetric associations with TDP-43 burden were detected in FTLD-TDP. Together, these findings demonstrate distinct structure-structure and structure-pathology relationships across neurodegenerative diseases and highlight the value of ex vivo postmortem neuroimaging for disentangling disease-specific patterns of deep brain vulnerability.

">Rescuing Neurodevelopmental Deficits in AMPA Receptor Gain-of-Function Mutant</a></h4>

              
                AMPA receptors (AMPARs) mediate fast excitatory synaptic transmission and are essential for neuronal development and brain function. We investigated the role of a recurrent variant in the AMPAR GluA1 subunit (GRIA1 p.A636T) identified in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and intellectual disability (ID). To test causality and mechanism, we generated a Gria1-A636T knock-in mouse model. Mutant mice exhibited core ASD/ID-like behaviors and a selective hippocampal vulnerability characterized by progressive dendritic atrophy and neuronal loss. Despite reduced GluA1-containing complexes, AMPARs displayed synaptic hyperexcitability and failed to undergo the normal postnatal transition to calcium-impermeable AMPARs, resulting in persistent excitotoxicity. To explore therapeutic intervention, we designed an allele-specific antisense oligonucleotide to specifically silence the mutant transcript. A single neonatal administration of the antisense oligonucleotide entirely prevented hippocampal pathology and ameliorated behavioral deficits. These findings establish GRIA1-A636T as a gain-of-function mutation that drives developmental excitotoxicity and highlight the potential of RNA-targeted precision medicine for neurodevelopmental disorders.

">Symmetry constraints on feedback-driven orientation tuning dynamics in translation-invariant models of primate V1</a></h4>

              
                Orientation selectivity in primate V1 is shaped by feedforward drive, intracortical recurrence, and corticocortical feedback. Yet a basic conceptual question remains: what aspects of orientation tuning can (or cannot) be altered by a recurrent/feedback loop that is rotationally symmetric in cortical space? We develop a minimal translation-invariant linear field model in which stimulus drive and recurrent interactions are analyzed in the spatial Fourier domain (k,{phi}). Our central analytic result is an exact symmetry constraint: for any temporally filtered but isotropic recurrent coupling W0(k,{omega}), the response at fixed (k,{omega}) is multiplied by an angle-independent complex gain. Consequently, any normalized orientation metric computed at fixed k--including circular variance, orientation selectivity index (OSI), and bandwidth--is invariant under isotropic recurrence. Isotropic recurrence can nevertheless rescale gain and select a spatial band through its k-dependence. We then show that adding a weak anisotropic component, especially when endowed with a slower timescale than a fast isotropic pathway, produces delayed sharpening and modest preferred-angle drifts. A perturbative calculation predicts linear scaling of tuning changes with anisotropy strength, and a simple phasor-sum formula explains {phi}*(t) drift when feedforward and feedback anisotropies compete. We provide stability criteria for the temporally filtered (auxiliary-variable) implementation and verify them numerically. Finally, we identify concrete regimes in which isotropic recurrence can alter measured tuning in practice, including finite-k readouts with k-dependent feedforward anisotropy and nonlinear (tuned) divisive-normalization readouts. Together these results sharpen a null hypothesis for perturbation experiments and delineate the minimal feature-specific ingredients required to explain dynamic tuning in macaque V1.

">Cortical potentials evoked by stimulation of cervical vagus vs. auricular nerve: a comparative, parametric study in nonhuman primates</a></h4>

              
                Stimulation of sensory vagal pathways is typically delivered via invasive, cervical vagus nerve stimulation (cVNS) or noninvasive, trans-auricular nerve stimulation (taNS). While both methods are investigated therapeutically, their effects on brain physiology remain poorly understood, hindering mechanistic understanding and stimulus optimization. In 6 awake nonhuman primates, we recorded cortical vagal-evoked potentials (VEPs) from subdural electrodes placed in prefrontal, sensorimotor and parietal cortical areas, in response to cVNS or taNS. Across 478 different taNS and cVNS protocols, we varied stimulation side, intensity, frequency, pulse count, and pulse width (PW) and assessed independent effects on amplitude and latency of early (EC; 30-100 ms), intermediate (IC; 101-200 ms) and late components (LC; 201-500 ms) of VEPs. Fixed and random effects of stimulation parameters and subjects, respectively, on VEP measurements, were assessed using a linear mixed-effects model. Overall, cVNS elicits more robust VEPs than taNS, with larger EC, IC and LC amplitudes in both hemispheres. cVNS-elicited ECs and LCs are largest in PFC and PC areas, whereas ICs are largest in SM areas. On the other hand, taNS generally does not elicit area-specific responses. cVNS-elicited ECs have slower latency than ta-NS elicited ECs. Higher stimulation frequencies and intensities and a longer pulse width elicit larger ECs and ICs for cVNS, and to some extent for taNS. Both short and long cVNS trains elicit stronger ECs, and long trains elicit slower ICs. Earlobe stimulation elicits VEPs that partially overlap with those from taNS. In conclusion, cVNS and taNS elicit cortical VEPs in a manner consistent with distinct engagement of ascending vagal pathways, and with similarities and differences in the effects of stimulation parameters on evoked responses.

">STAT1-Mediated Regulation of IL-17A/CEBPB/NF-κB Axisin HIV-1 Infected Human Cerebral Organoids RevealsTherapeutic Targets for Neuroprotection</a></h4>

              
                HIV-associated neurological complications remain a major concern in people living with HIV (PLWH), even under effective viral suppression with combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), underscoring unresolved mechanisms driving HIV-related neurodegeneration. To address this gap, we used HIV-1-infected human cerebral organoids (hCOs) containing microglia as a physiologically relevant three-dimensional model of the central nervous system (CNS) and validated key findings in simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-infected, cART-treated rhesus macaque model. Integrating single-nucleus RNA sequencing with ATAC sequencing, we identified cell-type-specific alterations in dual innate immune-driven inflammatory signaling pathways across neural and glial populations. Microglia were preferentially infected and activated, initiating IL-17A-mediated cascades involving IFN{gamma}, STAT1, CEBPB, and NFkB pathways, which converged with cGAS-STING and Notch-NEURL1 signaling, both associated with neuroinflammation and synaptic dysfunction. cART suppressed viral replication, reduced IL-17A-driven neuroinflammation, improved mitochondrial function, and restored synaptic gene expression. Collectively, these findings identify IL-17A, STAT1, CEBPB, and cGAS-STING as key molecular drivers of HIV-associated neuroinflammation and establish a novel mechanistic link between IL-17A signaling and microglial remodeling, providing a translational framework for the development of CNS-targeted therapies in PLWH.

">Friendship modulates physical effort and neural dynamics during group coordination in shared social networks</a></h4>

              
                Human social interactions are embedded within social networks, yet it remains unclear how existing interpersonal relationships influence the behavioural and neural dynamics of collective action. Here, we combined social network mapping with three-person EEG hyperscanning to investigate how friendships in shared networks modulate interpersonal coordination. We mapped social networks across seven undergraduate cohorts (N = 378) and recruited a subset of participants (N = 93) that consisted of triads of two mutually close friends and one non-friend from the same network. Triads performed a novel joint motor task in which participants produced forces towards a collective target. Non-friends consistently produced greater and more vigorous force than friends during joint action. This effect was strongest for non-friends embedded in smaller social networks. At the neural level, non-friends exhibited stronger alpha- and beta-band event-related desynchronization, higher inter-subject correlation, and increased inter-brain group phase synchrony. These neural signatures are consistent with increased action preparation, prediction, and attentional engagement during coordination. Taken together, these findings indicate that friendship and social network context are reflected in how individuals allocate physical effort and engage during collective action, and suggest that non-friends work harder and allocate more attention during joint tasks to compensate for the disparity in social standing. By linking real-world social relationships to behavioural and multi-brain neural dynamics, this work demonstrates that relational context is embodied in the mechanisms supporting human group coordination.

">Kinematic fields of the visuo-hippocampal circuit</a></h4>

              
                The structure of focused receptive fields in retinotopic and allocentric space in the visual cortex and hippocampus is studied extensively to understand cognitive functions such as stimulus tracking and path-integration, respectively. These functions require accurate tracking of running speed and acceleration. While speed dependence in these areas is well-studied, acceleration-dependence has received little attention, and the joint effect of speed-acceleration is unknown. Hence, we assessed the joint influence of these kinematic variables by computing receptive fields in a novel, 2D, phase space of speed-acceleration using the Allen Brain Visual Observatory data. Head-fixed mice ran spontaneously on a running wheel next to a monocular gray screen ensuring virtually no changes in the retinotopic or allocentric space. Remarkably, about half (44.3%, 6590/14862) of neurons in the visuo-hippocampal circuit (from LGN to subiculum) were significantly modulated by a specific combination of speed and acceleration to form receptive fields in the speed-acceleration phase space (called kinematic space). The prevalence of kinematic tuning is comparable to the fraction of place cells in the mouse hippocampus, and the fraction of visually tuned neurons in higher visual areas. The kinematic field size (~30% of the sampled space) was also comparable to the place field size. Kinematic fields spanned the entire space but preferred either low-speed, high-acceleration or the high-speed, low-acceleration segments. Although pupil size too varied spontaneously, the kinematic tuning exceeded pupil size tuning in all brain areas. Surprisingly, pupil size modulated the activity of ~20% of hippocampal neurons, which was comparable to that in LGN and visual cortical areas. Thus, all visuo-hippocampal areas have focused kinematic fields that are three times more prevalent than the pupil size fields in the absence of any vestibular, visual or spatial stimuli. This kinematic phase space could interface with retinotopic and allocentric spaces to guide natural behaviors involving movement.

                Myelination in the postnatal cortex requires epigenetic programs that activate oligodendrocyte gene networks. Here we show that the histone H3K27me3 demethylase KDM6B promotes this process in vivo. Conditional Kdm6b deletion (Kdm6b-cKO) in Emx1 dorsal telencephalic progenitors caused delayed cortical myelination. Lineage-specific RNA-seq revealed that the oligodendrocyte master regulator Sox10 was significantly reduced, as well as myelination effectors, indicating impaired oligodendrocyte maturation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays of the same lineage showed increased H3K27me3 at promoter-proximal regions of Sox10, consistent with loss of KDM6B-mediated de-repression. Temporally controlled Sox10 induction partially rescued myelination in Kdm6b-cKO mice. These findings define a KDM6B[-&gt;]SOX10 axis that licenses oligodendrocyte development and cortical myelination by removing repressive H3K27me3 and sustaining active chromatin, with implications for KDM6B-related neurodevelopmental disorders.

">Retrograde viral delivery of hyper-IL-6 activates Stat3 in corticospinal tract neurons but causes severe tremors and weight loss in adult mice</a></h4>

              
                Cytokines in the IL-6 family can improve axon regeneration after nervous system injury, acting in part by stimulating Stat3 phosphorylation and pro-regenerative signaling in injured neurons. Hyper-IL-6 (hIL-6) is an engineered ligand with enhanced signaling properties, shown previously to stimulate axon growth even more effectively than native IL-6 family members. Here we tested a method of hIL-6 delivery based on injection of retrograde AAV to the cervical spinal cord of adult mice. This was envisioned as a first step toward a regenerative treatment after spinal cord injury based on widespread stimulation of descending projection neurons. We found, however, that animals treated with AAV2-retro-hIL-6 developed severe tremors and weight loss within days of injection and reached criteria for humane euthanasia within five to eleven days, depending on viral dose. Examination of the cortex showed a pronounced increase in Stat3 phosphorylation in corticospinal tract (CST) neurons in hIL-6 animals versus control, confirming effective retrograde signaling. Stat3 phosphorylation and evidence of microglial activation were detected in tissue surrounding CST cell bodies and along descending CST axons, revealing extensive cytokine signaling and microglial response associated with secreted hIL-6. These results confirm the ability of hIL-6 expression to activate Stat3 signaling in CST neurons but uncover the potential for severe negative effects that must inform any further development of hIL-6 as a pro-regenerative therapeutic.

">Ultrastructural changes at auditory nerve synapses following moderate noise exposure</a></h4>

              
                Moderate noise exposure is a common experience, yet its impact on central auditory synapses remains poorly understood. We study this issue at the first synapses in the central auditory pathway formed by auditory nerve afferents onto bushy cells in the cochlear nucleus, called endbulbs of Held. Non-traumatic noise exposure alters endbulb properties, decreasing the probability of vesicle release and enlarging the pool of releasable vesicles as assessed using electrophysiological methods and immunolabelling. These changes appear homeostatic, to maintain synaptic efficacy during periods of high activity. To identify structural changes underlying the larger vesicle pool, we used serial blockface electron microscopy of endbulbs from control and noise-exposed mice to quantitatively assess synaptic morphology. We observed no differences in the juxtapositional area between endbulbs and bushy cells, nor in the number or density of active zones and postsynaptic densities. Images of endbulb terminals were significantly darker after noise exposure, indicating an increase in the density of synaptic vesicles. These results suggest that moderate noise exposure induces an activity-dependent increase in presynaptic vesicle numbers, consistent with the observed physiological changes in neurotransmitter release. This work sets the stage for high-resolution studies to quantify docked and reserve vesicles.

                Brain barriers, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) dynamics, and peripheral factors are implicated as significant contributors to Alzheimer's disease (AD). The choroid plexus (ChP) is a blood-brain interface that produces CSF and forms the blood-CSF barrier. However, how ChP pathology develops across the lifespan and contributes to AD has not been systematically characterized. Here, we report a multi-modal ChP atlas integrating single-nucleus transcriptomics from 49 individuals, AI-assisted quantitative histopathology across >500 postmortem samples age 16 to 105, spatial transcriptomics, and functional studies in 5xFAD mice. We identify fibrosis, calcification, and macrophage abnormalities as hallmarks of ChP aging, with AD pathology conferring additional effects, including expansion of a pro-inflammatory fibroblast-macrophage signaling niche. In 5xFAD mice, macrophage dysfunction is associated with impaired epithelial barrier maintenance and repair. Together, these data provide a foundational resource for understanding ChP dysfunction in aging and AD and propose the macrophage-fibroblast-epithelial barrier axis as a driver of ChP pathology.

">Cell-type-specific adaptations to mitochondrial stress underly the neurological presentations of 	MTRFR mutations</a></h4>

              
                Mitochondrial diseases are a group of heterogeneous genetic disorders that exhibit striking tissue specificity. Neurological involvement is among the most consistent features, yet the mechanisms that determine why selective neuronal populations are particularly vulnerable to mitochondrial dysfunction remain poorly understood. Mutations in MTRFR, a mitochondrial ribosome rescue factor, cause a progressive neuromuscular phenotype, but no relevant disease model exists to explain its cell-type-specific pathology. Here, we established the first human iPSC-derived neuronal model of MTRFR loss and identified mechanisms driving differential vulnerability between cortical and motor neurons. Although knockdown led to comparable deficits in mitochondrial translation and OXPHOS across both subtypes, cortical neurons engaged adaptive programs, including dendritic mitochondrial remodeling and heat-shock response activation, that preserved survival. Motor neurons failed to mount these responses and instead displayed apoptotic and inflammatory priming. Pharmacological enhancement of stress adaptation rescued motor neuron survival, indicating that resilience is programmable. These findings provide the first mechanistic evidence that neuronal susceptibility to mitochondrial translation defects is defined by the capacity to activate mitochondrial and cytoprotective stress-response pathways.

">Tbx1 heterozygosity in the oligodendrocyte lineage has distinct effects on myelinated axons in the fimbria and on behaviors related to neurodevelopmental disorders in mice.</a></h4>

              
                The hemizygous deletion of human chromosome 22q11.2 leads to cognitive and social deficits, as well as psychiatric disorders. Constitutive deletion of Tbx1, a T-box transcription factor gene encoded within this chromosomal region, results in deficits in various cognitive and social behaviors and altered formation of oligodendrocytes, myelin, and myelinated axons in the fimbria of adult mice. Given that Tbx1 is present in neonatal stem cells and oligodendrocytes, the present study was designed to test the hypothesis that Tbx1 heterozygosity in the oligodendrocyte lineage contributes to behavioral phenotypes relevant to neurodevelopmental disorders and ultrastructural changes in myelinated axons in the fimbria. To this end, we conditionally induced Tbx1 heterozygosity in the oligodendrocyte lineage in PdgfrCre;Tbx1+/flox mice. This mouse line showed recombination in brain regions known to express Pdgfra. Male Pdgfra;Cre;Tbx1+/flox mice performed better in spontaneous alternation in a T-maze than wild-type littermates at 1, but not 2 months of age; otherwise, mutant and wild-type littermates were indistinguishable in neonatal ultrasonic vocalization, peripubertal and postpubertal social interaction, novel object approach, anxiety-related behaviors in an elevated plus maze, and motor activity and thigmotaxis in an inescapable open field. The fimbria of male Pdgfra;Cre;Tbx1+/flox mice showed an increase in the number of myelinated axons in a range between 300 nm and 800 nm diameter and a decrease in the myelinated axons around 1,200 nm and 1,400 nm; the thickness of myelin was unchanged across all diameters. Our findings show that Tbx1 heterozygosity in oligodendrocyte precursor cells or their progeny selectively improves spontaneous alternation and shifts the proportion of myelinated axons toward small- to medium-sized axons, suggesting that the compositional shift in axons in the fimbria induced by Tbx1 heterozygosity in the oligodendrocyte lineage might underlie improved cognition relevant to neurodevelopmental disorders.

                <p>Recent work showed unexpectedly large, daily modulation of intracellular chloride concentration ([Cl<sup>&ndash;</sup>]<SUB>in</SUB>) in cortical pyramidal cells, with consequences for GABAergic function and network excitability (  <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B5">Alfonsa et al., 2023</cross-ref>;   <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B42">Pracucci et al., 2023</cross-ref>). One explanation for this [Cl<sup>&ndash;</sup>]<SUB>in</SUB> modulation is that it arises from variation in presynaptic drive. In that case, neuronal classes with similar synaptic inputs should show correlated changes in activity-dependent ionic redistribution. To examine this prediction, we performed in vivo, LSSm-ClopHensor imaging to measure [Cl<sup>&ndash;</sup>]<SUB>in</SUB> and pH<SUB>in</SUB> in populations of parvalbumin- (PV) and somatostatin (SST)-expressing interneurons in neocortical Layer 2/3 of male and female adult mice. Imaging was performed at zeitgeber time (ZT)5 and ZT17, when pyramidal cell [Cl<sup>&ndash;</sup>]<SUB>in</SUB> shows maximal divergence (  <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B42">Pracucci et al., 2023</cross-ref>). Interestingly, PV interneurons also showed large physiological [Cl<sup>&ndash;</sup>]<SUB>in</SUB> modulation between these times but out-of-phase with that in pyramidal cells, being raised at ZT5 and lower at ZT17, and with a far higher mean [Cl<sup>&ndash;</sup>]<SUB>in</SUB>. SST interneurons showed less modulation, with higher variance, and with a temporal dynamic resembling the pyramidal cell pattern. Notably, in vitro experimental assays of inhibition, involving these two classes of interneuron, differed markedly at ZT5 and ZT17. The persistence of these time-of-day effects in vitro and the difference in [Cl<sup>&ndash;</sup>]<SUB>in</SUB> dynamics between pyramidal cells and PV interneurons in vivo both point toward cell-intrinsic regulation being more important than activity-dependent effects in setting these slow, daily, physiological, ionic redistribution patterns. We discuss what other possible factors may influence variations in brain state through the day.</p>

                Background The convergence of highly effective prophylactic HPV vaccination and sensitive HPV-based screening technologies presents a historic opportunity to eliminate cervical cancer and reduce other HPV-related malignancies. Despite the availability of these tools, systemic inequities in access and implementation remain the principal barrier to achieving global elimination targets. Objective This policy brief synthesizes the latest evidence to provide an evidence-based, context-sensitive roadmap for policymakers to overcome health systems, economic, and political barriers, guiding the equitable elimination of HPV-related cancers by 2035. Key Recommendations Robust evidence confirms the high efficacy of HPV vaccination, including the transformative potential of single-dose schedules for improving equity and scalability. Primary HPV screening, particularly when coupled with self-sampling, offers superior protection and increases uptake. Success hinges on addressing critical implementation challenges. The brief outlines a comprehensive framework emphasizing: the adoption of gender-neutral and single-dose vaccination; integration of self-sampling and digital health tools; proactive interventions for marginalized groups; development of national investment cases; and the use of multi-sectoral task forces and community engagement to mitigate socio-cultural barriers. A phased three-year operational roadmap is proposed. Conclusion The elimination of HPV-related cancers is an achievable goal. This brief provides a strategic, evidence-informed pathway for policymakers to translate scientific progress into lasting population health impact through deliberate political commitment, financial investment, and health system reforms focused on equity.

                <p>by Kabir V. Dabholkar, Omri Barak</p>

Latent variable models serve as powerful tools to infer underlying dynamics from observed neural activity. Ideally, the inferred dynamics should align with true ones. However, due to the absence of ground truth data, prediction benchmarks are often employed as proxies. One widely-used method, <i>co-smoothing</i>, involves jointly estimating latent variables and predicting observations along held-out channels to assess model performance. In this study, we reveal the limitations of the co-smoothing prediction framework and propose a remedy. Using a student-teacher setup, we demonstrate that models with high co-smoothing can have arbitrary extraneous dynamics in their latent representations. To address this, we introduce a secondary metric—<i>few-shot co-smoothing</i>, performing regression from the latent variables to held-out neurons in the data using fewer trials. Our results indicate that among models with near-optimal co-smoothing, those with extraneous dynamics underperform in the few-shot co-smoothing compared to ‘minimal’ models that are devoid of such dynamics. We provide analytical insights into the origin of this phenomenon and further validate our findings on four standard neural datasets using a state-of-the-art method: STNDT. In the absence of ground truth, we suggest a novel measure to validate our approach. By cross-decoding the latent variables of all model pairs with high co-smoothing, we identify models with minimal extraneous dynamics. We find a correlation between few-shot co-smoothing performance and this new measure. In summary, we present a novel prediction metric designed to yield latent variables that more accurately reflect the ground truth, offering a significant improvement for latent dynamics inference.

                Background The gallbladder plays an essential role in lipid homeostasis through bile storage and regulated release. Gallstone disease is frequently associated with dyslipidemia, and cholecystectomy is one of the most common abdominal surgeries worldwide. However, its influence on serum lipid metabolism remains incompletely understood. Objective To evaluate changes in serum lipid profiles six months after cholecystectomy and assess whether the procedure contributes to improvement of dyslipidemia. Methods A prospective cohort study was conducted on 40 adult patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy for symptomatic gallstone disease between August 2024 and March 2025. Fasting lipid profiles—including LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, total cholesterol, and VLDL—were measured preoperatively and at 6-month follow-up. The Atherogenic Index of Plasma (AIP) and total cholesterol/HDL ratio were calculated. Statistical analysis was performed using paired tests with significance set at p < 0.05. Results Significant reductions were observed in total cholesterol (206.0 ± 37.1 to 194.8 ± 33.7 mg/dL, p = 0.003), LDL-cholesterol (128.7 ± 34.3 to 122.9 ± 31.6 mg/dL, p = 0.002), VLDL (25.2 ± 7.7 to 23.6 ± 7.8 mg/dL, p = 0.031), and the total cholesterol/HDL ratio (p = 0.004). HDL and triglyceride levels showed no significant change. AIP remained stable. Improvements were statistically significant but modest in magnitude. Conclusions Cholecystectomy was associated with small but significant reductions in total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol six months postoperatively. Although the procedure is not a treatment for dyslipidemia, these findings suggest no adverse impact on lipid metabolism, and possibly a slight beneficial effect.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that minimally invasive surgery (MIS), an emerging surgical treatment for spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH), is associated with better clinical outcomes than open craniotomy with clot evacuation, in a large, nationwide US cohort.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed a retrospective cohort study that included patients with sICH included in the American Heart Association Get With The Guidelines-Stroke registry between January 1, 2011, and December 31, 2021. We excluded patients with a diagnosis of ischemic stroke, subarachnoid hemorrhage, or subdural hemorrhage, and patients transferred to another hospital. The exposure was the type of surgery, classified as either open craniotomy with clot evacuation or MIS (composite of endoscopic evacuation or stereotactic evacuation with fibrinolytic therapy). The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes at discharge included disposition, ambulatory status, and modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score. After overlap-weighted propensity score matching, multiple logistic regression was used to study the association between the type of surgery and outcomes.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Among 564,265 patients with sICH, 7,770 underwent surgical intervention. MIS was performed in 703 patients and open craniotomy was performed in 7,067 patients. In regression analyses, MIS was associated with lower odds of in-hospital mortality (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 0.7, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.5–0.9), unfavorable discharge (aOR = 0.7, 95% CI = 0.6–0.9), and higher odds of discharge to rehabilitation (aOR = 1.3, 95% CI = 1.1–1.5), but not with functional outcomes.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In this large, representative US cohort of patients with sICH, MIS was associated with reduced in-hospital mortality and better discharge disposition compared to conventional open craniotomy with clot evacuation. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                Background Digital transformation has emerged as a key driver of competitiveness across industries, yet its adoption in the upcycling craft sector remains insufficiently explored. Existing studies often focus on large enterprises, leaving a research gap in understanding how micro-scale, resource-constrained upcycling businesses integrate digital technologies, specifically in creative industry. This study addresses this gap by developing the Behavioral-Based Digital Transformation (BBDT) model to investigate behavioral determinants of digital adoption, implementation, and innovation outcomes in Indonesia’s sustainability-oriented creative sector. Method This study employed a sequential exploratory mixed-methods approach. The qualitative phase involved field observations and in-depth interviews with three upcycling craft enterprises, while the quantitative phase surveyed 30 micro-scale upcycling businesses across multiple Indonesian regions. Data were analyzed using thematic coding, NVivo software, and Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) to test the proposed Behavioral-Based Digital Transformation (BBDT) model. Results and Conclusion Findings indicate that internal and external factors, including leadership commitment, financial capability, and market demand, significantly shape attitudes and behavioral intentions toward digital adoption. Behavioral intentions, in turn, drive digital technology implementation, enhancing operational efficiency, material optimization, and product innovation. Digital adoption acts as both an outcome and enabler of sustainable transformation, with innovation reinforcing continued engagement with technology. The study confirms the mediating role of behavioral intention and underscores the critical importance of human and organizational readiness. These insights offer theoretical contributions to TAM, TPB, and IDT integration and practical guidance for policymakers, creative communities, and micro-enterprise owners.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>This 24-month longitudinal study involving isolated rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (iRBD), early-stage Parkinson's disease (PD), and matched healthy control subjects aimed to assess whether acoustic speech features from real-world smartphone calls provide passive progressive biomarkers in synucleinopathies.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Participants underwent clinical assessments at baseline, 1, and 2 years. Speech was continuously captured during phone calls via a standardized smartphone application, segmented, and analyzed for speech impairment severity end points and key acoustic features of monopitch, vowel articulation, voice quality, and articulation rate. We used linear mixed-effect modeling to estimate speech progression and calculated sample size requirements to demonstrate slowing of progression under anticipated treatment effects.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Over 31,000 phone calls (&gt;1,000 hours) were collected from 71 participants including those with iRBD, PD, and healthy controls. Compared with controls, both individuals with iRBD and PD showed significant declines in speech impairment severity end points based on spectral changes and artificial intelligence-based neural embeddings. The subjects with iRBD also exhibited declines in vowel articulation and articulation rate. For a 2-year neuroprotective trial aiming for 50% drug efficacy, the most efficient sample size estimate based on time-to-event analysis was 74 iRBD and 84 PD participants per arm using the neural embedding end point.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The phone call analysis requiring no patient effort or clinical supervision can detect speech decline in prodromal and early synucleinopathies, providing a potential paradigm shift for clinical trial design and neuroprotective intervention end points. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                Financial networks, and neural architectures—generate nonstationary, heavy-tailed, and highly irregular time series that are poorly captured by classical statistical summaries. Conventional performance metrics like mean latency and throughput often fail to reveal early-warning signatures of systemic stress or impending failure. There is a growing need for scale-aware analytical tools that can capture hidden structure in consensus dynamics and network perturbations. We develop an end-to-end statistical framework that treats consensus protocols as high-dimensional discrete-time dynamical systems subject to stochastic latency and failure processes. Using a Python-based discrete-event simulator implementing the Raft consensus algorithm, we generate time series of consensus latency, message complexity, and network latency under multiple operational regimes (normal load, high load, denial-of-service–type attacks, and partial node failures). We then apply Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (MF-DFA) to these time series, deriving generalized Hurst exponents, singularity spectra f(α), and spectrum width Δα as multifractal descriptors. Synthetic results are complemented with an analysis of block chain-style data based on block inter-arrival and propagation times. Across all simulated regimes, consensus latency exhibits nontrivial multifractal structure with finite spectrum width Δα. Stress scenarios driven by heavy-tailed latency and node failures produce substantially broader and more left-skewed spectra than baseline conditions, indicating richer intermittency and clustered extremes. We find a strong positive association between Δα and mean consensus latency, and a moderate association between Δα and failure incidence. Comparative analysis of Raft-like traces and proof-of-work–style traces shows that multifractal spectra retain algorithm-specific signatures while sharing common stress-induced broadening. The findings support the view that multifractal descriptors offer a sensitive, scale-aware complement to traditional performance metrics for distributed consensus systems. Spectrum width Δα acts as a quantitative indicator of systemic complexity and can serve as an early-warning marker for performance degradation and partial instability. The proposed framework bridges chaos theory, multifractal analysis, and consensus protocols and suggests practical pathways for integrating multifractal monitoring into the design, diagnosis, and control of big-data, block chain, and cyber-physical infrastructures.

                Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are critical regulators of chromatin and gene expression, yet their precise molecular mechanisms are often undefined. CHASERR exemplifies this challenge: haploinsufficiency of this locus causes a severe neurodevelopmental syndrome, positioning it as a master epigenetic regulator, but its physical interactors and modes of action remain unknown. Here, we define the CHASERR interactome to uncover its core mechanism. By combining RNA pull-down sequencing with promoter-binding analysis, we demonstrate that CHASERR operates as a dual-function hub. It scaffolds a specific network of non-coding RNAs, including the catalytic RMRP, the responsive lncRNA CRNDE, and multiple microRNA host genes, supporting a role in post-transcriptional regulatory circuits. Simultaneously, CHASERR binds directly to gene promoters, and this binding is functionally linked to transcriptional changes upon its depletion. This integrated mechanism, coordinating direct DNA engagement with RNA-based regulatory networks, establishes CHASERR as a central node that bridges transcriptional and post-transcriptional control. Our work provides the missing physical and mechanistic foundation for its essential role in epigenetic regulation and human disease.

                Background Large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 are increasingly used in scientific writing, yet little is known about how AI-generated scientific titles are perceived by researchers in terms of quality. Objective To compare the perceived accuracy, appeal, and overall preference for AI-generated versus human-written scientific titles. Methods We conducted a blinded comparative study with 21 researchers from diverse academic backgrounds. A random sample of 50 original titles was selected from 10 high-impact general internal medicine journals. For each title, an alternative version was generated using GPT-4.0. Each rater evaluated 50 pairs of titles, each pair consisting of one original and one AI-generated version, without knowing the source of the titles or the purpose of the study. For each pair, raters independently assessed both titles on perceived accuracy and appeal, and indicated their overall preference. We analyzed accuracy/appeal using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests and negative binomial models, preferences using McNemar’s test and mixed-effects logistic regression, and inter-rater agreement with Gwet’s AC. Results AI-generated titles received significantly higher ratings for both perceived accuracy (mean=7.9 vs. 6.7, p-value <0.001) and appeal (mean=7.1 vs. 6.7, p-value <0.001) than human-written titles. The odds of preferring an AI-generated title were 1.7 times higher (p-value =0.001), with 61.8% of 1,049 paired judgments favoring the AI version. Inter-rater agreement was moderate to substantial (Gwet’s AC: 0.54–0.70). Conclusions AI-generated titles can surpass human-written titles in perceived accuracy, appeal, and preference, suggesting that LLMs may enhance the effectiveness of scientific communication. These findings support the responsible integration of AI tools in research.

                This paper introduces a novel non-classical probability distribution, termed the Logistic Map distribution, which is constructed by transforming a polynomial function derived from the second iteration of the logistic map. The logistic map a well-known discrete-time dynamical system has been extensively employed in diverse scientific domains, including population dynamics (to model bounded growth under environmental constraints), physics (to study nonlinear dynamics and deterministic chaos), and economics (to represent complex, nonlinear patterns in financial and economic time series). The proposed distribution is fully characterized by two parameters: a scale parameter and a shape parameter, with the constraint ensuring the non-negativity and integrability of the density. Within this valid parameter space, we rigorously derive and establish a comprehensive suite of statistical properties. These include the probability density function, cumulative distribution function, reliability (survival) function, and hazard (failure rate) function. Furthermore, we obtain analytical expressions for key descriptive measures such as the mode and median, as well as for higher-order characteristics including the moment generating function, factorial moment generating function, and characteristic function. The proposed distribution most closely application field in materials science specifically, the statistical modeling of particle or grain size distributions in industrial powder processing, metallurgy, and pharmaceutical manufacturing. The primary objective of this study is to formalize a new family of probability distributions grounded in the mathematical framework of dynamical systems, specifically leveraging the logistic function commonly encountered in differential and difference equations. By doing so, we bridge concepts from nonlinear dynamics and classical statistical theory. The secondary aim is to conduct a thorough investigation of the distribution’s mathematical structure and statistical behavior, thereby establishing its potential utility for modeling bounded, non-negative random phenomena in applied fields such as reliability engineering, survival analysis, and environmental statistics.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/108922">Evolution of a fuzzy ribonucleoprotein complex in viral assembly</a></h4>

              
                Previously, we showed that the genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein explores a wide range of biophysical properties facilitated by non-local impact of point mutations to its intrinsically disordered regions (Nguyen et al., 2024). This includes modulation of self-association, such as the creation of a de novo binding interface through the P13L mutation characteristic of Omicron variants. In the present work, we focus on the key function of N condensing viral RNA into ribonucleoprotein particles (RNPs) for viral assembly. Lacking high-resolution structural information, biochemical and biophysical approaches have revealed architectural principles of RNPs, which involve cooperative interactions of several protein-protein and protein-RNA interfaces, initiated through oligomerization of conserved transient helices in the central disordered linker of N. Here, we study the impact of defining N-protein mutations in variants of concern on RNP formation, using biophysical tools, a virus-like particle assay, and reverse genetics experiments. We find convergent evolution in repeated, independent introduction of amino acid substitutions strengthening existing binding interfaces, compensating for other substitutions that promote viral replication but decrease RNP stability. Furthermore, we show that the P13L mutation of Omicron variants enhances RNP assembly and increases viral fitness. Overall, our data reveal RNP complexes to be highly variable not only in sequence and conformations but also in thermodynamic and kinetic stability, with its pleomorphism affecting basic architectural principles. We hypothesize that the formation of polydisperse, fuzzy N-RNA clusters with multiple distributed weak binding interfaces optimizes reversible RNA condensation, while supporting host adaptation and allowing for a large sequence space to be explored.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/107096">Epidermal resident memory T cell fitness requires antigen encounter in the skin</a></h4>

              
                CD8<sup>+</sup> tissue-resident memory T cells (T<sub>RM</sub>) develop from effectors that seed peripheral tissues where they persist providing defense against subsequent challenges. T<sub>RM</sub> persistence requires autocrine TGFβ transactivated by integrins expressed on keratinocytes. T<sub>RM</sub> precursors that encounter antigen in the epidermis during development outcompete bystander T<sub>RM</sub> for TGFβ resulting in enhanced persistence. ScRNA-seq analysis of epidermal T<sub>RM</sub> revealed that local antigen experience in the skin resulted in an enhanced differentiation signature in comparison with bystanders. Upon recall, T<sub>RM</sub> displayed greater proliferation dictated by affinity of antigen experienced during epidermal development. Finally, local antigen experienced T<sub>RM</sub> differentially expressed TGFβRIII, which increases avidity of the TGFβRI/II receptor complex for TGFβ. Selective ablation of <i>Tgfbr3</i> reduced local antigen experienced T<sub>RM</sub> capacity to persist, rendering them phenotypically like bystander T<sub>RM</sub>. Thus, antigen-driven TCR signaling in the epidermis during T<sub>RM</sub> differentiation results in a lower TGFβ requirement for persistence and increased proliferative capacity that together enhance epidermal T<sub>RM</sub> fitness.

">Retinal Origins of Circadian Photoregulation's Specialized Dynamic Range and Temporal Integration</a></h4>

              
                The circadian clock allows organisms to anticipate environmental changes that are driven by the earth's rotation, and synchronizes with this cycle using ligh1. The clock extracts relevant parameters of illumination, responding selectively to intensities at twilight and above, and to the number of photons counted over an extended time window2-8. These hallmark properties are thought to manifest in the brain9. Here, we report that they emerge within specific neurons of the eye. These M1 intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) detect light directly, using a receptor called melanopsin, and indirectly, through circuits driven by rod and cone photoreceptors10. We find that the balance of intrinsic and extrinsic drives varies widely across M1s, and the population accounts for the dynamic range of circadian photoregulation. Both singly and collectively, M1s approach the level of temporal integration observed behaviorally. The cellular and behavioral levels match when the pupillary light reflex--another M1-driven function--shapes the light that M1s receive. This work reveals how the first steps of sensory processing are precisely formatted for specific tasks. It also introduces bioluminescence-based methods for identifying photosensitive neurons without desensitization, allowing their mechanistic study under physiological conditions.

">Drinking microstructure analysis of direct controls of water intake in male and female rats.</a></h4>

              
                Measures of rodent drinking (lick) patterns are used to test how various manipulations affect fluid intake. Decades of research indicate that manipulating the satiating potency of a stimulus affects the number of licking bursts whereas manipulating the hedonic value of the solution affects the size of the licking bursts or rate of licking. This type of analysis has been largely applied to manipulations that modulate drinking that is already occurring (i.e., indirect controls or modulators of intake), but there is a dearth of studies with detailed measures of licking in response to stimuli that are primary drivers of intake (i.e., direct controls). A better understanding of licking behavior in response to direct controls of fluid intake could provide insight into how drinking is stimulated. Accordingly, we analyzed lick patterns after varying doses of primary drivers (direct controls) of intake, angiotensin II, hypertonic saline, or carbochol, in male and female rats. As expected, all treatments dose-dependently increased licks for water. Analysis of licking patterns revealed dose-related increases in burst number after treatment with all stimuli, but dose did not predict burst size or lick rate. Together with previous work on licking patterns these data suggest that direct controls of water intake are more related to processes associated with satiety than to changes in hedonic value of the consumed substance.

">Inducible CreERT2 mouse lines for characterization of retinal bipolar cell subtypes</a></h4>

              
                Bipolar cells relay visual signals from photoreceptor cells to ganglion cells in the retina. Fifteen bipolar cell subtypes have been identified in the mouse retina. These subtypes are classified as ON and OFF bipolar cells based on their response to light stimulus or rod and cone bipolar cells based on their connection to photoreceptor cells. However, the unique structural and functional role of these subtypes in the processing of visual information is not fully known due to the inadequate tools and models available for their characterization. In this study, to trace the lineage and characterize Vsx1, Lhx3, and Lhx4-expressing bipolar cell subtypes in developing and adult mouse retina, we developed inducible Cre lines under the promoter of Vsx1, Lhx3, and Lhx4 and crossed them with ChR2EYFP reporter mice. Lineages of cells expressing Vsx1, Lhx3, and Lhx4 after Cre induction in the adult and postnatal mouse retina were then characterized. ChR2EYFP expression driven by Vsx1-CreERT2 was detected in type 2, 6, and 7 bipolar cells, Lhx3-CreERT2 in type 1b, 2, and 6 bipolar cells, and Lhx4-CreERT2 in type 2, 3, 4, and 5 bipolar cells as well as cone photoreceptor cells in the adult mouse retina. These bipolar cell subtype-specific inducible Cre mouse lines serve as efficient tools for elucidation of the mechanisms that control bipolar cell subtype development and function in the retina.

">Real-time Bayesian optimization of deep brain stimulation for personalized cognitive control enhancement</a></h4>

              
                Background: Identifying effective deep brain stimulation (DBS) parameters for psychiatric disorders has historically been a time-consuming and error prone process due to a lack of an objective and rapid readout of target circuit engagement. Cognitive control may have use as a biomarker of treatment efficacy but it has yet to be shown that DBS parameters can be reliably optimized to produce cognitive control improvements in individual subjects. Objective: We sought to leverage a rat model of DBS-driven cognitive control improvements to determine whether state of the art optimization algorithms could consistently identify effective stimulation amplitudes to enhance cognition. Methods: We delivered periods of active and inactive DBS-like stimulation at variable parameters while rats performed a Set-Shifting task that we previously showed to be stimulation-sensitive. We tested both predefined settings of interest and settings that were personalized to individual animals using Bayesian Optimization. Measurements of task performance including reaction time and accuracy were compared between acute, optimized, and traditional settings to evaluate effects on cognitive control. Results: Acute stimulation reduced reaction times without hindering accuracy (N=15), replicating the effects previously observed with chronic stimulation. In a second cohort (N=6), optimization of stimulation amplitude successfully reduced reaction times in all animals with comparable effect size to historically best settings. Conclusion: These findings confirm that optimization techniques can be effective for improving symptomatically-relevant cognitive markers supporting the feasibility of personalized, quantitatively-informed approaches to neuromodulation and target engagement for psychiatric and/or cognitive disorders.

">Lateralized foraging induces asymmetric corticostriatal plasticity in mice</a></h4>

              
                With practice, animals perform reward-oriented actions faster and with less variability. The dorsal striatum (DS) plays a key role in this process, potentially through opposing changes in cortical input strength to the two main striatal projection neurons (D1- and D2-SPNs). To test this hypothesis, we trained mice in a foraging task requiring them to perform quarter-turns (QTs) in a single direction (counterclockwise, CCW) along the walls of square towers to collect drops of water. As training progressed, the number and speed of CCW QTs increased while the variability of their trajectory decreased. Whisker trimming in well-trained mice altered QTs kinematics, highlighting the role of tactile inputs in guiding these actions. Combining ex vivo patch-clamp recordings in the DS with glutamate uncaging in the barrel cortex, we mapped the cortical neurons monosynaptically connected to D1- or D2-SPNs and measured the strength of these connections in the contralateral hemispheres, relative to the turn direction. In well-trained mice, compared to naive controls, the contralateral hemisphere showed no major changes in D1- or D2-SPNs connectivity, despite increased excitation of cortical pyramidal neurons. In contrast, the ipsiversive hemisphere exhibited no change in cortical excitability but showed increased cortical connectivity and input strength to SPNs. These findings reveal an unexpected hemispheric asymmetry in corticostriatal connectivity during lateralized foraging, which may reflect a homeostatic process normalizing striatal activity across hemispheres despite unbalanced cortical input.

">Implications of recursive Bayesian Sensory Inference</a></h4>

              
                In this article, we examine how the balance between velocity-based and position-based proprioceptive feedback influences state estimation during motor control. We introduce a computational model of arm state inference grounded in Bayesian sensory integration and compare its behaviour to findings from three classical sensorimotor studies. The model allows us to contrast the predicted behaviour of two proprioceptive configurations: one relying primarily on position signals and another relying primarily on velocity signals, reflecting the distinct contributions of type II and type Ia muscle spindle afferents. Our simulations show that a system with strong reliance on velocity-based feedback tends to represent movement relative to previously estimated positions. In a simulated reaching task with briefly presented offset visual feedback, such an Agent produces systematic endpoint errors even after visual feedback is removed. In contrast, an Agent relying mainly on positional feedback is able to correctly update its inferred hand position after visual feedback is removed, thereby limiting this type of biased endpoint errors. When biased visual feedback remains continuously available, or when muscle vibration is simulated, the two configurations produce very similar behaviour. These results indicate that markedly different assumptions about the weighting of positional and velocity proprioceptive cues can yield similar observable behaviour in some of the often-used experimental setups designed to probe state inference processes. This underscores the importance of carefully considering the composition of proprioceptive signals when building computational models and interpreting human sensorimotor experiments. We highlight the task conditions under which our model predicts clear behavioural differences arising from the relative contribution of velocity versus positional feedback.

">Integration of Audiovisual Danger Stimuli in the Zebrafish Tectum is Linked with Premotor and Behavioral Enhancements</a></h4>

              
                Multisensory integration allows animals to combine cues from different sensory modalities to improve threat detection and drive evasive behaviors. While the zebrafish Tectum is classically viewed as a visual processing center, its role in integrating auditory and visual danger signals remains unclear. Using in vivo calcium imaging in larval zebrafish, we find that brief, high-amplitude auditory stimuli recruit a significant population of tectal neurons, predominantly in deep tectal layers. In addition, combined auditory and visual stimulation robustly increases both neural activity in the zebrafish Tectum and the probability of executing rapid escape maneuvers, especially for low salient stimuli. Interestingly, simultaneous auditory and visual cues engage more tectal neurons than either modality alone. Single neuron analysis reveal a population of neurons that respond to both auditory and visual cues, and importantly, shows that a proportion of those neurons only responds to multisensory stimulation. These results firmly establish the zebrafish Tectum as a multisensory processing area. Notably, the heightened tectal response during multisensory stimulation is strongly correlated with increased activity in hindbrain neurons implicated in escape-like motion events. These results link tectal multisensory integration to premotor circuits that drive behavioral output. Overall, our findings reveal the zebrafish Tectum as a hub for integration os audiovisual threat signals, and suggest a role of tectal multisensory processing in enhancing behavioral escape responses.

                <p>by Yuto Kikuchi, Yoshifumi Asakura, Kazuhiro Aoki, Yohei Kondo, Honda Naoki</p>

Collective cell migration is fundamental to tissue homeostasis and underlies biological processes such as wound healing and cancer invasion. Previous work has proposed governing equations to describe how chemical and mechanical inputs regulate these movements, but the quantitative validity of such models remains to be thoroughly assessed. Here, we developed a machine-learning framework that infers the governing equation from live-cell imaging data. Applied to epithelial sheet migration driven by MAPK/ERK, our approach quantitatively predicted single-cell movement from local chemical and mechanical cues. Examination of the learned equations further indicated that cells process environmental signals by computing their spatiotemporal derivatives. Moreover, when applied to individual cells, our framework revealed cell-cell heterogeneity in the underlying migratory rules. Our framework offers a powerful tool for predictive modeling of multicellular dynamics in both physiological and pathological settings.

Epidemiological models that aim for a high degree of biological realism by simulating every individual in a population are unavoidably complex, with many free parameters, which makes systematic explorations of their dynamics computationally challenging. In this study, we demonstrate how Gaussian Process emulation can overcome this challenge. To simulate disease dynamics, we developed an abstract individual-based model that is loosely inspired by dengue, incorporating some key features shaping dengue epidemics such as social structure, human movement, and seasonality. We focused on three epidemiological metrics derived from the individual-based model outcomes — outbreak probability, maximum incidence, and epidemic duration — and trained three Gaussian Process surrogate models to approximate these metrics. The GP surrogate models enabled the rapid prediction of these epidemiological metrics at any point in the eight-dimensional parameter space of the original model. Our analysis revealed that average infectivity and average human mobility are key drivers of these epidemiological metrics, while the seasonal timing of the first infection can influence the course of the epidemic outbreak. We used a dataset comprising more than 1,000 dengue epidemics observed over 12 years in Colombia to calibrate our Gaussian Process model and evaluated its predictive power. The calibrated Gaussian Process model identified a subset of municipalities with consistently higher average infectivity estimates; the notable overlap between these municipalities and previously reported dengue disease clusters suggests that statistical emulation can facilitate empirical data analysis. Overall, this work underscores the potential of Gaussian Process emulation to enable the use of more complex individual-based models in epidemiology, allowing a higher degree of realism and accuracy that should increase our ability to control diseases of public health concern.

The biological mechanisms underlying the spontaneous and recurrent transition to seizures in the epileptic brain are still poorly understood. As a result, seizures remain uncontrolled in a substantial proportion of patients. Brain stimulation is an emerging and promising method to treat various brain disorders, including drug-refractory epilepsy. Selected stimulation protocols previously demonstrated therapeutic efficacy in reducing the seizure rate. The stimulation efficacy critically depends on chosen stimulation parameters, such as the time point, amplitude, and frequency of stimulation. This study aims to explore the neurobiological impact of 1Hz stimulation and provide the mechanistic explanation behind its seizure-delaying effects. We study this effect using a computational model, a modified version of the Epileptor-2 model, in close comparison with such stimulation effects on spontaneous seizures recorded <i>in vitro</i> in a high-potassium model of ictogenesis in rat hippocampal slices. In particular, we investigate the mechanisms and dynamics of spontaneous seizure emergence, the seizure-delaying effect of the stimulation, and the optimal stimulation parameters to achieve the maximal anti-seizure effect. We show that the modified Epileptor-2 model replicates key experimental observations, and captures seizure dynamics and the anti-seizure effects of low-frequency electrical stimulation (LFES) observed in hippocampal slices. We identify the critical thresholds in the model for seizure onset and determine the optimal stimulation parameters—timing, amplitude, and duration—that exceed specific thresholds to delay seizures without triggering premature seizures. Our study highlights the central role of sodium-potassium pump dynamics in terminating seizures and mediating the LFES effect.

Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are crucial in addressing the global crisis of bacterial resistance. However, there are still significant limitations in existing methods on de novo AMPs design, especially in designing AMPs with desirable physicochemical properties for specific bacterial pathogens. In this study, we propose a novel generative framework for designing pathogen-targeted antimicrobial peptides with programmable physicochemical properties. More specifically, a conditional Variational Autoencoder is first pretrained for generating AMPs with editable physicochemical properties. We then develop a conditional diffusion model to learn hidden representations of AMPs for targeting pathogens of interest, and construct corresponding MIC predictors for specific bacterial strains. Through comprehensive simulation experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms most existing models in terms of antimicrobial efficacy against specific bacterial targets. Moreover, through systematic screening and analysis, we have identified two star AMPs for each of the two target bacterial species (i.e., <i>E. coli</i> or <i>S. aureus</i>), both of which exhibit excellent performance in antibacterial activity, hemolytic properties, toxicity profiles, etc. Overall, this study provides the key technological support for developing next-generation intelligent platforms for antimicrobial agents design.

Accurately quantifying cellular morphology at scale could substantially empower existing single-cell approaches. However, measuring cell morphology remains an active field of research, which has inspired multiple computer vision algorithms over the years. Here, we show that DINOv2, a vision-transformer based, self-supervised algorithm, has a remarkable ability for learning rich representations of cellular morphology without manual annotations or any other type of supervision. We apply DINOv2 to cell phenotyping problems, and compare the performance of resulting models, called Cell-DINO models, on a wide variety of tasks across two publicly available imaging datasets of diverse specifications and biological focus. Compared to supervised and other self-supervised baselines, Cell-DINO models demonstrate improved performance, especially in low annotation regimes. For instance, to classify protein localization using only 1% of annotations on a challenging single-cell dataset, Cell-DINO performs 70% better than a supervised strategy, and 24% better than another self-supervised alternative. The results show that Cell-DINO can support the study of unknown biological variation, including single-cell heterogeneity and relationships between experimental conditions, making it an excellent tool for image-based biological discovery.

                <p>by Medha Shekhar, Herrick Fung, Krish Saxena, Farshad Rafiei, Dobromir Rahnev</p>

Humans can evaluate the accuracy of their decisions by providing confidence judgements. Traditional cognitive models have tried to capture the mechanisms underlying this process but remain mostly limited to two-choice tasks with simple stimuli. How confidence is given for naturalistic stimuli with multiple choice alternatives is not well understood. We recently developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) model – RTNet – that exhibits several important signatures of human decision making and outperforms existing alternatives in predicting human responses. Here, we use RTNet’s image computability to test seven different confidence strategies on a task involving digit discrimination with eight alternatives (N = 60). Specifically, we compared confidence strategies that consider the entire evidence distribution across choices against strategies that only consider a specific subset of the available evidence. We also compared strategies based on whether they compute confidence from posterior probabilities or from raw evidence. A model which derives confidence from the difference in raw evidence between the top-two choices (Top2Diff model) consistently provided the best quantitative and qualitative fits to the data and the best predictions of human confidence. These results support the notion that human confidence is based on a specific subset of available evidence, challenge prominent theories such as the Bayesian confidence hypothesis and the positive evidence heuristic, and establish CNNs as promising models for inferring the mechanisms underlying human confidence in naturalistic settings.

                <p>by Megan Morrison, Lai-Sang Young</p>

<i>C. elegans</i> locomotion is composed of switches between forward and reversal states punctuated by turns. This locomotory capability is necessary for the nematode to move towards attractive stimuli, escape noxious chemicals, and explore its environment. Although experimentalists have identified a number of premotor neurons as drivers of forward and reverse motion, how these neurons work together to produce the behaviors observed remains to be understood. Towards a better understanding of <i>C. elegans</i> neurodynamics, we present in this paper a minimally parameterized, biology-based dynamical systems model of the premotor network. Our model consists of a recurrently connected collection of premotor neurons (the core group) driven by over a hundred sensory and interneurons that provide diverse feedforward inputs to the core group. It is data-driven in the sense that the choice of neurons in the core group follows experimental guidance, anatomical structures are dictated by the connectome, and physiological parameters are deduced from whole-brain imaging and voltage clamps data. When simulated with realistic input signals, our model produces premotor activity that closely resembles experimental data: from the seemingly random switching between forward and reversal behaviors to the synchronization of subnetworks to various higher-order statistics. We posit that different roles are played by gap junctions and synaptic connections in switching dynamics. Using the model we identify signal neurons that strongly influence switches between behavioral states and core neurons that play an important role in integrating signal information. The model produces switching statistics that underlie behaviors such as dwelling versus roaming as a result of the synaptic inputs received.

In today’s research landscape, the dissemination and utilisation of results are not only an obligation but essential components of impactful research. Funding agencies are increasingly emphasising the translation of academic findings into practical applications that meet societal needs. However, researchers often lack training or incentives to focus on this task, leading to a disconnect between scientific enquiry and impact in practice. Innovation Boot Camps (IBCs) offer a dynamic solution to bridge this gap. IBCs provide a collaborative platform where researchers can familiarise themselves with attitudes and mindsets of end users, including industry professionals, policymakers and community members. This interaction ensures that scientific findings are aligned with real needs and challenges, increasing their relevance and applicability. These workshops foster creativity by encouraging researchers to think beyond the traditional academic framework and explore interdisciplinary approaches. This promotes not only innovative solutions, but also the effective tackling of complex societal problems. In addition to fostering creativity, IBCs also provide training to researchers in important professional skills such as communication, project management and business acumen. These skills are critical for communicating scientific concepts, navigating commercial environments and successfully implementing research findings. By participating in IBCs, researchers can assume a proactive role in transforming their findings into marketable or socially relevant innovations. This article offers a step-by-step guide on how to structure and run an effective Innovation Boot Camp, helping researchers transform their results from bureaucratic obligations into strategic opportunities for societal benefit.

Forming organs requires the appropriate distribution of spatiotemporal signals leading to tissue patterning and morphogenesis. Advances in genetic tools contributed to our understanding of cell signaling and their associated genes. Yet, due to technical challenges, the contribution of dynamic morphological transformations of tissues during organ formation remains widely unexplored. Here, we develop a new mathematical approach to understand the variables that shape the dynamic distribution of ligand and signaling. We use the TGF-α-like ligand Gurken (GRK) and the activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) during <i>Drosophila</i> oogenesis to build the model. Our model accounts for GRK secretion from a moving source, its diffusion in the perivitelline space, and the activation of EGFR in the overlaying follicle cells. Furthermore, we also capture the rapid growth of the oocyte, which was a major challenge to integrate into a model. We modeled the dynamic distribution of GRK and EGFR activation by a series of mathematical equations. We used this model to study how perturbations of the egg chamber’s morphological evolution impact cell signaling, which could not be achieved via genetic perturbation. We found that the relative movement of the follicle cells and the oocyte contributes to the distribution of EGFR signaling activation.

                <p>by Ling Xu, Pejman Senaei, Yi Jiang</p>

Mucociliary clearance is the primary defense mechanism in our respiratory system against aerosol pathogens and allergens. The rhythmic movement of cilia on airway-lining cells propels mucus flow, driving the movement of trapped particles. However, the impact of cilia density and distribution on mucociliary mixing and transport at the tissue scale remains poorly understood. In the present work, we present three-dimensional (3D) simulations of ciliary-driven mixing and transport of a Newtonian fluid as an approximation of mucus at the tissue scale. We investigate the influence of ciliary density, cilia cluster spacing, and metachrony on fluid mixing and transport. Our findings reveal that: (i) cilia clusters generate flow swirls whose size scales with ciliary density, (ii) a single cilia cluster generates horizontal and upward transport with horizontal mixing, (iii) optimal spacing between ciliary clusters enhances horizontal transport, and (iv) metachronic waves enhances mixing but reduces net transport. These findings provide useful insight into generic principles of cilia-driven transport in viscous fluids and may inform bio-inspired system design, while further work is needed to extend this work to physiologically realistic mucus transport.

                <p>We report the first human use of intranasal seletracetam (SEL) to prevent reflex seizures. A patient with epilepsy with reading-induced seizures on levetiracetam (3,000 mg/day) continued to experience reading-induced focal seizures with preserved consciousness. Detectable in serum within 2 minutes of intranasal administration, 30 mg seletracetam delayed seizure onset from 1:56 (placebo) to 4:17 minutes post-stimulus onset. A second 30 mg dose fully prevented seizures during 25 minutes of reading. Electroencephalogram (EEG) spike-frequency declined dose-dependently (3.1/min at placebo to 1.6/min after second dose), with reduced spike-propagation on magnetoencephalography (MEG). Our findings support SEL as a promising non-benzodiazepine acute seizure prevention and provide insight into reflex seizure dynamics. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                Cancer cell-autonomous immune-evasion programs limit the effectiveness of cancer immunotherapy. Huber et al. highlight recent CRISPR-driven discoveries showing how cancer cells resist cytokines, impair antigen presentation, upregulate suppressive ligands, and epigenetically silence immunogenic pathways. They outline emerging therapeutic strategies that exploit these newly defined cell-autonomous vulnerabilities.

                Subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) is protective against, while visceral adipose tissue (VAT) contributes to metabolic disease. SAT and VAT arise from heterogeneous adipose precursors of distinct developmental origins. During aging, SAT mass decreases while VAT mass increases. Changes and emergence of new adipose precursor populations may contribute to depot-specific alterations.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(25)01525-6?rss=yes">Intestinal low-abundant bacteria drive MyD88/Trif-dependent CD8+ T cell exhaustion in chronic myeloid leukemia</a></h4>

              
                Ronchi et al. show that Sutterella species promote MyD88/Trif-dependent CTL exhaustion, thereby impairing anti-leukemic immunity and accelerating CML progression. These findings reveal a gut microbiota-immune axis in leukemia, highlighting the need for further investigation of Sutterella in CML patients.
