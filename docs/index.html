              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12334">When neural implant meets multimodal LLM: A dual-loop system for neuromodulation and naturalistic neuralbehavioral research</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2503.12334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel dual-loop system that synergistically combines responsive neurostimulation (RNS) implants with artificial intelligence-driven wearable devices for treating post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and enabling naturalistic brain research. In PTSD Therapy Mode, an implanted closed-loop neural device monitors amygdala activity and provides on-demand stimulation upon detecting pathological theta oscillations, while an ensemble of wearables (smart glasses, smartwatches, smartphones) uses multimodal large language model (LLM) analysis of sensory data to detect environmental or physiological PTSD triggers and deliver timely audiovisual interventions. Logged events from both the neural and wearable loops are analyzed to personalize trigger detection and progressively transition patients to non-invasive interventions. In Neuroscience Research Mode, the same platform is adapted for real-world brain activity capture. Wearable-LLM systems recognize naturalistic events (social interactions, emotional situations, compulsive behaviors, decision making) and signal implanted RNS devices (via wireless triggers) to record synchronized intracranial data during these moments. This approach builds on recent advances in mobile intracranial EEG recording and closed-loop neuromodulation in humans (BRAIN Initiative, 2023) (Mobbs et al., 2021). We discuss how our interdisciplinary system could revolutionize PTSD therapy and cognitive neuroscience by enabling 24/7 monitoring, context-aware intervention, and rich data collection outside traditional labs. The vision is a future where AI-enhanced devices continuously collaborate with the human brain, offering therapeutic support and deep insights into neural function, with the resulting real-world context rich neural data, in turn, accelerating the development of more biologically-grounded and human-centric AI.

                arXiv:2503.12392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates EEG as a potential early biomarker by applying deep learning techniques to resting-state EEG recordings from 31 subjects (15 with PD and 16 healthy controls). EEG signals were rigorously preprocessed to remove tremor artifacts, then converted to wavelet-based images by grouping spatially adjacent electrodes into triplets for convolutional neural network (CNN) classification. Our analysis across different brain regions and frequency bands showed distinct spatial-spectral patterns of PD-related neural oscillations. We identified high classification accuracy (74%) in the gamma band (40-62.4 Hz) for central-parietal electrodes (CP1, Pz, CP2), and 76% accuracy using central electrodes (C3, Cz, C4) with full-spectrum 0.4-62.4 Hz. In particular, we observed pronounced right-hemisphere involvement, specifically in parieto-occipital regions. Unlike previous studies that achieved higher accuracies by potentially including tremor artifacts, our approach isolates genuine neurophysiological alterations in cortical activity. These findings suggest that specific EEG-based oscillatory patterns, especially central-parietal gamma activity, may provide diagnostic information for PD, potentially before the onset of motor symptoms.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12509">A Reservoir-based Model for Human-like Perception of Complex Rhythm Pattern</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2503.12509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rhythm is a fundamental aspect of human behaviour, present from infancy and deeply embedded in cultural practices. Rhythm anticipation is a spontaneous cognitive process that typically occurs before the onset of actual beats. While most research in both neuroscience and artificial intelligence has focused on metronome-based rhythm tasks, studies investigating the perception of complex musical rhythm patterns remain limited. To address this gap, we propose a hierarchical oscillator-based model to better understand the perception of complex musical rhythms in biological systems. The model consists of two types of coupled neurons that generate oscillations, with different layers tuned to respond to distinct perception levels. We evaluate the model using several representative rhythm patterns spanning the upper, middle, and lower bounds of human musical perception. Our findings demonstrate that, while maintaining a high degree of synchronization accuracy, the model exhibits human-like rhythmic behaviours. Additionally, the beta band neuronal activity in the model mirrors patterns observed in the human brain, further validating the biological plausibility of the approach.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13097">Combined impact of grey and superficial white matter abnormalities: implications for epilepsy surgery</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2503.13097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Drug-resistant focal epilepsy is associated with abnormalities in the brain in both grey matter (GM) and superficial white matter (SWM). However, it is unknown if both types of abnormalities are important in supporting seizures. Here, we test if surgical removal of GM and/or SWM abnormalities relates to post-surgical seizure outcome in people with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE).
  We analyzed structural imaging data from 143 TLE patients (pre-op dMRI and pre-op T1-weighted MRI) and 97 healthy controls. We calculated GM volume abnormalities and SWM mean diffusivity abnormalities and evaluated if their surgical removal distinguished seizure outcome groups post-surgically.
  At a group level, GM and SWM abnormalities were most common in the ipsilateral temporal lobe and hippocampus in people with TLE. Analyzing both modalities together, compared to in isolation, improved surgical outcome discrimination (GM AUC = 0.68, p < 0.01, WM AUC = 0.65, p < 0.01; Union AUC = 0.72, p < 0.01, Concordance AUC = 0.64, p = 0.04). Additionally, 100% of people who had all concordant abnormal regions resected had ILAE$_{1,2}$ outcomes.
  These findings suggest that regions identified as abnormal from both diffusion-weighted and T1-weighted MRIs are involved in the epileptogenic network and that resection of both types of abnormalities may enhance the chances of living without disabling seizures.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12066">Impact of Data Patterns on Biotype identification Using Machine Learning</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2503.12066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract:   Background: Patient stratification in brain disorders remains a significant challenge, despite advances in machine learning and multimodal neuroimaging. Automated machine learning algorithms have been widely applied for identifying patient subtypes (biotypes), but results have been inconsistent across studies. These inconsistencies are often attributed to algorithmic limitations, yet an overlooked factor may be the statistical properties of the input data. This study investigates the contribution of data patterns on algorithm performance by leveraging synthetic brain morphometry data as an exemplar.
  Methods: Four widely used algorithms-SuStaIn, HYDRA, SmileGAN, and SurrealGAN were evaluated using multiple synthetic pseudo-patient datasets designed to include varying numbers and sizes of clusters and degrees of complexity of morphometric changes. Ground truth, representing predefined clusters, allowed for the evaluation of performance accuracy across algorithms and datasets.
  Results: SuStaIn failed to process datasets with more than 17 variables, highlighting computational inefficiencies. HYDRA was able to perform individual-level classification in multiple datasets with no clear pattern explaining failures. SmileGAN and SurrealGAN outperformed other algorithms in identifying variable-based disease patterns, but these patterns were not able to provide individual-level classification.
  Conclusions: Dataset characteristics significantly influence algorithm performance, often more than algorithmic design. The findings emphasize the need for rigorous validation using synthetic data before real-world application and highlight the limitations of current clustering approaches in capturing the heterogeneity of brain disorders. These insights extend beyond neuroimaging and have implications for machine learning applications in biomedical research.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12330">Computational identification of ketone metabolism as a key regulator of sleep stability and circadian dynamics via real-time metabolic profiling</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2503.12330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metabolism plays a crucial role in sleep regulation, yet its effects are challenging to track in real time. This study introduces a machine learning-based framework to analyze sleep patterns and identify how metabolic changes influence sleep at specific time points. We first established that sleep periods in Drosophila melanogaster function independently, with no causal relationship between different sleep episodes. Using gradient boosting models and explainable artificial intelligence techniques, we quantified the influence of time-dependent sleep features. Causal inference and autocorrelation analyses further confirmed that sleep states at different times are statistically independent, providing a robust foundation for exploring metabolic effects on sleep. Applying this framework to flies with altered monocarboxylate transporter 2 expression, we found that changes in ketone transport modified sleep stability and disrupted transitions between day and night sleep. In an Alzheimers disease model, metabolic interventions such as beta hydroxybutyrate supplementation and intermittent fasting selectively influenced the timing of day to night transitions rather than uniformly altering sleep duration. Autoencoder based similarity scoring and wavelet analysis reinforced that metabolic effects on sleep were highly time dependent. This study presents a novel approach to studying sleep-metabolism interactions, revealing that metabolic states exert their strongest influence at distinct time points, shaping sleep stability and circadian transitions.

                arXiv:2503.12992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the ability of perceptron-type neurons in language models to perform intra-neuronal attention; that is, to identify different homogeneous categorical segments within the synthetic thought category they encode, based on a segmentation of specific activation zones for the tokens to which they are particularly responsive. The objective of this work is therefore to determine to what extent formal neurons can establish a homomorphic relationship between activation-based and categorical segmentations. The results suggest the existence of such a relationship, albeit tenuous, only at the level of tokens with very high activation levels. This intra-neuronal attention subsequently enables categorical restructuring processes at the level of neurons in the following layer, thereby contributing to the progressive formation of high-level categorical abstractions.

                arXiv:2404.11143v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Combining Functional MRI (fMRI) data across different subjects and datasets is crucial for many neuroscience tasks. Relying solely on shared anatomy for brain-to-brain mapping is inadequate. Existing functional transformation methods thus depend on shared stimuli across subjects and fMRI datasets, which are often unavailable. In this paper, we propose an approach for computing functional brain-to-brain transformations without any shared data, a feat not previously achieved in functional transformations. This presents exciting research prospects for merging and enriching diverse datasets, even when they involve distinct stimuli that were collected using different fMRI machines of varying resolutions (e.g., 3-Tesla and 7-Tesla). Our approach combines brain-to-brain transformation with image-to-fMRI encoders, thus enabling to learn functional transformations on visual stimuli to which subjects were never exposed. Furthermore, we demonstrate the applicability of our method for improving image-to-fMRI encoding of subjects scanned on older low-resolution 3T fMRI datasets, by using a new high-resolution 7T fMRI dataset (scanned on different subjects and different stimuli).

Abstract: Objective: To assess the effect of overall, between- and within-day subjectively rated fluctuations in motor and non-motor symptoms in people with functional motor disorder (FMD) on the health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Background: FMD is a complex condition characterized by fluctuating motor and non-motor symptoms that may negatively impact HRQoL. Methods: Seventy-seven patients (54 females, mean age 45.4 (SD 10.4) years) with a clinically established diagnosis of FMD, including weakness, completed symptom diaries, rating the severity of motor and non-motor symptoms (i.e., pain, fatigue, mood, cognitive difficulties) on a 10-point numerical scale three times daily for seven consecutive days. HRQoL was assessed using the SF-36 questionnaire. For the analysis, fluctuation magnitude was defined in terms of the variability in self-reported symptom scores. Results: The mental component of SF-36 was jointly predicted by the overall severity scores (t(74) = -3.61, P < 0.001) and overall general fluctuations (t(74) = -2.98, P = 0.004). The physical SF-36 was found to be related only to the overall symptom severity scores (t(74) = -7.09, P < 0.001), but not to the overall fluctuations. The assessment of the impact of different components showed that the mental component of SF-36 was significantly influenced by the combined effect of average fatigue (t(73) = -3.86, P < 0.001), between-day cognitive symptoms fluctuations (t(73) = -3.22, P = 0.002), and within-day mood fluctuations (t(73) = -2.48, P = 0.015). Conclusions: This study demonstrated the impact of self-reported symptom fluctuations across multiple motor and non-motor domains on mental but not physical HRQoL in FMD and highlighted the importance of assessing and managing fluctuations in clinical practice.

Abstract: We present a self-supervised framework that learns population-level codes for arbitrary ensembles of neural recordings at scale. We address key challenges in scaling models with neural time-series data, namely, sparse and variable electrode distribution across subjects and datasets. The Population Transformer (PopT) stacks on top of pretrained temporal embeddings and enhances downstream decoding by enabling learned aggregation of multiple spatially-sparse data channels. The pretrained PopT lowers the amount of data required for downstream decoding experiments, while increasing accuracy, even on held-out subjects and tasks. Compared to end-to-end methods, this approach is computationally lightweight, while achieving similar or better decoding performance. We further show how our framework is generalizable to multiple time-series embeddings and neural data modalities. Beyond decoding, we interpret the pretrained and fine-tuned PopT models to show how they can be used to extract neuroscience insights from large amounts of data. We release our code as well as a pretrained PopT to enable off-the-shelf improvements in multi-channel intracranial data decoding and interpretability. Code is available at https://github.com/czlwang/PopulationTransformer.

                arXiv:2412.12134v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the complex dynamics and fractal attractors that emerge from a 60-dimensional ring lattice system of electrically coupled nonchaotic Rulkov neurons. Although networks of chaotic Rulkov neurons are well studied, systems of nonchaotic Rulkov neurons have not been extensively explored due to the piecewise complexity of the nonchaotic Rulkov map. We find rich dynamics emerge from the electrical coupling of regular spiking Rulkov neurons, including chaotic spiking, synchronized chaotic bursting, and complete chaos. By varying the electrical coupling strength between the neurons, we also discover general trends in the maximal Lyapunov exponent across different regimes of the ring lattice system. By means of the Kaplan-Yorke conjecture, we also examine the fractal geometry of the ring system's high-dimensional chaotic attractors and find various correlations and differences between the fractal dimensions of the attractors and the chaotic dynamics on them.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20580">Training Large Neural Networks With Low-Dimensional Error Feedback</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.20580v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Training deep neural networks typically relies on backpropagating high dimensional error signals a computationally intensive process with little evidence supporting its implementation in the brain. However, since most tasks involve low-dimensional outputs, we propose that low-dimensional error signals may suffice for effective learning. To test this hypothesis, we introduce a novel local learning rule based on Feedback Alignment that leverages indirect, low-dimensional error feedback to train large networks. Our method decouples the backward pass from the forward pass, enabling precise control over error signal dimensionality while maintaining high-dimensional representations. We begin with a detailed theoretical derivation for linear networks, which forms the foundation of our learning framework, and extend our approach to nonlinear, convolutional, and transformer architectures. Remarkably, we demonstrate that even minimal error dimensionality on the order of the task dimensionality can achieve performance matching that of traditional backpropagation. Furthermore, our rule enables efficient training of convolutional networks, which have previously been resistant to Feedback Alignment methods, with minimal error. This breakthrough not only paves the way toward more biologically accurate models of learning but also challenges the conventional reliance on high-dimensional gradient signals in neural network training. Our findings suggest that low-dimensional error signals can be as effective as high-dimensional ones, prompting a reevaluation of gradient-based learning in high-dimensional systems. Ultimately, our work offers a fresh perspective on neural network optimization and contributes to understanding learning mechanisms in both artificial and biological systems.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06802">Identifying the impact of local connectivity patterns on dynamics in excitatory-inhibitory networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2411.06802v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Networks of excitatory and inhibitory (EI) neurons form a canonical circuit in the brain. Seminal theoretical results on dynamics of such networks are based on the assumption that synaptic strengths depend on the type of neurons they connect, but are otherwise statistically independent. Recent synaptic physiology datasets however highlight the prominence of specific connectivity patterns that go well beyond what is expected from independent connections. While decades of influential research have demonstrated the strong role of the basic EI cell type structure, to which extent additional connectivity features influence dynamics remains to be fully determined. Here we examine the effects of pairwise connectivity motifs on the linear dynamics in EI networks using an analytical framework that approximates the connectivity in terms of low-rank structures. This low-rank approximation is based on a mathematical derivation of the dominant eigenvalues of the connectivity matrix and predicts the impact on responses to external inputs of connectivity motifs and their interactions with cell-type structure. Our results reveal that a particular pattern of connectivity, chain motifs, have a much stronger impact on dominant eigenmodes than other pairwise motifs. An overrepresentation of chain motifs induces a strong positive eigenvalue in inhibition-dominated networks and generates a potential instability that requires revisiting the classical excitation-inhibition balance criteria. Examining effects of external inputs, we show that chain motifs can on their own induce paradoxical responses where an increased input to inhibitory neurons leads to a decrease in their activity due to the recurrent feedback. These findings have direct implications for the interpretation of experiments in which responses to optogenetic perturbations are measured and used to infer the dynamical regime of cortical circuits.

Abstract: This paper presents a new complex optimization problem in the field of automatic design of advanced industrial systems and proposes a hybrid optimization approach to solve the problem. The problem is multi-objective as it aims at finding solutions that minimize CO2 emissions, transportation time, and costs. The optimization approach combines an evolutionary algorithm and classical mathematical programming to design resilient and sustainable global manufacturing networks. Further, it makes use of the OWL ontology for data consistency and constraint management. The experimental validation demonstrates the effectiveness of the approach in both single and double sourcing scenarios. The proposed methodology, in general, can be applied to any industry case with complex manufacturing and supply chain challenges.

                arXiv:2503.12743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite their potential to address crucial bottlenecks in computing architectures and contribute to the pool of biological inspiration for engineering, pathological biological mechanisms remain absent from computational theory. We hereby introduce the concept of cancer-inspired computing as a paradigm drawing from the adaptive, resilient, and evolutionary strategies of cancer, for designing computational systems capable of thriving in dynamic, adversarial or resource-constrained environments. Unlike known bioinspired approaches (e.g., evolutionary and neuromorphic architectures), cancer-inspired computing looks at emulating the uniqueness of cancer cells survival tactics, such as somatic mutation, metastasis, angiogenesis and immune evasion, as parallels to desirable features in computing architectures, for example decentralized propagation and resource optimization, to impact areas like fault tolerance and cybersecurity. While the chaotic growth of cancer is currently viewed as uncontrollable in biology, randomness-based algorithms are already being successfully demonstrated in enhancing the capabilities of other computing architectures, for example chaos computing integration. This vision focuses on the concepts of multilevel intelligence and context-driven mutation, and their potential to simultaneously overcome plasticity-limited neuromorphic approaches and the randomness of chaotic approaches. The introduction of this concept aims to generate interdisciplinary discussion to explore the potential of cancer-inspired mechanisms toward powerful and resilient artificial systems.

Abstract: Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) are a cornerstone of intelligent transportation systems, facilitating real-time communication between vehicles and infrastructure. However, the dynamic nature of VANETs introduces significant challenges in routing, especially in minimizing communication delay while ensuring route stability. This paper proposes a hierarchical evolutionary optimization framework for delay-constrained routing in vehicular networks. Leveraging multi-objective optimization, the framework balances delay and stability objectives and incorporates adaptive mechanisms like incremental route adjustments and LSTM-based predictive modeling. Simulation results confirm that the proposed framework maintains low delay and high stability, adapting effectively to frequent topology changes in dynamic vehicular environments.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12856">Island-Based Evolutionary Computation with Diverse Surrogates and Adaptive Knowledge Transfer for High-Dimensional Data-Driven Optimization</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2503.12856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been a growing interest in data-driven evolutionary algorithms (DDEAs) employing surrogate models to approximate the objective functions with limited data. However, current DDEAs are primarily designed for lower-dimensional problems and their performance drops significantly when applied to large-scale optimization problems (LSOPs). To address the challenge, this paper proposes an offline DDEA named DSKT-DDEA. DSKT-DDEA leverages multiple islands that utilize different data to establish diverse surrogate models, fostering diverse subpopulations and mitigating the risk of premature convergence. In the intra-island optimization phase, a semi-supervised learning method is devised to fine-tune the surrogates. It not only facilitates data argumentation, but also incorporates the distribution information gathered during the search process to align the surrogates with the evolving local landscapes. Then, in the inter-island knowledge transfer phase, the algorithm incorporates an adaptive strategy that periodically transfers individual information and evaluates the transfer effectiveness in the new environment, facilitating global optimization efficacy. Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm is competitive with state-of-the-art DDEAs on problems with up to 1000 dimensions, while also exhibiting decent parallelism and scalability. Our DSKT-DDEA is open-source and accessible at: https://github.com/LabGong/DSKT-DDEA.

                arXiv:2503.12905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Video anomaly detection plays a significant role in intelligent surveillance systems. To enhance model's anomaly recognition ability, previous works have typically involved RGB, optical flow, and text features. Recently, dynamic vision sensors (DVS) have emerged as a promising technology, which capture visual information as discrete events with a very high dynamic range and temporal resolution. It reduces data redundancy and enhances the capture capacity of moving objects compared to conventional camera. To introduce this rich dynamic information into the surveillance field, we created the first DVS video anomaly detection benchmark, namely UCF-Crime-DVS. To fully utilize this new data modality, a multi-scale spiking fusion network (MSF) is designed based on spiking neural networks (SNNs). This work explores the potential application of dynamic information from event data in video anomaly detection. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on UCF-Crime-DVS and its superior performance compared to other models, establishing a new baseline for SNN-based weakly supervised video anomaly detection.

Inspired by the memory mechanism and powerful generalization ability of biological neural networks in human brains, we propose a novel gradient-free Elastic Memory Network, namely EMN, to support quick fine-tuning of the mapping between features and prediction without heavy optimization of deep features. In particular, EMN adopts randomly connected neurons to memorize the association of features and labels, where the signals in the network are propagated as impulses, and the prediction is made by associating the memories stored on neurons based on their confidence. More importantly, EMN supports reinforced memorization of feature mapping based on unlabeled data to quickly adapt to a new domain. Experiments based on four cross-domain real-world datasets show that EMN can achieve up to 10% enhancement of performance while only needing less than 1% timing cost of traditional domain adaptation methods.

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are posited as a computationally efficient and biologically plausible alternative to conventional neural architectures, with their core computational framework primarily using the leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neuron model. However, the limited hidden state representation of LIF neurons, characterized by a scalar membrane potential, and sequential spike generation process, poses challenges for effectively developing scalable spiking models to address long-range dependencies in sequence learning tasks. In this study, we develop a scalable probabilistic spiking learning framework for long-range dependency tasks leveraging the fundamentals of state space models. Unlike LIF neurons that rely on the deterministic Heaviside function for a sequential process of spike generation, we introduce a SpikeSampler layer that samples spikes stochastically based on an SSM-based neuronal model while allowing parallel computations. To address non-differentiability of the spiking operation and enable effective training, we also propose a surrogate function tailored for the stochastic nature of the SpikeSampler layer. To enhance inter-neuron communication, we introduce the SpikeMixer block, which integrates spikes from neuron populations in each layer. This is followed by a ClampFuse layer, incorporating a residual connection to capture complex dependencies, enabling scalability of the model. Our models attain state-of-the-art performance among SNN models across diverse long-range dependency tasks, encompassing the Long Range Arena benchmark, permuted sequential MNIST, and the Speech Command dataset and demonstrate sparse spiking pattern highlighting its computational efficiency.

Abstract: Building autonomous -- i.e., choosing goals based on one's needs -- and adaptive -- i.e., surviving in ever-changing environments -- agents has been a holy grail of artificial intelligence (AI). A living organism is a prime example of such an agent, offering important lessons about adaptive autonomy. Here, we focus on interoception, a process of monitoring one's internal environment to keep it within certain bounds, which underwrites the survival of an organism. To develop AI with interoception, we need to factorize the state variables representing internal environments from external environments and adopt life-inspired mathematical properties of internal environment states. This paper offers a new perspective on how interoception can help build autonomous and adaptive agents by integrating the legacy of cybernetics with recent advances in theories of life, reinforcement learning, and neuroscience.

                arXiv:2403.19243v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-rank decomposition has emerged as a vital tool for enhancing parameter efficiency in neural network architectures, gaining traction across diverse applications in machine learning. These techniques significantly lower the number of parameters, striking a balance between compactness and performance. However, a common challenge has been the compromise between parameter efficiency and the accuracy of the model, where reduced parameters often lead to diminished accuracy compared to their full-rank counterparts. In this work, we propose a novel theoretical framework that integrates a sinusoidal function within the low-rank decomposition process. This approach not only preserves the benefits of the parameter efficiency characteristic of low-rank methods but also increases the decomposition's rank, thereby enhancing model performance. Our method proves to be a plug in enhancement for existing low-rank models, as evidenced by its successful application in Vision Transformers (ViT), Large Language Models (LLMs), Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D shape modelling.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become important tools for machine learning on graph-structured data. In this paper, we explore the synergistic combination of graph encoding, graph rewiring, and graph attention, by introducing Graph Attention with Stochastic Structures (GRASS), a novel GNN architecture. GRASS utilizes relative random walk probabilities (RRWP) encoding and a novel decomposed variant (D-RRWP) to efficiently capture structural information. It rewires the input graph by superimposing a random regular graph to enhance long-range information propagation. It also employs a novel additive attention mechanism tailored for graph-structured data. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that GRASS achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets, including a 20.3% reduction in mean absolute error on the ZINC dataset.

Abstract: A new Kolmogorov-Arnold network (KAN) is proposed to approximate potentially irregular functions in high dimensions. We provide error bounds for this approximation, assuming that the Kolmogorov-Arnold expansion functions are sufficiently smooth. When the function is only continuous, we also provide universal approximation theorems. We show that it outperforms multilayer perceptrons in terms of accuracy and convergence speed. We also compare it with several proposed KAN networks: it outperforms all networks for irregular functions and achieves similar accuracy to the original spline-based KAN network for smooth functions. Finally, we compare some of the KAN networks in optimizing a French hydraulic valley.

                arXiv:2412.17312v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Expensive multi-objective optimization problems (EMOPs) are common in real-world scenarios where evaluating objective functions is costly and involves extensive computations or physical experiments. Current Pareto set learning methods for such problems often rely on surrogate models like Gaussian processes to approximate the objective functions. These surrogate models can become fragmented, resulting in numerous small uncertain regions between explored solutions. When using acquisition functions such as the Lower Confidence Bound (LCB), these uncertain regions can turn into pseudo-local optima, complicating the search for globally optimal solutions. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach called SVH-PSL, which integrates Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD) with Hypernetworks for efficient Pareto set learning. Our method addresses the issues of fragmented surrogate models and pseudo-local optima by collectively moving particles in a manner that smooths out the solution space. The particles interact with each other through a kernel function, which helps maintain diversity and encourages the exploration of underexplored regions. This kernel-based interaction prevents particles from clustering around pseudo-local optima and promotes convergence towards globally optimal solutions. Our approach aims to establish robust relationships between trade-off reference vectors and their corresponding true Pareto solutions, overcoming the limitations of existing methods. Through extensive experiments across both synthetic and real-world MOO benchmarks, we demonstrate that SVH-PSL significantly improves the quality of the learned Pareto set, offering a promising solution for expensive multi-objective optimization problems.

<p>Schematic summary of the presence and characteristics of putative telocytes in human dorsal root ganglia (DRG). In-depth in silico analysis of sequencing data suggests the presence of nine distinct telocyte subtypes in human DRG and defined more than 3000 predicted receptor–ligand interactions between neurons and telocytes. Immunofluorescence and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) confirmed the presence of CD34+ve cells with ultrastructural characteristics of telocytes next to the neuron (N)–satellite glia cell (SGC) complexes, bordering the perivascular space of small blood vessels (BVs) and separating nerve fiber bundles (Nf bundles).

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Telocytes are interstitial cells characterized by long processes that span considerable distances within tissues, likely facilitating coordination and interaction with various cell types. Although present in central and peripheral neuronal tissues, their role remains elusive. Dorsal root ganglia (DRG) house pseudounipolar afferent neurons responsible for transmitting signals related to temperature, proprioception, and nociception. This study aimed to investigate the presence and function of telocytes in human DRG by examining their transcriptional profile, anatomical location, and ultrastructure.</p>
<p>Combined expression of <i>CD34</i> and <i>PDGFRA</i> is a marker gene set for telocytes, and our sequencing data revealed CD34 and PDGFRA expressing cells comprise roughly 1.5%–3% of DRG cells. Combined expression of <i>CD34</i> and <i>PDGFRA</i> is a putative marker gene set for telocytes. Further analysis identified nine subclusters with enriched cluster-specific genes. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Gene Ontology (GO) pathway analysis suggested vascular, immune, and connective tissue-associated putative telocyte subtypes, mapping over 3000 potential receptor–ligand interactions between sensory neurons and these <i>CD34</i> and <i>PDGFRA</i> expressing putative telocytes were identified using a ligand–receptors interactome platform. Immunohistochemistry identified CD34+ve telocytes in the endoneural space of DRGs, next to neuron–satellite complexes, in perivascular spaces and in the endoneural space between nerve fiber bundles, consistent with pathway analysis. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) confirmed their location identifying characteristic elongated nucleus, long and thin telopodes containing vesicles, often surrounded by a basal lamina. This study provides the first gene expression analysis of telocytes in complex human tissue, specifically the DRG, highlighting functional differences based on tissue location while revealing no significant ultrastructural variations.</p>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Recent advances in theoretical biology suggest that key definitions of basal cognition and sentient behavior may arise as emergent properties of in vitro cell cultures and neuronal networks. Such neuronal networks reorganize activity to demonstrate structured behaviors when embodied in structured information landscapes. In this article, we characterize this kind of self-organization through the lens of the free energy principle, that is, as self-evidencing. We do this by first discussing the definitions of reactive and sentient behavior in the setting of active inference, which describes the behavior of agents that model the consequences of their actions. We then introduce a formal account of intentional behavior that describes agents as driven by a preferred end point or goal in latent state-spaces. We then investigate these forms of (reactive, sentient, and intentional) behavior using simulations. First, we simulate the in vitro experiments, in which neuronal cultures modulated activity to improve gameplay in a simplified version of Pong by implementing nested, free energy minimizing processes. The simulations are then used to deconstruct the ensuing predictive behavior, leading to the distinction between merely reactive, sentient, and intentional behavior with the latter formalized in terms of inductive inference. This distinction is further studied using simple machine learning benchmarks (navigation in a grid world and the Tower of Hanoi problem) that show how quickly and efficiently adaptive behavior emerges under an inductive form of active inference.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>We construct a thermodynamic potential that can guide training of a generative model defined on a set of binary degrees of freedom. We argue that upon reduction in description, so as to make the generative model computationally manageable, the potential develops multiple minima. This is mirrored by the emergence of multiple minima in the free energy proper of the generative model itself. The variety of training samples that employ N binary degrees of freedom is ordinarily much lower than the size 2N of the full phase space. The nonrepresented configurations, we argue, should be thought of as comprising a high-temperature phase separated by an extensive energy gap from the configurations composing the training set. Thus, training amounts to sampling a free energy surface in the form of a library of distinct bound states, each of which breaks ergodicity. The ergodicity breaking prevents escape into the near continuum of states comprising the high-temperature phase; thus, it is necessary for proper functionality. It may, however, have the side effect of limiting access to patterns that were underrepresented in the training set. At the same time, the ergodicity breaking within the library complicates both learning and retrieval. As a remedy, one may concurrently employ multiple generative models—up to one model per free energy minimum.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Forecasting electroencephalography (EEG) signals, that is, estimating future values of the time series based on the past ones, is essential in many real-time EEG-based applications, such as brain–computer interfaces and closed-loop brain stimulation. As these applications are becoming more and more common, the importance of a good prediction model has increased. Previously, the autoregressive model (AR) has been employed for this task; however, its prediction accuracy tends to fade quickly as multiple steps are predicted. We aim to improve on this by applying probabilistic deep learning to make robust longer-range forecasts.For this, we applied the probabilistic deep neural network model WaveNet to forecast resting-state EEG in theta- (4–7.5 Hz) and alpha-frequency (8–13 Hz) bands and compared it to the AR model.WaveNet reliably predicted EEG signals in both theta and alpha frequencies 150 ms ahead, with mean absolute errors of 1.0 ± 1.1 µV (theta) and 0.9 ± 1.1 µV (alpha), and outperformed the AR model in estimating the signal amplitude and phase. Furthermore, we found that the probabilistic approach offers a way of forecasting even more accurately while effectively discarding uncertain predictions.We demonstrate for the first time that probabilistic deep learning can be used to forecast resting-state EEG time series. In the future, the developed model can enhance the real-time estimation of brain states in brain–computer interfaces and brain stimulation protocols. It may also be useful for answering neuroscientific questions and for diagnostic purposes.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>From biological and artificial network perspectives, researchers have started acknowledging astrocytes as computational units mediating neural processes. Here, we propose a novel biologically inspired neuron-astrocyte network model for image recognition, one of the first attempts at implementing astrocytes in spiking neuron networks (SNNs) using a standard data set. The architecture for image recognition has three primary units: the preprocessing unit for converting the image pixels into spiking patterns, the neuron-astrocyte network forming bipartite (neural connections) and tripartite synapses (neural and astrocytic connections), and the classifier unit. In the astrocyte-mediated SNNs, an astrocyte integrates neural signals following the simplified Postnov model. It then modulates the integrate-and-fire (IF) neurons via gliotransmission, thereby strengthening the synaptic connections of the neurons within the astrocytic territory. We develop an architecture derived from a baseline SNN model for unsupervised digit classification. The spiking neuron-astrocyte networks (SNANs) display better network performance with an optimal variance-bias trade-off than SNN alone. We demonstrate that astrocytes promote faster learning, support memory formation and recognition, and provide a simplified network architecture. Our proposed SNAN can serve as a benchmark for future researchers on astrocyte implementation in artificial networks, particularly in neuromorphic systems, for its simplified design.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>We propose a sparse deep ReLU network (SDRN) estimator of the regression function obtained from regularized empirical risk minimization with a Lipschitz loss function. Our framework can be applied to a variety of regression and classification problems. We establish novel nonasymptotic excess risk bounds for our SDRN estimator when the regression function belongs to a Sobolev space with mixed derivatives. We obtain a new, nearly optimal, risk rate in the sense that the SDRN estimator can achieve nearly the same optimal minimax convergence rate as one-dimensional nonparametric regression with the dimension involved in a logarithm term only when the feature dimension is fixed. The estimator has a slightly slower rate when the dimension grows with the sample size. We show that the depth of the SDRN estimator grows with the sample size in logarithmic order, and the total number of nodes and weights grows in polynomial order of the sample size to have the nearly optimal risk rate. The proposed SDRN can go deeper with fewer parameters to well estimate the regression and overcome the overfitting problem encountered by conventional feedforward neural networks.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Neocortical layer 5 thick-tufted pyramidal cells are prone to exhibiting burst firing on receipt of coincident basal and apical dendritic inputs. These inputs carry different information, with basal inputs coming from feedforward sensory pathways and apical inputs coming from diverse sources that provide context in the cortical hierarchy. We explore the information processing possibilities of this burst firing using computer simulations of a noisy compartmental cell model. Simulated data on stochastic burst firing due to brief, simultaneously injected basal and apical currents allow estimation of burst firing probability for different stimulus current amplitudes. Information-theory-based partial information decomposition (PID) is used to quantify the contributions of the apical and basal input streams to the information in the cell output bursting probability. Four different operating regimes are apparent, depending on the relative strengths of the input streams, with output burst probability carrying more or less information that is uniquely contributed by either the basal or apical input, or shared and synergistic information due to the combined streams. We derive and fit transfer functions for these different regimes that describe burst probability over the different ranges of basal and apical input amplitudes. The operating regimes can be classified into distinct modes of information processing, depending on the contribution of apical input to output bursting: apical cooperation, in which both basal and apical inputs are required to generate a burst; apical amplification, in which basal input alone can generate a burst but the burst probability is modulated by apical input; apical drive, in which apical input alone can produce a burst; and apical integration, in which strong apical or basal inputs alone, as well as their combination, can generate bursting. In particular, PID and the transfer function clarify that the apical amplification mode has the features required for contextually modulated information processing.</span>

                Background The Elekta micro-multileaf collimator (mMLC) known as apex for planning stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS)/stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT)/stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) provides excellent dose distribution; however, it offers disadvantages such as prolonged treatment duration and technical errors in terms of mMLC and gantry calibration, which adds to the total treatment duration. Hence, we aimed to compare the treatment planning performed with the 2.5mm mMLC and 5mm MLC known as Agility for brain and lung targets treated with SRS and SBRT in Elekta Versa high definition (HD). Methods The study included 10 patients, five each with brain and lung targets. Two treatment plans were performed for each case using Elekta’s Monaco (5.11.03) treatment planning system (TPS) with 2.5mm and 5mm MLC. An X-ray photon beam of energy 6FFF was used for planning purposes with various gantry, couch, and collimator combinations. These two plans were compared using target coverage (TC), conformity index (CI), homogeneity index (HI), gradient index (GI), and organ at risk (OAR) doses. Results No significant differences were found in the target coverage, CI, HI, or OAR doses in either MLC design. Volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) with a 5 mm MLC provided equivalent tumor coverage with an additional number of monitor units. OAR doses were comparable in both MLC widths for brain targets, whereas for lung targets, OAR doses were slightly lower with 2.5mm mMLC. GI was superior in the 2.5mm mMLC compared to the 5mm MLC giving a steep falloff in the dose distributions (p = 0.158). Conclusions The TC, CI, HI, and OAR doses were similar in both 2.5mm and 5mm based VMAT plans. The gradient index was better in the 2.5mm mMLC resulting in steep dose gradients, which further reduced the isodose volumes. Therefore, a 5mm MLC (agility) can also be used for SRS/SBRT treatment planning, with a further reduction in the gradient index. However, the study must be extended further with more samples and multiple comparison parameters.

                We discuss how epidemiology has been and can continue to be used to advance understanding of the links between urban areas and health informed by an existing urban-health conceptual framework. This framework considers urban areas as contexts for health, determinants of health and modifiers of health pathways, and part of a complex system that affects health. We highlight opportunities for descriptive epidemiology to inform the context of urban health, for example, by characterizing the social and physical environments that give rise to health and the actions that change those conditions. We then describe inferential tools for evaluating the impact of group-level actions (e.g., interventions, policies) on urban health, providing some examples, and describing assumptions and challenges. Finally, we discuss opportunities and challenges of applying systems thinking and methods to advance urban health. While different conceptual frames lead to different insights, each perspective demonstrates that urban health is a major and growing challenge. The effectiveness of urban health knowledge, action, and policy as the world continues to urbanize can be informed by applying and expanding upon research and surveillance methods described here.

                Background Orthodox microeconomic theory establishes a positive link between employee wages and productivity in competitive markets. However, this perspective often overlooks gender and treats the workforce as a homogeneous category labelled as labor, potentially obscuring issues of gender discrimination. This article addresses the gender wage gap by analyzing, for the first time, at least in an emerging economy such as Colombia, the impact of manufacturing firm’s productivity on wages explicitly including gender. Method First, we use the GMM two-equation system proposed by Wooldridge (2009) to obtain consistent and unbiased estimates of output elasticities and TFP, respectively. Secondly, we explore wages-productivity linkage by gender, implementing a dynamic random effect generalized least squares model (GLS) with panel data to deal with endogeneity issues. Results Our main findings reveal, among others, that firms with a higher proportion of female workers (female firms) generally have higher productivity than those with a higher proportion of male workers (male firms). Conclusions The effect of female firm’s productivity on wages is lower than that of male firm’s productivity, which could indicate gender wage discrimination

                Background Maxillofacial prosthetic materials exhibit a range of qualities that vary considerably, including the hardness and stiffness of alloys and polymers, as well as the flexibility of elastomers and soft polymers. Silicone elastomers are the primary materials employed for maxillofacial prostheses due to their physical properties, which allow for adaptation to the movement of soft tissue. They also exhibit exceptional tensile and tear strength across a broad temperature range. Silicone elastomers can be classified according to the vulcanization process: High-temperature vulcanization (HTV) silicones, and Room temperature vulcanization (RTV) silicones. The addition of nanoparticle enhances thermal and tear strength of maxillofacial silicon. This study estimates the influence of addition tantalum oxide nanoparticle on thermal conductivity and tear strength after addition on maxillofacial silicone. Method Tantalum oxide nanoparticles were added into VST-50F platinum silicone elastomer at two weight percentages: 1wt% and 1.5wt%. 60 specimens were prepared and classified into two groups: one control group for each property and two experimental groups. All collected data underwent statistical analysis by one-way ANOVA and Bonferroni’s multiple comparison test, with significance set at p < 0.05. The Shapiro-Wilk test and Bartlett’s test were employed to assess the normality and homogeneity of the data, respectively. Result The one-way ANOVA test found a very significant difference between all groups, while Bonferroni’s test revealed a highly significant difference between the control and experimental groups. Thermal conductivity test found no significant difference between the 1wt% and 1.5wt% groups, however the tear strength test was highly significant. Conclusions The addition tantalum oxide nano particles improve tear strength and thermal conductivity.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-305/v1?src=rss">Ideal Approaches to AI Regulation in LATAM Countries: Promoting Technological Advancement and Human Rights Protections [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Today’s approaches to regulating AI diverge from countries and regions. For instance, Japan’s framework emphasizes agile governance, relying on soft law, corporate cooperation, and a deregulatory approach. In contrast, the EU adopts a hard law model with a risk-based approach centered on protecting human rights. Discussing the benefits and downsides of each will be deemed valuable for LATAM’s journey to regulating AI. Methods The authors identified guidelines and laws from Japan and the European Union by searching official websites and Google Scholar through 2023 and 2024. We divided the search between both researchers, one of us in charge of the Japanese documents and the other of the EU and Latin America ones. The relevant documents were selected when containing soft laws, hard laws, and independent reports about AI. The authors then proceeded to conduct a document analysis of the current situation in the LATAM region as well as a comparison between the Japanese and EU approaches to AI. Through this process, the logic behind each approach was deduced and then evaluated for suitability for the LATAM region. Results LATAM faces unique challenges in regulating AI. Limited investment in innovation and research, along with insufficient venture capital, places the region below global averages in technological development. Overly restrictive regulations risk worsening this disparity. A Japanese approach appears more convenient for the region rather than a European one. In this realm, it is crucial to avoid a binary logic that positions technological growth and human rights protection as opposing objectives. Conclusions The study proposes five principles for future AI regulation in LATAM: fostering innovation, balancing risks, and benefits, tailoring frameworks to regional needs, avoiding restrictive measures, and incorporating both Western and Asian perspectives. Ultimately, this study underscores the importance of context-specific, balanced regulations that address LATAM’s unique challenges and opportunities in AI governance.

                Introduction Solitary fibrous tumors (SFT) are typically characterized by the proliferation of CD34-positive specialized fibroblasts. While these tumors are most found in the pleura, they can also present in extra-pleural sites, including the orbit, particularly in adults. Herein, we report a rare case of SFT of the eyelid in a pediatric patient and review the existing literature on similar cases. Methods A case of a 5-year-old male with a nodule on the eyelid margin is presented. The nodule was completely resected and histopathologically confirmed as SFT. A comprehensive review of the published cases of eyelid SFT was conducted. Results The case represents the second reported instance of eyelid SFT in a pediatric patient and is the youngest case documented to date. The tumor’s histopathological examination revealed characteristics consistent with SFT. The review of the literature identified only 10 cases of eyelid SFT in English literature, with just one previously reported in the pediatric population. Conclusion SFT of the eyelid is extremely rare, especially in pediatric patients. Despite its rarity, SFT should be considered in the differential diagnosis of vascular spindle-cell tumors of the eyelid in this age group. Early recognition and complete resection are crucial for effective management.

                Background The human ear is unique to individuals, and ear prints, like fingerprints, are discrete enough to distinguish identical twins. Therefore, the external ear could be used to identify both living and deceased individuals. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the stature and sexual dimorphism of the external ear using various morphometric parameters and morphological features for forensic identification. Methods This study included 40 participants (20 males and 20 females). Participants were between the age of 18-25yrs. Measurements were taken with the subject’s head in the Frankfort horizontal plane. 18 measurements were taken like ear length and width, lobule height and width, concha length and width, tragus length, morphological ear length, helical mastoid distal length, thickness of ear lobe, auricular inclination angle, antihelical take off angle, concha mastoid angle, auricular index, lobular index, concha index, ear attachment length index and conchal bowl depth on external ear were taken and the morphological features like shape of ear, ear lobe, darwin’s tubercle and ear tragus, attachment of ear lobe and form of helix of both the right and left ears were noted. A digital Vernier caliper was used to measure all parameters. The angles were measured using a goniometer. Normal distribution was verified using the Shapiro–Wilk test. For normally distributed parameters, an independent t-test was used, and for non-normally distributed parameters, the Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare sexes. To compare the right and left parameters, independent t-tests (for normally distributed data) and Mann-Whitney U tests (for non-normally distributed data) were applied. Sex determination and stature estimation were performed using logistic regression analysis. Results In males and females, the most common shape was oval, and the ear lobe was free. The most common shape of the ear lobe in males was arched, while in females, it was triangular. In males and females, the most common form of the helix was the concave marginal. In males, the most common shape of the tragus was round, whereas in females, it was long. In males and females, the most common shape of Darwin’s tubercle was enlarged. It was seen that the right lobe width showed perfect separation, indicating its potential as an extremely reliable predictor. It was noted that in females, the strongest correlation with height was with the ear inclination angle on both sides. Conclusion The results of this study can help forensic anthropologists identify the sex and stature of a person from various ear measurements.

                Background The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on health professions education, particularly in developing and middle-income countries. Despite the implementation of alternative educational strategies to facilitate remote learning while maintaining physical distancing, challenges persist in ensuring the effectiveness. Methods This qualitative cross-sectional study explored the learning experiences of medical students at a Ghanaian institution during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants were drawn from four departments within the medical school, using a cluster-based sampling approach. A voluntary response sampling method was employed to recruit students, who completed self-administered online surveys containing interview questions about their educational experiences during the pandemic. Results The study identified several barriers to effective online learning, including inadequate supervision, limited access to library resources, overburdened syllabi, and interference from household responsibilities. A significant majority of participants (n=133, 67%) reported that online learning was insufficient, ineffective, and financially burdensome, undermining the development of essential competencies and skills needed for clinical practice. Conclusions Notwithstanding these challenges, nearly all participants expressed the belief that a combination of face-to-face and online learning could enhance medical education. The pandemic has accelerated the adoption of online learning in health professions, highlighting the need to address the ongoing challenges faced by students to ensure the effectiveness of this mode of instruction.

                Background Over 500 million people worldwide rely on sorghum as a main food crop. About 10% of the daily caloric intake of households in Ethiopia’s northwest and eastern regions, including Benishangul Gumuz, comes from sorghum. A hemi-biotrophic fungal pathogen called Colletotrichum sublineolum caused anthracnose disease is among the biotic constraints of sorghum production. Methods Ten selected sorghum genotypes were assessed for sorghum anthracnose severity and its temporal and spatial dynamics on field plots in the districts of Assosa and Bambasi. The performance of the chosen sorghum genotypes was assessed using the following metrics: AUDPC, disease progress rate, yield-related trait, sorghum grain yield, and mean severity index. Anthracnose severity was evaluated using a 1–5 disease rating scale and assessments conducted at seven consecutive time points. Results The result found that the mean anthracnose severity index ranging from 60-77 PSI and 53-82 PSI, respectively. AUDPC varied from 351 to 470 % days and 316 to 499 % days at Assosa and Bambasi districts, respectively. Bambasi district achieved a larger grain yield than the Assosa district. Assosa-1 demonstrated a significant level of disease pressure, yet the current investigation found that this genotype is the highest performing genotype in both locations. Conclusions There is a considerable positive link between the severity of anthracnose and the weekly total rainfall and relative humidity. At both trial sites, Mersa-1 continuously produced higher grain yields and reduced disease levels. Breeders might utilize the Baco Striga sorghum genotype as a check line in a breeding effort to resist anthracnose disease because it shown a high vulnerability to the disease at both locations.

[version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction Since 2009 Recovery Colleges have offered in the UK co-produced holistic recovery educative courses for ‘social recovery’ or ‘recovery’, different from ‘clinical recovery’ as cure or symptom reduction with psychiatric medication or clinical interventions. In the wake of the UK Department of Health policy ‘No Health Without Mental Health’ (2011) for mental health ‘self-management’ and recovery, the definition of ‘recovery’ expanded to include ‘becoming an expert in your own self-care’ (Perkins et al., 2012). Instrumental in advancing the ‘recovery approach’, we know little about how Recovery Colleges facilitate students’ ‘self-care’ learning. Method Co-produced rapid ethnographic research examines Recovery College students’ understandings and practices of ‘self-care’ and ‘self-management’; students’ ‘self-care’ investments, materiality, embodied feeling; and its role in preventing mental health crises and maintaining mental health and wellbeing. Nine Camden & Islington Recovery College students, the North London NHS Foundation Trust, and one clinical professional to co-deliver workshops are recruited. Study participants recruitment seeks diversity, including the Recovery College’s population demographics and under-represented communities. Data from study participants, the clinical co-facilitator, and the Chief Investigator is collected. Analysis Rapid data analysis follows guidance for reflexible thematic analysis (Braun & Clarke 2019, 2006). Data accurately transcribed, coded by topics, is clustered in themes, to inform report writing, employing study participant’s descriptive examples or cases for each identified theme. All relevant data is uploaded into NVivo. Ethics and Dissemination The Northern Ireland Research Ethical Committee (24-NI-0127 - HSC REC A) gave ethical approval to the study. The Chief Investigator is a Camden & Islington Recovery College Senior Peer Recovery Tutor and ‘Embedded Researcher’, funded by the NIHR Mental Health For All programme and an NIHR Springboard Awardee, with a PhD in Anthropology. Ethical considerations include study participants’ disclosure of harm or distress; power imbalances between the Chief Investigator and study participants; pseudonymity and data management.

Although the cerebellum is typically associated with supervised learning algorithms, it also exhibits extensive involvement in reward processing. In this study, we investigated the cerebellum’s role in executing reinforcement learning algorithms, with a particular emphasis on essential reward-prediction errors. We employed the Q-learning model to accurately reproduce the licking responses of mice in a Go/No-go auditory-discrimination task. This method enabled the calculation of reinforcement learning variables, such as reward, predicted reward, and reward-prediction errors in each learning trial. Through tensor component analysis of two-photon Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging data from more than 6,000 Purkinje cells, we found that climbing fiber inputs of the two distinct components, which were specifically activated during Go and No-go cues in the learning process, showed an inverse relationship with predictive reward-prediction errors. Assuming bidirectional parallel-fiber Purkinje-cell synaptic plasticity, we constructed a cerebellar neural-network model with 5,000 spiking neurons of granule cells, Purkinje cells, cerebellar nuclei neurons, and inferior olive neurons. The network model qualitatively reproduced distinct changes in licking behaviors, climbing-fiber firing rates, and their synchronization during discrimination learning separately for Go/No-go conditions. We found that Purkinje cells in the two components could develop specific motor commands for their respective auditory cues, guided by the predictive reward-prediction errors from their climbing fiber inputs. These results indicate a possible role of context-specific actors in modular reinforcement learning, integrating with cerebellar supervised learning capabilities.

                <p>by Russell Dinnage, Marian Kleineberg</p>

Data on the three dimensional shape of organismal morphology is becoming increasingly available, and forms part of a new revolution in high-throughput phenomics that promises to help understand ecological and evolutionary processes that influence phenotypes at unprecedented scales. However, in order to meet the potential of this revolution we need new data analysis tools to deal with the complexity and heterogeneity of large-scale phenotypic data such as 3D shapes. In this study we explore the potential of generative Artificial Intelligence to help organize and extract meaning from complex 3D data. Specifically, we train a deep representational learning method known as DeepSDF on a dataset of 3D scans of the bills of 2,020 bird species. The model is designed to learn a continuous vector representation of 3D shapes, along with a ’decoder’ function, that allows the transformation from this vector space to the original 3D morphological space. We find that approach successfully learns coherent representations: particular directions in latent space are associated with discernible morphological meaning (such as elongation, flattening, etc.). More importantly, learned latent vectors have ecological meaning as shown by their ability to predict the trophic niche of the bird each bill belongs to with a high degree of accuracy. Unlike existing 3D morphometric techniques, this method has very little requirements for human supervised tasks such as landmark placement, increasing it accessibility to labs with fewer labour resources. It has fewer strong assumptions than alternative dimension reduction techniques such as PCA. Once trained, 3D morphology predictions can be made from latent vectors very computationally cheaply. The trained model has been made publicly available and can be used by the community, including for finetuning on new data, representing an early step toward developing shared, reusable AI models for analyzing organismal morphology.

Neutrophils, an essential innate immune cell type with a short lifespan, rely on continuous replenishment from bone marrow (BM) precursors. Although it is established that neutrophils are derived from the granulocyte-macrophage progenitor (GMP), the molecular regulators involved in the differentiation process remain poorly understood. Here we developed a random forest-based machine-learning pipeline, NeuRGI (Neutrophil Regulatory Gene Identifier), which utilized Positive-Unlabeled Learning (PU-learning) and neural network-based <i>in silico</i> gene knockout to identify neutrophil regulators. We interrogated features including gene expression dynamics, physiological characteristics, pathological relatedness, and gene conservation for the model training. Our identified pipeline leads to identifying Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase-4 (<i>MAP4K4</i>) as a novel neutrophil differentiation regulator. The loss of MAP4K4 in hematopoietic stem cells and progenitors in mice induced neutropenia and impeded the differentiation of neutrophils in the bone marrow. By modulating the phosphorylation level of proteins involved in cell apoptosis, such as STAT5A, MAP4K4 delicately regulates cell apoptosis during the process of neutrophil differentiation. Our work presents a novel regulatory mechanism in neutrophil differentiation and provides a robust prediction model that can be applied to other cellular differentiation processes.

                <p>by Lilly May, Alice Dauphin, Julijana Gjorgjieva</p>

The ability to process visual stimuli rich with motion represents an essential skill for animal survival and is largely already present at the onset of vision. Although the exact mechanisms underlying its maturation remain elusive, spontaneous activity patterns in the retina, known as retinal waves, have been shown to contribute to this developmental process. Retinal waves exhibit complex spatio-temporal statistics and contribute to the establishment of circuit connectivity and function in the visual system, including the formation of retinotopic maps and the refinement of receptive fields in downstream areas such as the thalamus and visual cortex. Recent work in mice has shown that retinal waves have statistical features matching those of natural visual stimuli, such as optic flow, suggesting that they could prime the visual system for motion processing upon vision onset. Motivated by these findings, we examined whether artificial neural network (ANN) models trained on natural movies show improved performance if pre-trained with retinal waves. We employed the spatio-temporally complex task of next-frame prediction, in which the ANN was trained to predict the next frame based on preceding input frames of a movie. We found that pre-training ANNs with retinal waves enhances the processing of real-world visual stimuli and accelerates learning. Strikingly, when we merely replaced the initial training epochs on naturalistic stimuli with retinal waves, keeping the total training time the same, we still found that an ANN trained on retinal waves temporarily outperforms one trained solely on natural movies. Similar to observations made in biological systems, we also found that pre-training with spontaneous activity refines the receptive field of ANN neurons. Overall, our work sheds light on the functional role of spatio-temporally patterned spontaneous activity in the processing of motion in natural scenes, suggesting it acts as a training signal to prepare the developing visual system for adult visual processing.

                <p>by Emma Von Hoene, Amira Roess, Hamdi Kavak, Taylor Anderson</p>

Agent-based models (ABMs) simulate the behaviors, interactions, and disease transmission between individual “agents” within their environment, enabling the investigation of the underlying processes driving disease dynamics and how these processes may be influenced by policy interventions. Despite the critical role that characteristics such as health attitudes and vaccination status play in disease outcomes, the initialization of agent populations with these variables is often oversimplified, overlooking statistical relationships between attitudes and other characteristics or lacking spatial heterogeneity. Leveraging population synthesis methods to create populations with realistic health attitudes and protective behaviors for spatial ABMs has yet to be fully explored. Therefore, this study introduces a novel application for generating synthetic populations with protective behaviors and associated attitudes using public health surveys instead of traditional individual-level survey datasets from the census. We test our approach using two different public health surveys to create two synthetic populations representing individuals aged 18 and over in Virginia, U.S., and their COVID-19 vaccine attitudes and uptake as of December 2021. Results show that integrating public health surveys into synthetic population generation processes preserves the statistical relationships between vaccine uptake and attitudes in different demographic groups while capturing spatial heterogeneity at fine scales. This approach can support disease simulations that aim to explore how real populations might respond to interventions and how these responses may lead to demographic or geographic health disparities. Our study also demonstrates the potential for initializing agents with variables relevant to public health domains that extend beyond infectious diseases, ultimately advancing data-driven ABMs for geographically targeted decision-making.

Gram-negative bacteria employ the type VI secretion system (T6SS) to deliver toxic effectors into neighboring cells and outcompete rivals. Although many effectors have been identified, their secretion mechanism often remains unknown. Here, we describe WHIX, a domain sufficient to mediate the secretion of effectors via the T6SS. Remarkably, we find WHIX in T6SS effectors that contain a single toxic domain, as well as in effectors that contain two distinct toxic domains fused to either side of WHIX. We demonstrate that the latter, which we name double-blade effectors, require two cognate immunity proteins to antagonize their toxicity. Furthermore, we show that WHIX can be used as a chassis for T6SS-mediated secretion of multiple domains. Our findings reveal a new class of polymorphic T6SS cargo effectors with a unique secretion domain that can deploy two toxic domains in one shot, possibly reducing recipients’ ability to defend themselves.

                Background In a district of the Lambayeque province, considerable levels of political disaffection are evident, manifesting not only in the alienation from power but also in a significant gap between citizens and government institutions. Although efforts have been made to continue the participatory trend in democratic institutions, innovative proposals for social intervention in political processes and decision-making are still needed. The study aimed to propose a model of conventional participation to mitigate political disaffection in Lambayeque, Peru. Methods The research was quantitative, with a non-experimental, descriptive-propositional design. It employed a survey technique applied to a randomly selected sample of 506 citizens from a total universe of 19,342 voters. Results The results indicate that the implementation of a conventional participatory practice, tailored to the sociocultural peculiarities of the district, positively impacts the political perception of the population. The findings reveal that a large portion of the Lambayeque population has disconnected from politics in everyday life, registering a general malaise that may reflect in future elections, as interest that does not translate into action is meaningless. Conclusions General distrust in institutions, particularly the sentiment of corruption, has fostered this detachment; moreover, the results reflect a rejection of the political system. Despite many being informed about politics, the feeling of participation remains impotent.

                Background The significant challenge in adolescent and young adult therapy lies in the fact that research in this field does not provide many clinical indications. This study addresses domains contributing to the establishment and sustenance of engagement, satisfaction, and progress among adolescents and young adults in their treatment by delving into the impact of events that, from the perspective of clients, have positively influenced their therapeutic process. Methods Employing a qualitative research approach, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 13 adolescents and young adults undergoing therapy, recounting positive and constructive events during their treatment. Results A structured thematic analysis revealed six primary domains of positive events: events linked to the management of the setting, events shaping the definition of therapy goals, occurrences tied to the therapist’s active role, collaborative events between therapists and clients, and events associated with both clients’ external and internal worlds. Conclusions The findings suggest that working with adolescents shares similarities with psychotherapy involving adult clients but demands specific attention to adolescents and young adults’ families, surrounding environment, and rapidly changing needs.

                Abstract Currently, machine learning applications in marketing allow to optimize strategies, personalize experiences and improve decision making. However, there are still several research gaps, so the objective is to examine the research trends in the use of machine learning in marketing. A bibliometric analysis is proposed to assess the current scientific activity, following the parameters established by PRISMA-2020. Machine learning applications in marketing have experienced steady growth and increased attention in the academic community. Key references, such as Miklosik and Evans, and prominent journals, such as IEEE Access and Journal of Business Research, have been identified. A thematic evolution towards big data and digital marketing is observed, and thematic clusters such as “digital marketing”, “interpretation”, “prediction”, and “healthcare" stand out. These findings demonstrate the continued importance and research potential of this evolving field.

                Background Stunting still represents a major public health problem in Egypt, impacting around one-third of children under five and leading to a 2-3% drop in Gross domestic product (GDP). Therefore, this study examined the trends in the prevalence of stunting and its associated factors among children aged 0-23 months, 24-59 months and 0-59 months in Egypt. Methods The study used combined data from the 2005, 2008, and 2014 Egypt Demographic and Health Surveys (EDHS), with a total sample of 39,857 children aged 0-59 months. A multilevel logistic regression that adjusts for sampling weights and clustering was performed to analyse the factors associated with stunting among children in Egypt. Results The prevalence of stunting was 24.8% in children aged 0-23 months, 24.3% in children aged 24-59 months, and 24.5 % in children aged 0-59 months. After controlling for potential confounders, the common factors associated with stunting in three age groups were mothers with primary education and mothers who did not have an antenatal care (ANC) visit during pregnancy. Maternal short stature (height < 155 cm) was associated with an increased risk of stunting in three age groups compared to mothers taller than 160 cm. Conclusion Addressing the causes of stunting in Egypt necessitates sectoral collaboration, including health, water, sanitation and hygiene, education, and social protection. Interventions should prioritise and be accessible to families with low socioeconomic status, focusing on improved healthcare access, parent education, and infant and young child feeding practices. A systematic nutrition monitoring framework that enables routine data collection on nutritional outcomes to monitor and improve child health is recommended.

<p>Cre-dependent viral tracing from medial dopaminergic ZI neurons revealed abundant fiber projections rostrocaudally throughout the brain. Interestingly, the midbrain motor regions, including the periaqueductal gray area and superior colliculus, contained the densest accumulation of fiber projections, and this fiber density was independent of the region size.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The zona incerta (ZI) supports diverse behaviors including binge feeding, sleep–wake cycles, nociception, and hunting. Diverse ZI functions can be attributed to its heterogeneous neurochemical characterization, cytoarchitecture, and efferent connections. The ZI is predominantly GABAergic, but we recently identified a subset of medial ZI GABA cells that are marked by the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and produce dopamine (DA). While the role of GABA within the ZI is well studied, less is known about the functions of ZI DA cells. To identify potential roles of ZI DA cells, we further phenotyped them and mapped their efferent fiber projections. We showed that wild-type TH-immunoreactive (-ir) ZI cells did not express somatostatin or calretinin immunoreactivity. We next validated a <i>Th-cre;L10-Egfp</i> mouse line and found that medial <i>Egfp</i> ZI cells were more likely to be TH-ir. We therefore delivered a Cre-dependent virus into the medial ZI of <i>Th-cre</i> or <i>Th-cre;L10-Egfp</i> mice and selected two injection cases for full brain mapping, namely, cases with the lowest and highest colocalization between TH-ir and virally transduced, DsRed-labeled cells, to identify common target sites. Overall, DsRed-labeled fibers were distributed brainwide and were most prominent within the motor-related midbrain (MBmot), notably the periaqueductal gray area and superior colliculus. We also observed numerous DsRed-labeled fibers within the polymodal association cortex-related thalamus (DORpm), like paraventricular thalamic nucleus and nucleus of reunions, that processes external and internal sensory input. Overall, ZI DA cells displayed a similar fiber profile to ZI GABA cells and may integrate sensory input to coordinate motor output at their target sites.</p>

     alt="Ultrastructural Contributions to Extrasynaptic Glutamatergic Signaling in Olfactory Bulb Glomeruli"/>
<p>Within olfactory bulb glomeruli, glutamate released from the dendrites of external tufted cells (eTCs) can excite mitral cells (MCs) through an atypical “extrasynaptic” mechanism. Here, we used serial section electron microscopy images of rat bulb glomeruli with biocytin-labeled MC and eTC dendrites to evaluate the potential ultrastructural underpinnings. Two features of the environment around eTC dendrodendritic synapses that could support extrasynaptic signaling included an unusually short distance to nearby excitatory dendrites as well as an absence of nearby astroglial processes.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Olfactory bulb glomeruli have a complex organization that includes axodendritic synapses between olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) and excitatory mitral cells (MCs) and tufted cells (TCs), as well as dendrodendritic synapses between MCs/TCs and GABAergic periglomerular cells (PGCs). MCs also receive excitatory signals from one subclass of TCs, the external tufted cells (eTCs). While these signals are driven by glutamate released from eTC dendrites, they appear not to reflect direct eTC &gt; MC synaptic connections but rather “spill-over” of glutamate released at eTC &gt; PGC synapses acting on nearby MC dendrites. Here, we used serial section electron microscopy images of rat olfactory bulb glomeruli with biocytin-labeled MC and eTC dendrites to evaluate potential ultrastructural underpinnings of “extrasynaptic” signaling. We compared the environment around eTC &gt; PGC synapses with that of MC &gt; PGC synapses using several quantitative measures and, as a further point of comparison, also evaluated axodendritic OSN &gt; MC and OSN &gt; eTC synapses. Across the four synapse types, one unique feature of eTC &gt; PGC synapses was their much closer distance to the nearest dendrites of excitatory cells (including MCs), averaging ∼160 nm. In contrast, astroglial processes were positioned quite far away from eTC &gt; PGC synapses, with a mean distance of ∼500 nm. These distance values would suggest that glutamate released from eTC &gt; PGC synapses may access nearby excitatory dendrites without interference from glial glutamate transporters, thus providing an ultrastructural basis for extrasynaptic signaling. Our battery of ultrastructural measures, which included brick analyses, also supported a long-standing model for the organization of glomeruli in which OSN and dendrodendritic synapses are segregated into discrete compartments.</p>

                The bacterial pole-localizer TmaR sequesters the sugar regulator EI in polar condensates. Albocher-Kedem et al. identify residues in EI and TmaR that impair their interaction and colocalization by genetic and microscopy screens. They then use these residues to generate a 3D interaction model that explains how TmaR controls EI activity.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91329">Inhibiting NINJ1-dependent plasma membrane rupture protects against inflammasome-induced blood coagulation and inflammation</a></h4>

              
                Systemic blood coagulation accompanies inflammation during severe infections like sepsis and COVID. We previously established a link between coagulopathy and pyroptosis, a vital defense mechanism against infection. During pyroptosis, the formation of gasdermin-D (GSDMD) pores on the plasma membrane leads to the release of tissue factor (TF)-positive microvesicles (MVs) that are procoagulant. Mice lacking GSDMD release fewer of these procoagulant MVs. However, the specific mechanisms coupling the activation of GSDMD to MV release remain unclear. Plasma membrane rupture (PMR) in pyroptosis was recently reported to be actively mediated by the transmembrane protein Ninjurin-1 (NINJ1). Here, we show that NINJ1 promotes procoagulant MV release during pyroptosis. Haploinsufficiency or glycine inhibition of NINJ1 limited the release of procoagulant MVs and inflammatory cytokines, and partially protected against blood coagulation and lethality triggered by bacterial flagellin. Our findings suggest a crucial role for NINJ1-dependent PMR in inflammasome-induced blood coagulation and inflammation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99358">Endosomal-lysosomal organellar assembly (ELYSA) structures coordinate lysosomal degradation systems through mammalian oocyte-to-embryo transition</a></h4>

              
                Mouse oocytes undergo drastic changes in organellar composition and their activities during maturation from the germinal vesicle (GV) to metaphase II (MII) stage. After fertilization, the embryo degrades parts of the maternal components via lysosomal degradation systems, including autophagy and endocytosis, as zygotic gene expression begins during embryogenesis. Here, we demonstrate that endosomal-lysosomal organelles form large spherical assembly structures, termed endosomal-lysosomal organellar assemblies (ELYSAs), in mouse oocytes. ELYSAs are observed in GV oocytes, attaining sizes up to 7–8 μm in diameter in MII oocytes. ELYSAs comprise tubular-vesicular structures containing endosomes and lysosomes along with cytosolic components. Most ELYSAs are also positive for an autophagy regulator, LC3. These characteristics of ELYSA resemble those of ELVA (endolysosomal vesicular assemblies) identified independently. The signals of V1-subunit of vacuolar ATPase tends to be detected on the periphery of ELYSAs in MII oocytes. After fertilization, the localization of the V1-subunit on endosomes and lysosomes increase as ELYSAs gradually disassemble at the 2-cell stage, leading to further acidification of endosomal-lysosomal organelles. These findings suggest that the ELYSA/ELVA maintain endosomal-lysosomal activity in a static state in oocytes for timely activation during early development.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101733">Proactive distractor suppression in early visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                Avoiding distraction by salient yet irrelevant stimuli is critical when accomplishing daily tasks. One possible mechanism to accomplish this is by suppressing stimuli that may be distracting such that they no longer compete for attention. While the behavioral benefits of distractor suppression are well established, its neural underpinnings are not yet fully understood. In a functional MRI (fMRI) study, we examined whether and how sensory responses in early visual areas show signs of distractor suppression after incidental learning of spatial statistical regularities. Participants were exposed to an additional singleton task where, unbeknownst to them, one location more frequently contained a salient distractor. We analyzed whether visual responses in terms of fMRI BOLD were modulated by this distractor predictability. Our findings indicate that implicit spatial priors shape sensory processing even at the earliest stages of cortical visual processing, evident in early visual cortex as a suppression of stimuli at locations which frequently contained distracting information. Notably, while this suppression was spatially (receptive field) specific, it did extend to nearby neutral locations and occurred regardless of whether distractors, nontarget items, or targets were presented at this location, suggesting that suppression arises before stimulus identification. Crucially, we observed similar spatially specific neural suppression even if search was only anticipated, but no search display was presented. Our results highlight proactive modulations in early visual cortex, where potential distractions are suppressed preemptively, before stimulus onset, based on learned expectations. Combined, our study underscores how the brain leverages implicitly learned prior knowledge to optimize sensory processing and attention allocation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/103877">A differentiable Gillespie algorithm for simulating chemical kinetics, parameter estimation, and designing synthetic biological circuits</a></h4>

              
                The Gillespie algorithm is commonly used to simulate and analyze complex chemical reaction networks. Here, we leverage recent breakthroughs in deep learning to develop a fully differentiable variant of the Gillespie algorithm. The differentiable Gillespie algorithm (DGA) approximates discontinuous operations in the exact Gillespie algorithm using smooth functions, allowing for the calculation of gradients using backpropagation. The DGA can be used to quickly and accurately learn kinetic parameters using gradient descent and design biochemical networks with desired properties. As an illustration, we apply the DGA to study stochastic models of gene promoters. We show that the DGA can be used to: (1) successfully learn kinetic parameters from experimental measurements of mRNA expression levels from two distinct <i>Escherichia coli</i> promoters and (2) design nonequilibrium promoter architectures with desired input–output relationships. These examples illustrate the utility of the DGA for analyzing stochastic chemical kinetics, including a wide variety of problems of interest to synthetic and systems biology.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100665">Becker muscular dystrophy mice showed site-specific decay of type IIa fibers with capillary change in skeletal muscle</a></h4>

              
                Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD), an X-linked muscular dystrophy, is mostly caused by an in-frame deletion of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). BMD severity varies from asymptomatic to severe, associated with the genotype of DMD. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We established BMD mice carrying three representative exon deletions: ex45–48 del., ex45–47 del., and ex45–49 del. (d45–48, d45–47, and d45–49), with high frequencies and different severities in the human BMD hotspot. All three BMD mice showed muscle weakness, muscle degeneration, and fibrosis, but these changes appeared at different times for each exon deletion, consistent with the severities obtained by the natural history study of BMD. BMD mice showed site-specific muscle changes, unlike <i>mdx</i> mice, which showed diffuse muscle changes, and we demonstrated selective type IIa fiber reduction in BMD mice. Furthermore, BMD mice showed sarcolemmal neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) reduction and morphological capillary changes around type IIa fibers. These results suggest that capillary changes caused by nNOS reduction may be associated with the mechanism of skeletal muscle degeneration and type IIa fiber reduction in BMD mice. BMD mice may be useful in elucidating the pathomechanisms and developing vascular targeted therapies for human BMD.

">Markov models bridge behavioral strategies and circuit principles facilitating thermoregulation</a></h4>

              
                Behavioral thermoregulation is critical for survival across animals, including endothermic mammals. However, we do not understand how neural circuits control navigation towards preferred temperatures. Zebrafish exclusively regulate body temperature via behavior, making them ideal for studying thermal navigation. Here, we combine behavioral analysis, machine learning and calcium imaging to understand how larval zebrafish seek out preferred temperatures within thermal gradients. By developing a stimulus-controlled Markov model of thermal navigation we find that hot avoidance largely relies on the modulation of individual swim decisions. The avoidance of cold temperatures, a particular challenge in ectotherms, however relies on a deliberate strategy combining gradient alignment and directed reversals. Calcium imaging identified neurons within the medulla encoding thermal stimuli that form a place-code like representation of the gradient. Our findings establish a key link between neural activity and thermoregulatory behavior, elucidating the neural basis of how animals seek out preferred temperatures.

">Differential Effects of Cocaine Self-Administration Regimens on Incubation of Cocaine Craving and Nucleus Accumbens Neuronal Ensembles Activated by Cocaine-Associated Context</a></h4>

              
                Drug addiction develops in a subset of users following repeated exposure, influenced by biopsychosocial factors. Rodent self-administration protocols, varying in drug access times, are used to study both controlled and compulsive drug-taking behaviors and their neurobiological underpinnings. Drug-associated cues and environmental contexts are well-established triggers for relapse, with susceptibility to these stimuli peaking during early abstinence and remaining elevated, thereby increasing relapse risk. This phenomenon, known as incubation of craving, has been replicated across substances in animal models. The associative learning between drug effects and contextual cues is encoded by neuronal ensembles activated by drug-associated stimuli, driving craving, seeking, and relapse. Neuronal ensembles in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) are strongly involved in drug seeking, with parvalbumin-expressing fast-spiking interneurons playing a key role in this associative learning process. We investigated activation patterns in the NAcc triggered by cocaine-related cues following restricted- or extended-access self-administration and examined how forced abstinence alters these patterns, contributing to the incubation of cocaine craving. We also analyzed the engagement of parvalbumin-positive interneurons in NAcc neuronal ensembles before and after forced abstinence. Our findings show that the extended access protocol more effectively induced the incubation of cocaine craving. Neuronal activation in the NAcc core increased after thirty days of forced abstinence in both groups, with extended access rats showing consistently higher activation. Forced abstinence also increased NAcc shell activation, with no differences between protocols. NAcc core activation, but not shell, was influenced by cocaine consumption during training. Notably, extended access rats exhibited reduced parvalbumin interneurons activation following thirty days of forced abstinence. Based on these findings, we speculate that the transition from occasional to compulsive drug-taking may be driven by molecular changes in the NAcc core that enhance its responsiveness to drug-related cues. Additionally, the incubation of craving could be linked to impaired inhibitory control of NAcc core medium spiny neurons by PV interneurons.

">A fast nociceptive subsystem mediating rapid reflexive behavior but not affective pain</a></h4>

              
                Spinal nociceptive withdrawal reflexes are widely believed to rely on unmyelinated and thinly myelinated nociceptive fibers that also signal affective and motivational aspects of pain. Here we discover a population of myelinated mechanoreceptive nociceptor that forms free nerve endings as well as circumferential endings around hair follicles, and exclusively terminate in the deep spinal dorsal horn. Optogenetic activation of these fibers triggers rapid withdrawal reflexes that are precise and selective for the targeted limb, while silencing increases the threshold of mechanical nociceptive withdrawal reflexes. By contrast, optogenetic stimulation of the fibers is not associated with place aversion nor with changes in facial expression. Thus, we conclude that this nerve fiber population is uniquely positioned to rapidly respond to mechanical threats via selective withdrawal of the targeted body part, whereas other fast and slow nociceptive pathways are required for affective-motivational aspects of pain.

">Characterization and targeting of the endosomal signaling of the gastrin releasing peptide receptor in pruritus.</a></h4>

              
                Chronic pruritus is a major unmet clinical problem affecting one in four adults. G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are key receptors driving itch signaling and are a therapeutic target for itch relief. The endosomal signaling of GPCRs provides new challenges for understanding how GPCR signaling is regulated, how endosomal signaling of GPCRs contributes to disease states like chronic pruritus and opens new targets for therapeutic development. The Gastrin releasing peptide receptor (GRPR) is a key mediator of pruritus in the spinal cord. Yet, little is known about the molecular mechanisms regulating GRPR signaling in pruritus, if GRPR can signal from endosomes, or the role of endosomal GRPR in the development of pruritus. Here we show the importance of internalization and endosomal signaling of GRPR in pruritus. Agonist induced GRPR internalization and trafficking was quantified using BRET or microscopy while endosomal-mediated ERK signaling was measured using compartmentalized FRET biosensors. Recruitment of G proteins to endosomes was measured with NanoBit BRET. pH sensitive mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSN) which accumulated in endosomes were used to deliver RC-3095, a GRPR specific antagonist, intracellularly to block endosomal signaling of GRPR. MSN-RC proved more effective than free RC-3095 at inhibiting chloroquine scratching in mice. Our results demonstrate a critical role for GRPR endosomal signaling in itch sensation. These results highlight the ability of endosomally targeted antagonist to inhibit GRPR signaling and provide a new target for developing therapeutics that block GRPR mediated pruritus.

">From comparative connectomics to large-scale working memory modeling in macaque and marmoset</a></h4>

              
                Although macaques and marmosets are both primates of choice for studying the brain mechanisms of cognition, they differ in key aspects of anatomy and behavior. Interestingly, recent connectomic analysis revealed that strong top-down projections from the prefrontal cortex to the posterior parietal cortex, present in macaques and important for executive function, are absent in marmosets. Here, we propose a consensus mapping that bridges the two species' cortical atlases and allows for direct area-to-area comparison of their connectomes, which are then used to build comparative computational large-scale modeling of the frontoparietal circuit for working memory. We found that the macaque model exhibits resilience against distractors, a prerequisite for normal working memory function. By contrast, the marmoset model is sensitive to distractibility commonly observed behaviorally in this species. Surprisingly, this contrasting trend can be swapped by scaling intrafrontal and frontoparietal connections. Finally, the relevance to primate ethology and evolution is discussed.

">Neotenic expansion of adult-born dentate granule cells reconfigures GABAergic inhibition to enhance social memory consolidation</a></h4>

              
                Adult-born dentate granule cells (abDGCs) contribute to hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG)-CA3/CA2 circuit functions in memory encoding, retrieval and consolidation. Heightened synaptic and structural plasticity of immature abDGCs is thought to govern their distinct contributions to circuit and network mechanisms of hippocampal-dependent memory operations. Protracted maturation or neoteny of abDGCs in higher mammals is hypothesized to offset decline in adult hippocampal neurogenesis by expanding the capacity for circuit and network plasticity underlying different memory operations. Here, we provide evidence for this hypothesis by genetically modelling the effective impact of neoteny of abDGCs on circuitry, network properties and social cognition in mice. We show that selective synchronous expansion of a single cohort of 4 weeks old immature, but not 8 weeks old mature abDGCs, increases functional recruitment of fast spiking parvalbumin expressing inhibitory interneurons (PV INs) in CA3/CA2, number of PV IN-CA3/CA2 synapses, and GABAergic inhibition of CA3/CA2. This transient increase in feed-forward inhibition in DG-CA2 decreased social memory interference and enhanced social memory consolidation. In vivo local field potential recordings revealed that the expansion of a single cohort of 4-week-old abDGCs increased baseline power, amplitude, and duration, as well as sensitivity to social investigation-dependent rate changes of sharp-wave ripples (SWRs) in CA1 and CA2, a neural substrate for memory consolidation. Inhibitory neuron-targeted chemogenetic manipulations implicate CA3/CA2 INs, including PV INs, as necessary and sufficient for social memory consolidation following neotenic expansion of the abDGC population and in wild-type mice, respectively. These studies suggest that neoteny of abDGCs may represent an evolutionary adaptation to support cognition by reconfiguring PV IN-CA3/CA2 circuitry and emergent network properties underlying memory consolidation.

">Complementary roles for hippocampus and anterior cingulate in composing continuous choice</a></h4>

              
                Naturalistic, goal directed behavior often requires continuous actions directed at dynamically changing goals. In this context, the closest analogue to choice is a strategic reweighting of multiple goal-specific control policies in response to shifting environmental pressures. To understand the algorithmic and neural bases of choice in continuous contexts, we examined behavior and brain activity in humans performing a continuous prey-pursuit task. Using a newly developed control-theoretic decomposition of behavior, we find pursuit strategies are well described by a meta-controller dictating a mixture of lower-level controllers, each linked to specific pursuit goals. Examining hippocampus and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) population dynamics during goal switches revealed distinct roles for the two regions in parameterizing continuous controller mixing and meta-control. Hippocampal ensemble dynamics encoded the controller blending dynamics, suggesting it implements a mixing of goal-specific control policies. In contrast, ACC ensemble activity exhibited value-dependent ramping activity before goal switches, linking it to a meta-control process that accumulates evidence for switching goals. Our results suggest that hippocampus and ACC play complementary roles corresponding to a generalizable mixture controller and meta-controller that dictates value dependent changes in controller mixing.

">Single-cell Spatial Transcriptomics Reveals Disease-specificMicroenvironmental Niches in Neurodegeneration and COVID-19</a></h4>

              
                Neurodegenerative diseases and infections can produce lasting effects on brain function, yet the spatial molecular mechanisms underlying these changes remain poorly understood. Here, we present high-resolution spatial transcriptomics of 40 postmortem brain samples from patients with Parkinson's disease, frontotemporal dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies, and severe COVID-19. Analyzing over 1.5 million spatially resolved cells across dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex revealed disease-specific transcriptional signatures with pronounced layer- and region-specificity. In Parkinson's disease, we identified stressed neurons creating distinctive microenvironmental gradients where metabolic and protein degradation pathways are elevated near stress epicenters, while regenerative processes increase with distance. COVID-19 brains displayed extensive peripheral immune cell infiltration, particularly in the subcortical white matter, accompanied by compromised blood-brain barrier and coordinated neuroinflammatory responses from microglia, astrocytes, and endothelial cells. Integration of miRNA sequencing with spatial transcriptomics uncovered layer-specific regulatory patterns, including neuroinflammation-associated miR-155. This atlas provides unprecedented insights into disease pathology and highlights the critical importance of spatial molecular context in understanding brain disorders.

">Transcranial electrical stimulation for memory enhancement: A systematic review and meta-analysis</a></h4>

              
                Background Non-invasive brain stimulation techniques have received increasing interest for their potential to enhance memory function, a fundamental cognitive aspect of daily life. Methods This systematic review and meta-analysis investigated the efficacy of transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) in enhancing memory function in healthy adults, following the pre-registered strategy at PROSPERO (CRD42022353630). Results A total of 66 articles (119 trials, 3,786 participants) focusing on transcranial direct current stimulation and transcranial alternating current stimulation were identified. Meta-analysis revealed a significant overall effect of tES on memory function compared with sham stimulation (standardized mean difference [95% confidence interval] = 0.19 [0.12-0.27]), with anodal transcranial direct current stimulation showing the most consistent enhancement. In particular, stimulation of the frontal regions effectively improved working and declarative memories. While the effects remained significant within hours post stimulation, they diminished after one day or longer. Regarding adverse events, tingling and itching sensations on the scalp occurred more frequently in the active group than in the sham group, but no severe adverse events were reported. Challenges, including publication bias, heterogeneity, and bias toward specific aspects of memory were noted, emphasizing the need for improved experimental rigor and diversification of memory tasks. Conclusion These findings highlight the potential of tES as a safe and effective tool for memory enhancement while emphasizing areas for future research to develop its applications.

">Proteomic Analysis of Endemic Viral Infections in Neuronsoffers Insights into Neurodegenerative Diseases</a></h4>

              
                Endemic viral infections with low pathogenicity are often overlooked due to their mild symptoms, yet they can exert long-term effects on cellular function and contribute to disease pathogenesis. While viral infections have been implicated in neurodegenerative disorders, their impact on the neuronal proteome remains poorly understood. Here, we differentiated human induced pluripotent stem cells (KOLF2.1J) into mature neurons to investigate virus-induced proteomic changes following infection with five neurotropic endemic human viruses: Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), Human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), Varicella-Zoster virus (VZV), and Influenza A virus (H1N1). Given that these viruses can infect adults and have the potential to cross the placental barrier, their molecular impact on neurons may be relevant across the lifespan. Using mass spectrometry-based proteomics with a customized library for simultaneous detection of human and viral proteins, we confirmed successful infections and identified virus-specific proteomic signatures. Notably, virus-induced protein expression changes converged on key neuronal pathways, including those associated with neurodegeneration. Gene co-expression network analysis identified protein modules correlated with viral proteins. Pathway enrichment analysis of these modules revealed associations with the nervous system, including pathways linked to Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. Remarkably, several viral-induced proteomic alterations overlapped with changes observed in postmortem Alzheimer's patient brains, suggesting a mechanistic connection between viral exposure and neurodegenerative disease progression. These findings provide molecular insights into how common viral infections perturb neuronal homeostasis and may contribute to neurodegenerative pathology, highlighting the need to consider endemic viruses as potential environmental risk factors in neurological disorders.

">Hippocampal sequences represent working memory and implicit timing</a></h4>

              
                Working memory (WM) and timing are considered distinct cognitive functions, yet the neural signatures underlying both can be similar. To address the hypothesis that WM and timing may be multiplexed we developed a novel rodent task where 1st odor identity predicts the delay duration. We found that WM performance decreased when delay expectations were violated. Performance was worse for unexpected long delays than for unexpected short delays, suggesting that WM may be tuned to expire in a delay-dependent manner. Calcium imaging of dorsal CA1 neurons revealed odor-specific sequential activity tiling the short and long delays. Neural sequence structure also reflected expectation of the timing of the 2nd odor - i.e., of the expected delay. Consistent with the hypothesis that WM and timing may be multiplexed, our findings suggest that neural sequences in dorsal CA1 may encode cues and cue-specific elapsed time during the delay period of a WM task.

                Testing enhances memory more than studying. Although numerous studies have demonstrated the robustness of this classic effect, its neural and computational origin remains debated. Predictive learning is a potential mechanism behind this phenomenon: Because predictions and prediction errors (mismatch between predictions and feedback) can only be generated in testing (and not in studying), testing can benefit from predictive learning. We shed light on the testing effect from a multi-level analysis perspective via a combination of cognitive neuroscience experiments (fMRI) and computational modeling. At the neural level, we find that testing activates the canonical brain area related to reward prediction error, namely the ventral striatum. Crucially, activation in the ventral striatum fully mediates the testing effect. Computationally, only a model incorporating predictive learning can account for the full breadth of behavioral patterns observed in the data. These results provide strong and converging evidence for a predictive learning account of the testing effect.

                Activity-dependent synaptic remodeling, essential for neural circuit plasticity, is orchestrated by central organizers within the postsynaptic density (PSD), including the scaffolding protein PSD95. However, the molecular mechanisms driving this process remain incompletely understood. Here, we identify CDKL5, a protein associated with a severe neurodevelopmental condition known as CDKL5 deficiency disorder (CDD), as a critical regulator of structural plasticity at excitatory synapses. We show that CDKL5 undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) in vitro and in cultured neurons, forming co-condensates with PSD95. This LLPS-driven process spatially organizes synaptic components, specifically enabling the synaptic recruitment of Kalirin7 to promote dendritic spine enlargement. Pathogenic mutations disrupt condensate formation by impairing the LLPS capacity of CDKL5, directly linking phase separation defects to the pathogenesis of CDD. Our findings reveal a crucial role for CDKL5 in synaptic plasticity and establish LLPS as a fundamental mechanism by which CDKL5 coordinates molecular events to reorganize PSD architecture during synaptic remodeling.

                Although the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamic (CBGT) network is identified as a central circuit for decision-making, the dynamic interplay of multiple control pathways within this network in shaping decision trajectories remains poorly understood. Here we develop and apply a novel computational framework --- CLAW (Circuit Logic Assessed via Walks) --- for tracing the instantaneous flow of neural activity as it progresses through CBGT networks engaged in a virtual decision-making task. Our CLAW analysis reveals that the complex dynamics of network activity is functionally dissectible into two critical phases: deliberation and commitment. These two phases are governed by distinct contributions of underlying CBGT pathways, with indirect and pallidostriatal pathways influencing deliberation, while the direct pathway drives action commitment. We translate CBGT dynamics into the evolution of decision-related policies, based on three previously identified control ensembles (responsiveness, pliancy, and choice) that encapsulate the relationship between CBGT activity and the evidence accumulation process. Our results demonstrate two contrasting strategies for decision-making. Fast decisions, with direct pathway dominance, feature an early response in both boundary height and drift rate, leading to a rapid collapse of decision boundaries and a clear directional bias. In contrast, slow decisions, driven by indirect and pallidostriatal pathway dominance, involve delayed changes in both decision policy parameters, allowing for an extended period of deliberation before commitment to an action. These analyses provide important insights into how the CBGT circuitry can be tuned to adopt various decision strategies and how the decision-making process unfolds within each regime.

">SYSTEM XC- AS A MOLECULAR MECHANISM FOR EVOLUTIONARY NEW FORMS OF ADVANCED COGNITION</a></h4>

              
                Human cognitive abilities are deeply rooted in evolutionary building blocks that maximize computation while maintaining efficiency. These abilities are not without evolutionary signatures; conserved processes like vision have undergone continual phylogenetic adjustments to better serve ecological niches. Conversely, more sophisticated forms of cognition may have required evolutionary innovations to transform existing neuronal processing to expand computational abilities. One such innovation is system xc- (Sxc), a cystine-glutamate antiporter predominantly localized to astrocytes that emerged in deuterostomes (e.g., vertebrates) after their divergence from protostomes over 550 million years ago. Previous evidence suggests that genetically modified rats that lack functional Sxc (MSxc) exhibit enhanced cocaine-seeking behavior. In this study, we deconstructed drug-seeking into its component behaviors, categorizing them as reliant on evolutionary conserved or newly evolved cognitive processes. Our results reveal that Sxc function is dispensable for conserved processes like visual, emotional, and hedonic processing, but critical for advanced, evolutionary new cognitive functions, particularly impulse control and decision making. Notably, we demonstrate a temporally specific reliance on Sxc during the learning phase of optimal decision-making, but not in maintaining established strategies. This is an important addition to our current understanding of astrocytes in non-homeostatic functions, indicating their critical role in computationally demanding phases of learning and memory. Unraveling evolutionary innovations like Sxc not only deepens our understanding of cognitive evolution but also paves the way for revolutionary, precision-targeted therapies in neuropsychiatric disorders, potentially transforming treatment paradigms and patient outcomes.

">Transcriptional Profiles in Nucleus Accumbens of Antidepressant Resistance in Chronically Stressed Mice</a></h4>

              
                Unsuccessful response to several courses of antidepressants is a core feature of treatment-resistant depression (TRD), a severe condition that affects a third of patients with depression treated with conventional pharmacotherapy. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying TRD remain poorly understood. Here, we assessed the successful vs. unsuccessful response to ketamine (KET) in chronically stressed mice that failed to respond to initial treatment with fluoxetine (FLX) as a rodent model of TRD and characterized the associated transcriptional profiles in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) using RNA-sequencing. We observed that failed treatment with FLX exerts a priming effect that promotes behavioral and transcriptional responses to subsequent ketamine treatment. We also identified specific gene networks that are linked to both susceptibility to stress and resistance to antidepressant response. Collectively, these findings offer valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying antidepressant resistance and help address a critical gap in preclinical models of TRD.

">Mapping energy metabolism systems in the human brain</a></h4>

              
                Energy metabolism involves a network of biochemical reactions that generate ATP, utilizing substrates such as glucose and oxygen supplied via cerebral blood flow. Energy substrates are metabolized in multiple interrelated pathways that are cell- and organelle-specific. These pathways not only generate energy but are also fundamental to the production of essential biomolecules required for neuronal function and survival. How these complex biochemical processes are distributed over the cortex is integral to understanding the structure and function of the brain. Here, using curated gene sets and whole-brain transcriptomics, we generate maps of five fundamental energy metabolic pathways: glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway, tricarboxylic acid cycle, oxidative phosphorylation and lactate metabolism. We find consistent divergence between primarily energy-producing pathways and anabolic pathways, particularly in unimodal sensory cortices. We then explore the spatial alignment of these maps with multi-scale structural and functional attributes, including metabolic uptake, neurophysiological oscillations, cell type composition, laminar organization and macro-scale connectivity. Finally, we show that metabolic pathways exhibit unique developmental trajectories from the fetal stage to adulthood. The primary energy-producing pathways peak in late childhood, while the anabolic pentose phosphate pathway shows pronounced expression in the fetal stage and declines throughout life. Together, these results highlight the rich biochemical complexity of energy metabolism organization in the brain.

">Role of CaMKIIa reticular neurons of caudal medulla in control of posture</a></h4>

              
                Terrestrial quadrupeds actively stabilize dorsal-side-up orientation of the body in space due to activity of the postural control system. Supraspinal influences, including those from the reticular formation, play a crucial role in the operation of this system. However, the role of specific molecularly identified populations of reticular neurons in control of posture remains unknown. The aim of the present study was to reveal the role of CaMKIIa reticular neurons (CaMKIIa-RNs) located in the caudal medulla in control of posture. For this purpose, the effects of unilateral chemogenetic activation/inactivation of CaMKII-RNs on different aspects of postural control were studied in mice. It was found that unilateral activation of CaMKIIa-RNs evoked ipsilateral roll tilt of the head and trunk, caused by flexion/adduction of the ipsilateral limbs and extension/abduction of the contralateral limbs. The body roll tilt was actively stabilized on the tilting platform and maintained during walking. Unilateral inactivation of CaMKIIa-RNs evoked the opposite effects. Histological analyses showed that the population of CaMKIIa-RNs in the caudal medulla contains reticulospinal neurons that project to the spinal cord mainly through ipsilateral lateral funiculus and terminate in the intermediate area of the gray matter. We demonstrated that although the population of CaMKIIa-RNs contains both excitatory and inhibitory neurons, the excitatory ones dominate. Thus, CaMKIIa-RNs located in the caudal medulla play a crucial role for maintenance of the dorsal-side-up body orientation in different environments. Left/right symmetry and asymmetry in activity of CaMKIIa-RNs allows animals to maintain dorsal-side-up body orientation on horizontal and laterally inclined surfaces, respectively.

">PACAP Signaling Network in the Nucleus Accumbens Core Regulates Reinstatement Behavior in Rat</a></h4>

              
                Cocaine use disorder (CUD) lacks FDA-approved treatments, partly due to the difficulty of creating therapeutics that target behavior-related neural circuits without disrupting signaling throughout the brain. Recent evidence highlights the therapeutic potential of targeting gut-brain axis components, such as GLP-1 receptors, to modulate neural circuits with minimal central nervous system disruption. Like GLP-1, pituitary adenylate cyclase polypeptide (PACAP) is a component of the gut-brain axis that regulates behavior through a network spanning the gut and brain. Here, we investigated the potential existence and function of an endogenous PACAP signaling network within the nucleus accumbens core (NAcc), which is a structure that integrates emotional, cognitive, and reward processes underlying behavior. We found that PACAP and its receptor, PAC1R, are endogenously expressed in the rat NAcc and that PACAP mRNA is present in medial prefrontal cortical projections to the NAcc. Behaviorally, intra-NAcc infusions of PACAP (100 pm) did not induce seeking behavior but blocked cocaine-primed reinstatement (10 mg/kg, IP). Intra-NAcc PACAP also inhibited reinstatement driven by co-infusion of the D1 receptor agonist (SKF 81297, 3 microg) but not the D2 receptor agonist (sumanirole, 10 ng). These findings are significant since D1 and D2 receptor activities in the NAcc govern distinct behavioral mechanisms indicating precise actions of PACAP even within the NAcc. Future research should examine whether NAcc PACAP signaling can be selectively engaged by peripheral gut-brain axis mechanisms, potentially unveiling novel therapeutic approaches for CUD and related disorders.

">A NaV1.8FlpO mouse enabling selective intersectional targeting of low threshold C fiber mechanoreceptors and nociceptors</a></h4>

              
                Genetic targeting of select populations of cells in the mouse nervous system is often hampered by a lack of selectivity, as candidate genes for such targeting are commonly expressed by multiple cell populations, also in the same region. Intersectional targeting using two or more genes has been enabled by the development of reporter tools dependent on more than one recombinase or gene regulator. Still, widespread adoption of intersectional tools is complicated by a scarcity of driver mice expressing recombinases otherthan Cre. Here we report the generation and characterization of a new driver mouse that expresses the FlpO recombinase from the endogenous locus of the Scn10a gene encoding NaV1.8, a voltage-gated sodium channel that is almost exclusively expressed in the afferent limb of the peripheral nervous system. Moreover, among sensory neurons the channel is preferentially expressed in nociceptors and in low-threshold C-fiber mechanoreceptors (C-LTMRs). The mouse showed high recombination efficiency (97 %) and selectivity (93 %) in dorsal root ganglia. Reporter-expressing fibers were observed in a variety of peripheral tissues, including skin, skeletal muscle, genitalia, bladder and intestines. To validate the suitability of the FlpO mouse line for intersectional targeting, we crossed it with a mouse line expressing CreERT2 from the Th (tyrosine hydroxylase) locus. This approach resulted in strikingly selective and efficient targeting of C-LTMRs, showing robust visualization of nerve endings of these fibers in skin and spinal cord at the light and electron microscopic level. Thus, the NaV1.8Flpo mouse line presented here constitutes a selective and versatile tool for intersectional genetic targeting of NaV1.8 expressing primary afferent neurons.

">Eye movements anticipate target rebounds in an interception task</a></h4>

              
                Predictive control in humans enables anticipatory behavior by combining sensory feedback with internal forward models. In interception tasks, such predictive processing could enable the visual system to estimate future target positions, thereby facilitating precise and timely motor responses. This study investigated the existence of predictive fixations during a visuomotor task where participants used a joystick to intercept a target that rebounded within a circular arena. We categorized eye movements into fixations, smooth pursuits, and saccades using a threshold-based classification method. The task's circular geometry simplified trajectory analysis by consistently redirecting the target toward the arena's center after rebounds, enabling clear identification of predictive fixations. Results showed that participants consistently aligned their gaze and joystick movements with the target's anticipated trajectory before rebounds. Similarly, fixation and gaze onsets showed pre-rebound adjustments, using learned statistical regularities of rebounds to anticipate and prepare for changes in the target's trajectory. Directional cues from the target's entry angles just before rebounding influenced gaze alignment and prediction accuracy, while target speeds affected fixation locations. Moreover, masking the target disrupted gaze alignment and increased variability, whereas masking the user had minimal effects, highlighting the importance of target visibility in predictive control. These findings demonstrate the crucial role of predictive fixations in visuomotor coordination, offering a broader understanding of anticipatory behaviors and their applications in dynamic tasks. Our task's design offers a robust framework for studying predictive processing across individuals, with implications for sports performance, clinical diagnostics, and human-computer interaction.

">FM-dye inhibition of Piezo2 relieves acute inflammatory and osteoarthritis knee pain in mice of both sexes</a></h4>

              
                Musculoskeletal pain is a significant burden affecting billions of people with little progress in the development of pharmaceutical pain relief options. The mechanically-activated ion channel Piezo2 has been shown to play a role in mechanical sensitization; however there has been little progress in examining therapeutics that target this molecule. The goal of this study was to assess the effect of two FM-dyes, FM1-43 or FM4-64, in reducing acute inflammatory and osteoarthritis knee joint pain in mice of both sexes. In our acute model of Complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA)-induced joint pain, mice intra-articularly injected with FM1-43 exhibited an attenuation of knee hyperalgesia 90 minutes following injection. In vivo calcium imaging of the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) also demonstrated a reduction in nociceptor responses to mechanical forces applied to the knee joint of CFA mice following FM-dye injection. Male and female WT mice subjected to partial medial meniscectomy (PMX) surgery as a model of osteoarthritis developed more severe knee hyperalgesia than nociceptor-specific Piezo2 conditional knock-out mice. Intra-articular injection of FM1-43 reduced both knee hyperalgesia and weight-bearing asymmetry in this model and had no effect in Piezo2 conditional knock-out mice. Finally, in mice with spontaneous osteoarthritis associated with aging, intra-articular injection of FM-dyes also reduced knee hyperalgesia. In conclusion, inhibiting Piezo2 genetically or pharmacologically was effective in reducing pain-related behaviors in mice of both sexes in the setting of inflammatory and osteoarthritis knee pain. These studies provide evidence of the therapeutic potential of targeting Piezo2 in musculoskeletal pain conditions.

">Chemical targeting of the ATXN1 aa99-163 interaction site suppresses polyQ-expanded protein dimerization</a></h4>

              
                Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by the expansion of a polyglutamine (polyQ) tract in the ATXN1 protein. This expansion is thought to be responsible for the gradual aggregation of the mutant protein, which is associated with increased cytotoxicity and neuronal cell death. Apart from the polyQ tract, other domains in ATXN1 are also involved in the initial events of protein aggregation such as a dimerization domain that promotes protein oligomerization. ATXN1 interacts with various proteins; among them, MED15 that significantly enhances the aggregation of the polyQ-expanded protein. Therefore, we set to identify the interaction site between ATXN1 and MED15 and assess whether its chemical targeting would affect polyQ protein aggregation. First, we predicted the structure of ATXN1 and MED15 and simulated their interaction. We experimentally validated that amino acids (aa) 99-163 of ATXN1 and aa548-665 of MED15 are critical for this protein-protein interaction (PPI). We also show that the aa99-163 domain in ATXN1 is involved in the dimerization of the mutant isoform. Targeting this domain with a chemical compound identified through virtual screening (Chembridge ID: 5755483) inhibited both the interaction of ATXN1 with MED15 and the dimerization of polyQ-expanded ATXN1. These results strengthen our assumption that the aa99-163 domain of ATXN1 may be involved in polyQ protein aggregation and highlight compound 5755483 as a potent first-in-class therapeutic agent for SCA1.

">Intracortical transplantation of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived progenitors ameliorates delayed thalamic degeneration following cortical stroke</a></h4>

              
                Ischemic stroke, a leading cause of death and disability worldwide, frequently results in cortical damage. Due to disrupted neural connectivity, cortical lesions often trigger secondary neurodegeneration in remote brain regions, such as the thalamus. This secondary thalamic injury exacerbates neurological deficits, leading to long-term sensory, motor, and cognitive impairments. Although animal models have demonstrated that secondary thalamic damage is driven by retrograde degeneration, excitotoxicity, apoptosis, blood-brain barrier disruption, and neuroinflammation, the mechanisms linking cortical stroke to thalamic degeneration remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the dynamics of secondary thalamic injury in a rat model of cortical stroke. We evaluated the therapeutic potential of intracortical transplantation of human induced pluripotent stem cell iPSC)-derived neuronal progenitors. Cortical ischemic stroke was induced via distal middle cerebral artery occlusion, and animals were assessed at multiple time points post-stroke. We observed stable cortical infarcts by 2 weeks, followed by progressive thalamic degeneration, particularly in the ventral posterior nucleus (VPN), which began at 3 months and persisted up to 6 months. Neuronal loss in the VPN correlated with the size of the cortical lesion, and microglial activation in the thalamus peaked at 2-4 months, suggesting a role for neuroinflammation in secondary degeneration. Intracortical transplantation of cortically primed iPSC-derived progenitors 48 hours post-stroke did not alter the cortical infarct volume but significantly reduced thalamic neuronal loss. Grafted cells integrated into the host tissue and presumably established functional connections, potentially mitigating secondary thalamic injury. These findings highlight the therapeutic potential of stem cell-based interventions to prevent secondary neurodegeneration and improve long-term outcomes after cortical stroke. This study provides critical insights into the mechanisms of secondary thalamic injury and demonstrates the feasibility of intracortical transplantation as a strategy to enhance post-stroke recovery.

">Leaky evidence accumulation accounts for perceptual confidence and subjective duration</a></h4>

              
                Perceptual consciousness is defined as the subjective experience associated with the processing of sensory cues from the environment. Subjective experience unfolds over time and is accompanied by a sense of confidence, yet the mechanisms underlying these two properties remain elusive. Here, we propose a computational mechanism that accounts not only for the onset of subjective experience but also its subjective duration and associated feeling of confidence. Our model assumes that a percept becomes conscious when an ongoing, leaky accumulation of sensory evidence surpasses a perceptual threshold and stops being conscious when it falls back below the threshold due to leakage. Crucially, this perceptual threshold can be lower than the decision threshold for reporting the percept. Moreover, our model derives confidence in accurately detecting sensory evidence from the maximum reached by the evidence accumulation process following stimulus onset. We conducted a preregistered study in which three distinct models of evidence accumulation were fitted to behavioral reports of detection, confidence, and subjective duration during a face detection task under temporal uncertainty. The leaky evidence accumulation model accounted for the observed behavioral data best and outperformed alternative models without leakage. In a follow-up experiment, we investigated the impact of leakage adaptation on detection and subjective duration. We found that changes in leakage induced by contextual variations of face duration influenced both detection rates and subjective duration, as predicted by our model. Altogether, our findings suggest that leaky evidence accumulation is a suitable candidate mechanism to explain qualitative aspects of subjective experience, including subjective duration and feelings of confidence.

">Overcoming sensory-memory interference in working memory circuits</a></h4>

              
                Memories of recent stimuli are crucial for guiding behavior, but the sensory pathways responsible for encoding these memories are continuously bombarded by new sensory experiences. How the brain overcomes interference between sensory input and working memory representations remains largely unknown. To formalize the solution space, we examined recurrent neural networks that were either hand-designed or trained using gradient descent methods, and compared these models with neural data from two different macaque experiments. Here we report mechanisms by which neural networks overcome sensory-memory interference using both static and dynamic coding strategies: gating of the sensory inputs, modulating synapse strengths to achieve a strong attractor solution, and dynamic strategies - including the extreme solution in which cells invert their feature preference during working memory. Neural data from the medial superior temporal (MST) area of macaques, where sensory and working memory signals first interact along the dorsal pathway, best aligned with a solution that combined input gating and tuning inversion. Behavioral predictions from this model also matched error patterns observed in monkeys performing a working memory task with distractors. Taken together, our results help elucidate how working memory circuits preserve information as we continue to interact with the world, and suggest intermediate cortical visual areas like MST may play a critical role in this computation.

">Galectin-3 deletion modulates microglial phenotype and Aβ response via TREM2 activation while attenuating neuroinflammation</a></h4>

              
                Galectin-3 (Gal3) is a regulator of microglial activation implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, Gal3 role in modulating microglial phenotype towards amyloid-beta (A{beta}) remains poorly understood. We demonstrate that Gal3 affects several microglial functions and binds A{beta} fibrils with high affinity, stabilizing aggregation intermediates that alter fibril kinetics and morphology. Furthermore, Gal3 deletion affects the direct relationship between microglia and A{beta}, reducing its uptake and increasing its compaction. AlphaFold modeling predicts direct Gal3-TLR4 interactions, suggesting a molecular link to inflammatory pathways. In vivo, Gal3 deletion reduces A{beta} plaque burden in APP mice while suppressing interferon-alpha signaling and the neurodegenerative microglial (MGnD) phenotype. Moreover, microglia lacking Gal3 show enhanced TREM2 activation around plaques, a key mediator of protective microglial responses, while reducing dystrophic neurites. These findings position Gal3 as a nexus between A{beta} aggregation and microglial phenotype, proposing its inhibition as a strategy to concurrently target neurotoxic inflammation in AD.

">Comparing a computational model of visual problem solving with human vision on a difficult vision task.</a></h4>

              
                Human vision is not merely a passive process of interpreting sensory input but incorporates generative mechanisms that infer and synthesize plausible interpretations of ambiguous or noisy data. This synergy between the generative and discriminative components, often described as analysis-by-synthesis, enables robust perception and rapid adaptation to out-of-distribution inputs. By leveraging top-down feedback, human vision excels in constructing meaningful interpretations even in challenging scenarios. In this work, we investigate a computational implementation of the analysis-by-synthesis paradigm using search in a generative model applied to an underspecified image dataset inspired by star constellations. The search is guided by low-level cues based on the structural fitness of solutions to the test images. This dataset serves as a testbed for exploring how inferred signals can guide the synthesis of suitable solutions in ambiguous conditions. Drawing on insights from human experiments, we develop a generative search algorithm and compare its performance to humans, examining factors such as accuracy, reaction time, and overlap in drawings. Our results shed light on possible mechanisms of human visual inference and highlight the potential of generative search models to emulate aspects of this process.

">A parsimonious model for learning order relations provides a principled explanation of diverse experimental data</a></h4>

              
                A cornerstone of higher cognitive function is the ability to learn relations between objects, and to use this relational information for inference. A concrete challenge is learning an order relation, and the use of resulting internal representations for transitive inference. It is known that order relations are represented in the parietal cortex both by a summation code, where the firing rates of neurons indicate the rank of an item in the order, and by a heterogeneous code where neurons are selective for specific rank values. But it remains open how these neural codes are learned. We show that the summation code emerges through a simple rule for synaptic plasticity in a single layer of synaptic connections. The resulting neural representation enables transitive inference and gives rise to the terminal item effect observed in human behavior. We also show that the simultaneous presence of a heterogeneous code gives rise to the commonly observed curvature of 2D projections of fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) signals for items of increasing rank: They tend to lie on a horseshoe-shaped curved line. Our models are supported by a rigorous theory.

">Electrical Spinal Imaging (ESI): Analysing spinal cord activity with non-invasive, high-resolution mapping</a></h4>

              
                The spinal cord is the key bridge between the brain and the body. However, scientific understanding of healthy spinal cord function has historically been limited because noninvasive measures of its neural activity have proven exceptionally challenging. In this work, we describe a novel recording and analysis approach to obtain non-invasive, high-resolution images of the electrical activity of the spinal cord in humans (Electrical Spinal Imaging, ESI). ESI is analytically simple, easy to implement, and data-driven: it does not involve template-based strategies prone to produce spurious signals. Using this approach we provide a detailed description and physiological characterization of the spatiotemporal dynamics of the peripheral, spinal and cortical activity elicited by somatosensory stimulation. We also demonstrate that attention modulates post-synaptic activity at spinal cord level.  Our method has enabled four new insights regarding spinal cord activity. (1) We identified three distinct responses in the time domain: sP9, sN13 and sP22. (2) The sP9 is a traveling wave reflecting the afferent volley entering the spinal cord through the dorsal root. (3) In contrast, the sN13 and sP22 reflect segmental post-synaptic activity. (4) While the sP9 response is first seen on the dorsal electrodes ipsilateral to the stimulated side, the sN13 and sP22 were not lateralised with respect to the side of stimulation. (5) Unimodal attention strongly modulates the amplitude of the sP22, but not that of the sP9 and sN13 components. The proposed method offers critical insights into the spatiotemporal dynamics of somatosensory processing within the spinal cord, paving the way for precise non-invasive functional monitoring of the spinal cord  in basic and clinical neurophysiology.

We then used a 2-step Mendelian randomization approach and mediation analysis to identify brain imaging-derived phenotypes potentially mediating this relationship. Mendelian randomization analysis indicated that healthy aging had a positive causal relationship with various cognitive functions (common executive function, intelligence, cognitive performance, and fluid intelligence score). Two-step Mendelian randomization analysis identified 27 brain imaging-derived phenotypes having robust causal relationships with healthy aging and various cognitive measurements. Mediation analysis suggested that volume of subcallosal cortex might mediate effects of healthy aging on all 4 cognitive functions.

                <p>Self-administration of addictive substances like heroin can couple the rewarding/euphoric effects of the drug with drug-associated cues, and opioid cue reactivity contributes to relapse vulnerability in abstinent individuals recovering from an opioid use disorder (OUD). Opioids are reported to alter the intrinsic excitability of medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a key brain reward region linked to drug seeking, but how opioids alter NAc MSN neuronal excitability and the impact of altered MSN excitability on relapse-like opioid seeking remain unclear. Here, we discovered that self-administered, but not experimenter-administered, heroin reduced NAc protein levels of the voltage-gated sodium channel auxiliary subunit, SCN1b, in male and female rats. Viral-mediated reduction of NAc SCN1b increased the intrinsic excitability of MSNs, but without altering glutamatergic and GABAergic synaptic transmission. While reducing NAc SCN1b levels had no effect on acquisition of heroin self-administration or extinction learning, we observed a significant increase in cue-reinstated heroin seeking, suggesting that NAc SCN1b normally limits cue-reinstated heroin seeking. We also observed that NAc SCN1b protein levels returned to baseline following heroin self-administration, home-cage abstinence, and extinction training, suggesting that the noted reduction of NAc SCN1b during acquisition of heroin self-administration likely enhances MSN excitability and the strength of heroin&ndash;cue associations formed during active heroin use. As such, enhancing NAc SCN1b function might mitigate opioid cue reactivity and a return to active drug use in individuals suffering from OUD.</p>

                <p>The striatum is the primary input nucleus of the basal ganglia, integrating a dense plexus of inputs from the cerebral cortex and thalamus to regulate action selection and learning. Neuroanatomical mapping of the striatum and its subcompartments has been carried out extensively in rats and mice, nonhuman primates, and cats allowing comparative neuroanatomy studies to derive heuristics about striatal composition and function. Here, we systematically map corticostriatal topography from motor, somatosensory, auditory, and visual cortices as well as thalamostriatal parafascicular (PfN) inputs in the Mongolian gerbil. We also map a pathway reported in mice from medial vestibular nucleus to the PfN that could convey vestibular information to the striatum. Our findings align with those of similar studies in other rodents, indicating homologous neuroanatomical connectivity patterns within the corticostriatal projectome across Rodentia. We observed corticostriatal peaks of dense labeling for each input with a diffuse projection throughout striatal subregions from each cortical region, suggesting a global integration of all cortical information by the striatum. Thalamostriatal projections from PfN covered most of the striatum with a peak of PfN-specific compartmentalized labeling similar to other sensory and motor systems. We also confirm the connection from the medial vestibular nucleus to PfN thalamus, indicating that vestibular information may be widely integrated throughout the striatum. The findings build upon our body of knowledge on striatal connectivity across mammalian species and provide a foundation for striatal research focusing on vestibulothalamostriatal circuits in Rodentia.</p>

                <p>Neuroligins (NLGNs) are a family of postsynaptic adhesion molecules that bind to their presynaptic partners, neurexins, facilitating the formation and maintenance of synapses. In humans, there are five genes encoding NLGNs (<I>NLGN1-3</I>, <I>NLGN4X</I>, and <I>NLGN4Y</I>), with <I>NLGN1-3</I> having highly conserved counterparts in rodents, allowing these genes to be studied with high confidence of translational validity in mouse models. Human NLGN4X and 4Y were often assumed to serve similar functions because they share a 97% sequence homology, whereas mouse NLGN4-like is quite divergent. Many NLGN-mediated synaptic effects are modulated through post-translation modifications, which exert temporal and spatial control. In this report, we characterize a conserved phosphorylation site, serine 712, on NLGN4X and 4Y. Despite serine 712 being located in a highly conserved region between NLGN4X and 4Y, we observed kinase specificity. PKA exclusively phosphorylates NLGN4X S712, whereas Cdk5 phosphorylates S712 on both NLGN4X and 4Y. NLGN4X S712 phosphorylation regulated spine density, with phosphorylation reducing mature mushroom spines and unphosphorylated S712 increasing spines and enhancing miniature excitatory postsynaptic current frequency.</p>

                <p>Central sensitization plays a critical role in bladder pain syndrome/interstitial cystitis (BPS/IC). Electroacupuncture (EA) nerve stimulation therapy has been broadly acknowledged as an effective means of alleviating chronic pathological pain. However, it remains to be explored whether EA is effective in mitigating pain-sensitive symptoms of BPS/IC and the mechanisms involved. This study aims to investigate the analgesic effect and mechanism of EA therapy. We employed several techniques: mechanical pain threshold tests to assess pain sensitivity, urodynamic studies to evaluate bladder function, western blotting for protein analysis, immunofluorescence for visualizing, and transcriptomics. A rat cystitis model was established through a systemic intraperitoneal injection with cyclophosphamide (CYP). EA therapy was executed by stimulating the deep part of the hypochondriac point. EA treatment was observed to effectively reduce mechanical allodynia, enhance urinary function, suppress the activation of microglial cells, and alleviate neuroinflammation. Additionally, EA demonstrated the capability to downregulate brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)&ndash;tyrosine kinase receptor B (TrkB) signal transduction in the spinal dorsal horn. Transcriptome sequencing has indicated that EA therapy potentially inhibits excitatory neural transmission and modulates several pathways related to longevity. Furthermore, EA therapy has shown efficacy in treating conditions such as Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and prion diseases. In conclusion, by regulating the BDNF&ndash;TrkB signaling, EA nerve stimulation can effectively alleviate bladder dysfunction and mechanical allodynia in the CYP-induced cystitis model. Our research elucidates the underlying mechanisms of EA therapy in treating bladder dysfunction and offers new theoretical insights for addressing painful sensitization in BPS.</p>

                <p>Binocular disparity is used for perception and action in three dimensions. Neurons in the primary visual cortex respond to binocular disparity in random dot patterns, even when the contrast is inverted between eyes (false depth cue). In contrast, neurons in the ventral stream largely cease to respond to false depth cues. This study evaluated whether GABAergic inhibition is involved in suppressing false depth cues in the human ventral visual cortex. We compared GABAergic inhibition (GABA+) and glutamatergic excitation (Glx) during the viewing of correlated and anticorrelated binocular disparity in 18 participants using single-voxel proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Measurements were taken from the early visual cortex (EVC) and the lateral occipital cortex (LO). Three visual conditions were presented per voxel location: correlated binocular disparity, anticorrelated binocular disparity, or a blank gray screen with a fixation cross. To identify differences in neurochemistry, GABA+ or Glx levels were compared across viewing conditions. In EVC, correlated disparity increased Glx over anticorrelated and rest conditions, also mirrored in the Glx/GABA+ ratio. In LO, anticorrelated disparity decreased GABA+ and increased Glx. The Glx/GABA+ ratio showed increased excitatory over inhibitory drive to anticorrelated disparity in LO. Glx during viewing of anticorrelation in LO was predictive of object-selective BOLD activity in the same region. We provide evidence that early and ventral visual cortices change GABA+ and Glx concentrations during presentation of correlated and anticorrelated disparity, suggesting a contribution of cortical excitation and inhibition to disparity selectivity.</p>

                <p>Impulsivity is often considered a risk factor for drug addiction; however, not all evidence supports this view. In the present study, we used a food reward delay-discounting task (DDT) to categorize rats as low-, middle-, and high-impulsive but failed to find any difference among these groups in the acquisition and maintenance of cocaine self-administration (SA), regardless of electrical footshock punishment. Additionally, there were no group differences in locomotor responses to acute cocaine in rats with or without a history of cocaine SA. Unexpectedly, chronic cocaine SA selectively increased impulsive choice in low-impulsive rats. Resting-state fMRI analysis revealed a positive correlation between impulsivity and cerebral blood volume in the midbrain, thalamus, and auditory cortex. Using these three regions as seeds, we observed a negative correlation between impulsivity and functional connectivity between the midbrain and frontal cortex, as well as between the thalamus and frontal cortex (including the orbitofrontal, primary, and parietal cortices) in low-impulsive rats. These correlations were attenuated following chronic cocaine SA. RNAscope in situ hybridization assays revealed a significant reduction in dopamine (DA) D<SUB>1</SUB>, D<SUB>2</SUB>, and D<SUB>3</SUB> receptor mRNA expression in the corticostriatal regions of low-impulsive rats after cocaine SA. Our findings challenge the widely held view that impulsivity is a vulnerability factor for cocaine use disorder. Instead, chronic cocaine use appears to selectively increase impulsive choice decision-making in normally low-impulsive rats, associated with reduced functional connectivity and DA receptor expression in the mesocorticolimbic DA network.</p>

                <p>Human brain banks are essential for studying a wide variety of neurological and neurodegenerative diseases, yet the variability in postmortem interval (PMI)&mdash;the time from death to tissue preservation&mdash;poses significant challenges due to rapid cellular decomposition, protein alterations, and RNA degradation. Furthermore, the postmortem transcriptomic alterations occurring within distinct cell types are poorly understood. In this study, we analyzed the effect of a 3&nbsp;h postmortem interval on single-nucleus RNA signatures in the brains of wild-type (WT) and PS19 mice, a common model of tauopathy. We observed that basic quality control metrics (such as the number of genes and reads per cell), total nuclei counts, and RNA integrity number (RIN<sup>e</sup>) remained consistent across all samples, regardless of PMI or genotype. However, a 3&nbsp;h PMI diminished the number of genes differentially expressed between PS19 and WT mice, suggesting an impact of delayed processing on the detection of disease-specific transcriptomic signatures. When directly comparing 3&nbsp;h PMI versus freshly harvested 0&nbsp;h mouse brains, we identified genes upregulated in neurons and interneurons involved in DNA repair, immune response, and stress pathways. Furthermore, genes that were altered in non-neuronal cell types at 3 versus 0&nbsp;h PMI were associated with cell&ndash;cell adhesion processes. These findings highlight the effects of PMI on single-nucleus transcriptional changes that may dampen the true changes in cellular states in banked brain tissues.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/12/3/ENEURO.0579-24.2025?rss=1">The Dual Role of A2aR in Neuroinflammation: Modulating Microglial Polarization in White Matter Lesions</a></h4>

              
                <p>Neuroinflammation has been widely recognized as the primary pathophysiological mechanism underlying ischemic white matter lesions (IWML) in chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH). Adenosine A2A receptor (A2aR), an important adenosine receptor, exhibits a dual role in neuroinflammation by modulating both proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory responses. This study aimed to investigate the specific functions and mechanisms of A2aR in neuroinflammation. The findings revealed that A2aR initially exerted a proinflammatory role in the CCH model, transitioning to an anti-inflammatory role in later stages by regulating the phenotypic transformation of microglia. Further analyses using coimmunoprecipitation couple with mass spectrometry, in situ proximity ligation assay, AlphaFold protein structure prediction, [<sup>35</sup>S]GTPS binding assay, and NanoBiT technology demonstrated that A2aR formed heteromers with mGluR5 during the early stage of CCH under high glutamate conditions, promoting the polarization of microglia toward a proinflammatory phenotype. In contrast, during later stages characterized by low glutamate levels, A2aR predominantly existed as a monomer, facilitating microglial polarization toward an anti-inflammatory phenotype. Our findings indicate that elevated glutamate levels drive the formation of A2aR&ndash;mGluR5 heteromers, contributing to neuroinflammation by promoting proinflammatory microglial polarization in CCH white matter. Conversely, under low glutamate conditions, A2aR primarily functions in its monomeric form, favoring an anti-inflammatory microglial phenotype and exerting a protective effect. This study elucidates the mechanism by which A2aR mediates microglial phenotypic transformation and participates in neuroinflammation under CCH. It also identifies A2aR as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of IWML.</p>

                Background The global shift in corporate philosophy from wealth maximization to share value creation has propelled sustainable finance into the forefront of research endeavours. Despite its significance, the realm of sustainable finance, especially in the context of mergers and acquisitions, remains relatively underexplored. Objective This research intends to identify the gap by conducting a cutting-edge and expansive systematic review, unravelling the intricate layers of sustainable finance concerning mergers and acquisitions. Data source The data source is Web of Science to start with, yielding 41 publications. A similar search on Scopus yielded 52 articles. Not surprisingly, the 41 publications discovered via the Web of Science search were also found in the Scopus results. Study eligibility criteria Papers on business, management, environmental studies, corporate finance, economics, and ethics are featured. Study appraisal and synthesis methods Employing advanced methodologies including machine learning tools, our research delves into domain specific influential papers, top-contributing journals, noteworthy authors, institutions, and nations. By dissecting the context and methodologies employed in scholarly works, we aim to instil a through overview of the current body of knowledge. our study categorizes the selected scholarly research into four distinct objectives, facilitating a nuanced understanding of the diverse perspectives within the field. Each stratum of papers is meticulously analysed and discussed, offering insights into key themes and patterns. To guide future research initiatives, we present a synthesis of pertinent research questions, exploring avenues such as the incorporation of innovative financial instruments like green bonds and artificial intelligence. Results Since the Sustainable Development Goals were introduced in 2016, sustainable finance has become an increasingly important topic in merger and acquisition research. Research is progressing at a rapid pace in China and Australia, while emerging nations are falling behind. In addition, this study specifies the necessity of conducting a more comprehensive examination of the habits of company representatives regarding sustainable investments. This aspect has been neglected in earlier research. Additionally, because global M&As are becoming more common, research on cross-border M&As must take precedence over domestic ones. Finally, there is a gap in the current body of knowledge about greenwashing, green audits, and the use of AI in sustainable finance. Conclusions and implications of key findings Machine learning and big data analytics may help scholars get a more thorough grasp of the historical and present significance of sustainability in M&A. New era researchers may advance the potential yet unexplored topics.

                Background Despite diabetes mellitus and periodontal diseases are mutually exclusive, little is known about particular types of bacteria that may have exacerbated the development of diabetics’ periodontal inflammation. This study’s aim was to compare the salivary microbiomes of individuals with type 2 diabetes (20–40 years old) who had gingivitis or periodontitis to those who did not. Additionally, we evaluated the relationship between the number of periodontopathogens and the amount of nitrate-reducing bacteria in their salivary microbiome. Methods Saliva was collected, DNA was isolated, the entire 16S ribosomal RNA gene was amplified, and sample libraries were prepared in accordance to the Oxford Nanopore MinION Technology procedure. The relative abundance and bacterial diversity in saliva samples that were pooled according to three groups; T2DM patients without periodontal disease (G1), T2DM patients with gingivitis (G2), and T2DM patients with periodontitis (G3), was measured using bioinformatic methods. Additionally, the relationships between the periodontopathic bacteria (Porphyromonas gingivalis, Treponema denticola, Tannerella forsythia, and Fusobacterium spp.) and denitrifying community (Haemophilus, Neisseria, Rothia, and Veillonella) were assessed. Results Alpha-diversity analysis revealed, the G1 group had significantly lower bacterial diversity and abundance than groups G2 and G3 (p< 0.0001). However, the microbiota profiles of diabetic patient groups with periodontitis and gingivitis were comparable. Using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, potential biomarkers for differentiating between gingivitis and periodontitis were discovered. Areas under the curve (AUC) between Fusobacterium spp. and Neisseria were found to be 0.94 (p = 0.43), while the AUC between P. gingivalis and Rothia was not significant (0.84, p = 0.08). Conclusion People with type 2 diabetes mellitus who also have gingivitis or periodontitis exhibit different relationships between periodontopathic and denitrifying bacteria in their salivary microbiome. These features might be essential indicators for early identification and treatment of gingivitis in order to prevent periodontitis.

                Background Posthepatectomy liver dysfunction can lead to fatal outcomes, making it a highly undesirable complication. Numerous studies have attempted to mitigate liver dysfunction after hepatectomy. However, in the context of hepatectomy, Royal Jelly, previously known for its various benefits to liver health, has not been studied. Methods In this study, thirty-two male Wistar rats were randomly divided into two groups. Just before undergoing 80% hepatectomy, 16 rats received intravenous Royal Jelly (RJ group), while the remaining 16 rats were administered intravenous phosphate-buffered saline in a blinded manner (PBS group). Four rats died before the scheduled time for specimen collection, leaving 28 rats for analysis. Forty-eight hours after hepatectomy, liver function (bilirubin and prothrombin time) was evaluated in all rats. Additionally, hepatocyte proliferation was examined using the Ki67 marker, which was obtained from the remaining liver specimens. The difference in bilirubin levels and prothrombin time between the two groups was tested using the Mann-Whitney U test. The difference in Ki-67 percentage between the two groups was analyzed using the t-test. Results The RJ group exhibited a lower median total bilirubin level compared to the PBS group (p<0.001). Additionally, the prothrombin time in the RJ group was lower than that of the PBS group (p<0.05). The Ki-67 percentage in the RJ group was also lower than in the PBS group (p<0.05). These findings suggest that the rats administered Royal Jelly demonstrated better liver function compared to the other group. Conclusions Administer intravenous Royal Jelly to rats undergoing 80% hepatectomy helps to protect liver function. This study indicates the potential for further research on Royal Jelly as a possible alternative for reducing liver dysfunction following surgery or other medical conditions.

                Background: Early studies found that the mental health problems rate was relatively high in university students. We aimed to investigate the prevalence of mental problems and associated factors in university students. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional descriptive study at Supara mental health service in the Faculty of Medicine Vajira Hospital between February 2020 to June 2021. The primary outcome was the prevalence of psychiatric diagnosis according to the 10th revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10). The secondary assessments included the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), 8 items from the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) to assess suicidal risk (8Q), , and the Thai Mental Health Indicator (TMHI-15). The prevalence of mental health problems was presented by frequency and percentage. In addition, multivariable regression analysis was used to identify potential predictors of mental health problems. Results: A total of 184 participants (62% female; mean age = 22.49 years (SD 3.93) were recruited. The depressive disorders, adjustment disorders, and anxiety disorders rates were 57.1%, 15.2% and 13.6%, respectively. Grade point averages (GPAs) below 3.0 (OR=3.09, 95%CI: 1.17-8.14) and a family history of mental disorder (OR=3.40, 95%CI: 1.10-10.48) were significant associated factors of moderate to severe mental health problems. Detecting and screening these factors may help the university to provide early detection and treatment for students. Conclusions: Depressive disorders were the most common mental health disorders. Females, low GPAs and a family history of mental disorder were predictors of moderate to severe mental health problems.

                Background There is evidence that patients with COVID-19 have a higher prevalence of mental health problems than the normal population. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of mental health problems and their associated factors in patients with asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic in the hospitel in Thailand. Methods Mental health problems were evaluated using the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale - 21 items, and Patient Health Questionnaire-9. The prevalence of mental health problems was presented by frequency and percentage. McNemar's test was used to compare the prevalence of mental health problems between day 1 and day 7. Binary logistic regression was used to identify potential predictors of mental health problems. Results A total of 186 participants (68.3% female; mean age = 37.21 years (SD 13.66) were recruited. The depression, anxiety, and stress rate on day 1 of admission was 26.9%, 32.3% and 25.8%, respectively. Having mild COVID-19 symptoms was a significantly associated factor with anxiety (OR=2.69, 95%CI: 1.05-6.89) and stress (OR=4.53, 95%CI: 1.32-15.55). Conclusions There was a high rate of mental health problems in COVID-19 patients. Detecting and managing mental health problems should be considered standard care for COVID-19 patients.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The goal was to examine the effect of sociodemographic variables, Alzheimer's disease (AD) clinical stages and pathology on brain metabolism in Down syndrome (DS).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We included 71 euploid healthy controls (HC) and 105 adults with DS (67 asymptomatic, 12 prodromal, and 26 with dementia) from the Down-Alzheimer Barcelona Neuroimaging Initiative. Participants underwent [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography, 3 Tmagnetic resonance imaging, and lumbar puncture to measure cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers (ratio beween amyloid β peptide 42 and 40, phosphorylated tau 181, and neurofilament light chain [NfL]). Voxel-wise analyses in SPM12 examined the effects of age, sex, intellectual disability, Alzheimer's clinical stage, and CSF biomarkers on brain metabolism.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In HC, brain metabolism decreased with age primarily in the frontal lobe. By contrast, a more distributed pattern of metabolic loss was observed in DS with age, predominating in temporoparietal regions. Compared to asymptomatic DS participants, those at the prodromal stage exhibited medial parietal hypometabolism, which later extended to other temporoparietal and frontal regions at the dementia stage. In asymptomatic individuals, we observed a widespread hypometabolism compared to HC, mainly in medial frontal and parietal regions. All CSF biomarkers were closely associated with hypometabolism in regions affected by the disease, with the strongest association observed for NfL in medial parietal structures.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The brain metabolic decline in DS with age reflects Alzheimer's pathological processes and involves temporoparietal regions in a similar pattern to that found in other forms of AD. Hypometabolism is more tightly related to CSF NfL levels than to core AD biomarkers. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                The Earth continues to suffer from the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak even now, particularly due to the absence of appropriate theoretical frameworks for related emergency responses. In this study, we provided a simplified model for the emergency response to the coronavirus infection. We employed a qualitative content analysis, using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 checklist and flow diagram. Specifically, we examined eight underlying factors (leaders’ inability, focus on economic recovery, controversies regarding the usage of face masks, unprecedented reliance on herd immunity, hasty research and development, late decision-making, coordination failure, and occurrence of natural hazards) and eight selected overarching factors (global leadership, national policies, individual strategies, culture, research and development, timing, communication, and contingency). Considering these factors, we proposed the “Earth as a comprehensive system” approach, under which elements of the pandemic response are comprehensively included to facilitate problem-solving, social support, strategic use, assistance from various professionals, and education. The operational mechanism of this approach clearly emphasizes unified efforts for responding to a pandemic by systematically including various interdependent components of the Earth.

                Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans is a rare, locally aggressive soft-tissue sarcoma. Head and neck involvement accounts for only 10–15% of cases. Achieving clear margins in this region is challenging owing to anatomical constraints. Such cases often require extensive resection and complex reconstructions. This study presents a case series of extensive dermatofibrosarcoma resections in the head and neck, focusing on the surgical margins, reconstruction strategies, recurrence rates, and adjuvant therapy. We report four cases of head and neck dermatofibrosarcoma involving the cheek and scalp. Surgery included wide local excision with margins of 3–5 cm, which was confirmed intraoperatively by frozen section analysis. Reconstruction involved free flaps, local flaps, and healing with secondary intention. The choice depends on the defect size and location. Adjuvant radiotherapy was administered to selected cases. All patients achieved negative margins. One patient developed flap necrosis that required revision surgery. No local recurrence was observed during the follow-up (1–7 years). Head and neck dermatofibrosarcoma justifies aggressive surgical resection to achieve clear margins, which is the key to reducing the risk of recurrence. Free flaps and local reconstruction techniques ensure good functional and aesthetic outcomes. Adjuvant radiotherapy is indicated in patients with close margins or deep invasion. Long-term follow-up is essential owing to its high recurrence potential.
