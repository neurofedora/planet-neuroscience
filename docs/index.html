<p>We address the problem of designing artificial agents capable of reproducing
human behavior in a competitive game involving dynamic control. Given data
consisting of multiple realizations of inputs generated by pairs of interacting
players, we model each agent's actions as governed by a time-varying latent
goal state coupled to a control model. These goals, in turn, are described as
stochastic processes evolving according to player-specific value functions
depending on the current state of the game. We model these value functions
using generative adversarial networks (GANs) and show that our GAN-based
approach succeeds in producing sample gameplay that captures the rich dynamics
of human agents. The latent goal dynamics inferred and generated by our model
has applications to fields like neuroscience and animal behavior, where the
underlying value functions themselves are of theoretical interest.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.07227">The knowledge paradox: why knowing more is knowing less. (arXiv:1702.07227v1 [q-bio.NC])</a></h4>

<p>To provide an explanation of the evolution of scientific knowledge, I start
from the assumption that knowledge is based on concepts, and propose that each
concept about reality is affected by vagueness. This entails a paradox, which I
term Knowledge Paradox (KP): i.e. we need concepts to acquire knowledge about
the real world but each concept is a step away from reality. The KP provides a
unifying context for the sorites and the liar paradoxes. Any concept is viewed
as a sorites, i.e. it is impossible to set a boundary between what is, and what
is not, the entity to which the concept refers. Hence, any statement about
reality can be reduced to a liar, wherefrom the KP follows in its most general
form: -If I know, then I do not know-. The KP is self-referential but not
contradictory, as it can be referred to two levels of knowledge: -if I
know(epistemic), then I do not know(ontic)-, where the ontic level is made
unachievable by concept vagueness. Such an interpretation of scientific
knowledge provides an understanding of its dynamics. Concept proliferation
within theories produces periods of knowledge decay that are episodically
reversed by the formulation of new theories based on a smaller number of
synthetic concepts.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.07038">The Quest for the FFA led to the Expertise Account of its Specialization. (arXiv:1702.07038v1 [q-bio.NC])</a></h4>

<p>This article is written in response to a Progressions article by Kanwisher in
the Journal of Neuroscience, The Quest for the FFA and Where It Led (Kanwisher,
2017). I reflect on the extensive research program dedicated to the study of
how and why perceptual expertise explains the many ways that faces are special,
a research program which both predates and follows the Kanwisher (1997)
landmark article where the fusiform face area (FFA) is named. The expertise
accounts suggests that the FFA is an area recruited by expertise individuating
objects that are perceptually similar because they share a configuration of
parts. While Kanwisher (2017) discussed the expertise account only very briefly
and only to dismiss it, there is strong and replicable evidence that responses
in the FFA are highly sensitive to experience with non-face objects. I point
out that Kanwisher was well positioned to present these findings in their
historical context as she participated in the design of the first fMRI study on
car and bird expertise, as well as the first replication of this finding.
Perhaps most relevant to readers interested in the neural bases of face
processing, it is important to distinguish studies that describe the phenomenon
of face-selectivity from those that test an explanation for this phenomenon. In
the Progressions article, arguments for a face-dedicated processing module that
is not the result of our experience with faces are provided without attention
to a great deal of expertise research which is directly inconsistent with that
claim. The claim also lacks more direct support, as face-selective responses in
the visual system are not found in infants and children and face-selective
activity in FFA does not appear to be heritable.

Mindboggle (http://mindboggle.info) is an open source brain morphometry platform that takes in preprocessed T1-weighted MRI data and outputs volume, surface, and tabular data containing label, feature, and shape information for further analysis. In this article, we document the software and demonstrate its use in studies of shape variation in healthy and diseased humans. The number of different shape measures and the size of the populations make this the largest and most detailed shape analysis of human brains ever conducted. Brain image morphometry shows great potential for providing much-needed biological markers for diagnosing, tracking, and predicting progression of mental health disorders. Very few software algorithms provide more than measures of volume and cortical thickness, while more subtle shape measures may provide more sensitive and specific biomarkers. Mindboggle computes a variety of (primarily surface-based) shapes: area, volume, thickness, curvature, depth, Laplace-Beltrami spectra, Zernike moments, etc. We evaluate Mindboggle’s algorithms using the largest set of manually labeled, publicly available brain images in the world and compare them against state-of-the-art algorithms where they exist. All data, code, and results of these evaluations are publicly available.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/sbvAGebfYBU" width="1" />

<p>by Alice R. Walker, Pavel Silvestrov, Tina A. Müller, Robert H. Podolsky, Gregory Dyson, Robert P. Hausinger, Gerardo Andrés Cisneros</p>

The search for prostate cancer biomarkers has received increased attention and several DNA repair related enzymes have been linked to this dysfunction. Here we report a targeted search for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and functional impact characterization of human ALKBH family dioxygenases related to prostate cancer. Our results uncovered a SNP of <i>ALKBH7</i>, rs7540, which is associated with prostate cancer disease in a statistically significantly manner in two separate cohorts, and maintained in African American men. Comparisons of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on the wild-type and variant protein structures indicate that the resulting alteration in the enzyme induces a significant structural change that reduces ALKBH7’s ability to bind its cosubstrate. Experimental spectroscopy studies with purified proteins validate our MD predictions and corroborate the conclusion that this cancer-associated mutation affects productive cosubstrate binding in ALKBH7.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/1Xu_8bfGfMs" width="1" />

<div class="para"><p>Positron emission tomography (PET) is a powerful analytical tool for <em>in vivo</em> molecular imaging of the human brain. Over the past years, a number of PET studies imaging the serotonin transporter (SERT) have been used and provided evidence for the key role of serotonergic pathology in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Here, we review the role of SERT in the development of motor and nonmotor complications in patients with PD, and we performed a meta-analysis to identify the patterns of SERT pathology and the relevance to symptoms. Consistent SERT pathology in raphe nuclei, striatum, thalamus, and hypothalamus and associations with aging, PD progression, development of dyskinesias, and cognitive decline were observed.

<div class="section" id="ana24872-sec-0002"><h4>Methods</h4><div class="para"><p>Archival serum or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimens were available from 96 of 118 consecutive PCA-2-IgG–seropositive patients identified during 1993–2016. The autoantigen, defined in mouse brain lysate by Western blot and mass spectrometry, was confirmed by dual immunohistochemical staining using commercial antibodies. The major antigenic region was defined by Western blot using recombinant protein fragments.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ana24872-sec-0003"><h4>Results</h4><div class="para"><p>IgG in 95 of 96 patients’ serum or CSF (but in none of 98 healthy or disease control subjects’ serum specimens) bound to recombinant MAP1B. A minority (17.5%) of patients’ IgG also bound to MAP1A. PCA-2 was often accompanied by additional neural autoantibody markers of small-cell carcinoma, including collapsin response-mediated protein 5 (CRMP5) IgG (26%) or antineuronal nuclear antibody type 1 (ANNA-1) IgG (also known as anti-Hu; 13%). Neurological manifestations in 95 patients were (in decreasing frequency): peripheral neuropathy, 53%; cerebellar ataxia, dysmetria, or dysarthria, 38%; and encephalopathy, 27%. Cancer (majority small-cell lung carcinoma [SCLC]) was detected in 66 of 84 evaluated patients (79%). The MAP1B (PCA-2) autoantibody detection rate, among approximately 70,000 patients undergoing service neural autoantibody evaluation in 2015, was 0.024%, equaling amphiphysin IgG (0.026%) and more common than ANNA-2 (also known as anti-Ri; 0.016%) and PCA-Tr (also known as delta/notch-like epidermal growth factor-related receptor [DNER]; 0.006%).</p></div></div>

<div class="section" id="ana24848-sec-0002"><h4>Methods</h4><div class="para"><p>Medically refractory unilateral temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) with hippocampal sclerosis (HS-TLE, n = 26) was studied as an archetype of focal epilepsy, using fixel-based analysis of diffusion-weighted imaging. A genetic effect was assessed in first-degree relatives of HS-TLE subjects who did not have epilepsy themselves (HS-1°Rel; n = 26). The role of disease process was uncovered by comparing HS-TLE to unilateral TLE with normal clinical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI-neg TLE; n = 26, matched for seizure severity). The effect of focal seizures was inferred from lateralized atrophy common to both HS-TLE and MRI-neg TLE, in comparison to healthy controls (n = 76).</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ana24848-sec-0003"><h4>Results</h4><div class="para"><p>HS-1 °Rel had bilaterally small hippocampi, but no focal white matter atrophy was detected, indicating a limited effect of genetics. HS-TLE subjects had lateralized atrophy of most temporal lobe tracts, and hippocampal volumes in HS-TLE correlated with parahippocampal cingulum and anterior commissure atrophy, indicating an effect of the underlying pathology. Ipsilateral atrophy of the tapetum, uncinate, and inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus was found in both HS-TLE and MRI-neg TLE, suggesting a common lateralized effect of focal seizures. Both epilepsy groups had bilateral atrophy of the dorsal cingulum and corpus callosum fibers, which we interpret as a consequence of bilateral insults (potentially generalized seizures and/or medications).</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ana24848-sec-0004"><h4>Interpretation</h4><div class="para"><p>Underlying pathology, repeated focal seizures, and global insults each contribute to atrophy in specific tracts. Genetic factors make less of a contribution in this cohort. A multifactorial model of white matter atrophy in focal epilepsy is proposed. Ann Neurol 2017;81:240–250</p></div></div>

<div class="section" id="ana24870-sec-0001"><h4>Objective</h4><div class="para"><p>Rewiring of excitatory glutamatergic neuronal circuits is a major abnormality in epilepsy. Besides the rewiring of excitatory circuits, an abnormal depolarizing γ-aminobutyric acidergic (GABAergic) drive has been hypothesized to participate in the epileptogenic processes. However, a remaining clinically relevant question is whether early post–status epilepticus (SE) evoked chloride dysregulation is important for the remodeling of aberrant glutamatergic neuronal circuits.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ana24870-sec-0002"><h4>Methods</h4><div class="para"><p>Osmotic minipumps were used to infuse intracerebrally a specific inhibitor of depolarizing GABAergic transmission as well as a functionally blocking antibody toward the pan-neurotrophin receptor p75 (p75<sup>NTR</sup>). The compounds were infused between 2 and 5 days after pilocarpine-induced SE. Immunohistochemistry for NKCC1, KCC2, and ectopic recurrent mossy fiber (rMF) sprouting as well as telemetric electroencephalographic and electrophysiological recordings were performed at day 5 and 2 months post-SE.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ana24870-sec-0003"><h4>Results</h4><div class="para"><p>Blockade of NKCC1 after SE with the specific inhibitor bumetanide restored NKCC1 and KCC2 expression, normalized chloride homeostasis, and significantly reduced the glutamatergic rMF sprouting within the dentate gyrus. This mechanism partially involves p75<sup>NTR</sup> signaling, as bumetanide application reduced SE-induced p75<sup>NTR</sup> expression and functional blockade of p75<sup>NTR</sup> decreased rMF sprouting. The early transient (3 days) post-SE infusion of bumetanide reduced rMF sprouting and recurrent seizures in the chronic epileptic phase.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ana24870-sec-0004"><h4>Interpretation</h4><div class="para"><p>Our findings show that early post-SE abnormal depolarizing GABA and p75<sup>NTR</sup> signaling fosters a long-lasting rearrangement of glutamatergic network that contributes to the epileptogenic process. This finding defines promising and novel targets to constrain reactive glutamatergic network rewiring in adult epilepsy. Ann Neurol 2017;81:251–265</p></div></div>

<div class="section" id="ana24860-sec-0001"><h4>Objective</h4><div class="para"><p>Autoimmune encephalitis (AE), represented by anti–leucine-rich glioma-inactivated 1 (anti-LGI1) and anti–N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (anti-NMDAR) encephalitis, has increasing clinical significance based on recent discoveries of neuronal autoantibodies. However, its immunopathogenesis is not fully understood. Here, we investigated whether AE is associated with the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) subtypes.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ana24860-sec-0002"><h4>Methods</h4><div class="para"><p>We compared the HLA genotypes of 11 anti-LGI1 and 17 anti-NMDAR encephalitis patients to the control groups, which consisted of 210 epilepsy patients and 485 healthy Koreans.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ana24860-sec-0003"><h4>Results</h4><div class="para"><p>Anti-LGI1 encephalitis was associated with the DRB1*07:01–DQB1*02:02 haplotype (10 patients; 91%) in HLA class II genes, as well as with B*44:03 (8 patients; 73%) and C*07:06 (7 patients; 64%) in the HLA class I region. The prevalence of these alleles in anti-LGI1 encephalitis was significantly higher than that in the epilepsy controls or healthy controls. By contrast, anti-NMDAR encephalitis was not associated with HLA genotypes. Additional analysis using HLA-peptide binding prediction algorithms and computational docking underpinned the close relationship.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ana24860-sec-0004"><h4>Interpretation</h4><div class="para"><p>This finding suggests that most anti-LGI1 encephalitis develops in a population with specific HLA subtypes, providing insight into a novel disease mechanism. Ann Neurol 2017;81:183–192</p></div></div>

<div class="section" id="ana24881-sec-0001"><h4>Objective</h4><div class="para"><p>A novel autoimmune central nervous system (CNS) disorder with glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-IgG as biomarker was recently characterized. Here, 102 patients with GFAP-IgG positivity are described.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ana24881-sec-0002"><h4>Methods</h4><div class="para"><p>The 102 included patients had: (1) serum, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), or both that yielded a characteristic astrocytic pattern of mouse tissue immunostaining; (2) confirmation of IgG reactive with specific GFAP isoforms (α, ɛ, or κ) by cell-based assays; and (3) clinical data available. Control specimens (n = 865) were evaluated by tissue (n = 542) and cell-based (n = 323) assays.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ana24881-sec-0003"><h4>Results</h4><div class="para"><p>Median symptom onset age was 44 years (range = 8–103), and 54% were women. The predominant phenotype (83 patients; 81%) was inflammation of meninges, brain, spinal cord, or all 3 (meningoencephalomyelitis). Among patients, highest specificity for those phenotypes was observed for CSF testing (94%), and highest sensitivity was for the GFAPα isoform (100%). Rare GFAP-IgG positivity was encountered in serum controls by tissue-based assay (0.5%) or cell-based assay (1.5%), and in CSF controls by cell-based assay (0.9%). Among patients, striking perivascular radial enhancement was found on brain magnetic resonance imaging in 53%. Although cases frequently mimicked vasculitis, angiography was uniformly negative, and spinal imaging frequently demonstrated longitudinally extensive myelitic lesions. Diverse neoplasms encountered were found prospectively in 22%. Ovarian teratoma was most common and was predicted best when both N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor–IgG and aquaporin-4–IgG coexisted (71%). Six patients with prolonged follow-up had brisk corticosteroid response, but required additional immunosuppression to overcome steroid dependency.</p></div></div>

<div class="section" id="ana24873-sec-0001"><h4>Objective</h4><div class="para"><p>Although vein of Galen aneurysmal malformations (VGAM) can be diagnosed in the fetus, the challenge is predicting the occurrence of its 2 major complications: cardiopulmonary failure and encephalomalacia. This study attempts to determine which fetal brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features might be used to predict the development of these complications at birth.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ana24873-sec-0002"><h4>Methods</h4><div class="para"><p>The cohort was extracted from a prospectively assembled database of VGAM cases managed at a single referral center from 2000 to 2014. Of 251 patients with VGAM, 83 cases were diagnosed prenatally. A total of 58 patient charts having at least 1 fetal MRI were reviewed. Patterns of brain parenchyma, hydrocephalus, and so-called middle cerebral artery (MCA) “pseudofeeders” were correlated with cardiac failure, pulmonary hypertension, and encephalomalacia at birth.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ana24873-sec-0003"><h4>Results</h4><div class="para"><p>The median gestational age at fetal MRI was 32.3 weeks of pregnancy (±2.3). Nine fetuses (16%) had encephalomalacia. Thirty-one fetuses (53%) had MCA pseudofeeders. Twenty-six fetuses (45%) had prenatal hydrocephalus. Prenatal MCA pseudofeeders were a risk factor for encephalomalacia at birth (<em>p</em> = 0.001). MCA pseudofeeders and hydrocephalus were risk factors for both severe cardiac failure (<em>p</em> = 0.01 and <em>p</em> = 0.04, respectively) and severe pulmonary hypertension (<em>p</em> = 0.014 and <em>p</em> = 0.05, respectively) at birth.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ana24873-sec-0004"><h4>Interpretation</h4><div class="para"><p>MCA pseudofeeders are the result of impaired cerebral blood flow, and are thus a risk factor for further brain melting at birth.

<div class="section" id="ana24877-sec-0002"><h4>Methods</h4><div class="para"><p>One hundred patients who presented with pure autonomic failure were recruited at 5 medical centers in the United States. Seventy-four patients agreed to be followed prospectively. Patients underwent clinical evaluations including neurological rating scales, sleep questionnaires, smell test, and sympathetic and parasympathetic cardiovascular autonomic function tests.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ana24877-sec-0003"><h4>Results</h4><div class="para"><p>At enrollment, patients were 68 ± 12 years old (median ± interquartile range) and had had autonomic failure for 5 ± 7 years. Within 4 years of follow-up, 25 of 74 subjects (34%) developed dementia with Lewy bodies (n = 13), Parkinson disease (n = 6), or multiple system atrophy (n = 6). The presence of probable rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder was strongly associated with the development of a manifest central nervous system (CNS) synucleinopathy (odds ratio = 7.1). Patients who phenoconverted to multiple system atrophy had younger age at onset of autonomic failure, severe bladder/bowel dysfunction, preserved olfaction, and a cardiac chronotropic response upon tilt &gt; 10 beats per minute. Those who phenoconverted to Parkinson disease or dementia with Lewy bodies had decreased olfaction, a lesser chronotropic response to tilt, and a longer duration of illness. The small group of patients retaining the pure autonomic failure phenotype had very low plasma norepinephrine levels, slow resting heart rate, no REM sleep behavior disorder, and preserved smell.</p></div></div>

<div class="section" id="ana24846-sec-0001"><h4>Objectives</h4><div class="para"><p>Friedreich's ataxia is a devastating neurological disease currently lacking any proven treatment. We studied the neuroprotective effects of the cytokines, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) and stem cell factor (SCF) in a humanized murine model of Friedreich's ataxia.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ana24846-sec-0002"><h4>Methods</h4><div class="para"><p>Mice received monthly subcutaneous infusions of cytokines while also being assessed at monthly time points using an extensive range of behavioral motor performance tests. After 6 months of treatment, neurophysiological evaluation of both sensory and motor nerve conduction was performed. Subsequently, mice were sacrificed for messenger RNA, protein, and histological analysis of the dorsal root ganglia, spinal cord, and cerebellum.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ana24846-sec-0003"><h4>Results</h4><div class="para"><p>Cytokine administration resulted in significant reversal of biochemical, neuropathological, neurophysiological, and behavioural deficits associated with Friedreich's ataxia. Both G-CSF and SCF had pronounced effects on frataxin levels (the primary molecular defect in the pathogenesis of the disease) and a regulators of frataxin expression. Sustained improvements in motor coordination and locomotor activity were observed, even after onset of neurological symptoms. Treatment also restored the duration of sensory nerve compound potentials. Improvements in peripheral nerve conduction positively correlated with cytokine-induced increases in frataxin expression, providing a link between increases in frataxin and neurophysiological function. Abrogation of disease-related pathology was also evident, with reductions in inflammation/gliosis and increased neural stem cell numbers in areas of tissue injury.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ana24846-sec-0004"><h4>Interpretation</h4><div class="para"><p>These experiments show that cytokines already clinically used in other conditions offer the prospect of a novel, rapidly translatable, disease-modifying, and neuroprotective treatment for Friedreich's ataxia.

<p>Neural codes are collections of binary strings motivated by patterns of
neural activity. In this paper, we study algorithmic and enumerative aspects of
convex neural codes in dimension 1 (i.e. on a line or a circle). We use the
theory of consecutive-ones matrices to obtain some structural and algorithmic
results; we use generating functions to obtain enumerative results.

<p>Based on a set of subjects and a collection of descriptors obtained from the
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database, we use redescription
mining to find rules revealing associations between these determinants which
provides insights about the Alzheimer's disease (AD). We applied a four-step
redescription mining algorithm (CLUS-RM), which has been extended to engender
constraint-based redescription mining (CBRM) and enables several modes of
targeted exploration of specific, user-defined associations. To a large extent
we confirmed known findings, previously reported in the literature. However,
several redescriptions contained biological descriptors that differentiated
well between the groups and for which connection to AD is still not completely
explained. Examples include testosterone, ciliary neurotrophic factor, brain
natriuretic peptide, insulin etc. The imaging descriptor Spatial Pattern of
Abnormalities for Recognition of Early AD and levels of leptin and
angiopoietin-2 in plasma were also found to be remarkably good descriptors,
that may provide better understanding of AD pathogenesis. Finally, the most
intriguing and novel finding was the high association of the
Pregnancy-Associated Protein-A (PAPP-A) with cognitive impairment in AD. The
high importance of this finding lies in the fact that PAPP-A is a
metalloproteinase, known to cleave insulin-like growth factor binding proteins.
Since it also shares similar substrates with A Disintegrin and
Metalloproteinase family of enzymes that act as {\alpha}-secretase to
physiologically cleave amyloid precursor protein (APP) in the non-amyloidogenic
pathway, it could be directly involved in metabolism of APP very early during
the disease course. Therefore, further studies should investigate the role of
PAPP-A in the development of AD more thoroughly.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.06665">Visual response properties of MSTd emerge from a sparse population code. (arXiv:1702.06665v1 [q-bio.NC])</a></h4>

<p>Neurons in the dorsal subregion of the medial superior temporal (MSTd) area
respond to large, complex patterns of retinal flow, implying a role in the
analysis of self-motion. Some neurons are selective for the expanding radial
motion that occurs as an observer moves through the environment ("heading"),
and computational models can account for this finding. However, ample evidence
suggests that MSTd neurons may exhibit a continuum of visual response
selectivity to large-field motion stimuli, but the underlying computational
principles by which these response properties are derived remain poorly
understood. Here we describe a computational model of MSTd based on the
hypothesis that neurons in MSTd efficiently encode the continuum of large-field
retinal flow patterns on the basis of inputs received from neurons in MT, with
receptive fields that resemble basis vectors recovered with nonnegative matrix
factorization (NMF). These assumptions are sufficient to quantitatively
simulate neurophysiological response properties of MSTd cells such as radial,
circular, and spiral motion tuning, suggesting that these properties might
simply be a by-product of MSTd neurons performing dimensionality reduction on
their inputs. At the population level, model MSTd accurately predicts heading
using a sparse distributed code, consistent with the idea that biological MSTd
might operate in a sparseness regime well-suited to efficiently encode a number
of self-motion variables. The present work provides an alternative to the
template-model view of MSTd, and offers a biologically plausible account of the
receptive field structure across a wide range of visual response properties in
MSTd.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.06538">Applications of Discrete Mathematics for Understanding Dynamics of Synapses and Networks in Neuroscience. (arXiv:1702.06538v1 [q-bio.NC])</a></h4>

<p>Mathematical modeling has broad applications in neuroscience whether modeling
the dynamics of a single synapse or an entire network of neurons. In Part I, we
model vesicle replenishment and release at the photoreceptor synapse to better
understand how visual information is processed. In Part II, we explore a simple
model of neural networks with the goal of discovering how network structure
shapes the behavior of the network.
</p>
<p>To fully understand how visual information is processed requires an
understanding of the way signals are transformed at the ribbon synapse of
photoreceptor neurons. These synapses possess a ribbon-like structure capable
of storing around 100 synaptic vesicles, allowing graded responses through the
release of different numbers of vesicles in response to visual input. These
responses depend critically on the ability of the ribbon to replenish itself as
ribbon sites empty upon release. The rate of vesicle replenishment is thus an
important factor in shaping neural coding in the retina. In collaboration with
experimental neuroscientists we developed a mathematical model to describe the
dynamics of vesicle release and replenishment at the ribbon synapse.
</p>
<p>To learn more about how network architecture shapes the dynamics of the
network, we study a specific type of threshold-linear network that is
constructed from a simple directed graph. The network construction guarantees
that differences in dynamics arise solely from differences in the connectivity
of the underlying graph. By design, the activity of these networks is bounded
and there are no stable fixed points. Computational experiments show that most
of these networks yield limit cycles where the neurons fire in sequence. We
devised an algorithm to predict the sequence of firing using the structure of
the underlying graph. Using the algorithm we classify all the networks of this
type on five or fewer nodes.

Makinson et al. identify the mechanisms underlying the complex seizure phenotype associated with loss of the voltage-gated sodium channel Scn8a. Scn8a-mediated hypofunction in cortical circuits confers convulsive seizure resistance, while hypofunction in the thalamus is sufficient to generate absence seizures.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/110932v1?rss=1">Mobility as the purpose of postural control</a></h4>

Counteracting the destabilizing force of gravity is usually considered to be the purpose of postural control. However, from the consideration of the mechanical requirements for movement, we argue that posture is adjusted in view of providing impetus for movement. Thus, we show that the posture that is usually adopted in quiet standing in fact allows torque for potential movement. Moreover, when performing a movement - either voluntarily or in response to an external perturbation - we show that the postural adjustments are organized both spatially and temporally so as to provide the required torque for the movement. Thus, when movement is performed skillfully, the force of gravity is not counteracted but actually used to provide impetus to movement. This ability to move one's weight so as to exploit the torque of gravity seems crucial, especially for recovering one's balance when a standing person is perturbed by an external force.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/109496v1?rss=1">Foreground Enhancement and Background Suppression in Human Early Visual System During Passive Perception of Natural Images</a></h4>

One of the major challenges in visual neuroscience is represented by foreground-background segmentation, a process that is supposed to rely on computations in cortical modules, as information progresses from V1 to V4. Data from nonhuman primates (Poort et al., 2016) showed that segmentation leads to two distinct, but associated processes: the enhancement of cortical activity associated to figure processing (i.e., foreground enhancement) and the suppression of ground-related cortical activity (i.e., background suppression). To characterize foreground-background segmentation of natural stimuli in humans, we parametrically modulated low-level properties of 334 images and their behaviorally segmented counterparts. A model based on simple visual features was then adopted to describe the filtered and intact images, and to evaluate their resemblance with fMRI activity in different visual cortices (V1, V2, V3, V3A, V3B, V4, LOC). Results from representational similarity analysis (Kriegeskorte et al., 2008) showed that the correspondence between behaviorally segmented natural images and brain activity increases throughout the visual processing stream. We found evidence of foreground enhancement for all the tested visual regions, while background suppression occurs in V3B, V4 and LOC. Our results suggest that foreground-background segmentation is an automatic process that occurs during natural viewing, and cannot be merely ascribed to differences in objects size or location. Finally, neural images reconstructed from V4 and LOC fMRI activity revealed a preserved spatial resolution of foreground textures, indicating a richer representation of the salient part of natural images, rather than a simplistic model of objects shape.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/104117v1?rss=1">Sensitivity of Neurons in the Middle Temporal Area of Marmoset Monkeys to Random Dot Motion</a></h4>

Neurons in the Middle Temporal area (MT) of the primate cerebral cortex respond to moving stimuli. Their sensitivity to noisy motion signals is often characterized by using random-dot stimuli, where the coherence of the motion signal is manipulated. In macaques, this has allowed the calculation of "neurometric" thresholds, which can be compared to the animal's behavioral performance. There has been growing interest in the marmoset monkey, a species in which area MT is fully exposed on the surface of the brain, but responses of MT neurons to random-dot stimuli with noise have not been characterized. In sufentanil/nitrous oxide anesthetized marmosets, we found that MT neurons show a wide range of neurometric thresholds, similar to observations in macaques, and that the thresholds of the most sensitive neurons can account for the behavioral performance of macaques and humans. We also investigated factors that contributed to the wide range of observed thresholds. The difference in firing rate between responses to motion in the preferred and null directions was the most effective predictor of neurometric threshold, whereas the direction tuning bandwidth had no correlation with the threshold. We also showed that it is possible to obtain good neurometric thresholds using stimuli that were not highly optimized for each neuron, as is often necessary when recording from large populations of neurons. These results demonstrate that marmoset MT shows an essential similarity to macaque MT, and suggests that it is capable of representing motion signals that would allow for comparable motion-in-noise judgments.

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/8/2258?rss=1">An ALS-Associated Mutant SOD1 Rapidly Suppresses KCNT1 (Slack) Na+-Activated K+ Channels in Aplysia Neurons</a></h4>

<p>Mutations that alter levels of Slack (KCNT1) Na<sup>+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> current produce devastating effects on neuronal development and neuronal function. We now find that Slack currents are rapidly suppressed by oligomers of mutant human Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), which are associated with motor neuron toxicity in an inherited form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We recorded from bag cell neurons of <i>Aplysia californica</i>, a model system to study neuronal excitability. We found that injection of fluorescent wild-type SOD1 (wt SOD1YFP) or monomeric mutant G85R SOD1YFP had no effect on net ionic currents measured under voltage clamp. In contrast, outward potassium currents were significantly reduced by microinjection of mutant G85R SOD1YFP that had been preincubated at 37°C or of cross-linked dimers of G85R SOD1YFP. Reduction of potassium current was also seen with multimeric G85R SOD1YFP of ~300 kDa or &gt;300 kDa that had been cross-linked. In current clamp recordings, microinjection of cross-linked 300 kDa increased excitability by depolarizing the resting membrane potential, and decreasing the latency of action potentials triggered by depolarization. The effect of cross-linked 300 kDa on potassium current was reduced by removing Na<sup>+</sup> from the bath solution, or by knocking down levels of Slack using siRNA. It was also prevented by pharmacological inhibition of ASK1 (apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1) or of c-Jun N-terminal kinase, but not by an inhibitor of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase. These results suggest that soluble mutant SOD1 oligomers rapidly trigger a kinase pathway that regulates the activity of Na<sup>+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> channels in neurons.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Slack Na<sup>+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> channels (KCNT1, K<sub>Na</sub>1.1) regulate neuronal excitability but are also linked to cytoplasmic signaling pathways that control neuronal protein translation. Mutations that alter the amplitude of these currents have devastating effects on neuronal development and function. We find that injection of oligomers of mutant superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) into the cytoplasm of invertebrate neurons rapidly suppresses these Na<sup>+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> currents and that this effect is mediated by a MAP kinase cascade, including ASK1 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase. Because amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a fatal adult-onset neurodegenerative disease produced by mutations in SOD1 that cause the enzyme to form toxic oligomers, our findings suggest that suppression of Slack channels may be an early step in the progression of the disease.</p>

<p>The pulvinar complex is interconnected extensively with brain regions involved in spatial processing and eye movement control. Recent inactivation studies have shown that the dorsal pulvinar (dPul) plays a role in saccade target selection; however, it remains unknown whether it exerts effects on visual processing or at planning/execution stages. We used electrical microstimulation of the dPul while monkeys performed saccade tasks toward instructed and freely chosen targets. Timing of stimulation was varied, starting before, at, or after onset of target(s). Stimulation affected saccade properties and target selection in a time-dependent manner. Stimulation starting before but overlapping with target onset shortened saccadic reaction times (RTs) for ipsiversive (to the stimulation site) target locations, whereas stimulation starting at and after target onset caused systematic delays for both ipsiversive and contraversive locations. Similarly, stimulation starting before the onset of bilateral targets increased ipsiversive target choices, whereas stimulation after target onset increased contraversive choices. Properties of dPul neurons and stimulation effects were consistent with an overall contraversive drive, with varying outcomes contingent upon behavioral demands. RT and choice effects were largely congruent in the visually-guided task, but stimulation during memory-guided saccades, while influencing RTs and errors, did not affect choice behavior. Together, these results show that the dPul plays a primary role in action planning as opposed to visual processing, that it exerts its strongest influence on spatial choices when decision and action are temporally close, and that this choice effect can be dissociated from motor effects on saccade initiation and execution.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Despite a recent surge of interest, the core function of the pulvinar, the largest thalamic complex in primates, remains elusive. This understanding is crucial given the central role of the pulvinar in current theories of integrative brain functions supporting cognition and goal-directed behaviors, but electrophysiological and causal interference studies of dorsal pulvinar (dPul) are rare. Building on our previous studies that pharmacologically suppressed dPul activity for several hours, here we used transient electrical microstimulation at different periods while monkeys performed instructed and choice eye movement tasks, to determine time-specific contributions of pulvinar to saccade generation and decision making. We show that stimulation effects depend on timing and behavioral state and that effects on choices can be dissociated from motor effects.</p>

<p>Characterizing the functional impact of novel mutations linked to autism spectrum disorder (ASD) provides a deeper mechanistic understanding of the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. Here we show that a <i>de novo</i> Glu183 to Val (E183V) mutation in the CaMKIIα catalytic domain, identified in a proband diagnosed with ASD, decreases both CaMKIIα substrate phosphorylation and regulatory autophosphorylation, and that the mutated kinase acts in a dominant-negative manner to reduce CaMKIIα-WT autophosphorylation. The E183V mutation also reduces CaMKIIα binding to established ASD-linked proteins, such as Shank3 and subunits of l-type calcium channels and NMDA receptors, and increases CaMKIIα turnover in intact cells. In cultured neurons, the E183V mutation reduces CaMKIIα targeting to dendritic spines. Moreover, neuronal expression of CaMKIIα-E183V increases dendritic arborization and decreases both dendritic spine density and excitatory synaptic transmission. Mice with a knock-in CaMKIIα-E183V mutation have lower total forebrain CaMKIIα levels, with reduced targeting to synaptic subcellular fractions. The CaMKIIα-E183V mice also display aberrant behavioral phenotypes, including hyperactivity, social interaction deficits, and increased repetitive behaviors. Together, these data suggest that CaMKIIα plays a previously unappreciated role in ASD-related synaptic and behavioral phenotypes.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Many autism spectrum disorder (ASD)-linked mutations disrupt the function of synaptic proteins, but no single gene accounts for &gt;1% of total ASD cases. The molecular networks and mechanisms that couple the primary deficits caused by these individual mutations to core behavioral symptoms of ASD remain poorly understood. Here, we provide the first characterization of a mutation in the gene encoding CaMKIIα linked to a specific neuropsychiatric disorder. Our findings demonstrate that this ASD-linked <i>de novo CAMK2A</i> mutation disrupts multiple CaMKII functions, induces synaptic deficits, and causes ASD-related behavioral alterations, providing novel insights into the synaptic mechanisms contributing to ASD.</p>

<p>Major signaling molecules initially characterized as key early developmental regulators are also essential for the plasticity of the nervous system. Previously, the Wingless (Wg)/Wnt pathway was shown to underlie the structural and electrophysiological changes during activity-dependent synaptic plasticity at the <i>Drosophila</i> neuromuscular junction. A challenge remains to understand how this signal mediates the cellular changes underlying this plasticity. Here, we focus on the actin regulator Cortactin, a major organizer of protrusion, membrane mobility, and invasiveness, and define its new role in synaptic plasticity. We show that Cortactin is present presynaptically and postsynaptically at the <i>Drosophila</i> NMJ and that it is a presynaptic regulator of rapid activity-dependent modifications in synaptic structure. Furthermore, animals lacking presynaptic Cortactin show a decrease in spontaneous release frequency, and presynaptic Cortactin is necessary for the rapid potentiation of spontaneous release frequency that takes place during activity-dependent plasticity. Most interestingly, Cortactin levels increase at stimulated synaptic terminals and this increase requires neuronal activity, <i>de novo</i> transcription and depends on Wg/Wnt expression. Because it is not simply the presence of Cortactin in the presynaptic terminal but its increase that is necessary for the full range of activity-dependent plasticity, we conclude that it probably plays a direct and important role in the regulation of this process.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> In the nervous system, changes in activity that lead to modifications in synaptic structure and function are referred to as synaptic plasticity and are thought to be the basis of learning and memory. The secreted Wingless/Wnt molecule is a potent regulator of synaptic plasticity in both vertebrates and invertebrates. Understanding the molecular mechanisms that underlie these plastic changes is a major gap in our knowledge. Here, we identify a presynaptic effector molecule of the Wingless/Wnt signal, Cortactin. We show that this molecule is a potent regulator of modifications in synaptic structure and is necessary for the electrophysiological changes taking place during synaptic plasticity.</p>

<p>Orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), medial frontal cortex (MFC), and amygdala mediate stimulus–reward learning, but the mechanisms through which they interact are unclear. Here, we investigated how neurons in macaque OFC and MFC signaled rewards and the stimuli that predicted them during learning with and without amygdala input. Macaques performed a task that required them to evaluate two stimuli and then choose one to receive the reward associated with that option. Four main findings emerged. First, amygdala lesions slowed the acquisition and use of stimulus–reward associations. Further analyses indicated that this impairment was due, at least in part, to ineffective use of negative feedback to guide subsequent decisions. Second, the activity of neurons in OFC and MFC rapidly evolved to encode the amount of reward associated with each stimulus. Third, amygdalectomy reduced encoding of stimulus–reward associations during the evaluation of different stimuli. Reward encoding of anticipated and received reward after choices were made was not altered. Fourth, amygdala lesions led to an increase in the proportion of neurons in MFC, but not OFC, that encoded the instrumental response that monkeys made on each trial. These correlated changes in behavior and neural activity after amygdala lesions strongly suggest that the amygdala contributes to the ability to learn stimulus–reward associations rapidly by shaping encoding within OFC and MFC.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Altered functional interactions among orbital frontal cortex (OFC), medial frontal cortex (MFC), and amygdala are thought to underlie several psychiatric conditions, many related to reward learning. Here, we investigated the causal contribution of the amygdala to the development of neuronal activity in macaque OFC and MFC related to rewards and the stimuli that predict them during learning. Without amygdala inputs, neurons in both OFC and MFC showed decreased encoding of stimulus–reward associations. MFC also showed increased encoding of the instrumental responses that monkeys made on each trial. Behaviorally, changes in neural activity were accompanied by slower stimulus–reward learning. The findings suggest that interactions among amygdala, OFC, and MFC contribute to learning about stimuli that predict rewards.</p>

<p>Humans are unique in their ability to communicate using spoken language. However, it remains unclear how the speech signal is transformed and represented in the brain at different stages of the auditory pathway. In this study, we characterized electroencephalography responses to continuous speech by obtaining the time-locked responses to phoneme instances (phoneme-related potential). We showed that responses to different phoneme categories are organized by phonetic features. We found that each instance of a phoneme in continuous speech produces multiple distinguishable neural responses occurring as early as 50 ms and as late as 400 ms after the phoneme onset. Comparing the patterns of phoneme similarity in the neural responses and the acoustic signals confirms a repetitive appearance of acoustic distinctions of phonemes in the neural data. Analysis of the phonetic and speaker information in neural activations revealed that different time intervals jointly encode the acoustic similarity of both phonetic and speaker categories. These findings provide evidence for a dynamic neural transformation of low-level speech features as they propagate along the auditory pathway, and form an empirical framework to study the representational changes in learning, attention, and speech disorders.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We characterized the properties of evoked neural responses to phoneme instances in continuous speech. We show that each instance of a phoneme in continuous speech produces several observable neural responses at different times occurring as early as 50 ms and as late as 400 ms after the phoneme onset. Each temporal event explicitly encodes the acoustic similarity of phonemes, and linguistic and nonlinguistic information are best represented at different time intervals. Finally, we show a joint encoding of phonetic and speaker information, where the neural representation of speakers is dependent on phoneme category. These findings provide compelling new evidence for dynamic processing of speech sounds in the auditory pathway.</p>

<p>Zika virus (ZIKV), a positive-sense RNA flavivirus, has attracted considerable attention recently for its potential to cause serious neurological problems, including microcephaly, cortical thinning, and blindness during early development. Recent findings suggest that ZIKV infection of the brain can occur not only during very early stages of development, but also in later fetal/early neonatal stages of maturation. Surprisingly, after peripheral inoculation of immunocompetent mice on the day of birth, the first cells targeted throughout the brain were isolated astrocytes. At later stages, more neurons showed ZIKV immunoreactivity, in part potentially due to ZIKV release from infected astrocytes. In all developing mice studied, we detected infection of retinal neurons; in many mice, this was also associated with infection of the lateral geniculate, suprachiasmatic nuclei, and superior colliculus, suggesting a commonality for the virus to infect cells of the visual system. Interestingly, in mature mice lacking a Type 1 interferon response (IFNR<sup>–/–</sup>), after inoculation of the eye, the initial majority of infected cells in the visual system were glial cells along the optic tract. ZIKV microinjection into the somatosensory cortex on one side of the normal mouse brain resulted in mirror infection restricted to the contralateral somatosensory cortex without any infection of midline brain regions, indicating the virus can move by axonal transport to synaptically coupled brain loci. These data support the view that ZIKV shows considerable complexity in targeting the CNS and may target different cells at different stages of brain development.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Zika virus (ZIKV) can cause substantial damage to the developing human brain. Here we examine a developmental mouse model of ZIKV infection in the newborn mouse in which the brain is developmentally similar to a second-trimester human fetus. After peripheral inoculation, the virus entered the CNS in all mice tested and initially targeted astrocytes throughout the brain. Infections of the retina were detected in all mice, and infection of CNS visual system nuclei in the brain was common. We find that ZIKV can be transported axonally, thereby enhancing virus spread within the brain. These data suggest that ZIKV infects multiple cell types within the brain and that astrocyte infection may play a more important role in initial infection than previously appreciated.</p>

<p>Stress induces a shift from hippocampus-based "cognitive" toward dorsal striatum-based "habitual" learning and memory. This shift is thought to have important implications for stress-related psychopathologies, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, there is large individual variability in the stress-induced bias toward habit memory, and the factors underlying this variability are completely unknown. Here we hypothesized that a functional deletion variant of the gene encoding the α2b-adrenoceptor (<i>ADRA2B</i>), which has been linked to emotional memory processes and increased PTSD risk, modulates the stress-induced shift from cognitive toward habit memory. In two independent experimental studies, healthy humans were genotyped for the <i>ADRA2B</i> deletion variant. After a stress or control manipulation, participants completed a dual-solution learning task while electroencephalographic (Study I) or fMRI measurements (Study II) were taken. Carriers compared with noncarriers of the <i>ADRA2B</i> deletion variant exhibited a significantly reduced bias toward habit memory after stress. fMRI results indicated that, whereas noncarriers of the <i>ADRA2B</i> deletion variant showed increased functional connectivity between amygdala and putamen after stress, this increase in connectivity was absent in carriers of the deletion variant, who instead showed overall enhanced connectivity between amygdala and entorhinal cortex. Our results indicate that a common genetic variation of the noradrenergic system modulates the impact of stress on the balance between cognitive and habitual memory systems, most likely via altered amygdala orchestration of these systems.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Stressful events have a powerful effect on human learning and memory. Specifically, accumulating evidence suggests that stress favors more rigid dorsal striatum-dependent habit memory, at the expense of flexible hippocampus-dependent cognitive memory. Although this shift may have important implications for understanding mental disorders, such as post-traumatic stress disorder, little is known about the source of individual differences in the sensitivity for the stress-induced bias toward habit memory. We report here that a common genetic variation of the noradrenergic system, a known risk factor for post-traumatic stress disorder, modulates the stress-induced shift from cognitive to habit memory, most likely through altered crosstalk between the hippocampus and dorsal striatum with the amygdala, a key structure in emotional memory.</p>

<p>In a social group, animals make behavioral decisions that fit their social ranks. These behavioral choices are dependent on the various social cues experienced during social interactions. In vertebrates, little is known of how social status affects the underlying neural mechanisms regulating decision-making circuits that drive competing behaviors. Here, we demonstrate that social status in zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio</i>) influences behavioral decisions by shifting the balance in neural circuit activation between two competing networks (escape and swim). We show that socially dominant animals enhance activation of the swim circuit. Conversely, social subordinates display a decreased activation of the swim circuit, but an enhanced activation of the escape circuit. In an effort to understand how social status mediates these effects, we constructed a neurocomputational model of the escape and swim circuits. The model replicates our findings and suggests that social status–related shift in circuit dynamics could be mediated by changes in the relative excitability of the escape and swim networks. Together, our results reveal that changes in the excitabilities of the Mauthner command neuron for escape and the inhibitory interneurons that regulate swimming provide a cellular mechanism for the nervous system to adapt to changes in social conditions by permitting the animal to select a socially appropriate behavioral response.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Understanding how social factors influence nervous system function is of great importance. Using zebrafish as a model system, we demonstrate how social experience affects decision making to enable animals to produce socially appropriate behavior. Based on experimental evidence and computational modeling, we show that behavioral decisions reflect the interplay between competing neural circuits whose activation thresholds shift in accordance with social status. We demonstrate this through analysis of the behavior and neural circuit responses that drive escape and swim behaviors in fish. We show that socially subordinate animals favor escape over swimming, while socially dominants favor swimming over escape. We propose that these differences are mediated by shifts in relative circuit excitability.</p>

<p><i>O</i>-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) regulates a wide range of cellular processes through the addition of the <i>O-</i>GlcNAc sugar moiety to thousands of protein substrates. Because nutrient availability affects the activity of OGT, its role has been broadly studied in metabolic tissues. OGT is enriched in the nervous system, but little is known about its importance in basic neuronal processes <i>in vivo</i>. Here, we show that OGT is essential for sensory neuron survival and maintenance in mice. Sensory neuron-specific knock-out of OGT results in behavioral hyposensitivity to thermal and mechanical stimuli accompanied by decreased epidermal innervation and cell-body loss in the dorsal root ganglia. These effects are observed early in postnatal development and progress as animals age. Cultured sensory neurons lacking OGT also exhibit decreased axonal outgrowth. The effects on neuronal health <i>in vivo</i> are not solely due to disruption of developmental processes, because inducing OGT knock-out in the sensory neurons of adult mice results in a similar decrease in nerve fiber endings and cell bodies. Significant nerve-ending loss occurs before a decrease in cell bodies; this phenotype is indicative of axonal dieback that progresses to neuronal death. Our findings demonstrate that OGT is important in regulating axonal maintenance in the periphery and the overall health and survival of sensory neurons.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We show the importance of <i>O</i>-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) for sensory neuron health and survival <i>in vivo</i>. This study is the first to find that loss of OGT results in neuronal cell death. Moreover, it suggests that aberrant <i>O-</i>GlcNAc signaling can contribute to the development of neuropathy. The sensory neurons lie outside of the blood–brain barrier and therefore, compared to central neurons, may have a greater need for mechanisms of metabolic sensing and compensation. Peripheral sensory neurons in particular are subject to degeneration in diabetes. Our findings provide a foundation for understanding the role of OGT under normal physiological conditions in the peripheral nervous system. This knowledge will be important for gaining greater insight into such disease states as diabetic neuropathy.</p>

<p>We report that changes of phosphodiesterase-10A (PDE10A) can map widespread functional imbalance of basal ganglia circuits in a mouse model of DYT1 dystonia overexpressing mutant torsinA. PDE10A is a key enzyme in the catabolism of second messenger cAMP and cGMP, whose synthesis is stimulated by D1 receptors and inhibited by D2 receptors preferentially expressed in striatoentopeducuncular/substantia nigra or striatopallidal pathways, respectively. PDE10A was studied in control mice (NT) and in mice carrying human wild-type torsinA (hWT) or mutant torsinA (hMT). Quantitative analysis of PDE10A expression was assessed in different brain areas by rabbit anti-PDE10A antibody immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. PDE10A-dependent cAMP hydrolyzing activity and PDE10A mRNA were also assessed. Striatopallidal neurons were identified by rabbit anti-enkephalin antibody.</p>
<p>In NT mice, PDE10A is equally expressed in medium spiny striatal neurons and in their projections to entopeduncular nucleus/substantia nigra and to external globus pallidus. In hMT mice, PDE10A content selectively increases in enkephalin-positive striatal neuronal bodies; moreover, PDE10A expression and activity in hMT mice, compared with NT mice, significantly increase in globus pallidus but decrease in entopeduncular nucleus/substantia nigra. Similar changes of PDE10A occur in hWT mice, but such changes are not always significant. However, PDE10A mRNA expression appears comparable among NT, hWT, and hMT mice.</p>
<p>In <i>DYT1</i> transgenic mice, the inverse changes of PDE10A in striatoentopeduncular and striatopallidal projections might result over time in an imbalance between direct and indirect pathways for properly focusing movement. The decrease of PDE10A in the striatoentopeduncular/nigral projections might lead to increased intensity and duration of D1-stimulated cAMP/cGMP signaling; conversely, the increase of PDE10A in the striatopallidal projections might lead to increased intensity and duration of D2-inhibited cAMP/cGMP signaling.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> In <i>DYT1</i> transgenic mouse model of dystonia, PDE10A, a key enzyme in cAMP and cGMP catabolism, is downregulated in striatal projections to entopeduncular nucleus/substantia nigra, preferentially expressing D1 receptors that stimulate cAMP/cGMP synthesis. Conversely, in <i>DYT1</i> mice, PDE10A is upregulated in striatal projections to globus pallidus, preferentially expressing D2 receptors that inhibit cAMP/cGMP synthesis. The inverse changes to PDE10A in striatoentopeduncular/substantia nigra and striatopallidal pathways might tightly interact downstream to dopamine receptors, likely resulting over time to increased intensity and duration respectively of D1-stimulated and D2-inhibited cAMP/cGMP signals. Therefore, PDE10A changes in the DYT1 model of dystonia can upset the functional balance of basal ganglia circuits, affecting direct and indirect pathways simultaneously.</p>

<p>Animals show various behaviors in response to environmental chemicals. These behaviors are often plastic depending on previous experiences. <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>, which has highly developed chemosensory system with a limited number of sensory neurons, is an ideal model for analyzing the role of each neuron in innate and learned behaviors. Here, we report a new type of memory-dependent behavioral plasticity in Na<sup>+</sup> chemotaxis generated by the left member of bilateral gustatory neuron pair ASE (ASEL neuron). When worms were cultivated in the presence of Na<sup>+</sup>, they showed positive chemotaxis toward Na<sup>+</sup>, but when cultivated under Na<sup>+</sup>-free conditions, they showed no preference regarding Na<sup>+</sup> concentration. Both channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) activation with blue light and up-steps of Na<sup>+</sup> concentration activated ASEL only after cultivation with Na<sup>+</sup>, as judged by increase in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Under cultivation conditions with Na<sup>+</sup>, photoactivation of ASEL caused activation of its downstream interneurons AIY and AIA, which stimulate forward locomotion, and inhibition of its downstream interneuron AIB, which inhibits the turning/reversal behavior, and overall drove worms toward higher Na<sup>+</sup> concentrations. We also found that the Gq signaling pathway and the neurotransmitter glutamate are both involved in the behavioral response generated by ASEL.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Animals have acquired various types of behavioral plasticity during their long evolutionary history. <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> prefers odors associated with food, but plastically changes its behavioral response according to previous experience. Here, we report a new type of behavioral response generated by a single gustatory sensory neuron, the ASE-left (ASEL) neuron. ASEL did not respond to photostimulation or upsteps of Na<sup>+</sup> concentration when worms were cultivated in Na<sup>+</sup>-free conditions; however, when worms were cultivated with Na<sup>+</sup>, ASEL responded and inhibited AIB to avoid turning and stimulated AIY and AIA to promote forward locomotion, which collectively drove worms toward higher Na<sup>+</sup> concentrations. Glutamate and the Gq signaling pathway are essential for driving worms toward higher Na<sup>+</sup> concentrations.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/8/2086?rss=1">Cholinergic Interneurons Underlie Spontaneous Dopamine Release in Nucleus Accumbens</a></h4>

<p>The release of dopamine from terminals in the NAc is regulated by a number of factors, including voltage-gated ion channels, D2-autoreceptors, and nAChRs. Cholinergic interneurons (CINs) drive dopamine release through activation of nAChRs on dopamine terminals. Using cyclic voltammetry in mouse brain slices, nAChR-dependent spontaneous dopamine transients and the mechanisms underlying the origin were examined in the NAc. Spontaneous events were infrequent (0.3 per minute), but the rate and amplitude were increased after blocking Kv channels with 4-aminopyridine. Although the firing frequency of CINs was increased by blocking glutamate reuptake with TBOA and the Sk blocker apamin, only 4-aminopyridine increased the frequency of dopamine transients. In contrast, inhibition of CIN firing with the μ/ selective opioid [Met<sup>5</sup>]enkephalin (1 μm) decreased spontaneous dopamine transients. Cocaine increased the rate and amplitude of dopamine transients, suggesting that the activity of the dopamine transporter limits the detection of these events. In the presence of cocaine, the rate of spontaneous dopamine transients was further increased after blocking D2-autoreceptors. Blockade of muscarinic receptors had no effect on evoked dopamine release, suggesting that feedback inhibition of acetylcholine release was not involved. Thus, although spontaneous dopamine transients are reliant on nAChRs, the frequency was not strictly governed by the activity of CINs. The increase in frequency of spontaneous dopamine transients induced by cocaine was not due to an increase in cholinergic tone and is likely a product of an increase in detection resulting from decreased dopamine reuptake.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The actions of dopamine in the NAc are thought to be responsible for endogenous reward and the reinforcing properties of drugs of abuse, such as psychostimulants. The present work examines the mechanisms underlying nAChR-induced spontaneous dopamine release. This study demonstrates that spontaneous dopamine release is (1) dependent of the activation of nicotinic receptors, (2) independent on the spontaneous activity of cholinergic interneurons, and (3) that cocaine increased the detection of dopamine transients by prolonging the presence and increasing the diffusion of dopamine in the extracellular space. The release of acetylcholine is therefore responsible for spontaneous dopamine transients, and cocaine augments dopamine tone without altering activity of cholinergic interneurons.</p>

<p>Cellular asymmetries play crucial roles in development and organ function. The planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling pathway is involved in the establishment of cellular asymmetry within the plane of a cell sheet. Inner ear sensory hair cells (HCs), which have several rows of staircase-like stereocilia and one kinocilium located at the vertex of the stereocilia protruding from the apical surface of each HC, exhibit a typical form of PCP. Although connections between cilia and PCP signaling in vertebrate development have been reported, their precise nature is not well understood. During inner ear development, several ciliary proteins are known to play a role in PCP formation. In the current study, we investigated a functional role for intestinal cell kinase (Ick), which regulates intraflagellar transport (IFT) at the tip of cilia, in the mouse inner ear. A lack of <i>Ick</i> in the developing inner ear resulted in PCP defects in the cochlea, including misorientation or misshaping of stereocilia and aberrant localization of the kinocilium and basal body in the apical and middle turns, leading to auditory dysfunction. We also observed abnormal ciliary localization of Ift88 in both HCs and supporting cells. Together, our results show that Ick ciliary kinase is essential for PCP formation in inner ear HCs, suggesting that ciliary transport regulation is important for PCP signaling.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The cochlea in the inner ear is the hearing organ. Planar cell polarity (PCP) in hair cells (HCs) in the cochlea is essential for mechanotransduction and refers to the asymmetric structure consisting of stereociliary bundles and the kinocilium on the apical surface of the cell body. We reported previously that a ciliary kinase, Ick, regulates intraflagellar transport (IFT). Here, we found that loss of Ick leads to abnormal localization of the IFT component in kinocilia, PCP defects in HCs, and hearing dysfunction. Our study defines the association of ciliary transport regulation with PCP formation in HCs and hearing function.</p>

<p>Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions have distinct roles in the outer segment, cell body, and synaptic terminal of photoreceptors. We tested the hypothesis that distinct Ca<sup>2+</sup> domains are maintained by Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake into mitochondria. Serial block face scanning electron microscopy of zebrafish cones revealed that nearly 100 mitochondria cluster at the apical side of the inner segment, directly below the outer segment. The endoplasmic reticulum surrounds the basal and lateral surfaces of this cluster, but does not reach the apical surface or penetrate into the cluster. Using genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors, we found that mitochondria take up Ca<sup>2+</sup> when it accumulates either in the cone cell body or outer segment. Blocking mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uniporter activity compromises the ability of mitochondria to maintain distinct Ca<sup>2+</sup> domains. Together, our findings indicate that mitochondria can modulate subcellular functional specialization in photoreceptors.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis is essential for the survival and function of retinal photoreceptors. Separate pools of Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulate phototransduction in the outer segment, metabolism in the cell body, and neurotransmitter release at the synaptic terminal. We investigated the role of mitochondria in compartmentalization of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. We found that mitochondria form a dense cluster that acts as a diffusion barrier between the outer segment and cell body. The cluster is surprisingly only partially surrounded by the endoplasmic reticulum, a key mediator of mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake. Blocking the uptake of Ca<sup>2+</sup> by mitochondria causes redistribution of Ca<sup>2+</sup> throughout the cell. Our results show that mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake in photoreceptors is complex and plays an essential role in normal function.</p>

<p>In this study, we used the peristaltic crawling of <i>Drosophila</i> larvae as a model to study how motor patterns are regulated by central circuits. We built an experimental system that allows simultaneous application of optogenetics and calcium imaging to the isolated ventral nerve cord (VNC). We then investigated the effects of manipulating local activity of motor neurons (MNs) on fictive locomotion observed as waves of MN activity propagating along neuromeres. Optical inhibition of MNs with halorhodopsin3 in a middle segment (A4, A5, or A6), but not other segments, dramatically decreased the frequency of the motor waves. Conversely, local activation of MNs with channelrhodopsin2 in a posterior segment (A6 or A7) increased the frequency of the motor waves. Since peripheral nerves mediating sensory feedback were severed in the VNC preparation, these results indicate that MNs send signals to the central circuits to regulate motor pattern generation. Our results also indicate segmental specificity in the roles of MNs in motor control. The effects of the local MN activity manipulation were lost in <i>shaking-B<sup>2</sup></i> (<i>shakB<sup>2</sup></i>) or <i>ogre<sup>2</sup></i>, gap-junction mutations in <i>Drosophila</i>, or upon acute application of the gap junction blocker carbenoxolone, implicating electrical synapses in the signaling from MNs. Cell-type-specific RNAi suggested <i>shakB</i> and <i>ogre</i> function in MNs and interneurons, respectively, during the signaling. Our results not only reveal an unexpected role for MNs in motor pattern regulation, but also introduce a powerful experimental system that enables examination of the input–output relationship among the component neurons in this system.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Motor neurons are generally considered passive players in motor pattern generation, simply relaying information from upstream interneuronal circuits to the target muscles. This study shows instead that MNs play active roles in the control of motor generation by conveying information via gap junctions to the central pattern-generating circuits in larval <i>Drosophila</i>, providing novel insights into motor circuit control. The experimental system introduced in this study also presents a new approach for studying intersegmentally coordinated locomotion. Unlike traditional electrophysiology methods, this system enables the simultaneous recording and manipulation of populations of neurons that are genetically specified and span multiple segments.</p>

<p>Hyperalgesic priming, a model of pain chronification in the rat, is mediated by ryanodine receptor-dependent calcium release. Although ryanodine induces priming in both sexes, females are 5 orders of magnitude more sensitive, by an estrogen receptor α (EsRα)-dependent mechanism. An inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>) receptor inhibitor prevented the induction of priming by ryanodine. For IP<sub>3</sub> induced priming, females were also more sensitive. IP<sub>3</sub>-induced priming was prevented by pretreatment with inhibitors of the sarcoendoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase and ryanodine receptor. Antisense to EsRα prevented the induction of priming by low-dose IP<sub>3</sub> in females. The induction of priming by an EsRα agonist was ryanodine receptor-dependent and prevented by the IP<sub>3</sub> antagonist. Thus, an EsRα-dependent bidirectional interaction between endoplasmic reticulum IP<sub>3</sub> and ryanodine receptor-mediated calcium signaling is present in the induction of hyperalgesic priming, in females. In cultured male DRG neurons, IP<sub>3</sub> (100 μm) potentiated depolarization-induced transients produced by extracellular application of high-potassium solution (20 mm, K20), in nociceptors incubated with β-estradiol. This potentiation of depolarization-induced calcium transients was blocked by the IP<sub>3</sub> antagonist, and not observed in the absence of IP<sub>3</sub>. IP<sub>3</sub> potentiation was also blocked by ryanodine receptor antagonist. The application of ryanodine (2 nm), instead of IP<sub>3</sub>, also potentiated K20-induced calcium transients in the presence of β-estradiol, in an IP<sub>3</sub> receptor-dependent manner. Our results point to an EsRα-dependent, reciprocal interaction between IP<sub>3</sub> and ryanodine receptors that contributes to sex differences in hyperalgesic priming.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The present study demonstrates a mechanism that plays a role in the marked sexual dimorphism observed in a model of the transition to chronic pain, hyperalgesic priming. This mechanism involves a reciprocal interaction between the endoplasmic reticulum receptors, IP<sub>3</sub> and ryanodine, in the induction of priming, regulated by estrogen receptor α in the nociceptor of female rats. The presence of this signaling pathway modulating the susceptibility of nociceptors to develop plasticity may contribute to our understanding of sex differences observed clinically in chronic pain syndromes.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/8/2022?rss=1">Neural Differentiation of Incorrectly Predicted Memories</a></h4>

<p>When an item is predicted in a particular context but the prediction is violated, memory for that item is weakened (Kim et al., 2014). Here, we explore what happens when such previously mispredicted items are later reencountered. According to prior neural network simulations, this sequence of events—misprediction and subsequent restudy—should lead to differentiation of the item's neural representation from the previous context (on which the misprediction was based). Specifically, misprediction weakens connections in the representation to features shared with the previous context and restudy allows new features to be incorporated into the representation that are not shared with the previous context. This cycle of misprediction and restudy should have the net effect of moving the item's neural representation away from the neural representation of the previous context. We tested this hypothesis using human fMRI by tracking changes in item-specific BOLD activity patterns in the hippocampus, a key structure for representing memories and generating predictions. In left CA2/3/DG, we found greater neural differentiation for items that were repeatedly mispredicted and restudied compared with items from a control condition that was identical except without misprediction. We also measured prediction strength in a trial-by-trial fashion and found that greater misprediction for an item led to more differentiation, further supporting our hypothesis. Therefore, the consequences of prediction error go beyond memory weakening. If the mispredicted item is restudied, the brain adaptively differentiates its memory representation to improve the accuracy of subsequent predictions and to shield it from further weakening.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Competition between overlapping memories leads to weakening of nontarget memories over time, making it easier to access target memories. However, a nontarget memory in one context might become a target memory in another context. How do such memories get restrengthened without increasing competition again? Computational models suggest that the brain handles this by reducing neural connections to the previous context and adding connections to new features that were not part of the previous context. The result is neural differentiation away from the previous context. Here, we provide support for this theory, using fMRI to track neural representations of individual memories in the hippocampus and how they change based on learning.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/8/2010?rss=1">Orbitofrontal Cortex Signals Expected Outcomes with Predictive Codes When Stable Contingencies Promote the Integration of Reward History</a></h4>

<p>Memory can inform goal-directed behavior by linking current opportunities to past outcomes. The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) may guide value-based responses by integrating the history of stimulus–reward associations into expected outcomes, representations of predicted hedonic value and quality. Alternatively, the OFC may rapidly compute flexible "online" reward predictions by associating stimuli with the latest outcome. OFC neurons develop predictive codes when rats learn to associate arbitrary stimuli with outcomes, but the extent to which predictive coding depends on most recent events and the integrated history of rewards is unclear. To investigate how reward history modulates OFC activity, we recorded OFC ensembles as rats performed spatial discriminations that differed only in the number of rewarded trials between goal reversals. The firing rate of single OFC neurons distinguished identical behaviors guided by different goals. When &gt;20 rewarded trials separated goal switches, OFC ensembles developed stable and anticorrelated population vectors that predicted overall choice accuracy and the goal selected in single trials. When &lt;10 rewarded trials separated goal switches, OFC population vectors decorrelated rapidly after each switch, but did not develop anticorrelated firing patterns or predict choice accuracy. The results show that, whereas OFC signals respond rapidly to contingency changes, they predict choices only when reward history is relatively stable, suggesting that consecutive rewarded episodes are needed for OFC computations that integrate reward history into expected outcomes.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Adapting to changing contingencies and making decisions engages the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). Previous work shows that OFC function can either improve or impair learning depending on reward stability, suggesting that OFC guides behavior optimally when contingencies apply consistently. The mechanisms that link reward history to OFC computations remain obscure. Here, we examined OFC unit activity as rodents performed tasks controlled by contingencies that varied reward history. When contingencies were stable, OFC neurons signaled past, present, and pending events; when contingencies were unstable, past and present coding persisted, but predictive coding diminished. The results suggest that OFC mechanisms require stable contingencies across consecutive episodes to integrate reward history, represent predicted outcomes, and inform goal-directed choices.</p>

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<div class="para"><p><b><em>Objective</em></b>: Determine clinical and neuropathological outcomes following a clinical diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI).</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b><em>Methods</em></b>: Data were drawn from a large autopsy series (N=1,337) of individuals followed longitudinally from normal or MCI status to death, derived from four Alzheimer's Disease (AD) Centers in the United States.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b><em>Results</em></b>: Mean follow-up was 7.9 years. Of the 874 individuals ever diagnosed with MCI, final clinical diagnoses were varied: 39.2% died with an MCI diagnosis, 46.8% with a dementia diagnosis, and 13.9% died with a diagnosis of intact cognition. The latter group had pathological features resembling those with a final clinical diagnosis of MCI. In terms of non-AD pathologies, both primary age-related tauopathy (p&lt;0.05) and brain arteriolosclerosis pathology (p&lt;0.001) were more severe in MCI than cognitively intact controls. Among the group that remained MCI until death, Mixed AD neuropathologic changes (ADNC) (≥1 comorbid pathology) was more frequent than Pure ADNC pathology (55% vs. 22%); “suspected non-Alzheimer's pathology” (SNAP) comprised the remaining 22% of cases. A majority (74%) of subjects who died with MCI were without “high” level ADNC, Lewy body disease, or hippocampal sclerosis pathologies; this group was enriched in cerebrovascular pathologies. Subjects who died with dementia and were without severe neurodegenerative pathologies tended to have cerebrovascular pathology and carry the MCI diagnosis for a longer interval.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b><em>Interpretation</em></b>: MCI diagnosis usually was associated with comorbid neuropathologies; less than one-quarter of MCI cases showed “pure” AD at autopsy. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.</p></div>

<p>Line attractors in neural networks have been suggested to be the basis of
many brain functions, such as working memory, oculomotor control, head
direction, locomotion, and sensory processing. In recent work, we incorporated
pulse gating into feedforward neural networks and showed that the transmission
of graded information can be viewed as a line attractor in the firing rate of
transiently synchronous populations. While this was revealed in an analysis
using rate models, graded information transfer persisted in spiking neural
networks and was robust to intrinsic and extrinsic noise. Here, using a
Fokker-Planck approach, we show that the gradedness of rate amplitude
information transmission in pulse-gated networks is associated with the
existence of a cusp catastrophe, and that the slow dynamics near the fold of
the cusp underlies the robustness of the line attractor. Understanding the
dynamical aspects of this cusp catastrophe allows us to show how line
attractors can persist in biologically realistic neuronal networks and how the
interplay of pulse gating, synaptic coupling and neuronal stochasticity can be
used to enable attracting one-dimensional manifolds and thus, dynamically
control graded information processing.

<p>Brains need to predict how our muscles and body react to motor commands. How
networks of spiking neurons can learn to reproduce these non-linear dynamics,
using local, online and stable learning rules, is an important, open question.
Here, we present a supervised learning scheme for the feedforward and recurrent
connections in a network of heterogeneous spiking neurons. The error in the
output is fed back through fixed random connections with a negative gain,
causing the network to follow the desired dynamics, while an online and local
rule changes the weights; hence we call the scheme FOLLOW (Feedback-based
Online Local Learning Of Weights) The rule is local in the sense that weight
changes depend on the presynaptic activity and the error signal projected onto
the post-synaptic neuron. We provide examples of learning linear, non-linear
and chaotic dynamics, as well as the dynamics of a two-link arm. Using the
Lyapunov method, and under reasonable assumptions and approximations, we show
that FOLLOW learning is uniformly stable, with the error going to zero
asymptotically.

<p>We present here a browser-based application for visualizing patterns of
connectivity in 3D stacked data matrices with large numbers of pairwise
relations. Visualizing a connectivity matrix, looking for trends and patterns,
and dynamically manipulating these values is a challenge for scientists from
diverse fields, including neuroscience and genomics. In particular,
high-dimensional neural data include those acquired via electroencephalography
(EEG), electrocorticography (ECoG), magnetoencephalography (MEG), and
functional MRI. Neural connectivity data contains multivariate attributes for
each edge between different brain regions, which motivated our lightweight,
open source, easy-to-use visualization tool for the exploration of these
connectivity matrices to highlight connections of interest. Here we present a
client-side, mobile-compatible visualization tool written entirely in
HTML5/JavaScript that allows in-browser manipulation of user-defined files for
exploration of brain connectivity. Visualizations can highlight different
aspects of the data simultaneously across different dimensions. Input files are
in JSON format, and custom Python scripts have been written to parse MATLAB or
Python data files into JSON-loadable format. We demonstrate the analysis of
connectivity data acquired via human ECoG recordings as a domain-specific
implementation of our application. We envision applications for this
interactive tool in fields seeking to visualize pairwise connectivity.

<p>Our century has unprecedented new challenges, which need creative solutions
and deep thinking. Contemplative, deep thinking became an "endangered species"
in our rushing world of Tweets, elevator pitches and fast decisions. Here we
describe that important aspects of both creativity and deep thinking can be
understood as network phenomena of conceptual and social networks. "Creative
nodes" occupy highly dynamic, boundary spanning positions in social networks.
Creative thinking requires alternating plasticity-dominated and
rigidity-dominated mindsets, which can be helped by dynamically changing social
network structures. In the closing section we present three case studies which
demonstrate the applications of the concept in the Hungarian research student
movement, the Hungarian Templeton Program and the Youth Platform of the
European Talent Support Network. These examples show how talent support
programs can mobilize the power of social networks to enhance creative,
deliberative, deep thinking of talented young minds, influencing social
opinion, leading to community action, and developing charismatic leadership
skills.

<p>Identification of intended movement type and movement phase of hand grasp
shaping are critical features for the control of volitional neuroprosthetics.
We demonstrate that neural dynamics during visually-guided imagined grasp
shaping can encode intended movement. We apply Procrustes analysis and LASSO
regression to achieve 72% accuracy (chance = 25%) in distinguishing between
visually-guided imagined grasp trajectories. Further, we can predict the stage
of grasp shaping in the form of elapsed time from start of trial (R2=0.4). Our
approach contributes to more accurate single-trial decoding of higher-level
movement goals and the phase of grasping movements in individuals not trained
with brain-computer interfaces. We also find that the overall time-varying
trajectory structure of imagined movements tend to be consistent within
individuals, and that transient trajectory deviations within trials return to
the task-dependent trajectory mean. These overall findings may contribute to
the further understanding of the cortical dynamics of human motor imagery.

<p>A major obstacle to understanding neural coding and computation is the fact
that experimental recordings typically sample only a small fraction of the
neurons in a circuit. Measured neural properties are skewed by interactions
between recorded neurons and the "hidden" portion of the network. To properly
interpret neural data, we thus need a better understanding of the relationships
between measured effective neural properties and the true underlying
physiological properties. Here, we focus on how the effective spatiotemporal
dynamics of the synaptic interactions between neurons are reshaped by coupling
to unobserved neurons. We find that the effective interactions from a
pre-synaptic neuron $r'$ to a post-synaptic neuron $r$ can be decomposed into a
sum of the true interaction from $r'$ to $r$ plus corrections from every
directed path from $r'$ to $r$ through unobserved neurons. Importantly, the
resulting formula reveals when the hidden units have---or do not have---major
effects on reshaping the interactions among observed neurons. As a prominent
example, we derive a formula for strong impact of hidden units in random
networks with connection weights that scale with $1/\sqrt{N}$, where $N$ is the
network size---precisely the scaling observed in recent experiments.

<p>We revisit the problem of deriving the mean-field values of avalanche
critical exponents in systems with absorbing states. These are well-known to
coincide with those of an un-biased branching process. Here, we show that for
at least 4 different universality classes (directed percolation, dynamical
percolation, the voter model or compact directed percolation class, and the
Manna class of stochastic sandpiles) this common result can be obtained by
mapping the corresponding Langevin equations describing each of these classes
into a random walker confined close to the origin by a logarithmic potential.
Many of the results derived here appear in the literature as independently
derived for individual universality classes or for the branching process.
However, the emergence of non-universal continuously-varying exponent values
--which, as shown here, stems fro the presence of small external driving, that
might induce avalanche merging-- has not been noticed (or emphasized) in the
past. We believe that a simple an unified perspective as the one presented here
can (i) help to clarify the overall picture, (ii) underline the
super-universality of the behavior as well as the dependence on external
driving, and (iii) help avoiding the common existing confusion between
un-biased branching processes (equivalent to a random walker in a balanced
logarithmic potential) and standard (un-confined) random walkers.

<p>Critical branching is a theoretical interaction in-between simple units, such
as neuronal elements of the human brain. Zhigalov, Kaplan, and Palva (2016,
Clin. Neurophysiol., 127(8), 2882-2889) revealed that neurofeedback flash
stimulation locked to the phase of high-amplitude occipital alpha influences
stimulus-locked occipital averages in the alpha-band. This feedback also
influences the power scaling of long-range temporal correlations in alpha-band
amplitude fluctuations. Seemingly, neurofeedback influences critical branching
alongside there being an interaction between ongoing neuronal activity and
evoked responses. However, the causal relations between these neuronal
long-range temporal correlations, sustained attention, and any avalanche
dynamics are called into question. Further, uncorrected concerns include false
discovery rate and an objective mathematical error in the precedent (Palva et
al., 2013, Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 110(9), 3585-3590). An alternative set
of illustrative mathematical principles offers a preliminary fit to the effects
in the data. That is, neurofeedback influences the deterministic contribution
to the single-trial event-related potentials, which each flash evokes,
separately from the oscillatory alpha gain that those flashes cause.
Accordingly, distinct principles of this neurofeedback-related exponential
occipital oscillatory alpha gain and deterministic event-related potential
generation produce micro-behaviours with macroscale consequences: neurofeedback
causally influences power-scaling of long-range temporal correlations without
critical branching.

<p>Inferring processes or constructs from performance data is a major hallmark
of cognitive psychometrics. Particularly diffusion modeling of response times
(RTs) from correct and erroneous responses using the Wiener distribution has
become a popular measurement tool because it provides a set of psychologically
interpretable parameters. However, an important precondition to identify all of
these parameters, is a sufficient number of RTs from erroneous responses. In
the present article, we show by simulation that the parameters of the Wiener
distribution can be recovered even from tasks yielding very high or even
perfect response accuracies using the shifted Wald distribution. Specifically,
we argue that error RTs can be modeled as correct RTs that have undergone
censoring using techniques from parametric survival analysis. We illustrate our
reasoning by fitting the Wiener and (censored) shifted Wald distribution to RTs
from 6 participants who completed a Go/No-go task. In accordance with our
simulations, diffusion modeling using the Wiener and the shifted Wald
distribution yielded identical parameter estimates when the number of erroneous
responses was predicted to be low. Moreover, the modeling of error RTs as
censored correct RTs substantially improved the recovery of these diffusion
parameters when premature trial timeout was introduced to increase the number
of omission errors. Thus, the censored shifted Wald distribution provides a
suitable means for diffusion modeling in situations when the Wiener
distribution cannot be fitted without parametric constraints.

Sun and colleagues find that individual Grp+ spinal interneurons can respond to and distinguish between stimuli that provoke itch or pain. The nociceptive response is limited by enkaphalin-expressing interneurons that are connected synaptically to the Grp+ neurons.

Adult neural stem cells originate from the embryonic brain, but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly known. In this issue of Neuron, Falk et al. (2017) reveal how the timely control of cleavage plane orientation during division of embryonic neural progenitors has a specific and long-lasting impact on adult neurogenesis.

Neurotransmission requires exo-/endocytic cycling of synaptic vesicles (SVs). The timescale and mechanism of SV endocytosis remain debated.

Replication of neuroimaging studies is challenging for many reasons beyond the obvious pressure to publish novel findings. Specialized training is required to analyze neuroimaging data, which contributes to errors in data manipulation and false findings and limits the ability of scientists to reproduce findings. The cost and effort involved with conducting neuroimaging studies places even greater pressure on discovery rather than replication. Fortunately, there is a growing movement to share neuroimaging data for both purposes. Using a different dataset and different methods, a high-value replication of a highly influential neuroimaging study that showed correspondence between the brain networks that are active during idle rest and the networks that are engaged during the performance of tasks was conducted. Furthermore, the brain networks that are most strongly activated during task performance are shown for each task studied in the present work, providing new insights into task network function.

Action observation can facilitate the acquisition of novel motor skills, however, there is considerable individual variability in the extent to which observation promotes motor learning. Here we tested the hypothesis that individual differences in brain function or structure can predict subsequent observation-related gains in motor learning. Subjects underwent an anatomical MRI scan and resting-state fMRI scans to assess pre-observation grey matter volume and pre-observation resting-state functional connectivity (FC), respectively. On the following day, subjects observed a video of a tutor adapting her reaches to a novel force field. After observation, subjects performed reaches in a force field as a behavioral assessment of gains in motor learning resulting from observation. We found that individual differences in resting-state FC, but not grey matter volume, predicted post-observation gains in motor learning. Pre-observation resting-state FC between left S1 and bilateral PMd, M1, S1 and left SPL was positively correlated with behavioral measures of post-observation motor learning. Sensory-motor resting-state FC can thus predict the extent to which observation will promote subsequent motor learning.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/110890v1?rss=1">Mitochondrial impairment and rescue in riboflavin responsive neuropathy</a></h4>

Brown-Vialetto-Van Laere syndrome (BVVLS) represents a phenotypic spectrum of motor, sensory, and cranial nerve neuropathy, often with ataxia, optic atrophy and respiratory problems leading to ventilator-dependence. Loss-of-function mutations in two riboflavin transporter (RFVT) genes, SLC52A2 and SLC52A3, have recently been linked to BVVLS. However, the genetic frequency, neuropathology and downstream consequences of RFVT mutations have previously been undefined. By screening a large cohort of 132 patients with early-onset severe sensory, motor and cranial nerve neuropathy we confirmed the strong genetic link between RFVT mutations and BVVLS, identifying twenty-two pathogenic mutations in SLC52A2 and SLC52A3, fourteen of which were novel. Brain and spinal cord neuropathological examination of two cases with SLC52A3 mutations showed classical symmetrical brainstem lesions resembling pathology seen in mitochondrial disease, including severe neuronal loss in the lower cranial nerve nuclei, anterior horns and corresponding nerves, atrophy of the spinothalamic and spinocerebellar tracts and posterior column-medial lemniscus pathways. Mitochondrial dysfunction has previously been implicated in an array of neurodegenerative disorders. Since riboflavin metabolites are critical components of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC), we hypothesized that reduced riboflavin transport would result in impaired mitochondrial activity, and confirmed this using in vitro and in vivo models. ETC complex I and complex II activity were decreased in SLC52A2 patient fibroblasts, while global knockdown of the single Drosophila RFVT homologue revealed reduced levels of riboflavin, downstream metabolites, and ETC complex I activity. RFVT knockdown in Drosophila also resulted in severely impaired locomotor activity and reduced lifespan, mirroring patient pathology, and these phenotypes could be partially rescued using a novel esterified derivative of riboflavin. Our findings indicate mitochondrial dysfunction as a downstream consequence of RFVT gene defects in BVVLS and validate riboflavin esters as a potential therapeutic strategy.

Abstract Does processing the meanings of individual words vs. assembling words into phrases and sentences rely on distinct pools of cognitive and neural resources? Many have argued for such a dissociation, although the field is lacking a consensus on which brain region(s) support lexico-semantic vs. syntactic processing. Although some have also argued against such a dissociation, the dominant view in the field remains that distinct brain regions support these two fundamental components of language. One of the earlier and most cited pieces of evidence in favor of this dissociation comes from a paper by Dapretto &amp; Bookheimer (1999, Neuron; DB). Using a sentence meaning comparison task, DB observed two distinct peaks within the left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG): one more active when comparisons relied on lexico-semantic cues, and another when they instead relied on syntactic cues. Although the paper has been highly cited over the years, no attempt has been made, to our knowledge, to replicate the original finding. We here report an fMRI study that attempts to do so. Using a combination of three approaches, namely, whole-brain, group-level ROIs, and individual functional ROIs, we fail to replicate the originally reported dissociation. In particular, parts of the LIFG respond reliably more strongly during lexico-semantic than syntactic processing, but no part of the LIFG (including in the region defined around the peak reported by DB) shows the opposite response pattern. We hypothesize that the original result was a false positive, possibly driven by one participant or item given the use of a fixed-effects analysis and a small number of items (8 per condition) and participants (n=8).

Energy dissipation through interscapular brown adipose tissue (iBAT) thermogenesis is an important contributor to adaptive energy expenditure. However, it remains unresolved how acute and chronic changes in energy availability are detected by the brain to adjust iBAT activity and maintain energy homeostasis. Here we provide evidence that AGRP inhibitory tone to iBAT represents an energy-sparing circuit that integrates environmental food cues and internal signals of energy availability. We establish a role for the nutrient-sensing mTORC1 signaling pathway within AGRP neurons in the detection of environmental food cues and internal signals of energy availability, and in the bi-directionnal control of iBAT thermogenesis during nutrient deficiency and excess. Collectively, our findings provide insights into how mTORC1 signaling within AGRP neurons surveys energy availability to engage iBAT thermogenesis, and identify AGRP neurons as a neuronal substrate for the coordination of energy intake and adaptive expenditure under varying physiological and environmental contexts.

Assessing and analysing individual differences in change over time is of central scientific importance to developmental neuroscience. However, the extant literature is based largely on cross-sectional comparisons, which reflect a variety of influences and cannot directly represent change. We advocate using latent change score (LCS) models in longitudinal samples as a statistical framework to tease apart the complex processes underlying lifespan development in brain and behaviour using longitudinal data. LCS models provide a flexible framework that naturally accommodates key developmental questions as model parameters and can even be used, with some limitations, in cases with only two measurement occasions. We illustrate the use of LCS models with two empirical examples. In a lifespan cognitive training study (COGITO, N=204, two waves) we observe correlated change in brain and behaviour in the context of a high-intensity training intervention. In an adolescent development cohort (NSPN, N=176, two waves) we find greater variability in cortical thinning in males than in females. To facilitate the adoption of LCS by the developmental community, we provide analysis code that can be adapted by other researchers and basic primers in two freely available SEM software packages (lavaan and {Omega}nyx).

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/109900v1?rss=1">Low Dimensional Activity in Spiking Neuronal Networks</a></h4>

Several recent studies have shown that neural activity in vivo tends to be constrained to a low-dimensional manifold. Such activity does not arise in simulated neural networks with homogeneous connectivity and it has been suggested that it is indicative of some other connectivity pattern in neuronal networks. Surprisingly, the structure of the intrinsic manifold of the network activity puts constraints on learning. For instance, animals find it difficult to perform tasks that may require a change in the intrinsic manifold. Here, we demonstrate that the Neural Engineering Framework (NEF) can be adapted to design a biologically plausible spiking neuronal network that exhibit low dimensional activity. Consistent with experimental observations, the resulting synaptic weight distribution is heavy-tailed (log-normal). In our model, a change in the intrinsic manifold of the network activity requires rewiring of the whole network, which may be either not possible or a very slow process. This observation provides an explanation of why learning is easier when it does not require the neural activity to leave its intrinsic manifold.

The responses of neurons in the visual cortex (V1) of adult mammals have long been thought to be stable over long periods. Here, we investigated whether repeated exposure to specific stimuli would enhance V1 visual responses in mice using intrinsic signal imaging through the intact skull and two-photon imaging of calcium signals in single neurons. Mice ran on Styrofoam balls floating on air while viewing one of three different, high-contrast visual stimuli. V1 responses to the stimuli that were viewed by the animal were specifically enhanced, while responses to other stimuli were unaffected. Similar exposure in stationary mice, or in mice in which NMDA receptors were partially blocked, did not significantly enhance responses. These findings indicate that stimulus-specific plasticity in the adult visual cortex depends on concurrent locomotion, presumably as a result of the high-gain state of visual cortex induced by locomotion.

<p>by Zachary S. L. Foster, Thomas J. Sharpton, Niklaus J. Grünwald</p>

Community-level data, the type generated by an increasing number of metabarcoding studies, is often graphed as stacked bar charts or pie graphs that use color to represent taxa. These graph types do not convey the hierarchical structure of taxonomic classifications and are limited by the use of color for categories. As an alternative, we developed <i>metacoder</i>, an R package for easily parsing, manipulating, and graphing publication-ready plots of hierarchical data. <i>Metacoder</i> includes a dynamic and flexible function that can parse most text-based formats that contain taxonomic classifications, taxon names, taxon identifiers, or sequence identifiers. <i>Metacoder</i> can then subset, sample, and order this parsed data using a set of intuitive functions that take into account the hierarchical nature of the data. Finally, an extremely flexible plotting function enables quantitative representation of up to 4 arbitrary statistics simultaneously in a tree format by mapping statistics to the color and size of tree nodes and edges. <i>Metacoder</i> also allows exploration of barcode primer bias by integrating functions to run digital PCR. Although it has been designed for data from metabarcoding research, <i>metacoder</i> can easily be applied to any data that has a hierarchical component such as gene ontology or geographic location data. Our package complements currently available tools for community analysis and is provided open source with an extensive online user manual.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/zgIxP0C4ytU" width="1" />

<p>by Sean M. Gibbons, Sean M. Kearney, Chris S. Smillie, Eric J. Alm</p>

The gut microbiome is a dynamic system that changes with host development, health, behavior, diet, and microbe-microbe interactions. Prior work on gut microbial time series has largely focused on autoregressive models (e.g. Lotka-Volterra). However, we show that most of the variance in microbial time series is non-autoregressive. In addition, we show how community state-clustering is flawed when it comes to characterizing within-host dynamics and that more continuous methods are required. Most organisms exhibited stable, mean-reverting behavior suggestive of fixed carrying capacities and abundant taxa were largely shared across individuals. This mean-reverting behavior allowed us to apply sparse vector autoregression (sVAR)—a multivariate method developed for econometrics—to model the autoregressive component of gut community dynamics. We find a strong phylogenetic signal in the non-autoregressive co-variance from our sVAR model residuals, which suggests niche filtering. We show how changes in diet are also non-autoregressive and that Operational Taxonomic Units strongly correlated with dietary variables have much less of an autoregressive component to their variance, which suggests that diet is a major driver of microbial dynamics. Autoregressive variance appears to be driven by multi-day recovery from frequent facultative anaerobe blooms, which may be driven by fluctuations in luminal redox. Overall, we identify two dynamic regimes within the human gut microbiota: one likely driven by external environmental fluctuations, and the other by internal processes.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/7-KBWx0ACYs" width="1" />

Severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia (SNH) and the onset of bilirubin encephalopathy and kernicterus result in part from delayed expression of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1) and the inability to metabolize bilirubin. Although there is a good understanding of the early events after birth that lead to the rapid increase in serum bilirubin, the...<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/DBo6oiL2ggw" width="1" />

GATA4, an essential cardiogenic transcription factor, provides a model for dominant transcription factor mutations in human disease. Dominant GATA4 mutations cause congenital heart disease (CHD), specifically atrial and atrioventricular septal defects (ASDs and AVSDs). We found that second heart field (SHF)-specific Gata4 heterozygote embryos recapitulated the AVSDs observed in germline...<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/MjmPLNkwRvE" width="1" />

Fibroblasts are a main player in the tumor-inhibitory microenvironment. Upon tumor initiation and progression, fibroblasts can lose their tumor-inhibitory capacity and promote tumor growth. The molecular mechanisms that underlie this switch have not been defined completely. Previously, we identified four proteins overexpressed in cancer-associated fibroblasts and linked to Rho GTPase...<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/yKTsTNj5Xxg" width="1" />

<p>Polychronous neural groups are effective structures for the recognition of
precise spike-timing patterns but the detection method is an inefficient
multi-stage brute force process that works off-line on pre-recorded simulation
data. This work presents a new model of polychronous patterns that can capture
precise sequences of spikes directly in the neural simulation. In this scheme,
each neuron is assigned a randomized code that is used to tag the post-synaptic
neurons whenever a spike is transmitted. This creates a polychronous code that
preserves the order of pre-synaptic activity and can be registered in a hash
table when the post-synaptic neuron spikes. A polychronous code is a
sub-component of a polychronous group that will occur, along with others, when
the group is active. We demonstrate the representational and pattern
recognition ability of polychronous codes on a direction selective visual task
involving moving bars that is typical of a computation performed by simple
cells in the cortex. The computational efficiency of the proposed algorithm far
exceeds existing polychronous group detection methods and is well suited for
online detection.

<p>In the present work we analyzed the pupil size behavior of forty subjects
while they read well defined sentences with different contextual predictability
(i.e., regular sentences and proverbs). In general, pupil size increased when
reading regular sentences, but when readers realized that they were reading
proverbs their pupils strongly increase until finishing proverbs' reading. Our
results suggest that an increased pupil size is not limited to cognitive load
(i.e., relative difficulty in processing) because when participants accurately
recognized words during reading proverbs, theirs pupil size increased too. Our
results show that pupil size dynamics may be a reliable measure to investigate
the cognitive processes involved in sentence processing and memory functioning.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.05553">A simple mathematical model inspired by the Purkinje cells: from delayed travelling waves to fractional diffusion. (arXiv:1702.05553v1 [math.AP])</a></h4>

<p>Recently, several experiments have demonstrated the existence of fractional
diffusion in the neuronal transmission occurring in the Purkinje cells, whose
malfunctioning is known to be related to the lack of voluntary coordination and
the appearance of tremors.
</p>
<p>Also, a classical mathematical feature is that (fractional) parabolic
equations possess smoothing effects, in contrast with the case of hyperbolic
equations, which typically exhibit shocks and discontinuities.
</p>
<p>In this paper, we show how a simple toy-model of a highly ramified structure,
somehow inspired by that of the Purkinje cells, may produce a fractional
diffusion via the superposition of travelling waves that solve a hyperbolic
equation.
</p>
<p>This could suggest that the high ramification of the Purkinje cells might
have provided an evolutionary advantage of "smoothing" the transmission of
signals and avoiding shock propagations (at the price of slowing a bit such
transmission). Though an experimental confirmation of the possibility of such
evolutionary advantage goes well beyond the goals of this paper, we think that
is intriguing, as a mathematical counterpart, to consider the time fractional
diffusion as arising from the superposition of delayed travelling waves in
highly ramified transmission media.
</p>
<p>The new link that we propose between time fractional diffusion and hyperbolic
equation also provides a novelty with respect to the usual paradigm relating
time fractional diffusion with parabolic equations in the limit.
</p>
<p>The paper is written in such a way to be usable by both the communities of
biologists and mathematicians: to this aim, full explanations of the object
considered and detailed lists of references are provided.

<p>Obtaining meaningful quantitative descriptions of the statistical dependence
within multivariate systems is a difficult open problem. Recently, the Partial
Information Decomposition (PID) was proposed to decompose mutual information
(MI) about a target variable into components which are redundant, unique and
synergistic within different subsets of predictor variables. Here, we propose
to apply the elegant formalism of the PID to multivariate entropy, resulting in
a Partial Entropy Decomposition (PED). We implement the PED with an entropy
redundancy measure based on pointwise common surprisal; a natural definition
which is closely related to the definition of MI. We show how this approach can
reveal the dyadic vs triadic generative structure of multivariate systems that
are indistinguishable with classical Shannon measures. The entropy perspective
also shows that misinformation is synergistic entropy and hence that MI itself
includes both redundant and synergistic effects. We show the relationships
between the PED and MI in two predictors, and derive two alternative
information decompositions which we illustrate on several example systems. This
reveals that in entropy terms, univariate predictor MI is not a proper subset
of the joint MI, and we suggest this previously unrecognised fact explains in
part why obtaining a consistent PID has proven difficult. The PED also allows
separate quantification of mechanistic redundancy (related to the function of
the system) versus source redundancy (arising from dependencies between
inputs); an important distinction which no existing methods can address. The
new perspective provided by the PED helps to clarify some of the difficulties
encountered with the PID approach and the resulting decompositions provide
useful tools for practical data analysis across a wide range of application
areas.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/110643v1?rss=1">Structural covariance networks in children with autism or ADHD</a></h4>

While autism and ADHD are considered distinct conditions from a diagnostic perspective, they share some phenotypic features and have high comorbidity. Taking a dual-condition approach might help elucidate shared and distinct neural characteristics. Graph theory was used to analyse properties of cortical thickness structural covariance networks across both conditions and relative to a neurotypical (NT; n=87) group using data from the ABIDE (autism; n=62) and ADHD-200 datasets (ADHD; n=69). This was analysed in a theoretical framework examining potential differences in long and short range connectivity. We found convergence between autism and ADHD, where both conditions show an overall decrease in CT covariance with increased Euclidean distance compared to a neurotypical population. The two conditions also show divergence: less modular overlap between the two conditions than there is between each condition and the neurotypical group. Lastly, the ADHD group also showed reduced wiring costs compared to the autism groups. Our results indicate a need for taking an integrated approach when considering highly comorbid conditions such as autism and ADHD. Both groups show a distance-covariance relation that more strongly favours short-range over long-range. Thus, on some network features the groups seem to converge, yet on others there is divergence.

The ratio between AMPA and NMDA receptors is a key factor governing integrative and plastic properties of excitatory glutamatergic synapses. To determine whether the respective proportions of AMPA and NMDA receptors are similar or vary across a neuron's synapse, we analyzed the variability of NMDA and AMPA currents in quantal responses recorded from neurons located in the nucleus tractus solitarii. We found that the average NMDA to AMPA current ratio strongly differed between recorded neurons and that most of the intra-neuronal current ratio variability was attributable to fluctuations in NMDA current. We next performed computer simulations with a Monte Carlo model of a glutamatergic synapse to estimate the part of AMPA and NMDA currents fluctuations induced by stochastic factors. We found that NMDA current variability mainly resulted from strong channel noise with few influence of release variations. On the contrary, partly because of the presence of subconductance states, AMPA receptor channel noise was low and AMPA current fluctuations tightly reflected changes in the amount of glutamate released. We next showed that these two factors, channel noise and fluctuations in glutamate release, were sufficient to explain the observed variability of the NMDA to AMPA current ratio in quantal events recorded from the same neuron. We therefore concluded that the proportion of AMPA and NMDA receptors was similar, or roughly similar, across synapses onto the same target cell.

Executive abilities are supported by the fronto-parietal Multiple Demand (MD) network, yet attempts to link individual behavioral variability to MD activity have yielded contradictory findings. In a large-scale fMRI study (n=140), higher MD responses were strongly associated with better performance on a working memory task and higher IQ. These results pave the way for using individual fMRI measures to link genetic and behavioral variation in health and disease.

The basal ganglia play a major role in directing learned action sequences such as reaching and pressing, particularly in cases where precise timing plays an important role, as shown in experiments on rodents performing delayed lever press tasks. A comprehensive understanding of the relative roles of cortex and basal ganglia in learning and performing such behaviors, however, is still lacking. Inspired by recent experimental results showing that motor cortex is necessary for learning certain types of motor sequences but not for performing them once learned, we develop a model of the striatum, the major input structure of the basal ganglia, in which recurrently connected inhibitory neurons receive cortical input. An anti-Hebbian plasticity rule at the recurrent synapses in the striatum allows our model to learn a sparse, sequential pattern of neural activity similar to the patterns observed in experimental population recordings. After learning, the network can reproduce the same dynamics autonomously without patterned cortical input, and can further speed up or slow down the activity pattern simply by adjusting the level of tonic external input. The general mechanisms used in this model can also be applied to circuits with both excitatory and inhibitory populations, and hence may underlie sequential neural activity patterns that have been observed throughout other brain areas in addition to basal ganglia.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/110015v1?rss=1">Effective connectivity inferred from fMRI transition dynamics during movie viewing points to a balanced reconfiguration of cortical interactions</a></h4>

Our behavior entails a flexible and context-sensitive interplay between brain areas to integrate information according to goal-directed requirements. However, the neural mechanisms governing the entrainment of functionally specialized brain areas remain poorly understood. In particular, the question arises whether observed changes in the activity for different cognitive conditions are explained by modifications of the (intrinsic) inputs or (extrinsic) recurrent connectivity? Here, we show that fMRI transitions over successive time points - a new version of dynamic functional connectivity compared to usual definitions - convey information about the task performed by 19 subjects, namely watching a movie versus a black screen (rest). We use a theoretical framework that extracts this information to characterize the mechanisms underlying cortical coordination at the whole brain level. Our approach relies on our recent network model that was introduced for resting-state fMRI and estimates both the amplitude of input fluctuating activity to each of the 66 cortical regions and the strengths of cortico-cortical interactions between them. In our model, the change of condition does modify the (extrinsic) recurrent connectivity as much as the (intrinsic) inputs, which are putatively related to the movie stimulus. However, detailed changes in connectivity preserve a balance in the propagation of fluctuating activity and select specific pathways that integrate sensory information from the visual and auditory systems to high-level regions of the brain. These findings speak to a dynamic functional integration that underlies the hierarchical processing in the brain.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/109942v1?rss=1">Real-time decoding of bladder pressure from pelvic nerve activity</a></h4>

Real time algorithms for decoding physiological signals from peripheral nerve recordings form an important component of closed loop bioelectronic medicine (electroceutical) systems. As a feasibility demonstration, we considered the problem of decoding bladder pressure from pelvic nerve electroneurograms. We extracted power spectral density of the nerve signal across a band optimised for Shannon Mutual Information, followed by linearization via piece-wise linear regression, and finally decoded signal reconstruction through optimal linear filtering. We demonstrate robust and effective reconstruction of bladder pressure, both prior to and following pharmacological manipulation.

Motivation: The automatic reconstruction of single neuron cells is essential to enable large-scale data-driven investigations in computational neuroscience. However, few previous methods were able to generate satisfactory results automatically from 3D microscopic images without human intervention. Results: We developed a new algorithm for automatic 3D neuron reconstruction. The main idea of the proposed algorithm is to iteratively track backwards from the potential neuronal termini to the soma centre. The traced areas are labelled to avoid duplicated tracing. An online confidence score is computed to decide if a tracing iteration should be stopped and discarded from the final reconstruction. The performance improvements comparing to the previous methods are mainly introduced by a more accurate estimation of the traced area and a novel confidence controlled back-tracking algorithm. The proposed algorithm supports large-scale batch-processing by requiring only a background threshold. We bench-tested the proposed algorithm on the datasets of the BigNeuron project. We show it outperformed several state-of-the-art methods regarding the reconstruction accuracy. It was also able to generate topologically acceptable neuronal models in a majority of cases without human intervention. Availability: The python implementation of this algorithm has been released as a PyPI package (https://github.com/lsqshr/rivuletpy). It is also implemented in Vaa3D as a neuron tracing plugin (https://github.com/Vaa3D).

Chronic extracellular recordings are a powerful tool for systems neuroscience, but spike sorting remains a challenge. A common approach is to fit a generative model, such as a mixture of Gaussians, to the observed spike data. Even if non-parametric methods are used for spike sorting, such generative models provide a quantitative measure of unit isolation quality, which is crucial for subsequent interpretation of the sorted spike trains. We present a spike sorting strategy that models the data as a mixture of drifting t-distributions. This model captures two important features of chronic extracellular recordings--cluster drift over time and heavy tails in the distribution of spikes--and offers improved robustness to outliers. We evaluate this model on several thousand hours of chronic tetrode recordings and show that it fits the empirical data substantially better than a mixture of Gaussians. We also provide a software implementation that can re-fit long datasets (several hours, millions of spikes) in a few seconds, enabling interactive clustering of chronic recordings. Using experimental data, we identify three common failure modes of spike sorting methods that assume stationarity. We also characterize the limitations of several popular unit isolation metrics in the presence of empirically-observed variations in cluster size and scale. We find that the mixture of drifting t-distributions model enables efficient spike sorting of long datasets and provides an accurate measure of unit isolation quality over a wide range of conditions.

In the classic gain/loss framing effect, describing a gamble as a potential gain or loss biases people to make risk-averse or risk-seeking decisions, respectively. The canonical explanation for this effect is that frames differentially modulate emotional processes -- which in turn leads to irrational choice behavior. Here, we evaluate the source of framing biases by integrating functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from 143 human participants performing a gain/loss framing task with meta-analytic data from over 8000 neuroimaging studies. We found that activation during choices consistent with the framing effect were most correlated with activation associated with the resting or default brain, while activation during choices inconsistent with the framing effect most correlated with the task-engaged brain. Our findings argue against the common interpretation of gain/loss framing as a competition between emotion and control. Instead, our study indicates that this effect results from differential cognitive engagement across decision frames.

<p>by Dongjun Chung, Hang J. Kim, Hongyu Zhao</p>

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified tens of thousands of genetic variants associated with hundreds of phenotypes and diseases, which have provided clinical and medical benefits to patients with novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets. However, identification of risk variants associated with complex diseases remains challenging as they are often affected by many genetic variants with small or moderate effects. There has been accumulating evidence suggesting that different complex traits share common risk basis, namely pleiotropy. Recently, several statistical methods have been developed to improve statistical power to identify risk variants for complex traits through a joint analysis of multiple GWAS datasets by leveraging pleiotropy. While these methods were shown to improve statistical power for association mapping compared to separate analyses, they are still limited in the number of phenotypes that can be integrated. In order to address this challenge, in this paper, we propose a novel statistical framework, graph-GPA, to integrate a large number of GWAS datasets for multiple phenotypes using a hidden Markov random field approach. Application of graph-GPA to a joint analysis of GWAS datasets for 12 phenotypes shows that graph-GPA improves statistical power to identify risk variants compared to statistical methods based on smaller number of GWAS datasets. In addition, graph-GPA also promotes better understanding of genetic mechanisms shared among phenotypes, which can potentially be useful for the development of improved diagnosis and therapeutics. The R implementation of graph-GPA is currently available at https://github.com/dongjunchung/GGPA/.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/IZeOfXwIBw0" width="1" />

<p>by Jan Ewald, Martin Bartl, Thomas Dandekar, Christoph Kaleta</p>

A precise and rapid adjustment of fluxes through metabolic pathways is crucial for organisms to prevail in changing environmental conditions. Based on this reasoning, many guiding principles that govern the evolution of metabolic networks and their regulation have been uncovered. To this end, methods from dynamic optimization are ideally suited since they allow to uncover optimality principles behind the regulation of metabolic networks. We used dynamic optimization to investigate the influence of toxic intermediates in connection with the efficiency of enzymes on the regulation of a linear metabolic pathway. Our results predict that transcriptional regulation favors the control of highly efficient enzymes with less toxic upstream intermediates to reduce accumulation of toxic downstream intermediates. We show that the derived optimality principles hold by the analysis of the interplay between intermediate toxicity and pathway regulation in the metabolic pathways of over 5000 sequenced prokaryotes. Moreover, using the lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis in <i>Escherichia coli</i> as an example, we show how knowledge about the relation of regulation, kinetic efficiency and intermediate toxicity can be used to identify drug targets, which control endogenous toxic metabolites and prevent microbial growth. Beyond prokaryotes, we discuss the potential of our findings for the development of antifungal drugs.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/J9iJyxhh9xU" width="1" />

<p>by Vinal Lakhani, Timothy C. Elston</p>

The ability to detect a chemical gradient is fundamental to many cellular processes. In multicellular organisms gradient sensing plays an important role in many physiological processes such as wound healing and development. Unicellular organisms use gradient sensing to move (chemotaxis) or grow (chemotropism) towards a favorable environment. Some cells are capable of detecting extremely shallow gradients, even in the presence of significant molecular-level noise. For example, yeast have been reported to detect pheromone gradients as shallow as 0.1 nM/μm. Noise reduction mechanisms, such as time-averaging and the internalization of pheromone molecules, have been proposed to explain how yeast cells filter fluctuations and detect shallow gradients. Here, we use a Particle-Based Reaction-Diffusion model of ligand-receptor dynamics to test the effectiveness of these mechanisms and to determine the limits of gradient sensing. In particular, we develop novel simulation methods for establishing chemical gradients that not only allow us to study gradient sensing under steady-state conditions, but also take into account transient effects as the gradient forms. Based on reported measurements of reaction rates, our results indicate neither time-averaging nor receptor endocytosis significantly improves the cell’s accuracy in detecting gradients over time scales associated with the initiation of polarized growth. Additionally, our results demonstrate the physical barrier of the cell membrane sharpens chemical gradients across the cell. While our studies are motivated by the mating response of yeast, we believe our results and simulation methods will find applications in many different contexts.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/GCVK4m6DgHs" width="1" />

Foot-and-mouth disease outbreaks in non-endemic countries can lead to large economic costs and livestock losses but the use of vaccination has been contentious, partly due to uncertainty about emergency FMD vaccination. Value of information methods can be applied to disease outbreak problems such as FMD in order to investigate the performance improvement from resolving uncertainties. Here we calculate the expected value of resolving uncertainty about vaccine efficacy, time delay to immunity after vaccination and daily vaccination capacity for a hypothetical FMD outbreak in the UK. If it were possible to resolve all uncertainty prior to the introduction of control, we could expect savings of £55 million in outbreak cost, 221,900 livestock culled and 4.3 days of outbreak duration. All vaccination strategies were found to be preferable to a culling only strategy. However, the optimal vaccination radius was found to be highly dependent upon vaccination capacity for all management objectives. We calculate that by resolving the uncertainty surrounding vaccination capacity we would expect to return over 85% of the above savings, regardless of management objective. It may be possible to resolve uncertainty about daily vaccination capacity before an outbreak, and this would enable decision makers to select the optimal control action via careful contingency planning.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/CAB6na4ZfpU" width="1" />

<p>by John F. Magnotti, Michael S. Beauchamp</p>

Audiovisual speech integration combines information from auditory speech (talker’s voice) and visual speech (talker’s mouth movements) to improve perceptual accuracy. However, if the auditory and visual speech emanate from different talkers, integration decreases accuracy. Therefore, a key step in audiovisual speech perception is deciding whether auditory and visual speech have the same source, a process known as causal inference. A well-known illusion, the McGurk Effect, consists of incongruent audiovisual syllables, such as auditory “ba” + visual “ga” (AbaVga), that are integrated to produce a fused percept (“da”). This illusion raises two fundamental questions: first, given the incongruence between the auditory and visual syllables in the McGurk stimulus, why are they integrated; and second, why does the McGurk effect not occur for other, very similar syllables (<i>e</i>.<i>g</i>., AgaVba). We describe a simplified model of causal inference in multisensory speech perception (CIMS) that predicts the perception of arbitrary combinations of auditory and visual speech. We applied this model to behavioral data collected from 60 subjects perceiving both McGurk and non-McGurk incongruent speech stimuli. The CIMS model successfully predicted both the audiovisual integration observed for McGurk stimuli and the lack of integration observed for non-McGurk stimuli. An identical model without causal inference failed to accurately predict perception for either form of incongruent speech. The CIMS model uses causal inference to provide a computational framework for studying how the brain performs one of its most important tasks, integrating auditory and visual speech cues to allow us to communicate with others.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/drRET3-k1YQ" width="1" />

Saliva is an essential part of activities such as speaking, masticating and swallowing. Enzymes in salivary fluid protect teeth and gums from infectious diseases, and also initiate the digestion process. Intracellular calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) plays a critical role in saliva secretion and regulation. Experimental measurements of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and inositol trisphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>) concentrations in HSY cells, a human salivary duct cell line, show that when the cells are stimulated with adenosine triphosphate (ATP) or carbachol (CCh), they exhibit coupled oscillations with Ca<sup>2+</sup> spike peaks preceding IP<sub>3</sub> spike peaks. Based on these data, we construct a mathematical model of coupled Ca<sup>2+</sup> and IP<sub>3</sub> oscillations in HSY cells and perform model simulations of three different experimental settings to forecast Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses. The model predicts that when Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx from the extracellular space is removed, oscillations gradually slow down until they stop. The model simulation of applying a pulse of IP<sub>3</sub> predicts that photolysis of caged IP<sub>3</sub> causes a transient increase in the frequency of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations. Lastly, when Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent activation of PLC is inhibited, we see an increase in the oscillation frequency and a decrease in the amplitude. These model predictions are confirmed by experimental data. We conclude that, although concentrations of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and IP<sub>3</sub> oscillate, Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations in HSY cells are the result of modulation of the IP<sub>3</sub> receptor by intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and that the period is modulated by the accompanying IP<sub>3</sub> oscillations.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0BYBNxuLnug" width="1" />

<p>by Franca Schmid, Philbert S. Tsai, David Kleinfeld, Patrick Jenny, Bruno Weber</p>

A better knowledge of the flow and pressure distribution in realistic microvascular networks is needed for improving our understanding of neurovascular coupling mechanisms and the related measurement techniques. Here, numerical simulations with discrete tracking of red blood cells (RBCs) are performed in three realistic microvascular networks from the mouse cerebral cortex. Our analysis is based on trajectories of individual RBCs and focuses on layer-specific flow phenomena until a cortical depth of 1 mm. The individual RBC trajectories reveal that in the capillary bed RBCs preferentially move in plane. Hence, the capillary flow field shows laminar patterns and a layer-specific analysis is valid. We demonstrate that for RBCs entering the capillary bed close to the cortical surface (&lt; 400 μm) the largest pressure drop takes place in the capillaries (37%), while for deeper regions arterioles are responsible for 61% of the total pressure drop. Further flow characteristics, such as capillary transit time or RBC velocity, also vary significantly over cortical depth. Comparison of purely topological characteristics with flow-based ones shows that a combined interpretation of topology and flow is indispensable. Our results provide evidence that it is crucial to consider layer-specific differences for all investigations related to the flow and pressure distribution in the cortical vasculature. These findings support the hypothesis that for an efficient oxygen up-regulation at least two regulation mechanisms must be playing hand in hand, namely cerebral blood flow increase and microvascular flow homogenization. However, the contribution of both regulation mechanisms to oxygen up-regulation likely varies over depth.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/IVRfueS8eW0" width="1" />

<p>by Mark P. Little, Jolyon H. Hendry</p>

There is compelling biological data to suggest that cancer arises from a series of mutations in single target cells, resulting in defects in cell renewal and differentiation processes which lead to malignancy. Because much mutagenic damage is expressed following cell division, more-rapidly renewing tissues could be at higher risk because of the larger number of cell replications. Cairns suggested that renewing tissues may reduce cancer risk by partitioning the dividing cell populations into lineages comprising infrequently-dividing long-lived stem cells and frequently-dividing short-lived daughter transit cells. We develop generalizations of three recent cancer-induction models that account for the joint maintenance and renewal of stem and transit cells, also competing processes of partially transformed cell proliferation and differentiation/apoptosis. We are particularly interested in using these models to separately assess the probabilities of mutation and development of cancer associated with “spontaneous” processes and with those linked to a specific environmental mutagen, specifically ionizing radiation or cigarette smoking. All three models demonstrate substantial variation in cancer risks, by at least 20 orders of magnitude, depending on the assumed number of critical mutations required for cancer, and the stem-cell and transition-cell mutation rates. However, in most cases the conditional probabilities of cancer being mutagen-induced range between 7–96%. The relative risks associated with mutagen exposure compared to background rates are also stable, ranging from 1.0–16.0. Very few cancers, generally &lt;0.5%, arise from mutations occurring solely in stem cells rather than in a combination of stem and transit cells. However, for cancers with 2 or 3 critical mutations, a substantial proportion of cancers, in some cases 100%, have at least one mutation derived from a mutated stem cell. Little difference is made to relative risks if competing processes of proliferation and differentiation in the partially transformed stem and transit cell population are allowed for, nor is any difference made if one assumes that transit cells require an extra mutation to confer malignancy from the number required by stem cells. The probability of a cancer being mutagen-induced correlates across cancer sites with the estimated cumulative number of stem cell divisions in the associated tissue (<i>p</i>&lt;0.05), although in some cases there is sensitivity of findings to removal of high-leverage outliers and in some cases only modest variation in probability, but these issues do not affect the validity of the findings. There are no significant correlations (<i>p</i>&gt;0.3) between lifetime cancer-site specific radiation risk and the probability of that cancer being mutagen-induced. These results do not depend on the assumed critical number of mutations leading to cancer, or on the assumed mutagen-associated mutation rate, within the generally-accepted ranges tested. However, there are borderline significant negative correlations (<i>p</i> = 0.08) between the smoking-associated mortality rate difference (current vs former smokers) and the probability of cancer being mutagen-induced. This is only the case where values of the critical number of mutations leading to cancer, <i>k</i>, is 3 or 4 and not for smaller values (1 or 2), but does not strongly depend on the assumed mutagen-associated mutation rate.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/4OwAkAkyDh8" width="1" />

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/content/6/e22177">Generalizable knowledge outweighs incidental details in prefrontal ensemble code over time</a></h4>

<p>Memories for recent experiences are rich in incidental detail, but with time the brain is thought to extract latent rules and structures common across past experiences. We show that over weeks following the acquisition of two distinct associative memories, neuron firing in the rat prelimbic prefrontal cortex (mPFC) became less selective for perceptual features unique to each association and, with an apparently different time-course, became more selective for common relational features. We further found that during exposure to a novel experimental context, memory expression and neuron selectivity for relational features immediately generalized to the new situation. These neural patterns offer a window into the network-level processes by which the mPFC develops a knowledge structure of the world that can be adaptively applied to new experiences.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/content/6/e21540">Speed and segmentation control mechanisms characterized in rhythmically-active circuits created from spinal neurons produced from genetically-tagged embryonic stem cells</a></h4>

<p>Flexible neural networks, such as the interconnected spinal neurons that control distinct motor actions, can switch their activity to produce different behaviors. Both excitatory (E) and inhibitory (I) spinal neurons are necessary for motor behavior, but the influence of recruiting different ratios of E-to-I cells remains unclear. We constructed synthetic microphysical neural networks, called circuitoids, using precise combinations of spinal neuron subtypes derived from mouse stem cells. Circuitoids of purified excitatory interneurons were sufficient to generate oscillatory bursts with properties similar to in vivo central pattern generators. Inhibitory V1 neurons provided dual layers of regulation within excitatory rhythmogenic networks - they increased the rhythmic burst frequency of excitatory V3 neurons, and segmented excitatory motor neuron activity into sub-networks. Accordingly, the speed and pattern of spinal circuits that underlie complex motor behaviors may be regulated by quantitatively gating the intra-network cellular activity ratio of E-to-I neurons.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/content/6/e21036">A conformational switch regulates the ubiquitin ligase HUWE1</a></h4>

<p>The human ubiquitin ligase HUWE1 has key roles in tumorigenesis, yet it is unkown how its activity is regulated. We present the crystal structure of a C-terminal part of HUWE1, including the catalytic domain, and reveal an asymmetric auto-inhibited dimer. We show that HUWE1 dimerizes in solution and self-associates in cells, and that both occurs through the crystallographic dimer interface. We demonstrate that HUWE1 is inhibited in cells and that it can be activated by disruption of the dimer interface. We identify a conserved segment in HUWE1 that counteracts dimer formation by associating with the dimerization region intramolecularly. Our studies reveal, intriguingly, that the tumor suppressor p14ARF binds to this segment and may thus shift the conformational equilibrium of HUWE1 toward the inactive state. We propose a model, in which the activity of HUWE1 underlies conformational control in response to physiological cues—a mechanism that may be exploited for cancer therapy.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/content/6/e20975">Transient inhibition and long-term facilitation of locomotion by phasic optogenetic activation of serotonin neurons</a></h4>

<p>Serotonin (5-HT) is associated with mood and motivation but the function of endogenous 5-HT remains controversial. Here, we studied the impact of phasic optogenetic activation of 5-HT neurons in mice over time scales from seconds to weeks. We found that activating dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) 5-HT neurons induced a strong suppression of spontaneous locomotor behavior in the open field with rapid kinetics (onset ≤1 s). Inhibition of locomotion was independent of measures of anxiety or motor impairment and could be overcome by strong motivational drive. Repetitive place-contingent pairing of activation caused neither place preference nor aversion. However, repeated 15 min daily stimulation caused a persistent increase in spontaneous locomotion to emerge over three weeks. These results show that 5-HT transients have strong and opposing short and long-term effects on motor behavior that appear to arise from effects on the underlying factors that motivate actions.</p>

Protein motions are a key feature to understand biological function. Recently, a large-scale analysis of protein conformational diversity showed a positively skewed distribution with a peak at 0.5 Å C-alpha root-mean-square-deviation (RMSD). To understand this distribution in terms of structure-function relationships, we studied a well curated and large dataset of ~5,000 proteins with experimentally determined conformational diversity. We searched for global behaviour patterns studying how structure-based features change among the available conformer population for each protein. This procedure allowed us to describe the RMSD distribution in terms of three main protein classes sharing given properties. The largest of these protein subsets (~60%), which we call “rigid” (average RMSD = 0.83 Å), has no disordered regions, shows low conformational diversity, the largest tunnels and smaller and buried cavities. The two additional subsets contain disordered regions, but with differential sequence composition and behaviour. Partially disordered proteins have on average 67% of their conformers with disordered regions, average RMSD = 1.1 Å, the highest number of hinges and the longest disordered regions. In contrast, malleable proteins have on average only 25% of disordered conformers and average RMSD = 1.3 Å, flexible cavities affected in size by the presence of disordered regions and show the highest diversity of cognate ligands. Proteins in each set are mostly non-homologous to each other, share no given fold class, nor functional similarity but do share features derived from their conformer population. These shared features could represent conformational mechanisms related with biological functions.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/_HoBMRKlJf4" width="1" />

<p>by James M. Osborne, Alexander G. Fletcher, Joe M. Pitt-Francis, Philip K. Maini, David J. Gavaghan</p>

The coordinated behaviour of populations of cells plays a central role in tissue growth and renewal. Cells react to their microenvironment by modulating processes such as movement, growth and proliferation, and signalling. Alongside experimental studies, computational models offer a useful means by which to investigate these processes. To this end a variety of cell-based modelling approaches have been developed, ranging from lattice-based cellular automata to lattice-free models that treat cells as point-like particles or extended shapes. However, it remains unclear how these approaches compare when applied to the same biological problem, and what differences in behaviour are due to different model assumptions and abstractions. Here, we exploit the availability of an implementation of five popular cell-based modelling approaches within a consistent computational framework, Chaste (http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/chaste). This framework allows one to easily change constitutive assumptions within these models. In each case we provide full details of all technical aspects of our model implementations. We compare model implementations using four case studies, chosen to reflect the key cellular processes of proliferation, adhesion, and short- and long-range signalling. These case studies demonstrate the applicability of each model and provide a guide for model usage.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/aC_4z6Wo2U8" width="1" />

<p>by Dong-Ping Yang, Hai-Jun Zhou, Changsong Zhou</p>

The brain is highly energy consuming, therefore is under strong selective pressure to achieve cost-efficiency in both cortical connectivities and activities. However, cost-efficiency as a design principle for cortical activities has been rarely studied. Especially it is not clear how cost-efficiency is related to ubiquitously observed multi-scale properties: irregular firing, oscillations and neuronal avalanches. Here we demonstrate that these prominent properties can be simultaneously observed in a generic, biologically plausible neural circuit model that captures excitation-inhibition balance and realistic dynamics of synaptic conductance. Their co-emergence achieves minimal energy cost as well as maximal energy efficiency on information capacity, when neuronal firing are coordinated and shaped by moderate synchrony to reduce otherwise redundant spikes, and the dynamical clusterings are maintained in the form of neuronal avalanches. Such cost-efficient neural dynamics can be employed as a foundation for further efficient information processing under energy constraint.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/JKS1_70ZB20" width="1" />

<p>by Didac Santesmasses, Marco Mariotti, Roderic Guigó</p>

Selenocysteine (Sec) is known as the 21st amino acid, a cysteine analogue with selenium replacing sulphur. Sec is inserted co-translationally in a small fraction of proteins called selenoproteins. In selenoprotein genes, the Sec specific tRNA (tRNA<sup>Sec</sup>) drives the recoding of highly specific UGA codons from stop signals to Sec. Although found in organisms from the three domains of life, Sec is not universal. Many species are completely devoid of selenoprotein genes and lack the ability to synthesize Sec. Since tRNA<sup>Sec</sup> is a key component in selenoprotein biosynthesis, its efficient identification in genomes is instrumental to characterize the utilization of Sec across lineages. Available tRNA prediction methods fail to accurately predict tRNA<sup>Sec</sup>, due to its unusual structural fold. Here, we present Secmarker, a method based on manually curated covariance models capturing the specific tRNA<sup>Sec</sup> structure in archaea, bacteria and eukaryotes. We exploited the non-universality of Sec to build a proper benchmark set for tRNA<sup>Sec</sup> predictions, which is not possible for the predictions of other tRNAs. We show that Secmarker greatly improves the accuracy of previously existing methods constituting a valuable tool to identify tRNA<sup>Sec</sup> genes, and to efficiently determine whether a genome contains selenoproteins. We used Secmarker to analyze a large set of fully sequenced genomes, and the results revealed new insights in the biology of tRNA<sup>Sec</sup>, led to the discovery of a novel bacterial selenoprotein family, and shed additional light on the phylogenetic distribution of selenoprotein containing genomes. Secmarker is freely accessible for download, or online analysis through a web server at http://secmarker.crg.cat.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/rGii86KmsZg" width="1" />

<p>by Franziska Oschmann, Konstantin Mergenthaler, Evelyn Jungnickel, Klaus Obermayer</p>

Astrocytes integrate and process synaptic information and exhibit calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) signals in response to incoming information from neighboring synapses. The generation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals is mostly attributed to Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from internal Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores evoked by an elevated metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) activity. Different experimental results associated the generation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals to the activity of the glutamate transporter (GluT). The GluT itself does not influence the intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration, but it indirectly activates Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry over the membrane. A closer look into Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in different astrocytic compartments revealed a spatial separation of those two pathways. Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in the soma are mainly generated by Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from internal Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores (mGluR-dependent pathway). In astrocytic compartments close to the synapse most Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals are evoked by Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry over the plasma membrane (GluT-dependent pathway). This assumption is supported by the finding, that the volume ratio between the internal Ca<sup>2+</sup> store and the intracellular space decreases from the soma towards the synapse. We extended a model for mGluR-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in astrocytes with the GluT-dependent pathway. Additionally, we included the volume ratio between the internal Ca<sup>2+</sup> store and the intracellular compartment into the model in order to analyze Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals either in the soma or close to the synapse. Our model results confirm the spatial separation of the mGluR- and GluT-dependent pathways along the astrocytic process. The model allows to study the binary Ca<sup>2+</sup> response during a block of either of both pathways. Moreover, the model contributes to a better understanding of the impact of channel densities on the interaction of both pathways and on the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/CHZDUz5wGrg" width="1" />

Overall cellular responses to biologically-relevant stimuli are mediated by networks of simpler lower-level processes. Although information about some of these processes can now be obtained by visualizing and recording events at the molecular level, this is still possible only in especially favorable cases. Therefore the development of methods to extract the dynamics and relationships between the different lower-level (microscopic) processes from the overall (macroscopic) response remains a crucial challenge in the understanding of many aspects of physiology. Here we have devised a hybrid computational-analytical method to accomplish this task, the SYStems-based MOLecular kinetic scheme Extractor (SYSMOLE). SYSMOLE utilizes system-identification input-output analysis to obtain a transfer function between the stimulus and the overall cellular response in the Laplace-transformed domain. It then derives a Markov-chain state molecular kinetic scheme uniquely associated with the transfer function by means of a classification procedure and an analytical step that imposes general biological constraints. We first tested SYSMOLE with synthetic data and evaluated its performance in terms of its rate of convergence to the correct molecular kinetic scheme and its robustness to noise. We then examined its performance on real experimental traces by analyzing macroscopic calcium-current traces elicited by membrane depolarization. SYSMOLE derived the correct, previously known molecular kinetic scheme describing the activation and inactivation of the underlying calcium channels and correctly identified the accepted mechanism of action of nifedipine, a calcium-channel blocker clinically used in patients with cardiovascular disease. Finally, we applied SYSMOLE to study the pharmacology of a new class of glutamate antipsychotic drugs and their crosstalk mechanism through a heteromeric complex of G protein-coupled receptors. Our results indicate that our methodology can be successfully applied to accurately derive molecular kinetic schemes from experimental macroscopic traces, and we anticipate that it may be useful in the study of a wide variety of biological systems.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/pH320dHrfwU" width="1" />

<p>NODAL/Activin signaling orchestrates key processes during embryonic development via SMAD2. How SMAD2 activates programs of gene expression that are modulated over time however, is not known. Here we delineate the sequence of events that occur from SMAD2 binding to transcriptional activation, and the mechanisms underlying them. NODAL/Activin signaling induces dramatic chromatin landscape changes, and a dynamic transcriptional network regulated by SMAD2, acting via multiple mechanisms. Crucially we have discovered two modes of SMAD2 binding. SMAD2 can bind pre-acetylated nucleosome-depleted sites. However, it also binds to unacetylated, closed chromatin, independently of pioneer factors, where it induces nucleosome displacement and histone acetylation. For a subset of genes, this requires SMARCA4. We find that long term modulation of the transcriptional responses requires continued NODAL/Activin signaling. Thus SMAD2 binding does not linearly equate with transcriptional kinetics, and our data suggest that SMAD2 recruits multiple co-factors during sustained signaling to shape the downstream transcriptional program.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/content/6/e20183">Aberrant corticosteroid metabolism in tumor cells enables GR takeover in enzalutamide resistant prostate cancer</a></h4>

<p>Prostate cancer is driven by androgen stimulation of the androgen receptor (AR). The next-generation AR antagonist, enzalutamide, prolongs survival, but resistance and lethal disease eventually prevail. Emerging data suggest that the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is upregulated in this context, stimulating expression of AR-target genes that permit continued growth despite AR blockade. However, countering this mechanism by administration of GR antagonists is problematic because GR is essential for life. We show that enzalutamide treatment in human models of prostate cancer and patient tissues is accompanied by a ubiquitin E3-ligase, AMFR, mediating loss of 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-2 (11β-HSD2), which otherwise inactivates cortisol, sustaining tumor cortisol concentrations to stimulate GR and enzalutamide resistance. Remarkably, reinstatement of 11β-HSD2 expression, or AMFR loss, reverses enzalutamide resistance in mouse xenograft tumors. Together, these findings reveal a surprising metabolic mechanism of enzalutamide resistance that may be targeted with a strategy that circumvents a requirement for systemic GR ablation.</p>

<p>by Pierre Millard, Kieran Smallbone, Pedro Mendes</p>

The metabolism of microorganisms is regulated through two main mechanisms: changes of enzyme capacities as a consequence of gene expression modulation (“hierarchical control”) and changes of enzyme activities through metabolite-enzyme interactions. An increasing body of evidence indicates that hierarchical control is insufficient to explain metabolic behaviors, but the system-wide impact of metabolic regulation remains largely uncharacterized. To clarify its role, we developed and validated a detailed kinetic model of <i>Escherichia coli</i> central metabolism that links growth to environment. Metabolic control analyses confirm that the control is widely distributed across the network and highlight strong interconnections between all the pathways. Exploration of the model solution space reveals that several robust properties emerge from metabolic regulation, from the molecular level (<i>e</i>.<i>g</i>. homeostasis of total metabolite pool) to the overall cellular physiology (<i>e</i>.<i>g</i>. coordination of carbon uptake, catabolism, energy and redox production, and growth), while allowing a large degree of flexibility at most individual metabolic steps. These properties have important physiological implications for <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> and significantly expand the self-regulating capacities of its metabolism.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/pRZDDITnOus" width="1" />

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/content/6/e18492">Spontaneous activation of visual pigments in relation to openness/closedness of chromophore-binding pocket</a></h4>

<p>Visual pigments can be spontaneously activated by internal thermal energy, generating noise that interferes with real-light detection. Recently, we developed a physicochemical theory that successfully predicts the rate of spontaneous activity of representative rod and cone pigments from their peak-absorption wavelength (λ<sub>max</sub>), with pigments having longer λ<sub>max</sub> being noisier. Interestingly, cone pigments may generally be ~25 fold noisier than rod pigments of the same λ<sub>max</sub>, possibly ascribed to an ‘open’ chromophore-binding pocket in cone pigments defined by the capability of chromophore-exchange in darkness. Here, we show in mice that the λ<sub>max</sub>-dependence of pigment noise could be extended even to a mutant pigment, E122Q-rhodopsin. Moreover, although E122Q-rhodopsin shows some cone-pigment-like characteristics, its noise remained quantitatively predictable by the ‘non-open’ nature of its chromophore-binding pocket as in wild-type rhodopsin. The openness/closedness of the chromophore-binding pocket is potentially a useful indicator of whether a pigment is intended for detecting dim or bright light.</p>

<p>Chronic use of opioid analgesics can cause analgesic tolerance and opioid-induced hyperalgesia (OIH), contributing to dose escalation in patients. Corder et al. here provide evidence that, in mice, these unwanted effects, and the underlying altered circuit plasticity, are mediated by μ opioid receptors (MORs) </p>

Neurons affected in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) experience mitochondrial dysfunction and a bioenergetic deficit that occurs early and promotes the disease-defining amyloid beta peptide (Aβ) and Tau pathologies. Emerging findings suggest that the autophagy/lysosome pathway that removes damaged mitochondria (mitophagy) is also compromised in AD, resulting in the accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria. Results in animal and cellular models of AD and in patients with sporadic late-onset AD suggest that impaired mitophagy contributes to synaptic dysfunction and cognitive deficits by triggering Aβ and Tau accumulation through increases in oxidative damage and cellular energy deficits; these, in turn, impair mitophagy.

<p>Transcription start-site (TSS) selection and alternative promoter (AP) usage contribute to gene expression complexity but little is known about their impact on translation. Here we performed TSS mapping of the translatome following energy stress. Assessing the contribution of cap-proximal TSS nucleotides, we found dramatic effect on translation only upon stress. As eIF4E levels were reduced, we determined its binding to capped-RNAs with different initiating nucleotides and found the lowest affinity to 5'cytidine in correlation with the translational stress-response. In addition, the number of differentially translated APs was elevated following stress. These include novel glucose starvation-induced downstream transcripts for the translation regulators eIF4A and Pabp, which are also translationally-induced despite general translational inhibition. The resultant eIF4A protein is N-terminally truncated and acts as eIF4A inhibitor. The induced Pabp isoform has shorter 5'UTR removing an auto-inhibitory element. Our findings uncovered several levels of coordination of transcription and translation responses to energy stress.</p>

<p>Voltage- and calcium-dependent BK channels regulate calcium-dependent cellular events such as neurotransmitter release by limiting calcium influx. Their plasma membrane abundance is an important factor in determining BK current and thus regulation of calcium-dependent events. In <em>C. elegans</em>, we show that ERG-28, an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane protein, promotes the trafficking of SLO-1 BK channels from the ER to the plasma membrane by shielding them from premature degradation. In the absence of ERG-28, SLO-1 channels undergo aspartic protease DDI-1-dependent degradation, resulting in markedly reduced expression at presynaptic terminals. Loss of <em>erg-28</em> suppressed phenotypic defects of <em>slo-1</em> gain-of-function mutants in locomotion, neurotransmitter release, and calcium-mediated asymmetric differentiation of the AWC olfactory neuron pair, and conferred significant ethanol-resistant locomotory behavior, resembling <em>slo-1</em> loss-of-function mutants, albeit to a lesser extent. Our study thus indicates that the control of BK channel trafficking is a critical regulatory mechanism for synaptic transmission and neural function.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/content/6/e24040">Genetic control of encoding strategy in a food-sensing neural circuit</a></h4>

<p>Neuroendocrine circuits encode environmental information via changes in gene expression and other biochemical activities to regulate physiological responses. Previously, we showed that <em>daf-7</em> TGF<span class="inline-formula"><span class="mathjax mml-math"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi>β</mi></math></span></span> and <em>tph-1</em> tryptophan hydroxylase expression in specific neurons encode food abundance to modulate lifespan in <em>Caenorhabditis elegans</em>, and uncovered cross- and self-regulation among these genes (<a class="xref-bibr" href="https://elifesciences.org/#bib11">Entchev et al., 2015</a>). Here, we now extend these findings by showing that these interactions between <em>daf-7</em> and <em>tph-1</em> regulate redundancy and synergy among neurons in food encoding through coordinated control of circuit-level signal and noise properties. Our analysis further shows that <em>daf-7</em> and <em>tph-1</em> contribute to most of the food-responsiveness in the modulation of lifespan. We applied a computational model to capture the general coding features of this system. This model agrees with our previous genetic analysis and highlights the consequences of redundancy and synergy during information transmission, suggesting a rationale for the regulation of these information processing features.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/content/6/e22089">The golden mimicry complex uses a wide spectrum of defence to deter a community of predators</a></h4>

<p>Mimicry complexes typically consist of multiple species that deter predators using similar anti-predatory signals. Mimics in these complexes are assumed to vary in their level of defence from highly defended through to moderately defended, or not defended at all. Here, we report a new multi-order mimicry complex that includes at least 140 different putative mimics from four arthropod orders including ants, wasps, bugs, tree hoppers and spiders. All members of this mimicry complex are characterised by a conspicuous golden body and an ant <em>Gestalt</em>, but vary substantially in their defensive traits. However, they were similarly effective at deterring predators - even mildly defended mimics were rarely eaten by a community of invertebrate and vertebrate predators both in the wild and during staged trials. We propose that despite the predominance of less defended mimics the three predatory guilds avoid the mimics because of the additive influence of the various defensive traits.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/content/6/e21543">Functional double dissociation within the entorhinal cortex for visual scene-dependent choice behavior</a></h4>

<p>How visual scene memory is processed differentially by the upstream structures of the hippocampus is largely unknown. We sought to dissociate functionally the lateral and medial subdivisions of the entorhinal cortex (LEC and MEC, respectively) in visual scene-dependent tasks by temporarily inactivating the LEC and MEC in the same rat. When the rat made spatial choices in a T-maze using visual scenes displayed on LCD screens, the inactivation of the MEC but not the LEC produced severe deficits in performance. However, when the task required the animal to push a jar or to dig in the sand in the jar using the same scene stimuli, the LEC but not the MEC became important. Our findings suggest that the entorhinal cortex is critical for scene-dependent mnemonic behavior, and the response modality may interact with a sensory modality to determine the involvement of the LEC and MEC in scene-based memory tasks.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/content/6/e20156">Generation of shape complexity through tissue conflict resolution</a></h4>

<p>Out-of-plane tissue deformations are key morphogenetic events during plant and animal development that generate 3D shapes, such as flowers or limbs. However, the mechanisms by which spatiotemporal patterns of gene expression modify cellular behaviours to generate such deformations remain to be established. We use the Snapdragon flower as a model system to address this problem. Combining cellular analysis with tissue-level modelling, we show that an orthogonal pattern of growth orientations plays a key role in generating out-of-plane deformations. This growth pattern is most likely oriented by a polarity field, highlighted by PIN1 protein localisation, and is modulated by dorsoventral gene activity. The orthogonal growth pattern interacts with other patterns of differential growth to create tissue conflicts that shape the flower. Similar shape changes can be generated by contraction as well as growth, suggesting tissue conflict resolution provides a flexible morphogenetic mechanism for generating shape diversity in plants and animals.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/content/6/e19599">A long-term epigenetic memory switch controls bacterial virulence bimodality</a></h4>

<p>When pathogens enter the host, sensing of environmental cues activates the expression of virulence genes. Opposite transition of pathogens from activating to non-activating conditions is poorly understood. Interestingly, variability in the expression of virulence genes upon infection enhances colonization. In order to systematically detect the role of phenotypic variability in enteropathogenic <em>E. coli</em> (EPEC), an important human pathogen, both in virulence activating and non-activating conditions, we employed the ScanLag methodology. The analysis revealed a bimodal growth rate. Mathematical modeling combined with experimental analysis showed that this bimodality is mediated by a hysteretic memory-switch that results in the stable co-existence of non-virulent and hyper-virulent subpopulations, even after many generations of growth in non-activating conditions. We identified the <em>per</em> operon as the key component of the hysteretic switch. This unique hysteretic memory switch may result in persistent infection and enhanced host-to-host spreading.</p>

NMDA receptors (NMDARs) are ion channels activated by the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate and are essential to all aspects of brain function, including learning and memory formation. Missense mutations distributed throughout NMDAR subunits have been associated with an array of neurological disorders. Recent structural, functional, and computational studies have generated many insights into the activation process connecting glutamate binding to ion-channel opening, which is central to NMDAR physiology and pathophysiology.

<p>The majority of mitochondrial proteins use N-terminal presequences for targeting to mitochondria and are translocated by the presequence translocase. During translocation, proteins, threaded through the channel in the inner membrane, are handed over to the import motor at the matrix face. Tim17 is an essential, membrane-embedded subunit of the translocase; however, its function is only poorly understood. Here, we functionally dissected its four predicted transmembrane (TM) segments. Mutations in TM1 and TM2 impaired the interaction of Tim17 with Tim23, component of the translocation channel, whereas mutations in TM3 compromised binding of the import motor. We identified residues in the matrix-facing region of Tim17 involved in binding of the import motor. Our results reveal functionally distinct roles of different regions of Tim17 and suggest how they may be involved in handing over the proteins, during their translocation into mitochondria, from the channel to the import motor of the presequence translocase.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/content/6/e21137">Elucidation of a four-site allosteric network in fibroblast growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases</a></h4>

<p>Receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling is tightly regulated by protein allostery within the intracellular tyrosine kinase domains. Yet the molecular determinants of allosteric connectivity in tyrosine kinase domain are incompletely understood. By means of structural (X-ray and NMR) and functional characterization of pathogenic gain-of-function mutations affecting the FGF receptor (FGFR) tyrosine kinase domain, we elucidated a long-distance allosteric network composed of four interconnected sites termed the ‘molecular brake’, ‘DFG latch’, ‘A-loop plug’, and ‘αC tether’. The first three sites repress the kinase from adopting an active conformation, whereas the αC tether promotes the active conformation. The skewed design of this four-site allosteric network imposes tight autoinhibition and accounts for the incomplete mimicry of the activated conformation by pathogenic mutations targeting a single site. Based on the structural similarity shared among RTKs, we propose that this allosteric model for FGFR kinases is applicable to other RTKs.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/content/6/e19944">Disordered clusters of Bak dimers rupture mitochondria during apoptosis</a></h4>

<p>During apoptosis, Bak and Bax undergo major conformational change and form symmetric dimers that coalesce to perforate the mitochondrial outer membrane via an unknown mechanism. We have employed cysteine labelling and linkage analysis to the full length of Bak in mitochondria. This comprehensive survey showed that in each Bak dimer the N-termini are fully solvent-exposed and mobile, the core is highly structured, and the C-termini are flexible but restrained by their contact with the membrane. Dimer-dimer interactions were more labile than the BH3:groove interaction within dimers, suggesting there is no extensive protein interface between dimers. In addition, linkage in the mobile Bak N-terminus (V61C) specifically quantified association between dimers, allowing mathematical simulations of dimer arrangement. Together, our data show that Bak dimers form disordered clusters to generate lipidic pores. These findings provide a molecular explanation for the observed structural heterogeneity of the apoptotic pore.</p>

<p>Defining the organizational principles of neuronal networks at the cellular scale, or micro-connectomics, is a key challenge of modern neuroscience. In this Review, we focus on graph theoretical parameters of micro-connectome topology, often informed by economical principles that conceptually originated with Ramón y Cajal's conservation </p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/content/6/e22784">Epigenetic regulation of lateralized fetal spinal gene expression underlies hemispheric asymmetries</a></h4>

<p>Lateralization is a fundamental principle of nervous system organization but its molecular determinants are mostly unknown. In humans, asymmetric gene expression in the fetal cortex has been suggested as the molecular basis of handedness. However, human fetuses already show considerable asymmetries in arm movements before the motor cortex is functionally linked to the spinal cord, making it more likely that spinal gene expression asymmetries form the molecular basis of handedness. We analyzed genome-wide mRNA expression and DNA methylation in cervical and anterior thoracal spinal cord segments of five human fetuses and show development-dependent gene expression asymmetries. These gene expression asymmetries were epigenetically regulated by miRNA expression asymmetries in the TGF-β signaling pathway and lateralized methylation of CpG islands. Our findings suggest that molecular mechanisms for epigenetic regulation within the spinal cord constitute the starting point for handedness, implying a fundamental shift in our understanding of the ontogenesis of hemispheric asymmetries in humans.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/content/6/e18970">KEAP1 loss modulates sensitivity to kinase targeted therapy in lung cancer</a></h4>

<p>Inhibitors that target the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)/Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway have led to clinical responses in lung and other cancers, but some patients fail to respond and in those that do resistance inevitably occurs (<a class="xref-bibr" href="https://elifesciences.org/#bib2">Balak et al., 2006</a>; <a class="xref-bibr" href="https://elifesciences.org/#bib30">Kosaka et al., 2006</a>; <a class="xref-bibr" href="https://elifesciences.org/#bib37">Rudin et al., 2013</a>; <a class="xref-bibr" href="https://elifesciences.org/#bib45">Wagle et al., 2011</a>). To understand intrinsic and acquired resistance to inhibition of MAPK signaling, we performed CRISPR-Cas9 gene deletion screens in the setting of BRAF, MEK, EGFR, and ALK inhibition. Loss of <em>KEAP1</em>, a negative regulator of NFE2L2/NRF2, modulated the response to BRAF, MEK, EGFR, and ALK inhibition in BRAF-, NRAS-, KRAS-, EGFR-, and ALK-mutant lung cancer cells. Treatment with inhibitors targeting the RTK/MAPK pathway increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cells with intact KEAP1, and loss of KEAP1 abrogated this increase. In addition, loss of KEAP1 altered cell metabolism to allow cells to proliferate in the absence of MAPK signaling. These observations suggest that alterations in the KEAP1/NRF2 pathway may promote survival in the presence of multiple inhibitors targeting the RTK/Ras/MAPK pathway.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/content/6/e21481">Distinct mechanisms mediate speed-accuracy adjustments in cortico-subthalamic networks</a></h4>

<p>Optimal decision-making requires balancing fast but error-prone and more accurate but slower decisions through adjustments of decision thresholds. Here, we demonstrate two distinct correlates of such speed-accuracy adjustments by recording subthalamic nucleus (STN) activity and electroencephalography in 11 Parkinson’s disease patients during a perceptual decision-making task; STN low-frequency oscillatory (LFO) activity (2–8 Hz), coupled to activity at prefrontal electrode Fz, and STN beta activity (13–30 Hz) coupled to electrodes C3/C4 close to motor cortex. These two correlates differed not only in their cortical topography and spectral characteristics but also in the relative timing of recruitment and in their precise relationship with decision thresholds. Increases of STN LFO power preceding the response predicted increased thresholds only after accuracy instructions, while cue-induced reductions of STN beta power decreased thresholds irrespective of instructions. These findings indicate that distinct neural mechanisms determine whether a decision will be made in haste or with caution.</p>

<p>The visual responses of vertebrates are sensitive to the overall composition of retinal interneurons including amacrine cells, which tune the activity of the retinal circuitry. The expression of <em>Paired-homeobox 6 (PAX6)</em> is regulated by multiple cis-DNA elements including the intronic α-enhancer, which is active in GABAergic amacrine cell subsets. Here, we report that the transforming growth factor ß1-induced transcript 1 protein (Tgfb1i1) interacts with the LIM domain transcription factors Lhx3 and Isl1 to inhibit the α-enhancer in the post-natal mouse retina. <em>Tgfb1i1<sup>-/-</sup></em> mice show elevated α-enhancer activity leading to overproduction of Pax6ΔPD isoform that supports the GABAergic amacrine cell fate maintenance. Consequently, the <em>Tgfb1i1<sup>-/-</sup></em> mouse retinas show a sustained light response, which becomes more transient in mice with the auto-stimulation-defective <em>Pax6<sup>ΔPBS/ΔPBS</sup></em> mutation. Together, we show the antagonistic regulation of the α-enhancer activity by Pax6 and the LIM protein complex is necessary for the establishment of an inner retinal circuitry, which controls visual adaptation.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/content/6/e21221">Pharmacological targeting of the transcription factor SOX18 delays breast cancer in mice</a></h4>

<p>Pharmacological targeting of transcription factors holds great promise for the development of new therapeutics, but strategies based on blockade of DNA binding, nuclear shuttling, or individual protein partner recruitment have yielded limited success to date. Transcription factors typically engage in complex interaction networks, likely masking the effects of specifically inhibiting single protein-protein interactions. Here, we used a combination of genomic, proteomic and biophysical methods to discover a suite of protein-protein interactions involving the SOX18 transcription factor, a known regulator of vascular development and disease. We describe a small-molecule that is able to disrupt a discrete subset of SOX18-dependent interactions. This compound selectively suppressed SOX18 transcriptional outputs in vitro and interfered with vascular development in zebrafish larvae. In a mouse pre-clinical model of breast cancer, treatment with this inhibitor significantly improved survival by reducing tumour vascular density and metastatic spread. Our studies validate an interactome-based molecular strategy to interfere with transcription factor activity, for the development of novel disease therapeutics.</p>

<p>Desmoplasia, a fibrotic mass including cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and self-sustaining extracellular matrix (D-ECM), is a puzzling feature of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDACs). Conflicting studies have identified tumor-restricting and tumor-promoting roles of PDAC-associated desmoplasia, suggesting that individual CAF/D-ECM protein constituents have distinguishable tumorigenic and tumor-repressive functions. Using 3D culture of normal pancreatic versus PDAC-associated human fibroblasts, we identified a CAF/D-ECM phenotype that correlates with improved patient outcomes, and that includes CAFs enriched in plasma membrane-localized, active α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub>-integrin. Mechanistically, we established that TGFβ is required for D-ECM production but dispensable for D-ECM-induced naïve fibroblast-to-CAF activation, which depends on α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>5</sub>-integrin redistribution of pFAK-independent active α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub>-integrin to assorted endosomes. Importantly, the development of a simultaneous multi-channel immunofluorescence approach and new algorithms for computational batch-analysis and their application to a human PDAC panel, indicated that stromal localization and levels of active SMAD2/3 and α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub>-integrin distinguish patient-protective from patient-detrimental desmoplasia and foretell tumor recurrences, suggesting a useful new prognostic tool.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/content/6/e19505">Habitat and social factors shape individual decisions and emergent group structure during baboon collective movement</a></h4>

<p>For group-living animals traveling through heterogeneous landscapes, collective movement can be influenced by both habitat structure and social interactions. Yet research in collective behavior has largely neglected habitat influences on movement. Here we integrate simultaneous, high-resolution, tracking of wild baboons within a troop with a 3-dimensional reconstruction of their habitat to identify key drivers of baboon movement. A previously unexplored social influence – baboons’ preference for locations that other troop members have recently traversed – is the most important predictor of individual movement decisions. Habitat is shown to influence movement over multiple spatial scales, from long-range attraction and repulsion from the troop’s sleeping site, to relatively local influences including road-following and a short-range avoidance of dense vegetation. Scaling to the collective level reveals a clear association between habitat features and the emergent structure of the group, highlighting the importance of habitat heterogeneity in shaping group coordination.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/content/6/e18904">Oxytocin improves behavioral and electrophysiological deficits in a novel Shank3-deficient rat</a></h4>

<p>Mutations in the synaptic gene <em>SHANK3</em> lead to a neurodevelopmental disorder known as Phelan-McDermid syndrome (PMS). PMS is a relatively common monogenic and highly penetrant cause of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and intellectual disability (ID), and frequently presents with attention deficits. The underlying neurobiology of PMS is not fully known and pharmacological treatments for core symptoms do not exist. Here, we report the production and characterization of a <em>Shank3</em>-deficient rat model of PMS, with a genetic alteration similar to a human SHANK3 mutation. We show that <em>Shank3</em>-deficient rats exhibit impaired long-term social recognition memory and attention, and reduced synaptic plasticity in the hippocampal-medial prefrontal cortex pathway. These deficits were attenuated with oxytocin treatment. The effect of oxytocin on reversing non-social attention deficits is a particularly novel finding, and the results implicate an oxytocinergic contribution in this genetically defined subtype of ASD and ID, suggesting an individualized therapeutic approach for PMS.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/content/6/e21392">The paranodal cytoskeleton clusters Na+ channels at nodes of Ranvier</a></h4>

<p>A high density of Na<sup>+</sup> channels at nodes of Ranvier is necessary for rapid and efficient action potential propagation in myelinated axons. Na+ channel clustering is thought to depend on two axonal cell adhesion molecules that mediate interactions between the axon and myelinating glia at the nodal gap (i.e., NF186) and the paranodal junction (i.e., Caspr). Here we show that while Na<sup>+</sup> channels cluster at nodes in the absence of NF186, they fail to do so in double conditional knockout mice lacking both NF186 and the paranodal cell adhesion molecule Caspr, demonstrating that a paranodal junction-dependent mechanism can cluster Na<sup>+</sup> channels at nodes. Furthermore, we show that paranode-dependent clustering of nodal Na<sup>+</sup> channels requires axonal βII spectrin which is concentrated at paranodes. Our results reveal that the paranodal junction-dependent mechanism of Na<sup>+</sup>channel clustering is mediated by the spectrin-based paranodal axonal cytoskeleton.</p>

<p>The joints of mammals are lined with cartilage, comprised of individual chondrocytes embedded in a specialized extracellular matrix. Chondrocytes experience a complex mechanical environment and respond to changing mechanical loads in order to maintain cartilage homeostasis. It has been proposed that mechanically gated ion channels are of functional importance in chondrocyte mechanotransduction; however, direct evidence of mechanical current activation in these cells has been lacking. We have used high-speed pressure clamp and elastomeric pillar arrays to apply distinct mechanical stimuli to primary murine chondrocytes, stretch of the membrane and deflection of cell-substrate contacts points, respectively. Both TRPV4 and PIEZO1 channels contribute to currents activated by stimuli applied at cell-substrate contacts but only PIEZO1 mediates stretch-activated currents. These data demonstrate that there are separate, but overlapping, mechanoelectrical transduction pathways in chondrocytes.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/content/6/e19886">Adult-born neurons modify excitatory synaptic transmission to existing neurons</a></h4>

<p>Adult-born neurons are continually produced in the dentate gyrus but it is unclear whether synaptic integration of new neurons affects the pre-existing circuit. Here we investigated how manipulating neurogenesis in adult mice alters excitatory synaptic transmission to mature dentate neurons. Enhancing neurogenesis by conditional deletion of the pro-apoptotic gene <em>Bax</em> in stem cells reduced excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) and spine density in mature neurons, whereas genetic ablation of neurogenesis increased EPSCs in mature neurons. Unexpectedly, we found that <em>Bax</em> deletion in developing and mature dentate neurons increased EPSCs and prevented neurogenesis-induced synaptic suppression. Together these results show that neurogenesis modifies synaptic transmission to mature neurons in a manner consistent with a redistribution of pre-existing synapses to newly integrating neurons and that a non-apoptotic function of the Bax signaling pathway contributes to ongoing synaptic refinement within the dentate circuit.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/content/6/e19720">Pathogenic PS1 phosphorylation at Ser367</a></h4>

<p>The high levels of serine (S) and threonine (T) residues within the Presenilin 1 (PS1) N-terminus and in the large hydrophilic loop region suggest that the enzymatic function of PS1/γ-secretase can be modulated by its ‘phosphorylated’ and ‘dephosphorylated’ states. However, the functional outcome of PS1 phosphorylation and its significance for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathogenesis is poorly understood. Here, comprehensive analysis using FRET-based imaging reveals that activity-driven and Protein Kinase A-mediated PS1 phosphorylation at three domains (domain 1: T74, domain 2: S310 and S313, domain 3: S365, S366, and S367), with S367 being critical, is responsible for the PS1 pathogenic ‘closed’ conformation, and resulting increase in the Aβ42/40 ratio. Moreover, we have established novel imaging assays for monitoring PS1 conformation in vivo, and report that PS1 phosphorylation induces the pathogenic conformational shift in the living mouse brain. These phosphorylation sites represent potential new targets for AD treatment.</p>

<p>A large number of drugs can induce prolongation of cardiac repolarization and life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias. The prediction of this side effect is however challenging as it usually develops in some genetically predisposed individuals with normal cardiac repolarization at baseline. Here, we describe a platform based on a genetically diverse panel of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) that reproduces susceptibility to develop a cardiotoxic drug response. We generated iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes from patients presenting in vivo with extremely low or high changes in cardiac repolarization in response to a pharmacological challenge with sotalol. In vitro, the responses to sotalol were highly variable but strongly correlated to the inter-individual differences observed in vivo. Transcriptomic profiling identified dysregulation of genes (<em>DLG2, KCNE4, PTRF, HTR2C</em>, <em>CAMKV</em>) involved in downstream regulation of cardiac repolarization machinery as underlying high sensitivity to sotalol. Our findings offer novel insights for the development of iPSC-based screening assays for testing individual drug reactions.</p>

<p>Contributions of glial cells to neuroenergetics have been the focus of extensive debate. Here we provide positron emission tomography evidence that activation of astrocytic glutamate transport via the excitatory amino acid transporter GLT-1 triggers widespread but graded glucose uptake in the rodent brain. Our results highlight the need for a reevaluation of the interpretation of [18F]FDG positron emission tomography data, whereby astrocytes would be recognized as contributing to the [18F]FDG signal.</p>

<p>The hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis is a pivotal component of an organism's response to stressful challenges, and dysfunction of this neuroendocrine axis is associated with a variety of physiological and psychological pathologies. We found that corticotropin-releasing factor type 1 receptor within the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus is an important central component of hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis regulation that prepares the organism for successive exposure to stressful stimuli.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/content/6/e21589">Stimulus relevance modulates contrast adaptation in visual cortex</a></h4>

<p>A general principle of sensory processing is that neurons adapt to sustained stimuli by reducing their response over time. Most of our knowledge on adaptation in single cells is based on experiments in anesthetized animals. How responses adapt in awake animals, when stimuli may be behaviorally relevant or not, remains unclear. Here we show that contrast adaptation in mouse primary visual cortex depends on the behavioral relevance of the stimulus. Cells that adapted to contrast under anesthesia maintained or even increased their activity in awake naïve mice. When engaged in a visually guided task, contrast adaptation re-occurred for stimuli that were irrelevant for solving the task. However, contrast adaptation was reversed when stimuli acquired behavioral relevance. Regulation of cortical adaptation by task demand may allow dynamic control of sensory-evoked signal flow in the neocortex.</p>
