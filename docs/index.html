                <p>Microscopic observation of single molecules is a rapidly expanding field in chemistry and differs from conventional characterization techniques that require a large number of molecules. One of such form of single-molecule microscopy is high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM), which is especially suitable for coordination compounds because of its atomic number&ndash;dependent contrast. However, to date, single-molecule observations using HAADF-STEM has limited to simple planar molecules. In the present study, we demonstrate a direct structural investigation of nonplanar dendronized polynuclear Ir complexes with subnanometer resolution using Ir as an atomic label. Decreasing the electron dose to the dendrimer complexes is critical for the single-molecule observation. A comparison with simulated STEM images of conformational isomers is performed to determine the most plausible conformation. Our results enlarge the potential of electron microscopic observation to realize structural analysis of coordination macromolecules, which has been impossible with conventional methods.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Temperature sensitivity of permafrost carbon release mediated by mineral and microbial properties</a></h4>

              
                <p>Temperature sensitivity (<I>Q</I><SUB>10</SUB>) of permafrost carbon (C) release upon thaw is a vital parameter for projecting permafrost C dynamics under climate warming. However, it remains unclear how mineral protection interacts with microbial properties and intrinsic recalcitrance to affect permafrost C fate. Here, we sampled permafrost soils across a 1000-km transect on the Tibetan Plateau and conducted two laboratory incubations over 400- and 28-day durations to explore patterns and drivers of permafrost C release and its temperature response after thaw. We find that mineral protection and microbial properties are two types of crucial predictors of permafrost C dynamics upon thaw. Both high C release and <I>Q</I><SUB>10</SUB> are associated with weak organo-mineral associations but high microbial abundances and activities, whereas high microbial diversity corresponds to low <I>Q</I><SUB>10</SUB>. The attenuating effects of mineral protection and the dual roles of microbial properties would make the permafrost C-climate feedback more complex than previously thought.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Olfactory receptor-dependent receptor repression in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                <p>In olfactory systems across phyla, most sensory neurons express a single olfactory receptor gene selected from a large genomic repertoire. We describe previously unknown receptor gene&ndash;dependent mechanisms that ensure singular expression of receptors encoded by a tandem gene array [<I>Ionotropic receptor 75c</I> (<I>Ir75c</I>), <I>Ir75b</I>, and <I>Ir75a</I>, organized 5' to 3'] in <I>Drosophila melanogaster</I>. Transcription from upstream genes in the cluster runs through the coding region of downstream loci and inhibits their expression in cis, most likely via transcriptional interference. Moreover, Ir75c blocks accumulation of other receptor proteins in trans through a protein-dependent, posttranscriptional mechanism. These repression mechanisms operate in endogenous neurons, in conjunction with cell type&ndash;specific gene regulatory networks, to ensure unique receptor expression. Our data provide evidence for inter-olfactory receptor regulation in invertebrates and highlight unprecedented, but potentially widespread, mechanisms for ensuring exclusive expression of chemosensory receptors, and other protein families, encoded by tandemly arranged genes.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Longitudinal tracking of neuronal mitochondria delineates PINK1/Parkin-dependent mechanisms of mitochondrial recycling and degradation</a></h4>

              
                <p>Altered mitochondrial quality control and dynamics may contribute to neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson&rsquo;s disease, but we understand little about these processes in neurons. We combined time-lapse microscopy and correlative light and electron microscopy to track individual mitochondria in neurons lacking the fission-promoting protein dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) and delineate the kinetics of PINK1-dependent pathways of mitochondrial quality control. Depolarized mitochondria recruit Parkin to the outer mitochondrial membrane, triggering autophagosome formation, rapid lysosomal fusion, and Parkin redistribution. Unexpectedly, these mitolysosomes are dynamic and persist for hours. Some are engulfed by healthy mitochondria, and others are deacidified before bursting. In other cases, Parkin is directly recruited to the matrix of polarized mitochondria. Loss of PINK1 blocks Parkin recruitment, causes LC3 accumulation within mitochondria, and exacerbates Drp1KO toxicity to dopamine neurons. These results define a distinct neuronal mitochondrial life cycle, revealing potential mechanisms of mitochondrial recycling and signaling relevant to neurodegeneration.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">The structural basis of bacterial manganese import</a></h4>

              
                <p>Metal ions are essential for all forms of life. In prokaryotes, ATP-binding cassette (ABC) permeases serve as the primary import pathway for many micronutrients including the first-row transition metal manganese. However, the structural features of ionic metal transporting ABC permeases have remained undefined. Here, we present the crystal structure of the manganese transporter PsaBC from <I>Streptococcus pneumoniae</I> in an open-inward conformation. The type II transporter has a tightly closed transmembrane channel due to "extracellular gating" residues that prevent water permeation or ion reflux. Below these residues, the channel contains a hitherto unreported metal coordination site, which is essential for manganese translocation. Mutagenesis of the extracellular gate perturbs manganese uptake, while coordination site mutagenesis abolishes import. These structural features are highly conserved in metal-specific ABC transporters and are represented throughout the kingdoms of life. Collectively, our results define the structure of PsaBC and reveal the features required for divalent cation transport.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Rapid generation of maternal mutants via oocyte transgenic expression of CRISPR-Cas9 and sgRNAs in zebrafish</a></h4>

              
                <p>Maternal products are exclusive factors to drive oogenesis and early embryonic development. As disrupting maternal gene functions is either time-consuming or technically challenging, early developmental programs regulated by maternal factors remain mostly elusive. We provide a transgenic approach to inactivate maternal genes in zebrafish primary oocytes. By introducing three tandem single guide RNA (sgRNA) expression cassettes and a green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter into Tg(<I>zpc</I>:<I>zcas9</I>) embryos, we efficiently obtained maternal <I>nanog</I> and <I>ctnnb2</I> mutants among GFP-positive F<SUB>1</SUB> offspring. Notably, most of these maternal mutants displayed either sgRNA site&ndash;spanning genomic deletions or unintended large deletions extending distantly from the sgRNA targets, suggesting a prominent deletion-prone tendency of genome editing in the oocyte. Thus, our method allows maternal gene knockout in the absence of viable and fertile homozygous mutant adults. This approach is particularly time-saving and can be applied for functional screening of maternal factors and generating genomic deletions in zebrafish.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Cellular costs underpin micronutrient limitation in phytoplankton</a></h4>

              
                <p>Micronutrients control phytoplankton growth in the ocean, influencing carbon export and fisheries. It is currently unclear how micronutrient scarcity affects cellular processes and how interdependence across micronutrients arises. We show that proximate causes of micronutrient growth limitation and interdependence are governed by cumulative cellular costs of acquiring and using micronutrients. Using a mechanistic proteomic allocation model of a polar diatom focused on iron and manganese, we demonstrate how cellular processes fundamentally underpin micronutrient limitation, and how they interact and compensate for each other to shape cellular elemental stoichiometry and resource interdependence. We coupled our model with metaproteomic and environmental data, yielding an approach for estimating biogeochemical metrics, including taxon-specific growth rates. Our results show that cumulative cellular costs govern how environmental conditions modify phytoplankton growth.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Large slip, long duration, and moderate shaking of the Nicaragua 1992 tsunami earthquake caused by low near-trench rock rigidity</a></h4>

              
                <p>Large earthquake ruptures propagating up to areas close to subduction trenches are infrequent, but when they occur, they heavily displace the ocean seafloor originating destructive tsunamis. The current paradigm is that the large seafloor deformation is caused by local factors reducing friction and increasing megathrust fault slip, or prompting the activation of ancillary faults or energy sources. As alternative to site-specific models, it has been proposed that large shallow slip could result from depth-dependent rock rigidity variations. To confront both hypotheses, here, we map elastic rock properties across the rupture zone of the <I>M</I><SUB>S</SUB>7.0-<I>M</I><SUB>W</SUB>7.7 1992 Nicaragua tsunami earthquake to estimate a property-compatible finite fault solution. The obtained self-consistent model accounts for trenchward increasing slip, constrains stress drop, and explains key tsunami earthquake characteristics such as long duration, high-frequency depletion, and magnitude discrepancy. The confirmation that these characteristics are all intrinsic attributes of shallow rupture opens new possibilities to improve tsunami hazard assessment.</p>

                <p>The use of entangled sensors improves the precision limit from the standard quantum limit (SQL) to the Heisenberg limit. Most previous experiments beating the SQL are performed on the sensors that are well isolated under extreme conditions. Here, we demonstrate a sub-SQL interferometer at ambient conditions by using a multispin system, namely, the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) defect in diamond. We achieve two-spin interference with a phase sensitivity of 1.79 &plusmn; 0.06 dB beyond the SQL and three-spin interference with a phase sensitivity of 2.77 &plusmn; 0.10 dB. Besides, a magnetic sensitivity of 0.87 &plusmn; 0.09 dB beyond the SQL is achieved by two-spin interference for detecting a real magnetic field. Particularly, the deterministic and joint initialization of NV negative state, NV electron spin, and two nuclear spins is realized at room temperature. The techniques used here are of fundamental importance for quantum sensing and computing, and naturally applicable to other solid-state spin systems.</p>

                <p>In stretchable electronics, high-resolution stretchable interfacing at a mild temperature is considered as a great challenge and has not been achieved yet. This study presents a stretchable anisotropic conductive film (S-ACF) that can electrically connect high-resolution stretchable circuit lines to other electrodes whether they are rigid, flexible, or stretchable. The key concepts of this study are (i) high-resolution (~50 &mu;m) but low&ndash;contact resistance (0.2 ohm in 0.25 mm<sup>2</sup>) interfacing by periodically embedding conductive microparticles in thermoplastic film, (ii) low-temperature interfacing through the formation of chemical bonds between the S-ACF and the substrates, (iii) economical interfacing by selectively patterning the S-ACF, and (iv) direct interfacing of chips by using the adhesion of the thermoplastic matrix. We integrate light-emitting diodes on the patterned S-ACF and demonstrate stable light operation at large biaxial areal stretching (<SUB>xy</SUB> = 70%).</p>

                <p>After over 8 years of successful surface operations on Mars, the Curiosity rover has revealed much about the environment in Gale crater. Despite early observations of a lacustrine environment, few of the subsequent deposits exhibit demonstrable lacustrine character. We suggest instead that most of the stratigraphic section explored to date can be best explained as eolian and/or volcaniclastic sediments subaerially chemically weathered by acidic precipitation in a reduced atmosphere. Most of the deposits in Gale crater seemingly did not form in an ancient lake, but the results nonetheless shed considerable light on ancient climate, environmental change, and the astrobiology of Mars. Discoveries by Curiosity provide a critical piece to Mars&rsquo; global alteration puzzle.</p>

Several SARS-CoV-2 variants have shown worrisome effects on vaccine and treatment efficacy, but no current point-of-care (POC) testing modality allows their specific identification. We have developed miSHERLOCK, a low-cost, CRISPR-based POC diagnostic platform that takes unprocessed patient saliva; extracts, purifies, and concentrates viral RNA; performs amplification and detection reactions; and provides fluorescent visual output with only three user actions and 1 hour from sample input to answer out. miSHERLOCK achieves highly sensitive multiplexed detection of SARS-CoV-2 and mutations associated with variants B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1. Our modular system enables easy exchange of assays to address diverse user needs and can be rapidly reconfigured to detect different viruses and variants of concern. An adjunctive smartphone application enables output quantification, automated interpretation, and the possibility of remote, distributed result reporting.</p>

                <p>Rotation-translation conversion is a popular way to achieve power transmission in machinery, but it is rarely selected by nature. One unique case is that of bacteria swimming, which is based on the collective reorganization and rotation of flagella. Here, we mimic such motion using the light-driven evolution of a self-organized periodic arch pattern. The range and direction of translation are altered by separately varying the alignment period and the stimulating photon energy. Programmable self-propelling actuators are realized via a specific molecular assembly within a photoresponsive cholesteric medium. Through rationally presetting alignments, parallel transports of microspheres in customized trajectories are demonstrated, including convergence, divergence, gathering, and orbital revolution. This work extends the understanding of the rotation-translation conversion performed in an exquisitely self-organized system and may inspire future designs for functional materials and intelligent robotics.</p>

Individual HSCs demonstrate heterogeneity in their repopulating capacities. Here, we found that the levels of the histone acetyltransferase MOF (males absent on the first) and its target modification histone H4 lysine 16 acetylation are heterogeneous among HSCs and influence their proliferation capacities. The increased proliferative capacities of MOF-depleted cells are linked to their expression of CD93. The CD93<sup>+</sup> HSC subpopulation simultaneously shows transcriptional features of quiescent HSCs and functional features of active HSCs. CD93<sup>+</sup> HSCs were expanded and exhibited an enhanced proliferative advantage in <I>Mof</I><sup>+/&ndash;</sup> animals reminiscent of a premalignant state. Accordingly, low <I>MOF</I> and high <I>CD93</I> levels correlate with poor survival and increased proliferation capacity in leukemia. Collectively, our study indicates H4K16ac as an important determinant for HSC heterogeneity, which is linked to the onset of monocytic disorders.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Nanocapsules modify membrane interaction of polymyxin B to enable safe systemic therapy of Gram-negative sepsis</a></h4>

              
                <p>Systemic therapy of Gram-negative sepsis remains challenging. Polymyxin B (PMB) is well suited for sepsis therapy due to the endotoxin affinity and antibacterial activity. However, the dose-limiting toxicity has limited its systemic use in sepsis patients. For safe systemic use of PMB, we have developed a nanoparticulate system, called D-TZP, which selectively reduces the toxicity to mammalian cells but retains the therapeutic activities of PMB. D-TZP consists of an iron-complexed tannic acid nanocapsule containing a vitamin D core, coated with PMB and a chitosan derivative that controls the interaction of PMB with endotoxin, bacteria, and host cells. D-TZP attenuated the membrane toxicity associated with PMB but retained the ability of PMB to inactivate endotoxin and kill Gram-negative bacteria. Upon intravenous injection, D-TZP protected animals from pre-established endotoxemia and polymicrobial sepsis, showing no systemic toxicities inherent to PMB. These results support D-TZP as a safe and effective systemic intervention of sepsis.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Kisspeptin (Kiss1) neurons provide indispensable excitatory input to gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons, which is important for the coordinated release of gonadotropins, estrous cyclicity and ovulation. However, Kiss1 neurons also send projections to many other brain regions within and outside the hypothalamus. Two different populations of Kiss1 neurons, one in the arcuate nucleus (Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup>) and another in the anteroventral periventricular nucleus (AVPV) and periventricular nucleus (PeN; Kiss1<sup>AVPV/PeN</sup>) of the hypothalamus are differentially regulated by ovarian steroids, and are believed to form direct contacts with GnRH neurons as well as other neurons. To investigate the projection fields from Kiss1<sup>AVPV/PeN</sup> and Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons in female mice, we used anterograde projection analysis, and channelrhodopsin-assisted circuit mapping (CRACM) to explore their functional input to select target neurons within the paraventricular (PVH) and dorsomedial (DMH) hypothalamus, key preautonomic nuclei. Cre-dependent viral (AAV1-DIO-ChR2 mCherry) vectors were injected into the brain to label the two Kiss1 neuronal populations. Immunocytochemistry (ICC) for mCherry and neuropeptides combined with confocal microscopy was used to determine the projection-fields of both Kiss1 neuronal groups. Whole-cell electrophysiology and optogenetics were used to elucidate the functional input to the PVH and DMH. Our analysis revealed many common but also several clearly separate projection fields between the two different populations of Kiss1 neurons. In addition, optogenetic stimulation of Kiss1 projections to PVH prodynorphin, Vglut2 and DMH CART-expressing neurons, revealed excitatory glutamatergic input from Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons and inhibitory GABAergic input from Kiss1<sup>AVPV/PeN</sup> neurons. Therefore, these steroid-sensitive Kiss1 neuronal groups can differentially control the excitability of target neurons to coordinate autonomic functions with reproduction.</p>

                Background: Around 15 million babies are born prematurely in the world every year. The most common cause of neonatal death in Ethiopia is premature birth. To reduce the rate of preterm delivery by correcting modifiable or preventable causes, the availability of local data is important. Hence, this study aimed to identify the determinants of preterm birth among women who gave birth in public hospitals in central Ethiopia. Methods: An Institutional-based unmatched case-control study was conducted at public hospitals in central Ethiopia to select 170 cases and 340 controls. The collected data were entered into EPI INFO and transferred to SPSS for analysis. Tables, graphs, and proportions were used to present the results. Binary and multiple logistic regressions analysis were computed to identify determinants of preterm birth. Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR), 95% Confidence Interval (CI), and a p-value < 0.05 were computed to determine the presence of an association between preterm birth and independent variables. Results: A total of 166 cases and 332 controls participated in the study, giving a response rate of 97.6%. Cigarette smoking (AOR=3.77, 95% CI=1.35,10.56), alcohol consumption (AOR=1.85, 95% CI=1.11,3.10), wanted but unplanned pregnancy (AOR=3,95% CI=1.68,5.34), neither wanted nor planned pregnancy(AOR=3.61% CI=1.62,8.06), lack of antenatal care (ANC) visits (AOR=4.13, 95% CI=1.95, 8.74), adverse birth outcomes (AOR=5.66, 95% CI=2.88,11.12), presence of a diagnosed illness (AOR=2.81, 95% CI=1.37, 5.76), presence of one or more of obstetrics complications(AOR=6.44, 95% CI=5.49, 3.35, 9), and hemoglobin level < 11g/dl  (AOR=2.78, 95% CI=1.48, 5.22) were determinants of preterm birth. Conclusion:-In this study, cigarette smoking status, alcohol drinking status, pregnancy status, adverse birth outcomes, ANC visits, obstetric complications,  presence of medical illness, and anemia were identified as determinants of preterm birth. It is important to encourage such women to attend ANC visits, stop smoking, and abstain from alcohol.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Optimal closed-loop deep brain stimulation using multiple independently controlled contacts</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Gihan Weerasinghe, Benoit Duchet, Christian Bick, Rafal Bogacz</p>

Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a well-established treatment option for a variety of neurological disorders, including Parkinson’s disease and essential tremor. The symptoms of these disorders are known to be associated with pathological synchronous neural activity in the basal ganglia and thalamus. It is hypothesised that DBS acts to desynchronise this activity, leading to an overall reduction in symptoms. Electrodes with multiple independently controllable contacts are a recent development in DBS technology which have the potential to target one or more pathological regions with greater precision, reducing side effects and potentially increasing both the efficacy and efficiency of the treatment. The increased complexity of these systems, however, motivates the need to understand the effects of DBS when applied to multiple regions or neural populations within the brain. On the basis of a theoretical model, our paper addresses the question of how to best apply DBS to multiple neural populations to maximally desynchronise brain activity. Central to this are analytical expressions, which we derive, that predict how the symptom severity should change when stimulation is applied. Using these expressions, we construct a closed-loop DBS strategy describing how stimulation should be delivered to individual contacts using the phases and amplitudes of feedback signals. We simulate our method and compare it against two others found in the literature: coordinated reset and phase-locked stimulation. We also investigate the conditions for which our strategy is expected to yield the most benefit.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">SiGMoiD: A super-statistical generative model for binary data</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Xiaochuan Zhao, Germán Plata, Purushottam D. Dixit</p>

In modern computational biology, there is great interest in building probabilistic models to describe collections of a large number of co-varying binary variables. However, current approaches to build generative models rely on modelers’ identification of constraints and are computationally expensive to infer when the number of variables is large (<i>N</i>~100). Here, we address both these issues with Super-statistical Generative Model for binary Data (SiGMoiD). SiGMoiD is a maximum entropy-based framework where we imagine the data as arising from super-statistical system; individual binary variables in a given sample are coupled to the same ‘bath’ whose intensive variables vary from sample to sample. Importantly, unlike standard maximum entropy approaches where modeler specifies the constraints, the SiGMoiD algorithm infers them directly from the data. Due to this optimal choice of constraints, SiGMoiD allows to model collections of a very large number (<i>N</i>>1000) of binary variables. Finally, SiGMoiD offers a reduced dimensional description of the data, allowing us to identify clusters of similar data points as well as binary variables. We illustrate the versatility of SiGMoiD using several datasets spanning several time- and length-scales.

Phylogenomic analyses of hundreds of protein-coding genes aimed at resolving phylogenetic relationships is now a common practice. However, no software currently exists that includes tools for dataset construction and subsequent analysis with diverse validation strategies to assess robustness. Furthermore, there are no publicly available high-quality curated databases designed to assess deep (>100 million years) relationships in the tree of eukaryotes. To address these issues, we developed an easy-to-use software package, PhyloFisher (https://github.com/TheBrownLab/PhyloFisher), written in Python 3. PhyloFisher includes a manually curated database of 240 protein-coding genes from 304 eukaryotic taxa covering known eukaryotic diversity, a novel tool for ortholog selection, and utilities that will perform diverse analyses required by state-of-the-art phylogenomic investigations. Through phylogenetic reconstructions of the tree of eukaryotes and of the Saccharomycetaceae clade of budding yeasts, we demonstrate the utility of the PhyloFisher workflow and the provided starting database to address phylogenetic questions across a large range of evolutionary time points for diverse groups of organisms. We also demonstrate that undetected paralogy can remain in phylogenomic “single-copy orthogroup” datasets constructed using widely accepted methods such as all vs. all BLAST searches followed by Markov Cluster Algorithm (MCL) clustering and application of automated tree pruning algorithms. Finally, we show how the PhyloFisher workflow helps detect inadvertent paralog inclusions, allowing the user to make more informed decisions regarding orthology assignments, leading to a more accurate final dataset.

                Background: The pathogenesis of herniated nucleus pulposus (HNP) is complex and may involve the wide variety of gene polymorphism. However, the reports from the existing studies are inconclusive. The objective of this study was to determine the role of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in interleukin 1 alpha (IL-1A), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-A), and vitamin D receptor (VDR) genes on the susceptibility to herniated nucleus pulposus (HNP). Methods: Four databases (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, and Web of Science) were searched as of April 1 st, 2021. Authors, publication year, targeted genes, genotype and allele frequency in each case and control groups were collected. Newcastle-Ottawa scale was used to evaluate the publication quality. The pooled estimates of association of IL-1A -889C>T (rs1800587), TNF-A -238G>A (rs361525), and VDR TaqI (rs731236) and susceptibility to HNP were assessed using Z test. Results: We screened 3,067 unique studies for eligibility and three, two and nine case-control studies on IL-1A -889C>T, TNF-A -238G>A, and VDR TaqI were included, respectively, in our meta-analysis. The studies consisting 369 HNP cases and 433 controls for IL-1A -889C>T, 252 cases and 259 controls for TNF-A -238G>A and 1130 cases and 2096 controls for VDR TaqI. Our pooled estimates indicated that there was no significant association of those SNPs with the susceptibility to HNP in any genotype, dominant model, recessive model, or allele comparations. Conclusion: Although individual studies suggested the important role of gene expression dysregulation associated with SNPs in IL-1A, TNF-A, and VDR, our data indicated that IL-1A -889C>T, TNF-A -238G>A, and VDR TaqI had weak association with HNP susceptibility in both genotypes and allele distributions. However, since heterogeneity was identified among studies included in this meta-analysis, further meta-analysis with a larger population and subgroup analysis on specific population are warranted to support this finding.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Marine plant mediated green synthesis of silver nanoparticles using mangrove Rhizophora stylosa: Effect of variable process and their antibacterial activity [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Most natural plants used in the synthesis of silver nanoparticles are limited to marine plants. To carry out applications, colloidal silver nanoparticles (AgNps) should have appropriate properties such as homogeneous shapes, small and narrow particle size distribution, and long time stability. This study aims to determine the effects of a variable process of AgNps mediated mangrove Rhizophora stylosa (RS) leaf extract, and antibacterial activity.  Methods: Synthesis of AgNps was carried out by stirring silver nitrate solution with aqueous extract. The characterization of AgNps was carried out using UV-Vis spectrophotometry, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) zetasizer and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). Evaluation of antibacterial activity was carried out on Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. Reaction conditions such as the concentration of metal ions (0.001 M, 0.005 M, and 0.01 M), extracts (1%, 3%, and 5% v/v), and the reaction time on the size and stability of nanoparticles were also explored. Results: The UV-Vis spectroscopy showed an absorption of colloidal AgNps in a wavelength range of 403–443 nm.  TEM analysis showed that as-synthesized AgNps were spherical in shape with a size range of 5–87 nm. The use of 0.001 M and 0.005 M of Ag+ resulted in a smaller diameter than the synthesized AgNps, using 0.01 M Ag+, in the same extract concentration. The range of zeta potential was -24.9 mV to -27.7 mV. The as-synthesized AgNps were stable for more than one month. The XRD analysis showed four peaks, which were attributed to the face centered cubic crystal structure of metallic silver. The results of the silver nanoparticles synthesis showed good activity on Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, with an inhibition zone between 4.1–7.2 mm. Conclusions: The AgNps synthesized with RS leaf extract, which is a reducing agent, showed good potential as an antibacterial component.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The need to reassess single-cell RNA sequencing datasets: more is not always better [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The advent of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) and additional single-cell omics technologies have provided scientists with unprecedented tools to explore biology at cellular resolution. However, reaching an appropriate number of good quality reads per cell and reasonable numbers of cells within each of the populations of interest are key to infer conclusions from otherwise limited analyses. For these reasons, scRNAseq studies are constantly increasing the number of cells analysed and the granularity of the resultant transcriptomics analyses. Methods: We aimed to identify previously described fibroblast subpopulations in healthy adult human skin by using the largest dataset published to date (528,253 sequenced cells) and an unsupervised population-matching algorithm. Results: Our reanalysis of this landmark resource demonstrates that a substantial proportion of cell transcriptomic signatures may be biased by cellular stress and response to hypoxic conditions. Conclusions: We postulate that the ”more is better” approach, currently prevalent in the scientific community, might undermine the extent of the analysis, possibly due to long computational processing times inherent to large datasets.

                Background: This study investigated how the inclusion of Boesenbergia pandurata extract (BPE) in goldfish feed affects fish growth, immunity, and resistance to infection by Aeromonas hydrophila and Pseudomonas fluorescens.   Methods: Four fish feeds, were prepared by adding BPE at the concentrations of 0 (control), 2, 4, and 6 g kg-1, respectively, and 120 goldfish (Cyprinus carpio; initial weight 5 g) were separated into 12 boxes and fed with specific pellets and examined thrice. The experiment lasted 12 weeks, beginning with the different feeds, fish growth was measured at Weeks 4 and 8 after the feeding period. Moreover, a challenge test with pathogen bacteria to assay disease resistance was administered at Week 8 after the feeding period, and the survival rate and relative percentage of survival were quantified at Week 12.   Results: At Week 8, the goldfish that were fed BPE-containing feeds were significantly heavier than the fish that received the control feed (pellet without BPE), and the highest weight gain, reaching 72.44 g, was obtained with Pellet 3; accordingly, the specific growth rate after BPE treatment (5.7%) was higher than that after control treatment. Conversely, the feed conversion ratio in the control group, 2.03, was higher than the ratios in the BPE groups, which were decreased to 0.55–0.90. Lastly, BPE treatment consistently enhanced the immunity parameters of goldfish (relative to control treatment) at weeks 4 and 8, and following BPE treatment, the rate of resistance against bacterial infection, 68.3%–77.0%, was higher than that after control treatment.   Conclusions: BPE addition in goldfish feed clearly produces a positive effect by enhancing fish growth, immunity, and resistance to infection by pathogenic bacteria, and 4 g kg-1 is the optimal BPE concentration in feed prepared for goldfish.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis: to investigate the association of adherence to plant-based diets with cardiovascular disease risk [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Plant-based diets (PBDs) are characterised as healthy dietary patterns that emphasise the intake of plant foods and limit the intake of animal foods. The Mediterranean and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diets are common examples of healthy dietary patterns that are mainly plant based. There are different dietary pattern analysis approaches and scoring systems available to construct indices that measure adherence to a dietary pattern. Nutritional epidemiology studies necessitate the use of appropriate dietary indices when investigating diet-disease associations. Methods: This systematic review protocol was developed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis protocols (PRISMA-P) guidelines. PubMed–Medline, Scopus and relevant biomedical databases within EBSCOhost will be searched up to August 2021 using relevant key words. Two reviewers will independently screen the identified records and review the eligible full texts for inclusion. Discrepancies will be resolved by consensus or through discussion with a third reviewer. Appropriate meta-analysis will be performed where possible and consistency of the findings checked through subgroup analysis. Heterogeneity across studies will be assessed and quantified, and publication bias investigated. Relevant sensitivity analyses will be performed to substantiate the robustness of the study findings. Conclusion: Currently, there is some inconsistency in defining and measuring adherence to a PBD across study populations. In addition to this, a lack of global data on the association between adherence to a PBD and CVD risk. This systematic review could aid in promoting the worldwide uptake of these findings for policy and practice purposes. This research will use previously published studies; and therefore, will not require ethical approval.

     alt="Chemogenetic manipulation of astrocytic signaling in the basolateral amygdala reduces binge-like alcohol consumption in male mice"/>
<p>Binge ethanol activates astrocytes resulting in an increase in glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunoreactivity (red) in the basolateral amygdala. When astrocytic receptor signaling was activated using GFAP-Gq-GPCR designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs, it decreased ethanol consumption and ameliorated alcohol-induced depression of glutamate in the amygdala.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Binge drinking is a common occurrence in the United States, but a high concentration of alcohol in the blood has been shown to have reinforcing and reciprocal effects on the neuroimmune system in both dependent and non-dependent scenarios. The first part of this study examined alcohol's effects on the astrocytic response in the central amygdala and basolateral amygdala (BLA) in a non-dependent model. C57BL/6J mice were given access to either ethanol, water, or sucrose during a “drinking in the dark” paradigm, and astrocyte number and astrogliosis were measured using immunohistochemistry. Results indicate that non-dependent consumption increased glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) density but not the number of GFAP+ cells, suggesting that non-dependent ethanol is sufficient to elicit astrocyte activation. The second part of this study examined how astrocytes impacted behaviors and the neurochemistry related to alcohol using the chemogenetic tool, DREADDs (designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs). Transgenic GFAP-hM3Dq mice were administered clozapine N-oxide both peripherally, affecting the entire central nervous system (CNS), or directly into the BLA. In both instances, GFAP-Gq-signaling activation significantly reduced ethanol consumption and correlating blood ethanol concentrations. However, GFAP-Gq-DREADD activation throughout the CNS had more broad effects resulting in decreased locomotor activity and sucrose consumption. More targeted GFAP-Gq-signaling activation in the BLA only impacted ethanol consumption. Finally, a glutamate assay revealed that after GFAP-Gq-signaling activation glutamate concentrations in the amygdala were partially normalized to control levels. Altogether, these studies support the theory that astrocytes represent a viable target for alcohol use disorder therapies.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Adolescent alcohol drinking is widely recognized as a significant public health problem, and evidence is accumulating that sufficient levels of consumption during this critical period of brain development have an enduring impact on neural and behavioral function. Recent studies have indicated that adolescent intermittent ethanol (AIE) exposure alters astrocyte function, astrocyte–neuronal interactions, and related synaptic regulation and activity. However, few of those studies have included female animals, and a broader assessment of AIE effects on the proteins mediating astrocyte-mediated glutamate dynamics and synaptic function is needed. We measured synaptic membrane expression of several such proteins in the dorsal and ventral regions of the hippocampal formation (DH, VH) from male and female rats exposed to AIE or adolescent intermittent water. In the DH, AIE caused elevated expression of glutamate transporter 1 (GLT-1) in both males and females, elevated postsynaptic density 95 expression in females only, and diminished NMDA receptor subunit 2A expression in males only. AIE and sex interactively altered ephrin receptor A4 (EphA4) expression in the DH. In the VH, AIE elevated expression of the cystine/glutamate antiporter and the glutamate aspartate transporter 1 (GLAST) in males only. Compared to males, female animals expressed lower levels of GLT-1 in the DH and greater levels of ephrin receptor B6 (EphB6) in the VH, in the absence of AIE effects. These results support the growing literature indicating that adolescent alcohol exposure produces long-lasting effects on astrocyte function and astrocyte-neuronal interactions. The sex and subregion specificity of these effects have mechanistic implications for our understanding of AIE effects generally.</p>

<p>Postnatal exposure to ethanol resulted in pro-inflammatory molecule expression in mouse cerebellum that persisted for several days suggesting that anti-inflammatory agents may be effective in treating infants with FASD. Cerebellar microglial ramification and novel immune molecules were differentially regulated by ethanol. We demonstrate novel mechanisms for ethanol modulation of neuroinflammation.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are alarmingly common, result in significant personal and societal loss, and there is no effective treatment for these disorders. Cerebellar neuropathology is common in FASD and causes aberrant cognitive and motor function. Ethanol-induced neuroinflammation is believed to contribute to neuropathological sequelae of FASD, and was previously demonstrated in the cerebellum in animal models of FASD. We now demonstrate neuroinflammation persists in the cerebellum several days following cessation of ethanol treatment in an early postnatal mouse model, with meaningful implications for timing of therapeutic intervention in FASD. We also demonstrate by Sholl analysis that ethanol decreases ramification of microglia cell processes in cells located near the Purkinje cell layer but not those near the external granule cell layer. Ethanol did not alter the expression of anti-inflammatory molecules or molecules that constitute NLRP1 and NLRP3 inflammasomes. Interestingly, ethanol decreased the expression of IL-23a (P19) and IL-12Rβ1 suggesting that ethanol may suppress IL-12 and IL-23 signaling. Fractalkine-fractalkine receptor (CX3CL1-CX3CR1) signaling is believed to suppress microglial activation and our demonstration that ethanol decreases CX3CL1 expression suggests that ethanol modulation of CX3CL1-CX3CR1 signaling may contribute to cerebellar neuroinflammation and neuropathology. We demonstrate ethanol alters the expression of specific molecules in the cerebellum understudied in FASD, but crucial for immune responses. Ethanol increases the expression of NOX-2 and NGP and decreases the expression of RAG1, NOS1, CD59a, S1PR5, PTPN22, GPR37, and Serpinb1b. These molecules represent a new horizon as potential targets for development of FASD therapy.</p>

<p>Ethanol causes the secretion of pro-inflammatory microvesicles (MVs) from brain tissue. Ethanol-induced MVs reproduce the pro-inflammatory gene induction and microglial activation seen with ethanol alone, and inhibition of their secretion blocks ethanol-induced neuroinflammation. Microglia are required for the generation of pro-inflammatory MVs, with MV secretion involving activation of microglial PI3K.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Alcohol use disorder (AUD) pathology features pro-inflammatory gene induction and microglial activation. The underlying cellular processes that promote this activation remain unclear. Previously considered cellular debris, extracellular vesicles (EVs) have emerged as mediators of inflammatory signaling in several disease states. We investigated the role of microvesicles (MVs, 50 nm–100 µm diameter EVs) in pro-inflammatory and microglial functional gene expression using primary organotypic brain slice culture (OBSC). Ethanol caused a unique immune gene signature that featured: temporal induction of pro-inflammatory TNF-α and IL-1β, reduction of homeostatic microglia state gene Tmem119, progressive increases in purinergic receptor P2RY12 and the microglial inhibitory fractalkine receptor CX3CR1, an increase in the microglial presynaptic gene C1q, and a reduction in the phagocytic gene TREM2. MV signaling was implicated in this response as reduction of MV secretion by imipramine blocked pro-inflammatory TNF-α and IL-1β induction by ethanol, and ethanol-conditioned MVs (EtOH-MVs) reproduced the ethanol-associated immune gene signature in naïve OBSC slices. Depletion of microglia prior to ethanol treatment prevented pro-inflammatory activity of EtOH-MVs, as did incubation of EtOH-MVs with the HMGB1 inhibitor glycyrrhizin. Ethanol caused HMGB1 secretion from cultured BV2 microglia in MVs through activation of PI3 kinase. In summary, these studies find MVs modulate pro-inflammatory gene induction and microglial activation changes associated with ethanol. Thus, MVs may represent a novel therapeutic target to reduce neuroinflammation in the setting of alcohol abuse or other diseases that feature a neuroimmune component.

<p>After a single, binge-level exposure to ethanol in development, we found subtle effects on glia in the mouse somatosensory cortex and hippocampus. Ethanol treatment reduced colocalization between two astrocytic markers, GFAP and Aldh1L1; induced region-specific changes in microglia volume, process morphology, and density; and had no effect on glial interactions.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are the most common cause of nonheritable, preventable mental disability and are characterized by cognitive, behavioral, and physical impairments. FASD occurs in almost 5% of births in the United States, but despite this prevalence there is no known cure, largely because the biological mechanisms that translate alcohol exposure to neuropathology are not well understood. While the effects of early ethanol exposure on neuronal survival and circuitry have received more attention, glia, the cells most closely tied to initiating and propagating inflammatory events, could be an important target for alcohol in the developing brain. Inflammation is known to alter developmental trajectories, but it has recently been shown that even small changes in both astrocytes and microglia in the absence of full-blown inflammatory signaling can alter brain function long-term. Here, we studied the acute response of astrocytes and microglia to a single exposure to ethanol in development across sexes in a mouse model of human third trimester exposure, in order to understand how these cells may transition from their normal developmental path to a different program that leads to FASD neuropathology. We found that although a single ethanol exposure delivered subcutaneously on postnatal day 4 did not cause large changes in microglial morphology or the expression of AldH1L1 and GFAP in the cortex and hippocampus, subtle effects were observed. These findings suggest that even a single, early ethanol exposure can induce mild acute alterations in glia that could contribute to developmental deficits.</p>

     alt="Chronic intermittent ethanol and lipopolysaccharide exposure differentially alter Iba1-derived microglia morphology in the prelimbic cortex and nucleus accumbens core of male Long-Evans rats"/>
<p>Microglia structural reorganization, and altered neuroimmune signaling, are implicated in pathological adaptations that promote excessive drinking. Here we used Iba1 immunohistochemistry, high-resolution confocal microscopy, and digital reconstruction analyses of Iba1-positive microglia in the prelimbic (PL) cortex and nucleus accumbens (NAc) of rats during withdrawal from chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) exposure, rats injected with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and an ethanol-naïve (air)-exposed group. We found that CIE and LPS led to dichotomous alterations in microglia structural complexity in the PL cortex that were largely absent in the NAc. These findings add to a growing body of literature pointing towards altered microglia structural complexity, and presumably function, in ethanol-induced adaptations in the brain.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Accumulating evidence has linked pathological changes associated with chronic alcohol exposure to neuroimmune signaling mediated by microglia. Prior characterization of the microglial structure–function relationship demonstrates that alterations in activity states occur concomitantly with reorganization of cellular architecture. Accordingly, gaining a better understanding of microglial morphological changes associated with ethanol exposure will provide valuable insight into how neuroimmune signaling may contribute to ethanol-induced reshaping of neuronal function. Here we have used Iba1-staining combined with high-resolution confocal imaging and 3D reconstruction to examine microglial structure in the prelimbic (PL) cortex and nucleus accumbens (NAc) in male Long-Evans rats. Rats were either sacrificed at peak withdrawal following 15 days of exposure to chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) or 24 hr after two consecutive injections of the immune activator lipopolysaccharide (LPS), each separated by 24 hr. LPS exposure resulted in dramatic structural reorganization of microglia in the PL cortex, including increased soma volume, overall cellular volume, and branching complexity. In comparison, CIE exposure was associated with a subtle increase in somatic volume and differential effects on microglia processes, which were largely absent in the NAc. These data reveal that microglial activation following a neuroimmune challenge with LPS or exposure to chronic alcohol exhibits distinct morphometric profiles and brain region-dependent specificity.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Ethanol exposure to the fetus during pregnancy can result in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). These disorders vary in severity, can affect multiple organ systems, and can lead to lifelong disabilities. Damage to the central nervous system (CNS) is common in FASD, and can result in altered behavior and cognition. The incidence of FASD is alarmingly high, resulting in significant personal and societal costs. There are no cures for FASD. Alcohol can directly alter the function of neurons in the developing CNS. In addition, ethanol can alter the function of CNS glial cells including microglia and astrocytes which normally maintain homeostasis in the CNS. These glial cells can function as resident immune cells in the CNS to protect against pathogens and other insults. However, activation of glia can also damage CNS cells and lead to aberrant CNS function. Ethanol exposure to the developing brain can result in the activation of glia and neuroinflammation, which may contribute to the pathology associated with FASD. This suggests that anti-inflammatory agents may be effective in the treatment of FASD.</p>

                Mutations that increase sodium currents in excitatory neurons typically produce hyperexcitability and epileptic seizures. Paradoxically, mutations that reduce NaV1.2 sodium currents also have a similar effect. Two research groups (Spratt et al. and Zhang et al.) have now found that in some excitatory neurons, loss of NaV1.2 increases intrinsic excitability by altering activation and/or expression of potassium channels.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Glypicans define unique roles for the Hedgehog co-receptors Boi and Ihog in cytoneme-mediated gradient formation</a></h4>

              
                The conserved family of Hedgehog (Hh) signaling proteins plays a key role in cell-cell communication during development, tissue repair and cancer progression, inducing distinct concentration-dependent responses in target cells located at short and long distances. One simple mechanism for long distance dispersal of the lipid modified Hh is the direct contact between cell membranes through filopodia-like structures known as cytonemes. Here we have analyzed in <i>Drosophila</i> the interaction between the glypicans Dally and Dally-like protein, necessary for Hh signaling, and the adhesion molecules and Hh coreceptors Ihog and Boi. We describe that glypicans are required to maintain the levels of Ihog, but not of Boi. We also show that the overexpression of Ihog, but not of Boi, regulates cytoneme dynamics through their interaction with glypicans, the Ihog fibronectin III domains being essential for this interaction. Our data suggest that the regulation of glypicans over Hh signaling is specifically given by their interaction with Ihog in cytonemes. Contrary to previous data, we also show that there is no redundancy of Ihog and Boi functions in Hh gradient formation, being Ihog, but not of Boi, essential for the long-range gradient.

                Voltage-dependent proton-permeable channels are membrane proteins mediating a number of important physiological functions. Here we report the presence of a gene encoding H<sub>v</sub>1 voltage-dependent, proton-permeable channels in two species of reef-building corals. We performed a characterization of their biophysical properties and found that these channels are fast-activating and modulated by the pH gradient in a distinct manner. The biophysical properties of these novel channels make them interesting model systems. We have also developed an allosteric gating model that provides mechanistic insight into the modulation of voltage-dependence by protons. This work also represents the first functional characterization of any ion channel in scleractinian corals. We discuss the implications of the presence of these channels in the membranes of coral cells in the calcification and pH-regulation processes and possible consequences of ocean acidification related to the function of these channels.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Naa12 compensates for Naa10 in mice in the amino-terminal acetylation pathway</a></h4>

              
                Amino-terminal acetylation is catalyzed by a set of N-terminal acetyltransferases (NATs). The NatA complex (including X-linked Naa10 and Naa15) is the major acetyltransferase, with 40-50% of all mammalian proteins being potential substrates. However, the overall role of amino-terminal acetylation on a whole-organism level is poorly understood, particularly in mammals. Male mice lacking <i>Naa10</i> show no globally apparent <i>in vivo</i> amino-terminal acetylation impairment and do not exhibit complete embryonic lethality. Rather <i>Naa10</i> nulls display increased neonatal lethality, and the majority of surviving undersized mutants exhibit a combination of hydrocephaly, cardiac defects, homeotic anterior transformation, piebaldism and urogenital anomalies. <i>Naa12</i> is a previously unannotated <i>Naa10</i>-like paralogue with NAT activity that genetically compensates for <i>Naa10</i>. Mice deficient for<i> Naa12</i> have no apparent phenotype, whereas mice deficient for <i>Naa10</i> and <i>Naa12 </i>display embryonic lethality. The discovery of <i>Naa12</i> adds to the currently known machinery involved in amino-terminal acetylation in mice.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The need for practical insecticide-resistance guidelines to effectively inform mosquito-borne disease control programs</a></h4>

              
                Monitoring local mosquito populations for insecticide resistance is critical for effective vector-borne disease control. However, widely used phenotypic assays, which are designed to monitor the emergence and spread of insecticide resistance (technical resistance), do not translate well to the efficacy of vector control products to suppress mosquito numbers in the field (practical resistance). This is because standard testing conditions such as environmental conditions, exposure dose, and type of substrate differ dramatically from those experienced by mosquitoes under field conditions. In addition, field mosquitoes have considerably different physiological characteristics such as age and blood-feeding status. Beyond this, indirect impacts of insecticide resistance and/or exposure on mosquito longevity, pathogen development, host-seeking behavior, and blood-feeding success impact disease transmission. Given the limited number of active ingredients currently available and the observed discordance between resistance and disease transmission, we conclude that additional testing guidelines are needed to determine practical resistance—the efficacy of vector control tools under relevant local conditions— in order to obtain programmatic impact.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Expanding the MECP2 network using comparative genomics reveals potential therapeutic targets for Rett syndrome</a></h4>

              
                Inactivating mutations in the Methyl-CpG Binding Protein 2 (MECP2) gene are the main cause of Rett syndrome (RTT). Despite extensive research into MECP2 function, no treatments for RTT are currently available. Here, we used an evolutionary genomics approach to construct an unbiased MECP2 gene network, using 1028 eukaryotic genomes to prioritize proteins with strong co-evolutionary signatures with MECP2. Focusing on proteins targeted by FDA-approved drugs led to three promising targets, two of which were previously linked to MECP2 function (IRAK, KEAP1) and one that was not (EPOR). The drugs targeting these three proteins (Pacritinib, DMF, and EPO) were able to rescue different phenotypes of MECP2 inactivation in cultured human neural cell types, and appeared to converge on Nuclear Factor Kappa B (NF-κB) signaling in inflammation. This study highlights the potential of comparative genomics to accelerate drug discovery, and yields potential new avenues for the treatment of RTT.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Non-linear dimensionality reduction on extracellular waveforms reveals cell type diversity in premotor cortex</a></h4>

              
                Cortical circuits are thought to contain a large number of cell types that coordinate to produce behavior. Current in vivo methods rely on clustering of specified features of extracellular waveforms to identify putative cell types, but these capture only a small amount of variation. Here, we develop a new method (WaveMAP) that combines non-linear dimensionality reduction with graph clustering to identify putative cell types. We apply WaveMAP to extracellular waveforms recorded from dorsal premotor cortex of macaque monkeys performing a decision-making task. Using WaveMAP, we robustly establish eight waveform clusters and show that these clusters recapitulate previously identified narrow- and broad-spiking types while revealing previously unknown diversity within these subtypes. The eight clusters exhibited distinct laminar distributions, characteristic firing rate patterns, and decision-related dynamics. Such insights were weaker when using featurebased approaches. WaveMAP therefore provides a more nuanced understanding of the dynamics of cell types in cortical circuits.

                African trypanosomes cause sleeping sickness in humans and nagana in cattle. These unicellular parasites are transmitted by the bloodsucking tsetse fly. In the mammalian host's circulation, proliferating slender stage cells differentiate into cell cycle-arrested stumpy stage cells when they reach high population densities. This stage transition is thought to fulfil two main functions: first, it auto-regulates the parasite load in the host; second, the stumpy stage is regarded as the only stage capable of successful vector transmission. Here, we show that proliferating slender stage trypanosomes express the mRNA and protein of a known stumpy stage marker, complete the complex life cycle in the fly as successfully as the stumpy stage, and require only a single parasite for productive infection. These findings suggest a reassessment of the traditional view of the trypanosome life cycle. They may also provide a solution to a long-lasting paradox, namely the successful transmission of parasites in chronic infections, despite low parasitemia.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Mixed matrix factorization: a novel algorithm for the extraction of kinematic-muscular synergies</a></h4>

              
                Synergistic models have been employed to investigate motor coordination separately in the muscular and kinematic domains. However, the relationship between muscle synergies, constrained to be non-negative, and kinematic synergies, whose elements can be positive and negative, has received limited attention. Existing algorithms for extracting synergies from combined kinematic and muscular data either do not enforce non-negativity constraints or separate non-negative variables into positive and negative components. We propose a mixed matrix factorization (MMF) algorithm based on a gradient descent update rule which overcomes these limitations. It directly assesses the relationship between kinematic and muscle activity variables, by enforcing the non-negativity constrain on a subset of variables. We validated the algorithm on simulated kinematic-muscular data generated from known spatial synergies and temporal coefficients, by assessing the similarity between extracted and ground truth synergies and temporal coefficients when the data are corrupted by different noise levels. We also compared the performance of MMF to that of non-negative matrix factorization applied to separate positive and negative components (NMFpn). Finally, we factorized kinematic and EMG data collected during upper-limb movements to demonstrate the potential of the algorithm. MMF achieved almost perfect reconstruction on noiseless simulated data. It performed better than NMFpn in recovering the correct spatial synergies and temporal coefficients with noisy simulated data. It allowed to correctly select the original number of ground truth synergies. We showed meaningful applicability to real data. MMF can also be applied to any multivariate data that contains both non-negative and unconstrained variables.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Precision dynamical mapping using topological data analysis reveals a unique hub-like transition state at rest</a></h4>

              
                Even in the absence of external stimuli, neural activity is both highly dynamic and organized across multiple spatiotemporal scales. The continuous evolution of brain activity patterns during rest is believed to help maintain a rich repertoire of possible functional configurations that relate to typical and atypical cognitive phenomena. Whether these transitions or "explorations" follow some underlying arrangement or instead lack a predictable ordered plan remains to be determined. Here, using a precision dynamics approach, we aimed at revealing the rules that govern transitions in brain activity at rest at the single participant level. We hypothesized that by revealing and characterizing the overall landscape of whole brain configurations (or states) we could interpret the rules (if any) that govern transitions in brain activity at rest. To generate the landscape of whole-brain configurations we used Topological Data Analysis based Mapper approach. Across all participants, we consistently observed a rich topographic landscape in which the transition of activity from one state to the next involved a central hub-like "transition state." The hub topography was characterized as a shared attractor-like basin where all canonical resting-state networks were represented equally. The surrounding periphery of the landscape had distinct network configurations. The intermediate transition state and traversal through it via a topographic gradient seemed to provide the underlying structure for the continuous evolution of brain activity patterns at rest. In addition, differences in the landscape architecture were more consistent within than between subjects, providing evidence of idiosyncratic dynamics and potential utility in precision medicine.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Extracellular and intracellular components of theimpedance of neural tissue</a></h4>

              
                Electric phenomena in brain tissue can be measured using extracellular potentials, such as the local field potential, or the electro-encephalogram. The interpretation of these signals depend on the electric structure and properties of extracellular media, but the measurements of these electric properties are subject to controversy. Some measurements point to a model where the extracellular medium is purely resistive, and thus parameters such as electric conductivity and permittivity should be independent of frequency. Other measurements point to a pronounced frequency dependence of these parameters, with scaling laws that are consistent with capacitive or diffusive effects. However, these experiments correspond to different preparations, and it is unclear how to correctly compare them. Here, we provide for the first time, impedance measurements in various preparations, for acute brain slices and primary cell cultures, and we compare to measurements using the same setup in artificial cerebrospinal fluid with no biological material. The measurements show that when the current flows across a cell membrane, the frequency dependence of the macroscopic impedance between intracellular and extracellular electrodes is significant, and cannot be captured by a model with resistive media. Fitting a mean-field model to the data shows that this frequency dependence could be explained by the ionic diffusion mainly associated to Debye layers surrounding the membranes. We conclude that neuronal membranes and their ionic environment induce strong deviations to resistivity, that should be taken into account to correctly interpret extracellular potentials generated by neurons.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Synaptic and mitochondrial plasticity associated with fear memory revealed by deep learning-based 3D reconstruction</a></h4>

              
                Reconstruction of serial section electron microscopy (ssEM) data greatly facilitates neuroscience research, but such reconstruction is computationally expensive. Informative data about physiological functions can in theory be obtained from ssEM datasets by extracting distinct cellular structures without large-scale reconstruction, but an efficient method is needed to accomplish this. Here, we developed a Region-CNN (R-CNN) based deep learning method to identify, segment, and reconstruct synapses and mitochondria from ssEM data. We applied this method to explore the changes in synaptic and mitochondrial configuration in the auditory cortex of mice subjected to auditory fear conditioning. Upon reconstructing over 135,000 mitochondria and 160,000 synapses, we found that fear conditioning significantly increases the number while decreasing the size of mitochondria, and also noted that it promoted the formation of multi-contact synapses comprising a single axonal bouton and multiple postsynaptic sites from different dendrites. Combinatorial modeling indicated that such multi-dendritic synapses increased information storage capacity of new synapses by over 50%, representing a synaptic memory engram. Our method achieved high accuracy and speed in synapse and mitochondrion extraction, and its application revealed structural and functional insights about cellular engrams associated with fear conditioning.

                Elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) is a feature of critical cerebral disorders. Obesity has been linked to raised ICP, and especially to disorders such as idiopathic intracranial pressure (IIH). We aimed to explore the impact of diet-induced obesity (DIO) on ICP, cephalic sensitivity and structural retinal changes with the dual goal of developing a disease model for non-traumatic raised ICP and IIH. Rats were fed high-fat diet or matched control diet. To assess pain sensitivity, Von Frey and light/dark box testing were performed. Dual energy x-ray absorptiometry scanning was used to measure body composition. Optic nerve head and retinal structures were evaluated using optical coherence tomography. Intraocular pressure was assessed. Rats were then implanted with telemetric device for continuous ICP recording. At the end, eye histology and molecular analysis on choroid plexus (CP) and trigeminal ganglion (TG) were performed. The DIO rats had double the abdominal fat mass. ICP was 55% higher in obese rats (p=0.003). Altered pain thresholds were found in DIO rats as denoted by a lower periorbital threshold (p=0.0002). Expression of Calca and Trpv1 was elevated in TG. Furthermore, a peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer swelling (p=0.0026) with subsequent neuroretinal degeneration p=0.02) was detected in DIO rats. There was a trend to increased expression of AQP1 and NKCC1 at CP. This study demonstrates for the first time that DIO leads to raised ICP, with clinically relevant sequalae. Our novel model for non-traumatic raised ICP could expand the knowledge regarding disorders with elevated ICP and IIH.

                The microvascular inflow tract (MIT), i.e. penetrating arterioles, precapillary sphincters and first order capillaries, is the bottleneck for brain blood flow and energy supply. However, the exact structural and functional alterations during aging remain elusive. Using in vivo 4-dimensional (xyzt) two-photon imaging, we showed an age-dependent decrease in vaso-responsivity, which was accompanied by reduced sensitivity of MIT to pinacidil and papaverine, and to vasoconstrictors endothelin-1 and to L-NAME, a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor. Reduced responsivity was accompanied by an age-dependent decrease in capillary density close to the arterioles and by loss of pericyte processes, whereas the number of pericyte somas and the pericyte SMA density were preserved. The age-related reduction in vascular reactivity was most pronounced at precapillary sphincters, highlighting its crucial role for capillary blood flow regulation. Mathematical modeling further revealed dysregulated but protected pressure and flow in aged mice towards vasoconstriction. Prevention of reduced responsivity of the MIT may ameliorate the blood flow decrease associated with brain aging and age-related brain frailty.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Synaptic and membrane conductance underlie phase transition in a simple half-center oscillator</a></h4>

              
                Rhythmically active neural circuits often contain reciprocally inhibitory modules that act as half-center oscillators. In half-center oscillators, alternating burst discharges require a mechanism to transition activity from one phase to the next, which requires particular synaptic and membrane properties. Here we found that active membrane properties of specific neurons and the temporal dynamics of particular synapses both contribute to the production of a stable rhythmic motor pattern in the swim central pattern generator (CPG) of the nudibranch mollusc, Dendronotus iris. This CPG is composed of only four neurons that are organized into two competing modules of a half-center oscillator. Each module is composed of a Swim Interneuron 2 (Si2) and the contralateral Swim Interneuron 3 (Si3). Si2 and Si3 each inhibit their own contralateral counterparts; however, the S2 contralateral synapses have a more negative reversal potential, making them more effective at hyperpolarizing the Si2 and the electrically coupled Si3 of the other module. Si3 rebounds first from inhibition due to a hyperpolarization-activated slow inward current. Si3 excites the Si2 in its module through both chemical and electrical synapses. An Si2-evoked slow inhibitory synaptic potential in Si3 suppresses its firing, terminating the burst generated by the module. Using dynamic clamping, we showed that the magnitude of the slow inhibition sets the periodicity of the oscillator. Thus, the network-driven oscillation is produced by each module rebounding from inhibition, maintaining the burst through self-excitation, and then terminating its burst through a buildup of slow synaptic inhibition, thereby releasing the other module from inhibition.

                When choosing between different options, we tend to consider specific attribute qualities rather than deliberating over some general sense of the objects' overall values. The importance of each attribute together with its quality will determine our preference rankings over the available alternatives. Here, we show that the relative importance of the latent attributes within food rewards reliably differs when the items are evaluated in isolation compared to when binary choices are made between them. Specifically, we used standard regression and sequential sampling models to examine six datasets in which participants evaluated, and chose between, multi-attribute snack foods. We show that models that assume that attribute importance remains constant across evaluation and choice contexts fail to reproduce fundamental patterns in the choice data and provide quantitatively worse fits to the choice outcomes, response times, and confidence reports compared to models that allow for attribute importance to vary across preference elicitation methods. Our results provide important evidence that incorporating attribute-level information into computational models helps us to better understand the cognitive processes involved in value-based decision-making.

                Microglia are key remodelers of neuronal synapses during brain development, but the mechanisms that regulate this process and its ultimate impact on neural circuit function are not well defined. We previously identified the IL-1 family cytokine Interleukin-33 (IL-33) as a novel mediator of microglial synapse remodeling. Here we define the phagocytic program induced in microglia in response to IL-33. We find that IL-33 markedly alters the microglial enhancer landscape and exposes AP-1 transcription factor sites that promote target gene expression. We identify the scavenger receptor MARCO and the pattern recognition receptor TLR2 as downstream mediators of IL-33 dependent synapse engulfment. Conditional deletion of IL-33 in the CNS or its receptor on microglia results in increased numbers of excitatory synapses in the corticothalamic circuit and spontaneous epileptiform activity as well as increased seizure susceptibility by early adulthood. These findings define novel mechanisms through which IL-33 coordinates experience-dependent synaptic refinement to restrict hyperexcitability in the developing brain.

                Sensory stimuli evoke spiking neural responses that innately or after learning drive suitable behavioral outputs. How are these spiking activities intrinsically patterned to encode for innate preferences, and could the neural response organization impose constraints on learning? We examined this issue in the locust olfactory system. Using a diverse odor panel, we found that ensemble activities both during ('ON response') and after stimulus presentations ('OFF response') could be linearly mapped onto overall appetitive preference indices. Although diverse, ON and OFF response patterns generated by innately appetitive odorants were still limited to a low-dimensional subspace (a 'neural manifold'). Similarly, innately non-appetitive odorants evoked responses that were separable yet confined to another neural manifold. Notably, only odorants that evoked neural response excursions in the appetitive manifold were conducive for learning. In sum, these results provide insights on how encoding for innate preferences can also set limits on associative learning.

                Thermal signals are critical elements in the operation of interoceptive and exteroceptive neural circuits, essential for triggering thermally-driven reflexes and conscious behaviors. A fraction of cutaneous and visceral sensory endings are activated by cold temperatures. Compared to somatic (DRG and TG) neurons, little is known about the mechanisms underlying cold sensitivity of visceral vagal neurons. We used pharmacological and genetic tools for a side-by-side characterization of cold-sensitive (CS) neurons in adult mouse trigeminal (TG) and vagal ganglia (VG). We found that CS neurons are more abundant in VG than in TG. In both ganglia, sensitivity to cold varied widely and was enhanced by the potassium channel blocker 4-AP. The majority of CS neurons in VG co-express TRPA1 markers and cold-evoked responses are severely blunted in Trpa1 KO mice, with little impact of TRPM8 deletion or pharmacological TRPM8 blockade. Consistent with these findings, the expression of TRPM8-positive neurons was low in VG and restricted to the rostral jugular ganglion. In vivo retrograde labelling of airway-innervating vagal neurons demonstrated their enhanced cold sensitivity and a higher expression of TRPA1 compared to neurons innervating the stomach wall. In contrast, the majority of CS TG neurons co-express TRPM8 markers and their cold sensitivity is reduced after TRPM8 deletion or blockade. However, pharmacological or genetic reduction of TRPA1 showed that these channels contribute significantly to their cold sensitivity in TG. In both ganglia, a fraction of CS neuron respond to cooling by a mechanism independent of TRPA1 or TRPM8 yet to be characterized.

                Many neuronal populations that release fast-acting excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters in the brain also contain slower acting neuropeptides. These facultative peptidergic cell types are common, but it remains uncertain whether obligate peptidergic neurons exist. Our fluorescence in situ hybridization, genetically-targeted electron microscopy, and electrophysiological characterization data strongly suggest that neurons of the non-cholinergic, centrally-projecting Edinger-Westphal nucleus in mice are fundamentally obligately peptidergic. We further show, using fiber photometry, monosynaptic retrograde tracing, anterograde projection mapping, and a battery of behavioral assays, that this peptidergic population both promotes fear responses and analgesia and activates in response to loss of motor control and pain. Together, these findings elucidate an integrative, ethologically relevant function for the Edinger-Westphal nucleus and functionally align the nucleus with the periaqueductal gray, where it resides. This work advances our understanding of the peptidergic modulation of fear and provides a framework for future investigations of putative obligate peptidergic systems.

                When making a turn at a familiar intersection, we know what items and landmarks will come into view. These perceptual expectations, or predictions, come from our knowledge of the context, however it is unclear how memory and perceptual systems interact to support the prediction and reactivation of sensory details in cortex. To address this, human participants learned the spatial layout of animals positioned in a cross maze. During fMRI, participants navigated between animals to reach a target, and in the process saw a predictable sequence of five animal images. Critically, to isolate activity patterns related to item predictions, rather than bottom-up inputs, one quarter of trials ended early, with a blank screen presented instead. Using multivariate pattern similarity analysis, we reveal that activity patterns in early visual cortex, posterior medial regions, and the posterior hippocampus showed greater similarity when seeing the same item compared to different items. Further, item effects in posterior hippocampus were specific to the sequence context. Critically, activity patterns associated with seeing an item in visual cortex and posterior medial cortex, were also related to activity patterns when an item was expected, but omitted, suggesting sequence predictions were reinstated in these regions. Finally, multivariate connectivity showed that patterns in the posterior hippocampus at one position in the sequence were related to patterns in early visual cortex and posterior medial cortex at a later position. Together, our results support the idea that hippocampal representations facilitate sensory processing by modulating visual cortical activity in anticipation of expected items.

                We combine a chemically-synthesized, voltage-sensitive fluorophore with a genetically encoded, self-labeling enzyme to enable voltage imaging in Drosophila melanogaster. Previously, we showed that a rhodamine voltage reporter (RhoVR) combined with the HaloTag self-labeling enzyme could be used to monitor membrane potential changes from mammalian neurons in culture and brain slice. Here, we apply this hybrid RhoVR-Halo approach in vivo to achieve selective neuron labeling in intact fly brains. We generate a Drosophila UAS-HaloTag reporter line in which the HaloTag enzyme is expressed on the surface of cells. We validate the voltage sensitivity of this new construct in cell culture before driving expression of HaloTag in specific brain neurons in flies. We show that selective labeling of synapses, cells, and brain regions can be achieved with RhoVR-Halo in either larval neuromuscular junction (NMJ) or in whole adult brains. Finally, we validate the voltage sensitivity of RhoVR-Halo in fly tissue via dual-electrode/imaging at the NMJ, show the efficacy of this approach for measuring synaptic excitatory post-synaptic potentials (EPSPs) in muscle cells, and perform voltage imaging of carbachol-evoked depolarization and osmolarity-evoked hyperpolarization in projection neurons and in interoceptive subesophageal zone neurons in fly brain explants following in vivo labeling. We envision the turn-on response to depolarizations, fast response kinetics, and two-photon compatibility of chemical indicators, coupled with the cellular and synaptic specificity of genetically-encoded enzymes, will make RhoVR-Halo a powerful complement to neurobiological imaging in Drosophila.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Pupil correlates of decision variables in mice playing a competitive mixed-strategy game</a></h4>

              
                In a competitive game involving an animal and an opponent, the outcome is contingent on the choices of both players. To succeed, the animal must continually adapt to competitive pressure, or else risk being exploited and lose out on rewards. In this study, we demonstrate that head-fixed mice can be trained to play the iterative competitive game 'matching pennies' against a virtual computer opponent. We find that the animals' performance is well described by a hybrid computational model that includes Q-learning and choice kernels. Comparing between matching pennies and a non-competitive two-armed bandit task, we show that the tasks encourage animals to operate at different regimes of reinforcement learning. To understand the involvement of neuromodulatory mechanisms, we measure fluctuations in pupil size and use multiple linear regression to relate the trial-by-trial transient pupil responses to decision-related variables. The analysis reveals that pupil responses are modulated by observable variables, including choice and outcome, as well as latent variables for value updating, but not action selection. Collectively, these results establish a paradigm for studying competitive decision-making in head-fixed mice and provide insights into the role of arousal-linked neuromodulation in the decision process.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A population of descending neurons that regulate the flight motor of Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Like many insect species, Drosophila melanogaster are capable of maintaining a stable flight trajectory for periods lasting up to several hours(1, 2). Because aerodynamic torque is roughly proportional to the fifth power of wing length(3), even small asymmetries in wing size require the maintenance of subtle bilateral differences in flapping motion to maintain a stable path. Flies can even fly straight after losing half of a wing, a feat they accomplish via very large, sustained kinematic changes to the both damaged and intact wings(4). Thus, the neural network responsible for stable flight must be capable of sustaining fine-scaled control over wing motion across a large dynamic range. In this paper, we describe an unusual type of descending neurons (DNg02) that project directly from visual output regions of the brain to the dorsal flight neuropil of the ventral nerve cord. Unlike most descending neurons, which exist as single bilateral pairs with unique morphology, there is a population of at least 15 DNg02 cell pairs with nearly identical shape. By optogenetically activating different numbers of DNg02 cells, we demonstrate that these neurons regulate wingbeat amplitude over a wide dynamic range via a population code. Using 2-photon functional imaging, we show that DNg02 cells are responsive to visual motion during flight in a manner that would make them well suited to continuously regulate bilateral changes in wing kinematics. Collectively, we have identified a critical set of DNs that provide the sensitivity and dynamic range required for flight control.

	<p>Background: We aimed to assess the effects of modulated neuroprotection with intermittent administration in patients with unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS) after severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). Methods: Retrospective analysis of 60 patients divided into two groups, with and without neuroprotective treatment with Actovegin, Cerebrolysin, pyritinol, L-phosphothreonine, L-glutamine, hydroxocobalamin, alpha-lipoic acid, carotene, DL-α-tocopherol, ascorbic acid, thiamine, pyridoxine, cyanocobalamin, Q 10 coenzyme, and L-carnitine alongside standard treatment. Main outcome measures: Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) after TBI, Extended Glasgow Coma Scale (GOS E), Disability Rankin Scale (DRS), Functional Independence Measurement (FIM), and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA), all assessed at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after TBI. Results: Patients receiving neuroprotective treatment recovered more rapidly from UWS than controls (p = 0.007) passing through a state of minimal consciousness and gradually progressing until the final evaluation (p = 0.000), towards a high cognitive level MOCA = 22 ± 6 points, upper moderate disability GOS-E = 6 ± 1, DRS = 6 ± 4, and an assisted gait, FIM =101 ± 25. The improvement in cognitive and physical functioning was strongly correlated with lower UWS duration (−0.8532) and higher GCS score (0.9803). Conclusion: Modulated long-term neuroprotection may be the therapeutic key for patients to overcome UWS after severe TBI.</p>

	<p>Decision making is a complex cognitive phenomenon commonly used in everyday life. Studies have shown differences in behavioral strategies in risky decision-making tasks over the course of aging. The development of functional neuroimaging has gradually allowed the exploration of the neurofunctional bases of these behaviors. The purpose of our study was to carry out a meta-analysis on the neural networks underlying risky decision making in healthy older adults. Following the PRISMA guidelines, we systematically searched for fMRI studies of decision making in older adults using risky decision-making tasks. To perform the quantitative meta-analysis, we used the revised version of the activation likelihood estimation (ALE) algorithm. A total of 620 references were selected for initial screening. Among these, five studies with a total of 98 cognitively normal older participants (mean age: 69.5 years) were included. The meta-analysis yielded two clusters. Main activations were found in the right insula, bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and left orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). Despite the limited number of studies included, our meta-analysis highlights the crucial involvement of circuits associated with both emotion regulation and the decision to act. However, in contrast to the literature on young adults, our results indicate a different pattern of hemispheric lateralization in older participants. These activations can be used as a minimum pattern of activation in the risky decision-making tasks of healthy older subjects.</p>

	<p>Background and objectives: Parkinson’s disease (PD) and schizophrenia often share symptomatology. Psychotic symptoms are prevalent in patients with PD, and similar motor symptoms with extrapyramidal signs are frequently observed in antipsychotic-naïve patients with schizophrenia as well as premorbid families. However, few studies have examined the relationship between PD and schizophrenia. We performed this study to evaluate whether genetic variants which increase PD risk influence the risk of developing schizophrenia, and vice versa. Materials and Methods: Two-sample Mendelian randomization (TSMR) with summary statistics from large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) was applied. Summary statistics were extracted for these instruments from GWAS of PD and schizophrenia; Results: We found an increase in the risk of schizophrenia per one-standard deviation (SD) increase in the genetically-predicted PD risk (inverse-variance weighted method, odds ratio = 1.10; 95% confidence interval, 1.05−1.15; p = 3.49 × 10−5). The association was consistent in sensitivity analyses, including multiple TSMR methods, analysis after removing outlier variants with potential pleiotropic effects, and analysis after applying multiple GWAS subthresholds. No relationships were evident between PD and smoking or other psychiatric disorders, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorder, bipolar affective disorder, major depressive disorder, Alzheimer’s disease, or alcohol dependence. However, we did not find a reverse relationship; genetic variants increasing schizophrenia risk did not alter the risk of PD; Conclusions: Overall, our findings suggest that increased genetic risk of PD can be associated with increased risk of schizophrenia. This association supports the intrinsic nature of the psychotic symptom in PD rather than medication or environmental effects. Future studies for possible comorbidities and shared genetic structure between the two diseases are warranted.</p>

	<p>The beneficial effects of regular physical activity (PA) on cognitive functions have received much attention. Recent research suggests that regular PA may also enhance creative thinking, an indispensable cognitive factor for invention and innovation. However, at what intensity regular PA brings the most benefits to creative thinking remains uninvestigated. Furthermore, whether the levels of regular PA affect the acute PA effects on creative thinking is also unclear. In the present study, using a previous dataset that investigated the effects of an acute bout of aerobic exercise on creative thinking in healthy Japanese young adults (22.98 ± 1.95 years old) in the year 2020, we tested the association between different intensities of regular PA (i.e., vigorous, moderate, and walking) and creative thinking with the cross-sectional baseline data using multiple linear regression. We also investigated whether regular PA levels were associated with the acute aerobic exercise intervention effects on creative thinking. The results showed that cross-sectionally, the regular PAs were differentially associated with divergent but not convergent thinking. Specifically, whereas the amount of vigorous-intensity PA was positively associated with fluency and flexibility, the amount of walking was positively associated with novelty on the alternate uses test (AUT) measuring divergent thinking. Importantly, the explained variances of fluency, flexibility, and novelty were 20.3% (p = 0.040), 18.8% (p = 0.055), and 20.1% (p = 0.043), respectively. None of the regular PAs predicted convergent thinking (i.e., an insight problem-solving task), nor were they associated with the acute aerobic exercise intervention effects on divergent and convergent thinking. These findings suggest that engaging in regular vigorous-intensity PA and walking may be useful strategies to enhance different aspects of divergent thinking in daily life.</p>

	<p>Prader–Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare disease determined by the loss of the paternal copy of the 15q11-q13 region, and it is characterized by hypotonia, hyperphagia, obesity, short stature, hypogonadism, craniofacial dysmorphisms, and cognitive and behavioral disturbances. The aims of this retrospective study were to analyze interictal EEG findings in a group of PWS patients and to correlate them with genetic, clinical, and neuroimaging data. The demographic, clinical, genetic, EEG, and neuroimaging data of seventy-four patients were collected. Associations among the presence of paroxysmal EEG abnormalities, genotype, and clinical and neuroimaging features were investigated. Four patients (5.4%) presented drug-sensitive epilepsy. Interictal paroxysmal EEG abnormalities—focal or multifocal—were present in 25.7% of the cases, and the normalization of the EEG occurred in about 25% of the cases. In 63.2% of the cases, the paroxysmal abnormalities were bilaterally localized over the middle–posterior regions. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed on 39 patients (abnormal in 59%). No relevant associations were found between paroxysmal EEG abnormalities and all of the other variables considered. Interictal paroxysmal EEG abnormalities—in particular, with a bilateral middle–posterior localization—could represent an important neurological feature of PWS that is not associated with genotype, cognitive or behavioral endophenotypes, MRI anomalies, or prognosis.</p>

	<p>Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a prevalent, chronic neurodevelopmental disorder that affects oculomotor (eye movement) control. Dysfunctional oculomotor control may result in reading or educational difficulties. This randomized controlled crossover study sought to investigate the feasibility of a larger scale trial and effects of a single session of spinal manipulation on oculomotor control in children with ADHD. Thirty children participated in the study and were randomized into either control-first or spinal manipulation first groups. The results indicate that the trial was feasible. Secondary outcomes showed that there was a significant decrease in reading time after the spinal manipulation intervention compared to the control intervention. Future studies of the effects of spinal manipulation on oculomotor control in children with ADHD are suggested.</p>

<p>Shortening the open duration of the ryanodine receptor 2 (RyR2) channel genetically by the RyR2-E4872Q mutation or pharmacologically by R-carvedilol prevented learning and memory impairment, dendritic spine loss, and neuronal cell death in the 3xTG-AD mouse model.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Increasing evidence suggests that Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression is driven by a vicious cycle of soluble β-amyloid (Aβ)-induced neuronal hyperactivity. Thus, breaking this vicious cycle by suppressing neuronal hyperactivity may represent a logical approach to stopping AD progression. In support of this, we have recently shown that genetically and pharmacologically limiting ryanodine receptor 2 (RyR2) open time prevented neuronal hyperactivity, memory impairment, dendritic spine loss, and neuronal cell death in a rapid, early onset AD mouse model (5xFAD). Here, we assessed the impact of limiting RyR2 open time on AD-related deficits in a relatively late occurring, slow developing AD mouse model (3xTG-AD) that bears more resemblance (compared to 5xFAD) to that of human AD. Using behavioral tests, long-term potentiation recordings, and Golgi and Nissl staining, we found that the RyR2-E4872Q mutation, which markedly shortens the open duration of the RyR2 channel, prevented learning and memory impairment, defective long-term potentiation, dendritic spine loss, and neuronal cell death in the 3xTG-AD mice. Furthermore, pharmacologically shortening the RyR2 open time with R-carvedilol rescued these AD-related deficits in 3xTG mice. Therefore, limiting RyR2 open time may offer a promising, neuronal hyperactivity-targeted anti-AD strategy.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Structural basis for enhanced infectivity and immune evasion of SARS-CoV-2 variants</a></h4>

              
                <p>Several fast-spreading variants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have become the dominant circulating strains in the COVID-19 pandemic. We report here cryo&ndash;electron microscopy structures of the full-length spike (S) trimers of the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants, as well as their biochemical and antigenic properties. Amino acid substitutions in the B.1.1.7 protein increase both the accessibility of its receptor binding domain and the binding affinity for receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The enhanced receptor engagement may account for the increased transmissibility. The B.1.351 variant has evolved to reshape antigenic surfaces of the major neutralizing sites on the S protein, making it resistant to some potent neutralizing antibodies. These findings provide structural details on how SARS-CoV-2 has evolved to enhance viral fitness and immune evasion.</p>

                <p>A novel variant of concern (VOC) named CAL.20C (B.1.427/B.1.429), which was originally detected in California, carries spike glycoprotein mutations S13I in the signal peptide, W152C in the N-terminal domain (NTD), and L452R in the receptor-binding domain (RBD). Plasma from individuals vaccinated with a Wuhan-1 isolate&ndash;based messenger RNA vaccine or from convalescent individuals exhibited neutralizing titers that were reduced 2- to 3.5-fold against the B.1.427/B.1.429 variant relative to wild-type pseudoviruses. The L452R mutation reduced neutralizing activity in 14 of 34 RBD-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). The S13I and W152C mutations resulted in total loss of neutralization for 10 of 10 NTD-specific mAbs because the NTD antigenic supersite was remodeled by a shift of the signal peptide cleavage site and the formation of a new disulfide bond, as revealed by mass spectrometry and structural studies.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">De novo assembly, annotation, and comparative analysis of 26 diverse maize genomes</a></h4>

              
                <p>We report de novo genome assemblies, transcriptomes, annotations, and methylomes for the 26 inbreds that serve as the founders for the maize nested association mapping population. The number of pan-genes in these diverse genomes exceeds 103,000, with approximately a third found across all genotypes. The results demonstrate that the ancient tetraploid character of maize continues to degrade by fractionation to the present day. Excellent contiguity over repeat arrays and complete annotation of centromeres revealed additional variation in major cytological landmarks. We show that combining structural variation with single-nucleotide polymorphisms can improve the power of quantitative mapping studies. We also document variation at the level of DNA methylation and demonstrate that unmethylated regions are enriched for cis-regulatory elements that contribute to phenotypic variation.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">A noncoding RNA modulator potentiates phenylalanine metabolism in mice</a></h4>

              
                <p>The functional role of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in inherited metabolic disorders, including phenylketonuria (PKU), is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the mouse lncRNA <I>Pair</I> and human <I>HULC</I> associate with phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH). <I>Pair</I>-knockout mice exhibited excessive blood phenylalanine (Phe), musty odor, hypopigmentation, growth retardation, and progressive neurological symptoms including seizures, which faithfully models human PKU. <I>HULC</I> depletion led to reduced PAH enzymatic activities in human induced pluripotent stem cell&ndash;differentiated hepatocytes. Mechanistically, <I>HULC</I> modulated the enzymatic activities of PAH by facilitating PAH-substrate and PAH-cofactor interactions. To develop a therapeutic strategy for restoring liver lncRNAs, we designed GalNAc-tagged lncRNA mimics that exhibit liver enrichment. Treatment with GalNAc-<I>HULC</I> mimics reduced excessive Phe in <I>Pair</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> and <I>Pah</I><sup>R408W/R408W</sup> mice and improved the Phe tolerance of these mice.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Quantum-enhanced sensing of displacements and electric fields with two-dimensional trapped-ion crystals</a></h4>

              
                <p>Fully controllable ultracold atomic systems are creating opportunities for quantum sensing, yet demonstrating a quantum advantage in useful applications by harnessing entanglement remains a challenging task. Here, we realize a many-body quantum-enhanced sensor to detect displacements and electric fields using a crystal of ~150 trapped ions. The center-of-mass vibrational mode of the crystal serves as a high-<I>Q</I> mechanical oscillator, and the collective electronic spin serves as the measurement device. By entangling the oscillator and collective spin and controlling the coherent dynamics via a many-body echo, a displacement is mapped into a spin rotation while avoiding quantum back-action and thermal noise. We achieve a sensitivity to displacements of 8.8 &plusmn; 0.4 decibels below the standard quantum limit and a sensitivity for measuring electric fields of 240 &plusmn; 10 nanovolts per meter in 1 second. Feasible improvements should enable the use of trapped ions in searches for dark matter.</p>

                <p>A prototypical hydroperoxyalkyl radical (&bull;QOOH) intermediate, transiently formed in the oxidation of volatile organic compounds, was directly observed through its infrared fingerprint and energy-dependent unimolecular decay to hydroxyl radical and cyclic ether products. Direct time-domain measurements of &bull;QOOH unimolecular dissociation rates over a wide range of energies were found to be in accord with those predicted theoretically using state-of-the-art electronic structure characterizations of the transition state barrier region. Unimolecular decay was enhanced by substantial heavy-atom tunneling involving O-O elongation and C-C-O angle contraction along the reaction pathway. Master equation modeling yielded a fully a priori prediction of the pressure-dependent thermal unimolecular dissociation rates for the &bull;QOOH intermediate&mdash;again increased by heavy-atom tunneling&mdash;which are required for global models of atmospheric and combustion chemistry.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Suppressing atomic diffusion with the Schwarz crystal structure in supersaturated Al-Mg alloys</a></h4>

              
                <p>High atomic diffusivity in metals enables substantial tuneability of their structure and properties by tailoring the diffusional processes, but this causes their customized properties to be unstable at elevated temperatures. Eliminating diffusive interfaces by fabricating single crystals or heavily alloying helps to address this issue but does not inhibit atomic diffusion at high homologous temperatures. We discovered that the Schwarz crystal structure was effective at suppressing atomic diffusion in a supersaturated aluminum&ndash;magnesium alloy with extremely fine grains. By forming these stable structures, diffusion-controlled intermetallic precipitation from the nanosized grains and their coarsening were inhibited up to the equilibrium melting temperature, around which the apparent across-boundary diffusivity was reduced by about seven orders of magnitude. Developing advanced engineering alloys using the Schwarz crystal structure may lead to useful properties for high-temperature applications.</p>

                <p>Recent advances in nanofluidics have enabled the confinement of water down to a single molecular layer. Such monolayer electrolytes show promise in achieving bioinspired functionalities through molecular control of ion transport. However, the understanding of ion dynamics in these systems is still scarce. Here, we develop an analytical theory, backed up by molecular dynamics simulations, that predicts strongly nonlinear effects in ion transport across quasi&ndash;two-dimensional slits. We show that under an electric field, ions assemble into elongated clusters, whose slow dynamics result in hysteretic conduction. This phenomenon, known as the memristor effect, can be harnessed to build an elementary neuron. As a proof of concept, we carry out molecular simulations of two nanofluidic slits that reproduce the Hodgkin-Huxley model and observe spontaneous emission of voltage spikes characteristic of neuromorphic activity.</p>

                <p>Incorporating passive radiative cooling structures into personal thermal management technologies could effectively defend humans against intensifying global climate change. We show that large-scale woven metafabrics can provide high emissivity (94.5%) in the atmospheric window and high reflectivity (92.4%) in the solar spectrum because of the hierarchical-morphology design of the randomly dispersed scatterers throughout the metafabric. Through scalable industrial textile manufacturing routes, our metafabrics exhibit desirable mechanical strength, waterproofness, and breathability for commercial clothing while maintaining efficient radiative cooling ability. Practical application tests demonstrated that a human body covered by our metafabric could be cooled ~4.8&deg;C lower than one covered by commercial cotton fabric. The cost-effectiveness and high performance of our metafabrics present substantial advantages for intelligent garments, smart textiles, and passive radiative cooling applications.</p>

                <p>Arboreal animals often leap through complex canopies to travel and avoid predators. Their success at making split-second, potentially life-threatening decisions of biomechanical capability depends on their skillful use of acrobatic maneuvers and learning from past efforts. Here, we found that free-ranging fox squirrels (<I>Sciurus niger</I>) leaping across unfamiliar, simulated branches decided where to launch by balancing a trade-off between gap distance and branch-bending compliance. Squirrels quickly learned to modify impulse generation upon repeated leaps from unfamiliar, compliant beams. A repertoire of agile landing maneuvers enabled targeted leaping without falling. Unanticipated adaptive landing and leaping "parkour" behavior revealed an innovative solution for particularly challenging leaps. Squirrels deciding and learning how to launch and land demonstrates the synergistic roles of biomechanics and cognition in robust gap-crossing strategies.</p>

                <p>Gag, the primary structural protein of HIV-1, is recruited to the plasma membrane for virus assembly by its matrix (MA) domain. Gag is subsequently cleaved into its component domains, causing structural maturation to repurpose the virion for cell entry. We determined the structure and arrangement of MA within immature and mature HIV-1 through cryo&ndash;electron tomography. We found that MA rearranges between two different hexameric lattices upon maturation. In mature HIV-1, a lipid extends out of the membrane to bind with a pocket in MA. Our data suggest that proteolytic maturation of HIV-1 not only assembles the viral capsid surrounding the genome but also repurposes the membrane-bound MA lattice for an entry or postentry function and results in the partial removal of up to 2500 lipids from the viral membrane.</p>

While adaptation to mink resulted in spike destabilization, the B.1.1.7 (UK) spike balanced stabilizing and destabilizing mutations. A local destabilizing effect of the RBD E484K mutation was implicated in resistance of the B.1.1.28/P.1 (Brazil) and B.1.351 (South Africa) variants to neutralizing antibodies.

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Maternal Oxycodone Treatment Results in Neurobehavioral Disruptions in Mice Offspring</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Opioid drugs are increasingly being prescribed to pregnant women. Such compounds can also bind and activate opioid receptors in the fetal brain, which could lead to long-term brain and behavioral disruptions. We hypothesized that maternal treatment with oxycodone (OXY), the primary opioid at the center of the current crisis, leads to later neurobehavioral disorders and gene expression changes in the hypothalamus and hippocampus of resulting offspring. Female mice were treated daily with 5 mg OXY/kg or saline solution (control; CTL) for two weeks before breeding and then throughout gestation. Male and female offspring from both groups were tested with a battery of behavioral and metabolic tests to measure cognition, exploratory-like, anxiety-like, voluntary physical activity, and socio-communication behaviors. qPCR analyses were performed for candidate gene expression patterns in the hypothalamus and hippocampus of OXY and CTL derived offspring. Developmental exposure to OXY caused socio-communication changes that persisted from weaning through adulthood. Such offspring also showed cognitive impairments, reduced voluntary physical activity, and weighed more than CTL counterparts. In the hippocampus, prenatal exposure to OXY caused sex-dependent differences in expression of genes encoding opioid receptors and those involved in serotonin signaling. OXY exposure induced changes in neuropeptide hormone expression and the epigenetic modulator, <I>Dnmt3a</I>, in the hypothalamus, which could result in epigenetic changes in this brain region. The findings suggest cause for concern that consumption of OXY by pregnant mothers may result in permanent neurobehavioral changes in their offspring. Further work is needed to determine the potential underpinning epigenetic mechanisms.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Action Costs Rapidly and Automatically Interfere with Reward-Based Decision-Making in a Reaching Task</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>It is widely assumed that we select actions we value the most. While the influence of rewards on decision-making has been extensively studied, evidence regarding the influence of motor costs is scarce. Specifically, how and when motor costs are integrated in the decision process is unclear. Twenty-two right-handed human participants performed a reward-based target selection task by reaching with their right arm toward one of two visual targets. Targets were positioned in different directions according to biomechanical preference, such that one target was systematically associated with a lower motor cost than the other. Only one of the two targets was rewarded, either in a congruent or incongruent manner with respect to the associated motor cost. A timed-response paradigm was used to manipulate participants&rsquo; reaction times (RT). Results showed that when the rewarded target carried the highest motor cost, movements produced at short RT (&lt;350 ms) were deviated toward the other (i.e., non-rewarded, low-cost (LC) target). In this context participants needed an additional 150-ms delay to reach the same percentage of rewarded trials as when the LC target was rewarded. Crucially, motor costs affected the total earnings of participants. These results demonstrate a robust interference of motor costs in a simple reward-based decision-making task. They point to the rapid and automatic integration of motor costs at an early stage of processing, potentially through the direct modulation of competing action representations in parieto-frontal regions. The progressive overcoming of this bias with increasing RT is likely achieved through top-down signaling pertaining to expected rewards.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Quantifying Age-Related Changes in Brain and Behavior: A Longitudinal versus Cross-Sectional Approach</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Cross-sectional versus longitudinal comparisons of age-related change have often revealed differing results. In the current study, we used within-subject task-based fMRI to investigate changes in voxel-based activations and behavioral performance across the life span in the Reference Ability Neural Network cohort, at both baseline and 5 year follow-up. We analyzed fMRI data from between 127 and 159 participants (20&ndash;80 years) on a battery of tests relating to each of four cognitive reference abilities. We applied a Gaussian age kernel to capture continuous change across the life span using a 5 year sliding window centered on each age in our participant sample, with a subsequent division into young, middle, and old age brackets. This method was applied separately to both cross-sectional approximations of change and real longitudinal changes adopting a comparative approach. We then focused on longitudinal measurements of neural change to identify regions expressing peak changes and fluctuations of sign change across our sample. Our results revealed several regions expressing divergence between cross-sectional and longitudinal measurements in each domain and age bracket; behavioral comparisons between measurements showed differences in change curves for all four domains, with processing speed displaying the steepest declines. In the longitudinal change measurement, we found lack of support for age-related frontal increases across analysis types, instead finding more posterior regions displaying peak increases in activation, particularly in the old age bracket. Our findings encourage greater focus on longitudinal measurements of age-related changes, which display appreciable differences from cross-sectional approximations.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">General Anesthesia Disrupts Complex Cortical Dynamics in Response to Intracranial Electrical Stimulation in Rats</a></h4>

              
                <p>The capacity of human brain to sustain complex cortical dynamics appears to be strongly associated with conscious experience and consistently drops when consciousness fades. For example, several recent studies in humans found a remarkable reduction of the spatiotemporal complexity of cortical responses to local stimulation during dreamless sleep, general anesthesia, and coma. However, this perturbational complexity has never been directly estimated in non-human animals <I>in vivo</I> previously, and the mechanisms that prevent neocortical neurons to engage in complex interactions are still unclear. Here, we quantify the complexity of electroencephalographic (EEG) responses to intracranial electrical stimulation in rats, comparing wakefulness to propofol, sevoflurane, and ketamine anesthesia. The evoked activity changed from highly complex in wakefulness to far simpler with propofol and sevoflurane. The reduced complexity was associated with a suppression of high frequencies that preceded a reduced phase-locking, and disruption of functional connectivity and pattern diversity. We then showed how these parameters dissociate with ketamine and depend on intensity and site of stimulation. Our results support the idea that brief periods of activity-dependent neuronal silence can interrupt complex interactions in neocortical circuits, and open the way for further mechanistic investigations of the neuronal basis for consciousness and loss of consciousness across species.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Role of NMDA Receptors in Adult Neurogenesis and Normal Development of the Dentate Gyrus</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The NMDA receptors are a type of glutamate receptors, which is involved in neuronal function, plasticity and development in the mammalian brain. However, how the NMDA receptors contribute to adult neurogenesis and development of the dentate gyrus is unclear. In this study, we investigate this question by examining a region-specific knock-out mouse line that lacks the NR1 gene, which encodes the essential subunit of the NMDA receptors, in granule cells of the dentate gyrus (DG-NR1KO mice). We found that the survival of newly-generated granule cells, cell proliferation and the size of the granule cell layer are significantly reduced in the dorsal dentate gyrus of adult DG-NR1KO mice. Our results also show a significant reduction in the number of immature neurons and in the volume of the granule cell layer, starting from three weeks of postnatal age. DG-NR1KO mice also showed impairment in the expression of an immediate early gene, Arc, and behavior during the novelty-suppressed feeding and open field test. These results suggest that the NMDA receptors in granule cells have a role in adult neurogenesis in the adult brain and contributes to the normal development of the dentate gyrus.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Modelling conformational state dynamics and its role on infection for SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein variants</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Natália Teruel, Olivier Mailhot, Rafael J. Najmanovich</p>

The SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein needs to be in an open-state conformation to interact with ACE2 to initiate viral entry. We utilise coarse-grained normal mode analysis to model the dynamics of Spike and calculate transition probabilities between states for 17081 variants including experimentally observed variants. Our results correctly model an increase in open-state occupancy for the more infectious D614G via an increase in flexibility of the closed-state and decrease of flexibility of the open-state. We predict the same effect for several mutations on glycine residues (404, 416, 504, 252) as well as residues K417, D467 and N501, including the N501Y mutation recently observed within the B.1.1.7, 501.V2 and P1 strains. This is, to our knowledge, the first use of normal mode analysis to model conformational state transitions and the effect of mutations on such transitions. The specific mutations of Spike identified here may guide future studies to increase our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection mechanisms and guide public health in their surveillance efforts.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Relating simulation studies by provenance—Developing a family of Wnt signaling models</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Kai Budde, Jacob Smith, Pia Wilsdorf, Fiete Haack, Adelinde M. Uhrmacher</p>

For many biological systems, a variety of simulation models exist. A new simulation model is rarely developed from scratch, but rather revises and extends an existing one. A key challenge, however, is to decide which model might be an appropriate starting point for a particular problem and why. To answer this question, we need to identify entities and activities that contributed to the development of a simulation model. Therefore, we exploit the provenance data model, PROV-DM, of the World Wide Web Consortium and, building on previous work, continue developing a PROV ontology for simulation studies. Based on a case study of 19 Wnt/β-catenin signaling models, we identify crucial entities and activities as well as useful metadata to both capture the provenance information from individual simulation studies and relate these forming a family of models. The approach is implemented in WebProv, a web application for inserting and querying provenance information. Our specialization of PROV-DM contains the entities Research Question, Assumption, Requirement, Qualitative Model, Simulation Model, Simulation Experiment, Simulation Data, and Wet-lab Data as well as activities referring to building, calibrating, validating, and analyzing a simulation model. We show that most Wnt simulation models are connected to other Wnt models by using (parts of) these models. However, the overlap, especially regarding the Wet-lab Data used for calibration or validation of the models is small. Making these aspects of developing a model explicit and queryable is an important step for assessing and reusing simulation models more effectively. Exposing this information helps to integrate a new simulation model within a family of existing ones and may lead to the development of more robust and valid simulation models. We hope that our approach becomes part of a standardization effort and that modelers adopt the benefits of provenance when considering or creating simulation models.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Integration of a physiologically-based pharmacokinetic model with a whole-body, organ-resolved genome-scale model for characterization of ethanol and acetaldehyde metabolism</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Leo Zhu, William Pei, Ines Thiele, Radhakrishnan Mahadevan</p>

Ethanol is one of the most widely used recreational substances in the world and due to its ubiquitous use, ethanol abuse has been the cause of over 3.3 million deaths each year. In addition to its effects, ethanol’s primary metabolite, acetaldehyde, is a carcinogen that can cause symptoms of facial flushing, headaches, and nausea. How strongly ethanol or acetaldehyde affects an individual depends highly on the genetic polymorphisms of certain genes. In particular, the genetic polymorphisms of mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase, ALDH2, play a large role in the metabolism of acetaldehyde. Thus, it is important to characterize how genetic variations can lead to different exposures and responses to ethanol and acetaldehyde. While the pharmacokinetics of ethanol metabolism through alcohol dehydrogenase have been thoroughly explored in previous studies, in this paper, we combined a base physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model with a whole-body genome-scale model (WBM) to gain further insight into the effect of other less explored processes and genetic variations on ethanol metabolism. This combined model was fit to clinical data and used to show the effect of alcohol concentrations, organ damage, ALDH2 enzyme polymorphisms, and ALDH2-inhibiting drug disulfiram on ethanol and acetaldehyde exposure. Through estimating the reaction rates of auxiliary processes with dynamic Flux Balance Analysis, The PBPK-WBM was able to navigate around a lack of kinetic constants traditionally associated with PK modelling and demonstrate the compensatory effects of the body in response to decreased liver enzyme expression. Additionally, the model demonstrated that acetaldehyde exposure increased with higher dosages of disulfiram and decreased ALDH2 efficiency, and that moderate consumption rates of ethanol could lead to unexpected accumulations in acetaldehyde. This modelling framework combines the comprehensive steady-state analyses from genome-scale models with the dynamics of traditional PK models to create a highly personalized form of PBPK modelling that can push the boundaries of precision medicine.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">The Δ40p53 isoform inhibits p53-dependent eRNA transcription and enables regulation by signal-specific transcription factors during p53 activation</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Cecilia B. Levandowski, Taylor Jones, Margaret Gruca, Sivapriya Ramamoorthy, Robin D. Dowell, Dylan J. Taatjes</p>

The naturally occurring Δ40p53 isoform heterotetramerizes with wild-type p53 (WTp53) to regulate development, aging, and stress responses. How Δ40p53 alters WTp53 function remains enigmatic because their co-expression causes tetramer heterogeneity. We circumvented this issue with a well-tested strategy that expressed Δ40p53:WTp53 as a single transcript, ensuring a 2:2 tetramer stoichiometry. Human MCF10A cell lines expressing Δ40p53:WTp53, WTp53, or WTp53:WTp53 (as controls) from the native TP53 locus were examined with transcriptomics (precision nuclear run-on sequencing [PRO-seq] and RNA sequencing [RNA-seq]), metabolomics, and other methods. Δ40p53:WTp53 was transcriptionally active, and, although phenotypically similar to WTp53 under normal conditions, it failed to induce growth arrest upon Nutlin-induced p53 activation. This occurred via Δ40p53:WTp53-dependent inhibition of enhancer RNA (eRNA) transcription and subsequent failure to induce mRNA biogenesis, despite similar genomic occupancy to WTp53. A different stimulus (5-fluorouracil [5FU]) also showed Δ40p53:WTp53-specific changes in mRNA induction; however, other transcription factors (TFs; e.g., E2F2) could then drive the response, yielding similar outcomes vs. WTp53. Our results establish that Δ40p53 tempers WTp53 function to enable compensatory responses by other stimulus-specific TFs. Such modulation of WTp53 activity may be an essential physiological function for Δ40p53. Moreover, Δ40p53:WTp53 functional distinctions uncovered herein suggest an eRNA requirement for mRNA biogenesis and that human p53 evolved as a tetramer to support eRNA transcription.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">IL-25–induced shifts in macrophage polarization promote development of beige fat and improve metabolic homeostasis in mice</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Lingyi Li, Lei Ma, Zewei Zhao, Shiya Luo, Baoyong Gong, Jin Li, Juan Feng, Hui Zhang, Weiwei Qi, Ti Zhou, Xia Yang, Guoquan Gao, Zhonghan Yang</p>

Beige fat dissipates energy and functions as a defense against cold and obesity, but the mechanism for its development is unclear. We found that interleukin (IL)-25 signaling through its cognate receptor, IL-17 receptor B (IL-17RB), increased in adipose tissue after cold exposure and β3-adrenoceptor agonist stimulation. IL-25 induced beige fat formation in white adipose tissue (WAT) by releasing IL-4 and IL-13 and promoting alternative activation of macrophages that regulate innervation and up-regulate tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) up-regulation to produce more catecholamine including norepinephrine (NE). Blockade of IL-4Rα or depletion of macrophages with clodronate-loaded liposomes in vivo significantly impaired the beige fat formation in WAT. Mice fed with a high-fat diet (HFD) were protected from obesity and related metabolic disorders when given IL-25 through a process that involved the uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1)-mediated thermogenesis. In conclusion, the activation of IL-25 signaling in WAT may have therapeutic potential for controlling obesity and its associated metabolic disorders.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: Retinal vein occlusion as the first clinical manifestation of systemic lupus erythematosus in a male patient [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic, autoimmune disease characterized by widespread clinical manifestations and immunological disorders. A myriad of ocular manifestations can be seen in patients with SLE. The most vision-threatening complication is vaso-occlusive retinopathy including retinal vein occlusion (RVO). RVO associated with SLE is well described in the literature and its association with antiphospholipid antibodies is recognized. However, RVO as the initial manifestation of SLE is scarcely reported. Herein, we report the first case of recurrent RVO as the primary manifestation of SLE in a 40-year-old male patient. He had two consecutive episodes of decreased vision. Ophthalmologic examination disclosed a branch retinal vein occlusion the first time and a central retinal vein occlusion the second time. The diagnosis of SLE was established based on clinical and immunological criteria. He was prescribed antiplatelet therapy, hydroxychloroquine at 5.5 mg/kg/day, and intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) antibodies regimen. He slowly improved under treatment.

     alt="The RNA-binding protein and stress granule component ATAXIN-2 is expressed in mouse and human tissues associated with glaucoma pathogenesis"/>
<p>The RNA-binding protein Ataxin 2 (ATXN2) is associated with neurodegenerative diseases and vision loss. Retinal ATXN2 is confined to spiking neurons (ganglion cells and amacrine cells) and largely absent from photoreceptors/bipolar cells and glia. The strong expression in the trabecular meshwork and the ciliary body suggests relevance to glaucoma.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Polyglutamine repeat expansions in the <i>Ataxin-2</i> (<i>ATXN2)</i> gene were first implicated in Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 2, a disease associated with degeneration of motor neurons and Purkinje cells. Recent studies linked single nucleotide polymorphisms in the gene to elevated intraocular pressure in primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) yet the localization of ATXN2 across glaucoma-relevant tissues of the vertebrate eye has not been thoroughly examined. This study characterizes ATXN2 expression in the mouse and human retina, and anterior eye, using an antibody validated in ATXN2<sup>-/-</sup> retinas. ATXN2-ir was localized to cytosolic sub compartments in retinal ganglion cell (RGC) somata and proximal dendrites in addition to GABAergic, glycinergic and cholinergic amacrine cells in the inner plexiform layer (IPL), and displaced amacrine cells. Human, but not mouse retinas showed modest immunolabeling of bipolar cells. ATXN2 immunofluorescence was prominent in the trabecular meshwork and pigmented and nonpigmented cells of the ciliary body, with analyses of primary human trabecular meshwork cells confirming the finding. The expression of ATXN2 in key POAG-relevant ocular tissues supports the potential role in autophagy and stress granule formation in response to ocular hypertension.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Philympics 2021: Prophage Predictions Perplex Programs [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Most bacterial genomes contain integrated bacteriophages—prophages—in various states of decay. Many are active and able to excise from the genome and replicate, while others are cryptic prophages, remnants of their former selves. Over the last two decades, many computational tools have been developed to identify the prophage components of bacterial genomes, and it is a particularly active area for the application of machine learning approaches. However, progress is hindered and comparisons thwarted because there are no manually curated bacterial genomes that can be used to test new prophage prediction algorithms. Methods We present a library of gold-standard bacterial genome annotations that include manually curated prophage annotations, and a computational framework to compare the predictions from different algorithms. We use this suite to compare all extant stand-alone prophage prediction algorithms to identify their strengths and weaknesses. We provide a FAIR dataset for prophage identification, and demonstrate the accuracy, precision, recall, and f1 score from the analysis of seven different algorithms for the prediction of prophages. Results We identified different strengths and weaknesses between the prophage prediction tools. Several tools exhibit exceptional f1 scores, while others have better recall at the expense of more false positives. The tools vary greatly in runtime performance with few exhibiting all desirable qualities for large-scale analyses. Conclusions Our library of gold-standard prophage annotations and benchmarking framework provide a valuable resource for exploring strengths and weaknesses of current and future prophage annotation tools. We discuss caveats and concerns in this analysis, how those concerns may be mitigated, and avenues for future improvements. This framework will help developers identify opportunities for improvement and test updates. It will also help users in determining the tools that are best suited for their analysis.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Clinical characteristics and radiological domains among patients with recurrent strokes-a descriptive cross-sectional study from a tertiary care center in central Nepal [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Stroke is a significant global health hazard that ripples continuum multi-spectral effects to the patients as well their caretakers.   Methods: We studied 28 consecutive cohorts of patients with recurrent strokes managed in our centre within the last two years.  Results: The most common recurrence stroke pattern was of that of hemorrhagic to hemorrhagic subtype observed in 50% of the patients. The most common anatomical region of involvement was cortical – cortical seen in 39.28% of our cohorts. The surgical intervention was required in 17.85% whereas 42.85% of them were managed conservatively. Paradoxically, 39.28% of patients left against medical advice. The receiver operating curve (ROC) predicting mode of management was highest (area under the curve (AUC) =0.635) for compliance to therapy followed by stroke territory (AUC=0.578), age (AUC=0.457) and motor grading (AUC=0.374). The receiver operating curve (ROC) for influencing decision to leave against medical advice was highest (area under the curve (AUC) =0.861) for motor score followed by sex (AUC=0.701) and age (AUC=0.564). The analysis of variance (ANOVA) study pertaining to the mode of management was significantly connoted by the motor score and the stroke territory only. The ANOVA study pertaining to the decision to leave against medical advice was significantly governed by the motor score, stroke territory, and sex respectively. The multivariate analysis for variables governing mode of management was significant for motor score and the stroke territory only. The multivariate analysis for variables governing leave against medical advice was significant for sex, motor score and the stroke territory.  Conclusions: This study aims to appraise early dichotomization of high-risk patients for recurrent strokes to reduce the continuum of neurological events as well as to mitigate the financial aspects governing stroke care.
