                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective of this study was to investigate the association between developmental and premorbid body composition measurements and the risk of motor neuron disease (MND).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed a cohort study in the UK Biobank to assess the association of developmental body metrics and premorbid body composition measures (using 28 measurements and 7 patterns of body composition) with the risk of MND. Among participants with longitudinal measures, we compared the changes in body composition over time between individuals who later developed MND and those who remained free of MND.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Among the 412,691 individuals included in this study, 549 people received an MND diagnosis during the follow-up visit. Higher birth weight was associated with an increased risk of MND among individuals born over 4 kg (hazard ratio [HR] per kg increase = 2.21, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.38–3.55), and taller adult height was associated with an increased risk of MND (HR per 5 cm increase = 1.10, 95% CI = 1.03–1.17). We observed that measures of elevated fat mass were associated with a lower risk of MND more than 5 years before diagnosis. A higher “leg-dominant fat distribution” pattern was associated with an increased risk whereas higher “muscle strength” was associated with a reduced risk of MND 5 years before diagnosis. Longitudinal analyses indicated a faster decline in measures of fat mass and muscle strength, as well as a shift in fat distribution from arm to leg dominant, among individuals who later developed MND, compared with others.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Body composition at early and middle age may be indicative of the risk of MND development. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) face challenges in social communication due to difficulties in considering context, processing information, and interpreting social cues. This study aims to explore the neural processes related to pragmatic language communication in children with ASD and address the research question of how functional brain connectivity operates during complex pragmatic language tasks. Methods: We examined differences in brain functional connectivity between children with ASD and typically developing peers while they engaged in video recordings of spoken language tasks. We focused on two types of speech acts: semantic and pragmatic. Results: Our results showed differences between groups during the pragmatic and semantic language processing, indicating more idiosyncratic connectivity in children with ASD in the Left Somatomotor and Left Limbic networks, suggesting that these networks play a role in task-dependent functional connectivity. Additionally, these functional differences were mainly localized to the left hemisphere.</p>

	<p>Background: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is currently a promising technique for psychiatric patients with severe and treatment-resistant symptoms. However, the results to date have been quite heterogeneous, and the indications for psychosurgery with DBS remain in an experimental phase. One of the major challenges limiting the advancement of DBS in psychiatric disorders is the lack of objective criteria for diagnosing certain conditions, which are often based more on clinical scales rather than measurable biological markers. Additionally, there is a limited capacity to objectively assess treatment outcomes. Methods: This overview examines the literature on the available biomarkers in psychosurgery in relation to DBS, as well as other relevant biomarkers in psychiatry with potential applicability for this treatment modality. Results: There are five types of biomarkers: clinical/behavioral, omic, neuroimaging, electrophysiological, and neurobiochemical. The information provided by each biomarker within these categories is highly variable and may be relevant for diagnosis, response prediction, target selection, program adjustment, etc. Conclusions: A better understanding of biomarkers and their applications would allow DBS in psychosurgery to advance on a more objective basis, guided by the information provided by them and within the context of precision psychiatry.</p>

	<p>Background: Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD), the most prevalent form of dementia, is a leading neurodegenerative disorder currently affecting approximately 55 million individuals globally, a number projected to escalate to 139 million by 2050. Despite extensive research spanning several decades, the cure for AD remains at a developing stage. The only existing therapeutic options are limited to symptom management, and are often accompanied by adverse side effects. The pathological features of AD, including the accumulation of beta-amyloid plaques and tau protein tangles, result in progressive neuronal death, synaptic loss, and brain atrophy, leading to significant cognitive decline and a marked reduction in quality of life. Objective: In light of the shortcomings of existing pharmacological interventions, this review explores the potential of photobiomodulation (PBM) as a non-invasive therapeutic option for AD. PBM employs infrared light to facilitate cellular repair and regeneration, focusing on addressing the disease&amp;amp;rsquo;s underlying biomechanical mechanisms. Method: This paper presents a comprehensive introduction to the mechanisms of PBM and an analysis of preclinical studies evaluating its impact on cellular health, cognitive function, and disease progression in AD.The review provides a comprehensive overview of the various wavelengths and application methods, evaluating their efficacy in mitigating AD-related symptoms. Conclusions: The findings underscore the significant potential of PBM as a safe and effective alternative treatment for Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease, emphasizing the necessity for further research and clinical trials to establish its therapeutic efficacy conclusively.</p>

                <p>Pyroptosis, an inflammatory programmed cell death, has recently been found to play an important role in spinal cord injury (SCI). C-type lectin domain family 5 member A (CLEC5A), triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 1 (TREM1), and NLR-family CARD-containing protein 4 (NLRC4) have been reported to be associated with neuronal pyroptosis, but few studies have clarified their functions and regulatory mechanisms in SCI. In this study, CLEC5A, TREM1, and NLRC4 were highly expressed in lidocaine-induced SCI rat models, and their knockdown alleviated lidocaine-induced SCI. The elevation of pyroptosis-related indicators LDH, ASC, GSDMD-N, IL-18, caspase-1, and IL-1&beta; levels in SCI rats was attenuated after silencing of CLEC5A, TREM1, or NLRC4. Lidocaine-induced decrease in cell viability and the elevation in cell death were partly reversed after CLEC5A, TREM1, or NLRC4 silencing. Lidocaine-mediated effects on the levels of LDH, ASC, GSDMD-N, IL-18, caspase-1, and IL-1&beta; in lidocaine-induced PC12 cells were weakened by downregulating CLEC5A, TREM1, or NLRC4. CLEC5A could interact with TREM1 to mediate NLRC4 expression, thus accelerating neuronal pyroptosis, ultimately leading to SCI exacerbation. In conclusions, CLEC5A interacted with TREM1 to increase NLRC4 expression, thus promoting neuronal pyroptosis in rat SCI models, providing new insights into the role of neuronal pyroptosis in SCI.</p>

                <p>Tetrahydroxy stilbene glucoside (TSG) from <I>Polygonum multiflorum</I> exerts neuroprotective effects after ischemic stroke. We explored whether TSG improved ischemic stroke injury via PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1)/Parkin-mediated mitophagy. Oxygen glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) in vitro model and middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) rat model were established. Cerebral injury was assessed by neurological score, hematoxylin and eosin staining, 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining, and brain water content. Apoptosis, cell viability, and mitochondrial membrane potential were assessed by flow cytometry, cell counting kit-8, and JC-1 staining, respectively. Colocalization of LC3-labeled autophagosomes with lysosome-associated membrane glycoprotein 2-labeled lysosomes or translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane 20-labeled mitochondria was observed with fluorescence microscopy. The ubiquitination level was determined using ubiquitination assay. The interaction between molecules was validated by coimmunoprecipitation and glutathione <I>S</I>-transferase pull-down. We found that TSG promoted mitophagy and improved cerebral ischemia/reperfusion damage in MCAO rats. In OGD/R-subjected neurons, TSG promoted mitophagy, repressed neuronal apoptosis, upregulated Y-box binding protein-1 (YBX1), and activated PINK1/Parkin signaling. TSG upregulated ubiquitin-specific peptidase 10 (USP10) to elevate YBX1 protein. Furthermore, USP10 inhibited ubiquitination-dependent YBX1 degradation. <I>USP10</I> overexpression activated PINK1/Parkin signaling and promoted mitophagy, which were reversed by <I>YBX1</I> knockdown. Moreover, TSG upregulated USP10 to promote mitophagy and inhibited neuronal apoptosis. Collectively, TSG facilitated PINK1/Parkin pathway-mediated mitophagy by upregulating USP10/YBX1 axis to ameliorate ischemic stroke.</p>

                <p>It remains unknown whether the Chinese tree shrew, regarded as the closest sister of primate, has evolved a dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) comparable with primates that is characterized by a fourth layer (L4) enriched with granular cells and reciprocal connections with the mediodorsal nucleus (MD). Here, we reported that following AAV-hSyn-EGFP expression in the MD neurons, the fluorescence micro-optical sectioning tomography revealed their projection trajectories and targeted brain areas, such as the hippocampus, the corpus striatum, and the dlPFC. Cre-dependent transsynaptic viral tracing identified the MD projection terminals that targeted the L4 of the dlPFC, in which the presence of granular cells was confirmed via cytoarchitectural studies by using the Nissl, Golgi, and vGlut2 stainings. Additionally, the L5/6 of the dlPFC projected back to the MD. These results suggest that the tree shrew has evolved a primate-like dlPFC which can serve as an alternative for studying cognition-related functions of the dlPFC.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012425">TIBA: A web application for the visual analysis of temporal occurrences, interactions, and transitions of animal behavior</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Nicolai Kraus, Michael Aichem, Karsten Klein, Etienne Lein, Alex Jordan, Falk Schreiber</p>

Data in behavioral research is often quantified with event-logging software, generating large data sets containing detailed information about subjects, recipients, and the duration of behaviors. Exploring and analyzing such large data sets can be challenging without tools to visualize behavioral interactions between individuals or transitions between behavioral states, yet software that can adequately visualize complex behavioral data sets is rare. TIBA (The Interactive Behavior Analyzer) is a web application for behavioral data visualization, which provides a series of interactive visualizations, including the temporal occurrences of behavioral events, the number and direction of interactions between individuals, the behavioral transitions and their respective transitional frequencies, as well as the visual and algorithmic comparison of the latter across data sets. It can therefore be applied to visualize behavior across individuals, species, or contexts.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002894">Why does invasive brain stimulation sometimes improve memory and sometimes impair it?</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Uma R. Mohan, Joshua Jacobs</p>

Invasive brain stimulation is used to treat individuals with episodic memory loss; however, studies to date report both enhancement and impairment of memory. This Essay discusses the sources of this variability, and suggests a path towards developing customized stimulation protocols for more consistent memory enhancement.
Author summary: Episodic memory is a critical aspect of everyday life that allows us to recall events, make decisions, and navigate our environments. It is estimated that 1 in 25 Americans suffer from episodic memory loss from Alzheimer ‘s disease, dementia, or following a traumatic brain injury. Clinicians and researchers have recently tried to help supplement or repair memory in individuals with episodic memory disorders using electrical brain stimulation. However, although there is evidence of invasive brain stimulation improving memory, studies also show that it can have variable effects, and sometimes cause memory impairment. In this Essay, we investigate these differences and try to explain this variability. We propose that key aspects of the memory network are heterogeneous across individuals, requiring customized stimulation protocols to create successful brain stimulation systems for memory enhancement. We provide a plan for applying brain stimulation while overcoming this variability by using closed-loop stimulation protocols that are customized according to a person’s own anatomical structure, functional connectivity, and memory-related electrophysiological patterns.

                Abstract Paragangliomas are rare neuroendocrine tumors, often associated with catecholamine secretion. These tumors can arise in various locations, with the majority found in the abdomen and pelvis, while a smaller percentage occurs in the thorax and head and neck regions. Diaphragmatic paragangliomas are exceedingly rare, with only two documented cases in the literature. This report details a case of a primary diaphragmatic paraganglioma in a 59-year-old patient presenting with unexplained weight loss, tremors, and diaphoresis. Imaging studies revealed a mass in the right lobe of the liver, later identified as a diaphragmatic paraganglioma during surgery. The case underscores the importance of preoperative catecholamine assessment and careful surgical planning due to the risks associated with tumor manipulation. Complete surgical resection, although challenging, remains the definitive treatment, especially in hypervascular tumors located near major vascular structures.

                Abstract Background Telemedicine has improved adherence to heart failure (HF) treatment, however it has not yet been tailored specifically to address HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Our objective is to undertake a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis of existing research studies that focus on telemedicine in HFrEF. Methods We conducted an extensive literature review encompassing trials which included outpatients with HFrEF who underwent telemedicine compared with usual care. We exclude any studies without ejection fraction data. Three bibliographic databases from PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Cochrane Library were utilized in our search from January 1999 to May 2023. The endpoints of interest included all-cause mortality, cardiovascular-related mortality, all-cause hospitalization, and HF-related hospitalization. The Cochrane risk-of-bias (RoB) and the risk of bias in non-randomized studies – of interventions (ROBINS-I) were used for non-randomized or observational studies. To quantitatively analyze the collective findings, a pooled odds ratio (OR) was computed for each outcome. Results Out of the initial pool of 4,947 articles, we narrowed down our analysis to 27 studies, Results showed that telemedicine significantly reduced all-cause mortality (OR: 0.65; 95% CI 0.54 – 0.78; p<0.00001), cardiovascular-related mortality (OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.58 – 0.80, p < 0.00001), and HF-related hospitalization based on number of events (OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.64 – 0.94, p = 0.009) as well as number of patients (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.69 – 0.87, p < 0.0001). Conclusion Telemedicine was shown significantly beneficial in decreasing mortality and hospitalization in HFrEF patients. Future research should focus on standardizing effective telemedicine practices due to the existing variability in methods and clinical situation of the patients.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95811">GDF2 and BMP10 coordinate liver cellular crosstalk to maintain liver health</a></h4>

              
                The liver is the largest solid organ in the body and is primarily composed of hepatocytes (HCs), endothelial cells (ECs), Kupffer cells (KCs), and hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), which spatially interact and cooperate with each other to maintain liver homeostasis. However, the complexity and molecular mechanisms underlying the crosstalk between these different cell types remain to be revealed. Here, we generated mice with conditional deletion of <i>Gdf2</i> (also known as <i>Bmp9</i>) and <i>Bmp10</i> in different liver cell types and demonstrated that HSCs were the major source of GDF2 and BMP10 in the liver. Using transgenic ALK1 (receptor for GDF2 and BMP10) reporter mice, we found that ALK1 is expressed on KCs and ECs other than HCs and HSCs, and GDF2 and BMP10 secreted by HSCs promote the differentiation of KCs and ECs and maintain their identity. <i>Pdgfb</i> expression was significantly upregulated in KCs and ECs after <i>Gdf2</i> and <i>Bmp10</i> deletion, ultimately leading to HSCs activation and liver fibrosis. ECs express several angiocrine factors, such as BMP2, BMP6, Wnt2, and Rspo3, to regulate HC iron metabolism and metabolic zonation. We found that these angiocrine factors were significantly decreased in ECs from <i>Gdf2/Bmp10</i><sup>HSC-KO</sup> mice, which further resulted in liver iron overload and disruption of HC zonation. In summary, we demonstrated that HSCs play a central role in mediating liver cell-cell crosstalk via the production of GDF2 and BMP10, highlighting the important role of intercellular interaction in organ development and homeostasis.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100083">One N-glycan regulates natural killer cell antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity and modulates Fc γ receptor IIIa/CD16a structure</a></h4>

              
                Both endogenous antibodies and a subset of antibody therapeutics engage Fc gamma receptor (FcγR)IIIa/CD16a to stimulate a protective immune response. Increasing the FcγRIIIa/IgG1 interaction improves the immune response and thus represents a strategy to improve therapeutic efficacy. FcγRIIIa is a heavily glycosylated receptor and glycan composition affects antibody-binding affinity. Though our laboratory previously demonstrated that natural killer (NK) cell N-glycan composition affected the potency of one key protective mechanism, antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), it was unclear if this effect was due to FcγRIIIa glycosylation. Furthermore, the structural mechanism linking glycan composition to affinity and cellular activation remained undescribed. To define the role of individual amino acid and N-glycan residues, we measured affinity using multiple FcγRIIIa glycoforms. We observed stepwise affinity increases with each glycan truncation step, with the most severely truncated glycoform displaying the highest affinity. Removing the N162 glycan demonstrated its predominant role in regulating antibody-binding affinity, in contrast to four other FcγRIIIa N-glycans. We next evaluated the impact of the N162 glycan on NK cell ADCC. NK cells expressing the FcγRIIIa V158 allotype exhibited increased ADCC following kifunensine treatment to limit N-glycan processing. Notably, an increase was not observed with cells expressing the FcγRIIIa V158 S164A variant that lacks N162 glycosylation, indicating that the N162 glycan is required for increased NK cell ADCC. To gain structural insight into the mechanisms of N162 regulation, we applied a novel protein isotope labeling approach in combination with solution NMR spectroscopy. FG loop residues proximal to the N162 glycosylation site showed large chemical shift perturbations following glycan truncation. These data support a model for the regulation of FcγRIIIa affinity and NK cell ADCC whereby composition of the N162 glycan stabilizes the FG loop and thus the antibody-binding site.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/84053">Emergence of planar cell polarity from the interplay of local interactions and global gradients</a></h4>

              
                Planar cell polarity (PCP) – tissue-scale alignment of the direction of asymmetric localization of proteins at the cell-cell interface – is essential for embryonic development and physiological functions. Abnormalities in PCP can result in developmental imperfections, including neural tube closure defects and misaligned hair follicles. Decoding the mechanisms responsible for PCP establishment and maintenance remains a fundamental open question. While the roles of various molecules – broadly classified into “global” and “local” modules – have been well-studied, their necessity and sufficiency in explaining PCP and connecting their perturbations to experimentally observed patterns have not been examined. Here, we develop a minimal model that captures the proposed features of PCP establishment – a global tissue-level gradient and local asymmetric distribution of protein complexes. The proposed model suggests that while polarity can emerge without a gradient, the gradient not only acts as a global cue but also increases the robustness of PCP against stochastic perturbations. We also recapitulated and quantified the experimentally observed features of swirling patterns and domineering non-autonomy, using only three free model parameters - the rate of protein binding to membrane, the concentration of PCP proteins, and the gradient steepness. We explain how self-stabilizing asymmetric protein localizations in the presence of tissue-level gradient can lead to robust PCP patterns and reveal minimal design principles for a polarized system.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104071">Navigating neurodiversity in higher education in India</a></h4>

              
                The concept of neurodiversity embraces the idea that there are many different ways of perceiving, thinking about and responding to the world around us. Yet, many countries – including India, with its vast population – still struggle with this concept. Societal perceptions and stereotypes surrounding neurodiversity, often fuelled by ignorance and misinformation, contribute to the marginalisation and exclusion experienced by neurodivergent individuals. This article discusses the challenges and opportunities that neurodivergent students in Indian higher education face, highlighting the urgent need for systemic change to co-create a more inclusive and equitable learning environment.

">Dopamine transmission in the anterior insula shapes the neural coding of anxiety</a></h4>

              
                The insular cortex (or insula), and particularly its anterior region, plays a crucial role in the control of emotional valence and anxiety (Etkin & Wager, 2007; Mendez-Ruette et al., 2019; Nicolas et al., 2023). While dopamine neurotransmission is known to modulate anxiety levels in humans (Hjorth et al., 2021) and animal models (de la Mora et al., 2010; Bananej et al., 2012; Zarrindast & Khakpai, 2015; DeGroot et al., 2020; Godino et al., 2023), its regulatory effects on the anterior insula remained unexplored. Here, using a multifaceted approach, we uncovered how dopamine shapes anterior insula function in anxiety and valence processing. First, we revealed a high density of neurons expressing type-1 dopamine receptors (D1) in the insula, particularly important in the anterior insula, and seven times greater than the density of neurons expressing type-2 dopamine receptors (D2). Few neurons co-expressed Drd1 and Drd2 mRNAs in the anterior and posterior insula, and the density of Drd1+ neurons in the anterior insula was twice higher among inhibitory neurons than excitatory neurons. Second, we found that pharmacological activation of D1 in the anterior insula is anxiogenic, suggesting a direct link between insular dopamine signaling and anxiety-related behaviors. Using fiber-photometry recordings, we identified that the amplitude of dopamine release onto D1+ neurons in the anterior insula while mice were in anxiogenic spaces or receiving mild foot shocks was both positively correlated with mice level of trait anxiety. Population dynamics and deep-learning analyses of anterior insula single-unit recordings uncovered distinct coding patterns of anxiety-provoking and safe environments, as well as tastants of positive and negative valence. Remarkably, systemic D1 activation, which heightens anxiety-related behaviors, dampens this coding dichotomy by increasing coding variability for protected spaces while increasing the coding reliability for anxiogenic spaces. Interestingly, the coding reliability of anxiogenic areas was positively correlated with mice level of trait anxiety, and we observed a trend towards a positive correlation between the coding reliability of a negative tastants, and mice level of anxiety. Altogether, our findings provide a new model of neural population coding of anxiety and emotional valence and unravel D1-dependent coding mechanisms in the mouse anterior insula.

">F-BAR proteins CIP4 and FBP17 function in cortical neuron radial migration and process outgrowth</a></h4>

              
                Neurite initiation from newly born neurons is a critical step in neuronal differentiation and migration. Neuronal migration in the developing cortex is accompanied by dynamic extension and retraction of neurites as neurons progress through bipolar and multipolar states. However, there is a relative lack of understanding regarding how the dynamic extension and retraction of neurites is regulated during neuronal migration. In recent work we have shown that CIP4, a member of the F-BAR family of membrane bending proteins, inhibits cortical neurite formation in culture, while family member FBP17 induces premature neurite outgrowth. These results beg the question of how CIP4 and FBP17 function in radial neuron migration and differentiation in vivo, including the timing and manner of neurite extension and retraction. Indeed, the regulation of neurite outgrowth is essential for the transitions between bipolar and multipolar states during radial migration. To examine the effects of modulating expression of CIP4 and FBP17 in vivo, we used in utero electroporation, in combination with our published Double UP technique, to compare knockdown or overexpression cells with control cells within the same mouse tissue of either sex. We show that either knockdown or overexpression of CIP4 and FBP17 results in the marked disruption of radial neuron migration by modulating neuronal morphology and neurite outgrowth, consistent with our findings in culture. Our results demonstrate that the F-BAR proteins CIP4 and FBP17 are essential for proper radial migration in the developing cortex and thus play a key role in cortical development.

">Auditory working memory mediates the relationship between musicianship and auditory stream segregation</a></h4>

              
                This study investigates the interactions between musicianship and two auditory cognitive mechanisms: auditory working memory (AWM) and stream segregation. The primary hypothesis is that AWM mediates the relationship between musical training and enhanced stream segregation capabilities. Two groups of listeners were tested, the first to establish the relationship between the two variables and the second to replicate the effect in an independent sample. Music history and behavioural data were collected from a total of 145 healthy young adults with normal binaural hearing. They performed a task that requires manipulation of tonal patterns in working memory, and the Music-in-Noise Task (MINT), which measures stream segregation abilities in a musical context. The MINT task expands measurements beyond traditional Speech-in-Noise (SIN) assessments by capturing auditory subskills (e.g., rhythm, visual, spatial, prediction) relevant to stream segregation. Our results showed that musical training is associated with enhanced AWM and MINT task performance, and that this effect is replicable across independent samples. Moreover, we found in both samples that the enhancement of stream segregation was largely mediated by AWM capacity. The results suggest that musical training and/or aptitude enhances music-in-noise perception by way of improved AWM capacity.

">Dissociable Default Mode Network Connectivity Patterns Underlie Distinct Symptoms in Psychosis Risk</a></h4>

              
                The Clinical High Risk (CHR) stage of psychosis is characterized by subthreshold symptoms of schizophrenia including negative symptoms, dysphoric mood, and functional deterioration. Hyperconnectivity of the default-mode network (DMN) has been observed in early schizophrenia, but the extent to which hyperconnectivity is present in CHR, and the extent to which such hyperconnectivity may underlie transdiagnostic symptoms, is not clear. As part of the Shanghai At-Risk for Psychosis (SHARP) program, resting-state fMRI data were collected from 251 young adults (158 CHR and 93 controls, M = 18.72, SD = 4.68, 129 male). We examined functional connectivity of the DMN by performing a whole-brain seed-to-voxel analysis with the MPFC as the seed. Symptom severity across a number of dimensions, including negative symptoms, positive symptoms, and affective symptoms were assessed. Compared to controls, CHRs exhibited significantly greater functional connectivity (p < 0.001 uncorrected) between the MPFC and 1) other DMN nodes including the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), and 2) auditory cortices (superior and middle temporal gyri, STG/MTG). Furthermore, these two patterns of hyperconnectivity were differentially associated with distinct symptom clusters. Within CHR, MPFC-PCC connectivity was significantly correlated with anxiety (r= 0.23, p=0.006), while MPFC-STG/MTG connectivity was significantly correlated with negative symptom severity (r=0.26, p=0.001). Secondary analyses using item-level symptom scores confirmed a similar dissociation. These results demonstrate that two dissociable patterns of DMN hyperconnectivity found in the CHR stage may underlie distinct dimensions of symptomatology.

">In Vivo Expression of an SCA27A-linked FGF14 Mutation Results in Haploinsufficiency and Impaired Firing of Cerebellar Purkinje Neurons</a></h4>

              
                Autosomal dominant mutations in FGF14, which encodes intracellular fibroblast growth factor 14 (iFGF14), underlie spinocerebellar ataxia type 27A (SCA27A), a devastating multisystem disorder resulting in progressive deficits in motor coordination and cognitive function. Mice lacking iFGF14 (Fgf14-/-) exhibit similar phenotypes, which have been linked to iFGF14-mediated modulation of the voltage-gated sodium (Nav) channels that control the high frequency repetitive firing of Purkinje neurons, the main output neurons of the cerebellar cortex. To investigate the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying SCA27A, we developed a targeted knock-in strategy to introduce the first point mutation identified in FGF14 into the mouse Fgf14 locus (Fgf14F145S), we determined the impact of in vivo expression of the mutant Fgf14F145S allele on the motor performance of adult animals and on the firing properties of mature Purkinje neurons in acute cerebellar slices. Electrophysiological experiments revealed that repetitive firing rates are attenuated in adult Fgf14F145S/+ cerebellar Purkinje neurons, attributed to a hyperpolarizing shift in the voltage-dependence of steady-state inactivation of Nav channels. More severe effects on firing properties and Nav channel inactivation were observed in homozygous Fgf14F145S/F145S Purkinje neurons. Interestingly, the electrophysiological phenotypes identified in adult Fgf14F145S/+ and Fgf14F145S/F145S cerebellar Purkinje neurons mirror those observed in heterozygous Fgf14+/- and homozygous Fgf14-/- Purkinje neurons, respectively, suggesting that the mutation results in the loss of the iFGF14 protein. Western blot analysis of lysates from adult heterozygous Fgf14F145S/+ and homozygous Fgf14F145S/F145S animals revealed reduced or undetectable, respectively, iFGF14 expression, supporting the hypothesis that the mutant allele results in loss of the iFGF14 protein and that haploinsufficiency underlies SCA27A neurological phenotypes.

">Principles and Operation of Virtual Brain Twins</a></h4>

              
                Current clinical methods often overlook individual variability by relying on population-wide trials, while mechanism-based trials remain underutilized in neuroscience due to the brain's complexity. A Virtual Brain Twin (VBT) is a personalized digital replica of an individual's brain, integrating structural and functional brain data into advanced computational models and inference algorithms. By bridging the gap between molecular mechanisms, whole-brain dynamics, and imaging data, VBTs enhance the understanding of (patho)physiological mechanisms, advancing insights into both healthy and disordered brain function. Central to VBT is the network modeling that couples mesoscopic representation of neuronal activity through white matter connectivity, enabling the simulation of brain dynamics at a network level. This transformative approach provides interpretable predictive capabilities, supporting clinicians in personalizing treatments and optimizing interventions. This manuscript outlines the key components of VBT development, covering the conceptual, mathematical, technical, and clinical aspects. We describe the stages of VBT construction--from anatomical coupling and modeling to simulation and Bayesian inference--and demonstrate their applications in resting-state, healthy aging, epilepsy, and multiple sclerosis. Finally, we discuss potential extensions to other neurological disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, and explore future applications in consciousness research and brain-computer interfaces, paving the way for advancements in personalized medicine and brain-machine integration.

                Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the accumulation of alpha-synuclein aggregates and progressive neuronal loss in the substantia nigra, with aging being its primary risk factor. The current available models to study PD mechanisms are largely relying on genetic mutations to recapitulate PD typical hallmarks, such as increased alpha-synuclein aggregation. However, they do not model the aging features associated with the disease. Microgravity, a condition experience by astronauts during space missions, is known to induce ageing-like modifications on both systemic and cellular physiology. To replicate the aging-related stress observed in PD patients, we exposed SH-SY5Y and 3K-SNCA mutant cell lines to simulated microgravity. Our findings revealed that simulated microgravity enhanced PD alterations, with a significant increase in misfolded and phosphorylated a-syn. This was accompanied by heightened oxidative stress, as evidenced by increased levels of reactive oxygen species, without a sufficient antioxidant response. These results suggest that simulated microgravity effectively mimics and accelerate the stress associated with aging in PD cell models, regardless of the presence of PD mutation. This study highlights the potential of simulated microgravity as a tool for investigating aging processes in neurodegenerative diseases.

                The human genome is replete with sequences derived from foreign elements including endogenous retrovirus-like proteins of unknown function. Here we show that UBQLN2, a ubiquitin-proteasome shuttle factor implicated in neurodegenerative diseases, is regulated by the linked actions of two retrovirus-like proteins, RTL8 and PEG10. RTL8 confers on UBQLN2 the ability to complex with and regulate PEG10. PEG10, a core component of stress granules, drives the recruitment of UBQLN2 to stress granules under various stress conditions, but can only do so when RTL8 is present. Changes in PEG10 levels further remodel the kinetics of stress granule disassembly and overall composition by incorporating select extracellular vesicle proteins. Within stress granules, PEG10 forms virus-like particles, underscoring the structural heterogeneity of this class of biomolecular condensates. Together, these results reveal an unexpected link between pathways of cellular proteostasis and endogenous retrovirus-like proteins.

">Microglial states determine lesion dynamics in multiple sclerosis</a></h4>

              
                Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neuroinflammatory disease of the central nervous system, characterized by demyelinating lesions 1. Lesion expansion contributes to progression and increased disability, while remyelination can recover neurological deficits. However, mechanisms driving lesion dynamics are largely unclear, hindering the development of effective therapeutics. We propose that distinct states of microglia are involved in lesion expansion and remyelination 2,3. Using Stereo-seq, an RNA capture based high-resolution spatial transcriptomics technology with single-cell resolution, on post-mortem human brain tissue, we compared mixed active/inactive lesions with lipid-laden foamy microglia with lesions containing ramified microglia. We identified distinct cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying lesion activity and remyelination, linked to microglia phenotypes and states. Lesions with foamy microglia were characterized by elevated immune activation, increased lymphocyte densities, upregulated immunoglobulin production (IGHG1, IGHG3), increased complement system activity, indication of iron dysregulation (FTL, FTH1), and increased demyelination. In contrast, lesions with ramified microglia exhibited gene expression profiles indicative of myelin stability (ABCA2, QKI) and neuro-axonal protection, fostering an environment conducive to repair and remyelination. Our findings highlight the role of microglial states in lesion expansion and repair in MS and offer promising avenues for the development of therapeutic approaches aimed at preventing MS disability progression.

">OLIGONUCLEOTIDES TARGETING THE SPLICE ACCEPTOR SITE DOWNSTREAM OF A MICROEXON AS AN INNOVATIVE THERAPY FOR AUTISM</a></h4>

              
                Background: Microexons are highly conserved and mostly neuronal-specific 3-27 nucleotide exons, enriched in genes linked to autism spectrum disorders (ASD). We have previously shown decreased inclusion of a neuronal specific 24 bp microexon (exon 4) of the translational regulator CPEB4 in brains of idiopathic ASD cases and that this leads to CPEB4 aggregation and subsequent under-expression of multiple high confidence ASD-risk genes. Furthermore, enhanced skipping of the CPEB4 microexon is also a novel etiological mechanism in schizophrenia (SCZ). Methods: In this work we designed and tested in neuroblastoma cells a series of splice switching antisense oligonucleotides (SSO) targeting the CPEB4 genomic region surrounding the microexon. Results: SSOs targeting candidate intronic regions near the microexon resulted in a decrease in microexon inclusion by blocking hnRNPC/PTPB1 binding, thus mimicking the isoform imbalance observed in ASD. However, based on the kinetic coupling model correlating transcriptional elongation with splicing regulation, we identified SSOs targeting downstream splice acceptor site of exon 5 that favoured microexon inclusion in a dose-dependent manner and resulted in increased protein levels of FOXP1 and AUTS2, two high-confidence ASD risk genes that are known targets of CPEB4 and whose protein levels are reduced in ASD. Conclusions: These results deepen our understanding of the complex splicing regulation of microexons and open new applications of SSOs to treat diseases such as ASD and SCZ that are characterized by altered microexon inclusion

">Proteomic associations with cognitive variability as measured by the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test in a healthy Thai population: A machine learning approach</a></h4>

              
                Cognitive function is the term for the higher-order mental processes in the brain that gather and process information, and it mirrors brain activity. Cognitive function in adults exhibits variability as a result of genetic and environmental components such as gender, age, and lifestyle factors to name a few. Interindividual variability in cognitive trajectories has been observed in community-dwelling older adults across different cognitive domains. Inter-individual variations in cognitive response to identical physical exercise are also evident. This study aimed to explore the association between serum protein expression profiles and one measure of cognitive variability, as measured by the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST), in a healthy Thai population using a machine learning approach. This study included 199 healthy Thai subjects, ranging in age from 20 to 70 years. Cognitive performance was measured by the WCST, and the WCST % Errors was used to define the lower and higher cognitive ability groups. Serum protein expression profiles were studied by the label-free proteomics method. The Linear Model for Microarray Data (LIMMA) approach in R was utilized to assess differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) between groups; subsequently bioinformatic analysis was performed for the functional enrichment and interaction network analysis of DEPs. A random forest model was built to classify subjects from the lower and higher cognitive ability groups. Cross-validation was used for model performance evaluation. The results showed that, there were 213 DEPs identified between the poor and higher cognition groups, with 155 DEPs being upregulated in the poor cognition group. Those DEPs were significantly enriched in the IL-17 signaling pathway. Furthermore, the analysis of protein-protein interaction (PPI) network revealed that most of the selected DEPs were linked to neuroinflammation-related cognitive impairment. The random forest model achieved a test classification accuracy of 81.5%. The model's sensitivity (true positive rate) was estimated to be 65%, and the specificity (true negative rate) was 85.9%. The AUC (0.79) indicates good binary classification performance. The results suggested that a measure of poor WCST performance in healthy Thai subjects might be attributed to higher levels of neuroinflammation.

">Fragmentation and Multithreading of Experience in the Default-Mode Network</a></h4>

              
                Reliance on internal predictive models of the world is central to many theories of human cognition. Yet it is unknown whether humans acquired multiple separate internal models, each evolved for a specific domain, or maintain a globally unified representation. Using fMRI, we show that during naturalistic experiences (during movie watching or narrative listening), adult participants selectively engage three topographically distinct midline prefrontal cortical regions, for different forms of predictions. Regions responded selectively to abstract spatial, referential (social), and temporal domains during model updates implying separate representations for each. Prediction-error-driven neural transitions in these regions, indicative of model updates, preceded subjective belief changes in a domain-specific manner. We find these parallel top-down predictions are unified and selectively integrated with sensory streams in the Precuneus, shaping participants' ongoing experience. Results generalized across sensory modalities and content, suggesting humans recruit abstract, modular predictive models for both vision and language. Our results highlight a key feature of human world modeling: fragmenting information into abstract domains before global integration.

	<p>Background: Humans exhibit a remarkable ability to synchronize their actions with external auditory stimuli through a process called auditory&amp;amp;ndash;motor or rhythmic entrainment. Positive effects of rhythmic entrainment have been demonstrated in adults with neurological movement disorders, yet the neural substrates supporting the transformation of auditory input into timed rhythmic motor outputs are not fully understood. We aimed to systematically map and synthesize the research on the neural correlates of auditory&amp;amp;ndash;motor entrainment and synchronization. Methods: Following the PRISMA-ScR guidelines for scoping reviews, a systematic search was conducted across four databases (MEDLINE, Embase, PsycInfo, and Scopus) for articles published between 2013 and 2023. Results: From an initial return of 1430 records, 22 studies met the inclusion criteria and were synthesized based on the neuroimaging modality. There is converging evidence that auditory&amp;amp;ndash;motor synchronization engages bilateral cortical and subcortical networks, including the supplementary motor area, premotor cortex, ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, basal ganglia, and cerebellum. Specifically, the supplementary motor area and the basal ganglia are essential for beat-based timing and internally guided rhythmic movements, while the cerebellum plays an important role in tracking and processing complex rhythmic patterns and synchronizing to the external beat. Self-paced tapping is associated with additional activations in the prefrontal cortex and the basal ganglia, suggesting that tapping in the absence of auditory cues requires more neural resources. Lastly, existing studies indicate that movement rate and the type of music further modulate the EEG power in the alpha and beta frequency bands. Conclusions: These findings are discussed in the context of clinical implications and rhythm-based therapies.</p>

	<p>Background: The neurosurgical treatment of thoracic disc herniation (TDH) has undergone dramatic changes over the years in terms of surgical approaches and intraoperative technological tools. There is still no unanimous consent on the criteria for approach selection, and the choice varies among Institutions. The aim of this study is to compare anterior and posterolateral approaches for TDH in terms of functional and surgical outcomes. Methods: A systematic literature review and meta-analysis according to PRISMA guidelines from EMBASE, PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Google Scholar online databases up to May 2024 incorporated studies that reported outcomes of thoracic disc herniation surgeries. Analyzed factors included major peri- and postoperative complications, intraoperative blood loss, hospital stay, neurological improvement, and complete hernia resection. Random-effect models were used to calculate pooled odds ratios and mean differences. Results: The posterolateral approach was associated with significantly lower rates of major medical (OR 0.14, 95% CI: 0.07 to 0.27) and surgical complications (OR 0.61, 95% CI: 0.38 to 0.99) compared to the anterior approach. Additionally, posterolateral approaches reduced intraoperative blood loss and shorter hospital stays. Posterolateral techniques were linked to higher odds of neurological improvement (OR 0.65, 95% CI: 0.43 to 0.99) and higher rates of complete hernia resection (OR 0.38, 95% CI: 0.21 to 0.71). Conclusions: Posterolateral approaches offer advantages in terms of safety, recovery, neurological improvement, and complete hernia resection. More extensive prospective studies are needed to confirm these findings and refine surgical strategies. Emerging technologies, such as the exoscope and 45&amp;amp;deg; endoscopy, may further enhance surgical outcomes.</p>

	<p>Background. Pain is known to negatively impact attention, but its influence on more complex cognitive abilities, such as logical reasoning, remains inconsistent. This may be due to compensatory mechanisms (e.g., investing additional resources), which might not be detectable at the behavioral level but can be observed through psychophysiological measures. In this study, we investigated whether experimentally induced pain affects logical reasoning and underlying attentional mechanisms, using both behavioral and electroencephalographic (EEG) measures. Methods. A total of 98 female participants were divided into a pain-free control group (N = 47) and a pain group (N = 51). Both groups completed the Advanced Progressive Matrices (APM) task, with EEG recordings capturing task-related power (TRP) changes in the upper alpha frequency band (10&amp;amp;ndash;12 Hz). We used a mixed design where all participants completed half of the APM task in a pain-free state (control condition); the second half was completed under pain induction by the pain group but not the pain-free group (experimental condition). Results. Logical reasoning performance, as measured by APM scores and response times, declined during the experimental condition, compared to the control condition for both groups, indicating that the second part of the APM was more difficult than the first part. However, no significant differences were found between the pain and pain-free groups, suggesting that pain did not impair cognitive performance at the behavioral level. In contrast, EEG measures revealed significant differences in upper alpha band power, particularly at fronto-central sites. In the pain group, the decrease in TRP during the experimental condition was significantly smaller compared to both the control condition and the pain-free group. Conclusions. Pain did not impair task performance at the behavioral level but reduced attentional resources, as reflected by changes in upper alpha band activity. This underscores the importance of incorporating more sensitive psychophysiological measures alongside behavioral measures to better understand the impact of pain on cognitive processes.</p>

	<p>Background: Focal mechanical vibration therapy has gained attention as a potential intervention to improve motor function while decreasing spasticity and pain in post-stroke patients. Despite promising results, there remains variability in study designs and outcomes, warranting a review of its clinical efficacy. Methods: A review was conducted to evaluate randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the effects of focal mechanical vibration therapy on post-stroke rehabilitation. Six studies were included, assessing outcomes such as spasticity reduction (using the Modified Ashworth Scale), motor function recovery (Wolf Motor Function Test, Fugl-Meyer Assessment), and pain management (Visual Analog Scale, Numerical Rating Scale). The quality of studies was evaluated using the PEDro scale and RoB-2 tool. An overview review was conducted to provide a comprehensive analysis of the topic. Results: The included studies demonstrated significant reductions in spasticity and improvements in motor function in most patients receiving focal vibration therapy. Notable improvements were observed when focal vibration was combined with other rehabilitation techniques, such as progressive modular rebalancing or robotic rehabilitation. Pain levels were also reduced in several studies. However, differences in vibration parameters (frequency, amplitude), small sample sizes, and short follow-up periods limit the generalizability of the findings. Conclusions: Focal mechanical vibration therapy appears to be an effective adjunct in post-stroke rehabilitation, particularly for reducing spasticity and improving motor function. Although short-term benefits are promising, further research is required to determine long-term efficacy and optimal treatment parameters. This review evaluates the effectiveness of focal vibration therapy in treating motor deficits and spasticity in post-stroke patients. The results suggest its potential to improve these conditions, though further studies with larger sample sizes are needed to confirm its long-term efficacy.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Around 20% of cancer patients will develop brain metastases (BrMs), with 15&amp;amp;ndash;25% occurring in the posterior fossa (PF). Although the effectiveness of systemic therapies is increasing, surgery followed by stereotactic radiosurgery (S+SRS) versus definitive SRS remains the mainstay of treatment. Given the space restrictions within the PF, patients with BrMs in this location are at higher risk of brainstem compression, hydrocephalus, herniation, coma, and death. However, the criteria for treating large PF BrMs with S+SRS versus definitive SRS remains unclear. Methods: We reviewed a prospective registry database (2009 to 2020) and identified 64 patients with large PF BrMs (&amp;amp;ge;4 cc) treated with SRS or S+SRS. Clinical and radiological parameters were analyzed. The two endpoints were overall survival (OS) and local failure (LF). Results: Patients in the S+SRS group were more highly symptomatic than patients in the SRS group. Gait imbalance and intracranial pressure symptoms were 97% and 80%, and 47% and 35% for S+SRS and SRS, respectively. Radiologically, there were significant differences in the mean volume of the lesions [6.7 cm3 in SRS vs. 29.8 cm3 in the S+SRS cohort, (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001)]; compression of the fourth ventricle [47% in SRS vs. 96% in S+SRS cohort, (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001)]; and hydrocephalus [0% in SRS vs. 29% in S+SRS cohort, (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001)]. Patients treated with S+SRS had a higher Graded Prognostic Assessment (GPA). LF was 12 and 17 months for SRS and S+SRS, respectively. Moreover, the S+SRS group had improved OS (12 vs. 26 months, p = 0.001). Conclusions: A higher proportion of patients treated with S+SRS presented with hydrocephalus, fourth-ventricle compression, and larger lesion volumes. SRS-alone patients had a lower KPS, a lower GPA, and more brain metastases. S+SRS correlated with improved OS, suggesting that it should be seriously considered for patients with large PF-BrM.</p>

	<p>Background: Glioblastoma (GBM) is an extremely aggressive brain tumor that has few available treatment options and a dismal prognosis. Recent research has highlighted the potential of extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) produced from mesenchymal stem cells as a potential treatment approach for GBM. MSC-EVs, including exosomes, microvesicles, and apoptotic bodies, perform a significant function in cellular communication and have shown promise in mediating anti-tumor effects. Purpose: This systematic literature review aims to consolidate current findings on the therapeutic potential of MSC-EVs in GBM treatment. Methods: A systematic search was conducted across major medical databases (PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus) up to September 2024 to identify studies investigating the use of MSC-derived EVs in GBM therapy. Keywords included &amp;amp;ldquo;extracellular vesicles&amp;amp;rdquo;, &amp;amp;ldquo;mesenchymal stem cells&amp;amp;rdquo;, &amp;amp;ldquo;targeted therapies&amp;amp;rdquo;, &amp;amp;ldquo;outcomes&amp;amp;rdquo;, &amp;amp;ldquo;adverse events&amp;amp;rdquo;, &amp;amp;ldquo;glioblastoma&amp;amp;rdquo;, and &amp;amp;ldquo;exosomes&amp;amp;rdquo;. Inclusion criteria were studies published in English involving GBM models both in vivo and in vitro and those reporting on therapeutic outcomes of MSC-EVs. Data were extracted and analyzed based on EV characteristics, mechanisms of action, and therapeutic efficacy. Results: The review identified several key studies demonstrating the anti-tumor effects of MSC-EVs in GBM models. A total of three studies were included, focusing on studies conducted between 2021 and 2023. The review included three studies that collectively enrolled a total of 18 patients. These studies were distributed across two years, with two trials published in 2023 (66.7%) and one in 2021 (33.3%). The mean age of the participants ranged from 37 to 57 years. In terms of gender distribution, males were the predominant group in all studies. Prior to receiving MSC-EV therapy, all patients had undergone standard treatments for GBM, including surgery, chemotherapy (CT), and, in some cases, radiation therapy (RT). In all three studies, the targeted treatment involved the administration of herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSVtk) gene therapy delivered to the tumor site, then 14 days of ganciclovir treatment. Outcomes across the studies indicated varying levels of efficacy for the MSC-EV-based therapy. The larger 2023 study reported fewer encouraging outcomes, with a median PFS of 11.0 months (95% CI: 8.3&amp;amp;ndash;13.7) and a median OS of 16.0 months (95% CI: 14.3&amp;amp;ndash;17.7). Adverse effects were reported in only one of the studies, the 2021 trial, where patients experienced mild-to-moderate side effects, including fever, headache, and cerebrospinal fluid leukocytosis. A total of 11 studies on preclinical trials, using in vitro and in vivo models, were included, covering publications from 2010 to 2024. The studies utilized MSCs as delivery systems for various therapeutic agents (interleukin 12, interleukin 7, doxorubicin, paclitaxel), reflecting the versatility of these cells in targeted cancer therapies. Conclusions: MSC-derived EVs represent a promising therapeutic approach for GBM, offering multiple mechanisms to inhibit tumor growth and enhance treatment efficacy. Their ability to deliver bioactive molecules and modulate the tumor microenvironment underscores their potential as a novel, cell-free therapeutic strategy. Future studies should optimize EV production and delivery methods and fully understand their long-term effects in clinical settings to harness their therapeutic potential in GBM treatment.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: The primary life-threatening complication in spinal&amp;amp;ndash;bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is ventilatory failure. The present study analyzes the longitudinal patterns of respiratory function tests over a follow-up of 11 years. Methods: We collected data from 9 genetically confirmed SBMA patients. Spirometric measurements [maximum inspiratory pressure (MIP), maximum expiratory pressure (MEP), and forced vital capacity (FVC)], serum biochemical indices and SBMA functional rating scale (SBMAFRS) were collected every 6 months for 11 years. An average time curve was utilized to assess the changes in both pulmonary tests and serum biochemical indices of the patients. One-way repeated-measures ANOVA was applied to assess statistical differences. The Spearman&amp;amp;rsquo;s rank correlation coefficient was utilized to evaluate the correlations between the respiratory function tests and serum biochemical and clinical indices. Results: A progressive decrease was observed in the respiratory function tests; the slope of the linear regression was significantly non-zero (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001) for all three time curves. A major decrease was observed for MEP (52%) and MIP (42%), while this was minor for FVC (25%). SBMAFRS score correlated with FVC (r = 0.27), MIP (r = 0.53) and MEP (r = 0.51). MIP and MEP correlated with creatine phosphokinase (r = 0.3, r = 0.25, respectively) and MIP with creatinine levels (r = 0.31). Conclusions: This longitudinal study shows a progressive decline of spirometric data throughout life in SBMA patients. The decline appears to be related to clinical deterioration and muscle denervation. Spirometric measures relative to maximal strength of the respiratory muscles (MIP and MEP) may have a better predictive value for pulmonary and muscular decline than FVC.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Although the embodiment of action-related language is well-established in the mother tongue (L1), less is known about the embodiment of a second language (L2) acquired later in life through formal instruction. We used the high temporal resolution of ERPs and topographic ERP analyses to compare embodiment in L1 and L2 and to investigate whether L1 and L2 are embodied with different strengths at different stages of linguistic processing. Methods: Subjects were presented with action-related and non-action-related verbs in a silent reading task. Subjects were late French&amp;amp;ndash;German and German&amp;amp;ndash;French bilinguals, respectively, and we could therefore collapse across languages to avoid common confounding between language (French and German) and order of acquisition (L1, L2). Results: We could show distinct effects of embodiment and language. Embodiment affected only the sensory and lexical stages of processing with increased strength and power of the N1 component for motor vs. non-motor verbs, and language affected the lexical and semantic stages of processing with stronger P2/N400 components for L2 than for L1. Non-motor verbs elicited a stronger P1 component in L2. Conclusions: Our results suggest that processing words in L2 requires more effortful processing. Importantly, L1 and L2 are not embodied differently, and embodiment affects early and similar stages of processing in L1 and L2, possibly integrating other process of action&amp;amp;ndash;language interaction</p>

	<p>Background: Revised El Escorial (rEEC) and Awaji criteria are currently used for diagnosing and categorizing amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). However, they are complex; their sensitivity is still not optimal for research purposes, and they present high inter-rater variability in clinical practice. To address these points, in 2019, a new set of diagnostic criteria was proposed, namely the Gold Coast criteria (GCC), characterized by a dichotomous diagnostic categorization, i.e., ALS or not ALS. Methods:&amp;amp;nbsp;In order to investigate the sensitivity, specificity, and clinical usefulness of GCC in a practical clinical setting, we retrospectively evaluated 131 patients diagnosed with ALS and 104 control subjects. ALSFRS-R score, electrophysiological tests, neuroradiological investigations, and CSF analysis were obtained. rEEC, Awaji, and GCC were applied at the first and last evaluations. Results: The sensitivity of GCC (93.1%; 96.1%) was greater than rEEC (71.8%; 87%) and Awaji criteria (77.8%; 89.3%) both at the first visit and last follow-up. The GCC&amp;amp;rsquo;s specificity (28.8%) is lower than that of the other two criteria (rEEC 45.2%; Awaji 43.3%). Conclusions: Our study suggests that in a real-world setting, the GCC are more sensitive and have substantially lower risk of false negative diagnoses than rEEC and Awaji criteria. Although rEEC had the highest specificity, they may delay the diagnosis. Systematically using the GCC could help to achieve an earlier diagnosis and quickly refer patients to the correct management. The low specificity of GCC is likely to not significantly impact patient recruitment in clinical trials; therefore, its use might allow a faster and earlier enrollment.</p>

                Background Underwater gliders are widely used in marine applications for monitoring purposes. These gliders must withstand hydrodynamic forces and maintain its body stability. The underwater environments are highly unpredictable, and small changes in the environment can lead to significant instability in underwater vehicles. Methods This study uses different numerical techniques to investigate the hydrodynamic characteristics of a torpedo-shaped glider. A symmetric torpedo-shaped glider model was created and analyzed using a licensed version of ANSYS 20.1 Fluent tool. The behavior of the torpedo glider under various flow conditions was examined such as variation of grid test, change of turbulent models, the variation in the inflow boundary conditions involves varying the velocity from 10.16 m/s to 15.16 m/s in 1m/s increment and from 10.16 m/s to 7.66 m/s in 0.5 m/s, also six different models were analyzed. Results Research was also attempted with different turbulent models and the Spalart-Allmara model was producing least validation error of 1.28 % with a primary focus on nose optimization. By varying the nose length, the study aimed to identify the best-suited nose geometry to minimize drag force. The nose lengths were varied to 0.205 m and 0.19m, resulting in validation errors of 2.81% and 1.16%, respectively, the results are clearly explained in the sub sequent sections of this article. Conclusion In conclusion, this study has evaluated various modifications and their impact on drag force reduction. The application of Spallart-Allmara model resulted in an improvement of 1.28%. Decrease in velocity lead to a significant reduction in the drag force, with an improvement of 37.3%. The nose optimization also contributed to drag force; a nose length of 0.205m yielded a 3.37% improvement. While a 0.19m nose length resulted in a 1.67% reduction. This study helps researchers in hydrodynamics by optimizing geometry for drag reduction.

                Background Exposure to second hand smoke (SHS) is a cause for heart disease and lung cancer among non- smokers. This cluster randomized control trial will evaluate the effectiveness of a tobacco smoke free home intervention in reducing exposure to second hand smoke. Protocol The intervention will be conducted among 30 clusters in urban and peri-urban areas of Kochi, India. The sample size is 300 per arm and 15 clusters to detect a minimal difference of 0.03ng/ml in cotinine levels between groups, at 80% power with a two-sided alfa of 0.05 considering variable cluster size. A baseline survey will be undertaken to identify smokers. Data related to smoking, indoor smoking, nicotine dependence, blood pressure (BP) of smokers, morbidity experienced, and lung volume Fev1/Fev6 of smokers will be measured. Urine cotinine, morbidity, BP of spouse and child will be assessed. Air quality monitors measuring PM2.5 will be placed in homes. Trained self-help group women and frontline health workers will implement the intervention. The intervention will consist of monthly home visits to educate the smoker on the harms of second-hand smoke using 3 A’s. The circle of influencers around the smoking men will also be contacted by the members of self-help group to provide support to stop smoking within homes and to quit. They will then organize two-three meetings of community leaders and heads of women’s groups, present data on harms of SHS, and explain the rationale for establishing smoke free homes in their community for a duration of six months. After the intervention a post assessment will be conducted and this will be repeated after six months. Ethics and dissemination The trial protocol was approved by the Institutional Ethical Committee of Amrita Institute of Medical Sciences. Results will be submitted to open access peer reviewed journals and shared with other stakeholders. Trial registration CTRI/2021/06/034478

                Background Artificial Intelligence (AI) has gained significant importance in dentistry, particularly in the field of cariology. The aim of this study was to perform a comprehensive bibliometric and altimetric analysis of research on the application of AI in cariology. Methods The Web of Science database was selected for the search conducted in February 2024, and selection and data extraction were performed independently by two researchers. Collaborative networks were generated using VOSviewer software, while altimetric data were analysed using Dimensions. The relationship between the bibliometric and altimetric data was examined using Spearman correlation. Results The search yielded 355 articles, of which 175 were included, published between 2008 and 2024. The most cited article reached 324 citations. Proof of concept was the most common study design (n=135), and the majority of studies used AI to detect and diagnose dental caries (n=122), with radiography being the most commonly used diagnostic method (n=99). The author with the highest number of articles was Schwendicke F (n=15), and the leading institution was Charite University, Berlin (n=13). China was the leading country in terms of research output (n=28) and Asia was the leading continent (n=54). The use of AI in cariology has been shown to improve diagnostic accuracy, reduce unnecessary interventions and optimise patient outcomes. Research interest in AI for cariology has increased significantly over the past five years, particularly in Asia. Conclusion These findings suggest significant clinical benefits and highlight the need for further research, particularly clinical trials, to validate these applications in practice.

                Background Triple-negative breast cancers are defined as tumors that lack the expression of the estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). It exhibits unique clinical and pathological features, is highly aggressive, and has a relatively poor prognosis and poor clinical outcome. Objective To identify a novel drug target protein against triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and potential phytochemical lead molecules against novel drug targets. Methods In this study, we retrieved TNBC samples from NGS and microarray datasets in the Gene Expression Omnibus database and employed a combination of differential gene expression studies, protein-protein interaction analysis, and network topology investigation to identify the target protein. Using molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation studies, followed by Molecular Mechanics with Generalised Born Surface Area solvation, a potential lead molecule was identified. Result The androgen receptor (AR) was found to be the target protein, and 2-hydroxynaringenin was discovered to be a possible phytochemical lead molecule to combat TNBC. Upregulated genes with LogFC > 1.25 and P-value < 0.05 from the TNBC gene expression dataset were given to STRING tool to investigate the network topology, and androgen receptor (AR) was found to be an appropriate hub gene in the protein-protein interaction network. Phytochemicals that inhibit breast cancer were retrieved from the PubChem database and virtual screening was performed using PyRx against the AR protein. Based on Lipinski’s rule and ADMET properties, molecular interaction studies were analyzed using induced fit docking, wherein significant binding interactions were displayed by 2-hydroxynaringenin. Molecular dynamics studies and MM-GBSA of AR and the 2-hydroxynaringenin complex revealed strong and stable interactions. Conclusion AR was identified as a hub protein that is highly expressed in breast cancer and 2-hydroxynaringenin efficacy of counter TNBC needs to be investigated further in vitro and in vivo.

                Abstract This article presents two patients who were diagnosed with autoimmune liver disease (autoimmune hepatitis and primary biliary cholangitis overlap syndrome) during anti-tuberculosis therapy, which is a rarely reported occurrence. It highlights the challenges in distinguishing drug-induced liver injury from authentic autoimmune liver disease. It also points out the importance of considering autoimmune liver disease as a potential diagnosis revealed by the setting of drug-induced liver injury.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1269/v1?src=rss">Prevalence and risk factors of Acinetobacter baumannii infection in Pediatric Intensive Care Unit at Thammasat University Hospital [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Acinetobacter baumannii infection (ABI) is a concerning worldwide public health matter with high levels of morbidity and mortality, particularly in critically ill patients. This study aims to assess the prevalence, risk factors, and clinical outcomes of ABI in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) setting. Methods A retrospective review was performed on pediatric patients admitted to the PICU over an 8-year period. Demographic characteristics, infection risk factors, and clinical outcomes were compared and analyzed between patients with ABI, determined to be the case group, and patients without ABI, determined to be the control group. The study also assessed the prevalence of ABI and its antimicrobial resistance profile. Results Between June 2014 and May 2022, a total of 82 cases of ABI were identified, resulting in an overall prevalence of 5.02%. After applying the exclusion criteria, 12 cases were excluded. Consequently, 70 ABI cases in total and 140 cases in a control group were included in the study. Multivariable conditional logistic regression analysis identified chronic respiratory disease, mechanical ventilation lasting 3 days or more, and the use of piperacillin/tazobactam within the last 2 weeks as independent risk factors associated with ABI. The rate of carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii (CRAB) was notably high at 93.22%. Cases of ABI were associated with higher mortality rates and prolonged hospitalization compared to non-ABI cases. Conclusion ABI remains a critical pathogen in the PICU. The presence of chronic respiratory disease, use of mechanical ventilation for at least three days, and a history of receiving piperacillin/tazobactam within the last 2 weeks are significant risk factors for ABI. The high level of antibiotic resistance, especially to carbapenems, highlights the emphasis for more stringent infection control practices and the creation of novel antimicrobial therapies.

Natural eye movements have primarily been studied for over-learned activities such as tea-making, sandwich-making, and hand-washing, which have a fixed sequence of associated actions. These studies demonstrate a sequential activation of low-level cognitive schemas facilitating task completion. However, whether these action schemas are activated in the same pattern when a task is novel and a sequence of actions must be planned in the moment is unclear. Here, we recorded gaze and body movements in a naturalistic task to study action-oriented gaze behavior. In a virtual environment, subjects moved objects on a life-size shelf to achieve a given order. To compel cognitive planning, we added complexity to the sorting tasks. Fixations aligned with the action onset showed gaze as tightly coupled with the action sequence, and task complexity moderately affected the proportion of fixations on the task-relevant regions. Our analysis revealed that gaze fixations were allocated to action-relevant targets just in time. Planning behavior predominantly corresponded to a greater visual search for task-relevant objects before the action onset. The results support the idea that natural behavior relies on the frugal use of working memory, and humans refrain from encoding objects in the environment to plan long-term actions. Instead, they prefer just-in-time planning by searching for action-relevant items at the moment, directing their body and hand to it, monitoring the action until it is terminated, and moving on to the following action.

                <p>by Pablo Capilla-Lasheras, Nina Bircher, Antony M. Brown, Xavier Harrison, Thomas Reed, Jennifer E. York, Dominic L. Cram, Christian Rutz, Lindsay Walker, Marc Naguib, Andrew J. Young</p>

Explaining the evolution of sex differences in cooperation remains a major challenge. Comparative studies highlight that offspring of the more philopatric sex tend to be more cooperative within their family groups than those of the more dispersive sex but we do not understand why. The leading “Philopatry hypothesis” proposes that the more philopatric sex cooperates more because their higher likelihood of natal breeding increases the direct fitness benefits of natal cooperation. However, the “Dispersal trade-off hypothesis” proposes that the more dispersive sex cooperates less because preparations for dispersal, such as extra-territorial prospecting, trade-off against natal cooperation. Here, we test both hypotheses in cooperatively breeding white-browed sparrow weavers (<i>Plocepasser mahali</i>), using a novel high-resolution automated radio-tracking method. First, we show that males are the more dispersive sex (a rare reversal of the typical avian sex difference in dispersal) and that, consistent with the predictions of both hypotheses, females contribute substantially more than males to cooperative care while within the natal group. However, the Philopatry hypothesis cannot readily explain this female-biased cooperation, as females are not more likely than males to breed within their natal group. Instead, our radio-tracking findings support the Dispersal trade-off hypothesis: males conduct pre-dispersal extra-territorial prospecting forays at higher rates than females and prospecting appears to trade-off against natal cooperation. Our findings thus highlight that the evolution of sex differences in cooperation could be widely attributable to trade-offs between cooperation and dispersal; a potentially general explanation that does not demand that cooperation yields direct fitness benefits.

Reynolds, Nicolas Torquet, Stefania Tolu, Sarah Mondoloni, Claire Nguyen, Amy Siriphanh, Robin Justo, Steve Didienne, Nicolas Debray, Cécile Viollet, Louis Raynaud, Yasmine Layadi, Coralie Fouquet, Bernadette Hannesse, Ana-Marta Capaz, Thomas Topilko, Nicolas Renier, Alexandre Mourot, Fabio Marti, Philippe Faure</p>

Individual animals differ in their traits and preferences, which shape their social interactions, survival, and susceptibility to disease, including addiction. Nicotine use is highly heterogenous and has been linked to the expression of personality traits. Although these relationships are well documented, we have limited understanding of the neurophysiological mechanisms that give rise to distinct behavioral profiles and their connection to nicotine susceptibility. To address this question, we conducted a study using a semi-natural and social environment called “Souris-City” to observe the long-term behavior of individual male mice. Souris-City provided both a communal living area and a separate test area where mice engaged in a reward-seeking task isolated from their peers. Mice developed individualistic reward-seeking strategies when choosing between water and sucrose in the test compartment, which, in turn, predicted how they adapted to the introduction of nicotine as a reinforcer. Moreover, the profiles mice developed while isolated in the test area correlated with their behavior within the social environment, linking decision-making strategies to the expression of behavioral traits. Neurophysiological markers of adaptability within the dopamine system were apparent upon nicotine challenge and were associated with specific profiles. Our findings suggest that environmental adaptations influence behavioral traits and sensitivity to nicotine by acting on dopaminergic reactivity in the face of nicotine exposure, potentially contributing to addiction susceptibility. These results further emphasize the importance of understanding interindividual variability in behavior to gain insight into the mechanisms of decision-making and addiction.

                Background Large research consortia can generate tremendous amounts of biological information, including high-resolution soil, vegetation, and climate data. While this knowledge stock holds invaluable potential for answering evolutionary and ecological questions, making these data exploitable for modelling remains a daunting task due to the many processing steps required for synthesis. This might result in many researchers to fall back to a handful of ready-to-use data sets, potentially at the expense of statistical power and scientific rigour. In a push for a more stringent approach, we introduce BEpipeR, an R pipeline that allows for the streamlined synthesis of plot-based Biodiversity Exploratories data. Methods BEpipeR was designed with flexibility and ease of use in mind. For instance, users simply choose between aggregating forest or grassland data, or a combination thereof, effectively allowing them to process any experimental plot data of this research consortium. Additionally, instead of coding, they parse most processing information in a user-friendly way through parameter sheets. Processing includes, among others, the creation of a spatially explicit plot-ID template, data wrangling, quality control, plot-wise aggregations, the calculation of derived metrics, data joining to a large composite data set, and metadata compilation. Results With BEpipeR, we provide a feature-rich pipeline that allows users to process Biodiversity Exploratories data in a flexible and reproducible way. This pipeline might serve as a starting point for aggregating the numerous data sets of this and potentially similar research consortia. In this way, it might be a primer for the construction of consortia-wide composite data sets that take full advantage of the consortia’s rich information stocks, ultimately boosting the visibility and participation of individual research projects. Conclusions The BEpipeR permits the user-friendly processing and plot-wise aggregation of Biodiversity Exploratories data. With modifications, this framework may be easily adopted by other research consortia.

                <p>Biallelic variants in phosphatidylinositol glycan anchor biosynthesis, class G (<i>PIGG</i>) cause hypotonia, intellectual disability, seizures, and cerebellar features. We present 8 patients from 6 families with a childhood-onset motor neuropathy and neurophysiology demonstrating variable motor conduction block and temporal dispersion. All individuals had a childhood onset tremor, 5 of 8 had cerebellar involvement, and 6 of 8 had childhood febrile seizures. All individuals have biallelic <i>PIGG</i> variants, including the previously reported pathogenic variant Trp505*, plus 6 novel variants.

                The rise of large, publicly shared functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data sets in human neuroscience has focused on acquiring either a few hours of data on many individuals (‘wide’ fMRI) or many hours of data on a few individuals (‘deep’ fMRI). In this opinion article, we highlight an emerging approach within deep fMRI, which we refer to as ‘intensive’ fMRI: one that strives for extensive sampling of cognitive phenomena to support computational modeling and detailed investigation of brain function at the single voxel level. We discuss the fundamental principles, trade-offs, and practical considerations of intensive fMRI. We also emphasize that intensive fMRI does not simply mean collecting more data: it requires careful design of experiments to enable a rich hypothesis space, optimizing data quality, and strategically curating public resources to maximize community impact.

                Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) are the brain’s gateway for vision, and their degeneration underlies several blinding diseases. RGCs interact with other neuronal cell types, microglia, and astrocytes in the retina and in the brain. Much knowledge has been gained about RGCs and glia from mice and other model organisms, often with the assumption that certain aspects of their biology may be conserved in humans. However, RGCs vary considerably between species, which could affect how they interact with their neuronal and glial partners. This review details which RGC and glial features are conserved between mice, humans, and primates, and which differ. We also discuss experimental approaches for studying human and primate RGCs. These strategies will help to bridge the gap between rodent and human RGC studies and increase study translatability to guide future therapeutic strategies.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90893">Increasing adult-born neurons protects mice from epilepsy</a></h4>

              
                Neurogenesis occurs in the adult brain in the hippocampal dentate gyrus, an area that contains neurons which are vulnerable to insults and injury, such as severe seizures. Previous studies showed that increasing adult neurogenesis reduced neuronal damage after these seizures. Because the damage typically is followed by chronic life-long seizures (epilepsy), we asked if increasing adult-born neurons would prevent epilepsy. Adult-born neurons were selectively increased by deleting the pro-apoptotic gene <i>Bax</i> from Nestin-expressing progenitors. Tamoxifen was administered at 6 weeks of age to conditionally delete <i>Bax</i> in Nestin-CreER<sup>T2</sup><i>Bax</i><sup>fl/fl</sup> mice. Six weeks after tamoxifen administration, severe seizures (status epilepticus; SE) were induced by injection of the convulsant pilocarpine. After mice developed epilepsy, seizure frequency was quantified for 3 weeks. Mice with increased adult-born neurons exhibited fewer chronic seizures. Postictal depression was reduced also. These results were primarily in female mice, possibly because they were more affected by <i>Bax</i> deletion than males, consistent with sex differences in <i>Bax</i>. The female mice with enhanced adult-born neurons also showed less neuronal loss of hilar mossy cells and hilar somatostatin-expressing neurons than wild-type females or males, which is notable because loss of these two hilar cell types is implicated in epileptogenesis. The results suggest that selective <i>Bax</i> deletion to increase adult-born neurons can reduce experimental epilepsy, and the effect shows a striking sex difference. The results are surprising in light of past studies showing that suppressing adult-born neurons can also reduce chronic seizures.

">A universal hippocampal memory code across animals and environments</a></h4>

              
                How learning is affected by context is a fundamental question of neuroscience, as the ability to generalize learning to different contexts is necessary for navigating the world. An example of swift contextual generalization is observed in conditioning tasks, where performance is quickly generalized from one context to another. A key question in identifying the neural substrate underlying this ability is how the hippocampus (HPC) represents task-related stimuli across different environments, given that HPC cells exhibit place-specific activity that changes across contexts (remapping). In this study, we used calcium imaging to monitor hippocampal neuron activity as animals performed a conditioning task across multiple spatial contexts. We investigated whether hippocampal cells, which encode both spatial locations (place cells) and task-related information, could maintain their task representation even when their spatial encoding remapped in a new spatial context. To assess the consistency of task representations, we used advanced dimensionality reduction techniques combined with machine learning to develop manifold representations of population level HPC activity. The results showed that task-related neural representations remained stable even as place cell representations of spatial context changed, thus demonstrating similar embedding geometries of neural representations of the task across different spatial contexts. Notably, these patterns were not only consistent within the same animal across different contexts but also significantly similar across different animals, suggesting a standardized neural encoding or 'neural syntax' in the hippocampus. These findings bridge a critical gap between memory and navigation research, revealing how the hippocampus maintains cognitive consistency across different spatial environments. These findings also suggest that hippocampal function is governed by a neural framework shared between animals, an observation that may have broad implications for understanding memory, learning, and related cognitive processes. Looking ahead, this work opens new avenues for exploring the fundamental principles underlying hippocampal encoding strategies.

">Dendritome Mapping Unveils Spatial Organization of Striatal D1/D2-Neuron Morphology</a></h4>

              
                Morphology is a cardinal feature of a neuron that mediates its functions, but profiling neuronal morphologies at scale remains a formidable challenge. Here we describe a generalizable pipeline for large-scale brainwide study of dendritic morphology of genetically-defined single neurons in the mouse brain. We generated a dataset of 3,762 3D-reconstructed and reference-atlas mapped striatal D1- and D2- medium spiny neurons (MSNs). Integrative morphometric analyses reveal distinct impacts of anatomical locations and D1/D2 genetic types on MSN morphologies. To analyze striatal regional features of MSN dendrites without prior anatomical constraints, we assigned MSNs to a lattice of cubic boxes in the reference brain atlas, and summarized morphometric representation ("eigen-morph") for each box and clustered boxes with shared morphometry. This analysis reveals 6 modules with characteristic dendritic features and spanning contiguous striatal territories, each receiving distinct corticostriatal inputs. Finally, we found aging confers robust dendritic length and branching defects in MSNs, while Huntington's disease (HD) mice exhibit selective length-related defects. Together, our study demonstrates a systems-biology approach to profile dendritic morphology of genetically-defined single-neurons; and defines novel striatal D1/D2-MSN morphological territories and aging- or HD-associated pathologies.

">Sex differences in deep brain shape and asymmetry persist across schizophrenia and healthy individuals: A meta-analysis from the ENIGMA-Schizophrenia Working Group</a></h4>

              
                Background: Schizophrenia (SCZ) is characterized by a disconnect from reality that manifests as various clinical and cognitive symptoms, and persistent neurobiological abnormalities. Sex-related differences in clinical presentation imply separate brain substrates. The present study characterized deep brain morphology using shape features to understand the independent effects of diagnosis and sex on the brain, and to determine whether the neurobiology of schizophrenia varies as a function of sex. Methods: This study analyzed multi-site archival data from 1,871 male (M) and 955 female (F) participants with SCZ, and 2,158 male and 1,877 female healthy controls (CON) from twenty-three cross-sectional samples from the ENIGMA Schizophrenia Workgroup. Harmonized shape analysis protocols were applied to each site's data for seven deep brain regions obtained from T1-weighted structural MRI scans. Effect sizes were calculated for the following main contrasts: 1) Sex effects; 2) Diagnosis-by-Sex interaction; 3) within sex tests of diagnosis; 4) within diagnosis tests of sex differences. Meta-regression models between brain structure and clinical variables were also computed separately in men and women with schizophrenia. Results: Mass univariate meta-analyses revealed more concave-than-convex shape differences in all regions for women relative to men, across diagnostic groups (d = -0.35 to 0.20, SE = 0.02 to 0.07); there were no significant diagnosis-by-sex interaction effects. Within men and women separately, we identified more-concave-than-convex shape differences for the hippocampus, amygdala, accumbens, and thalamus, with more-convex-than-concave differences in the putamen and pallidum in SCZ (d = -0.30 to 0.30, SE = 0.03 to 0.10). Within CON and SZ separately, we found more-concave-than-convex shape differences in the thalamus, pallidum, putamen, and amygdala among females compared to males, with mixed findings in the hippocampus and caudate (d = -0.30 to 0.20, SE = 0.03 to 0.09). Meta-regression models revealed similarly small, but significant relationships, with medication and positive symptoms in both SCZ-M and SCZ-F. Conclusions: Sex-specific variation is an overriding feature of deep brain shape regardless of disease status, underscoring persistent patterns of sex differences observed both within and across diagnostic categories, and highlighting the importance of including it as a critical variable in studies of neurobiology. Future work should continue to explore these dimensions independently to determine whether these patterns of brain morphology extend to other aspects of neurobiology in schizophrenia, potentially uncovering broader implications for diagnosis and treatment.

">Synaptic input architecture of visual cortical neurons revealed by large-scale synapse imaging without backpropagating action potentials</a></h4>

              
                How neurons integrate thousands of synaptic inputs to compute sharply tuned outputs is a critical question in sensory information processing. To answer this question, it is essential to record the location and activity of synaptic inputs in vivo. However, back-propagating action potential (BAP) calcium signals invade dendrites and spines, making accurate recording of spine responses difficult. In this study, we first developed a new method to record spine calcium responses without BAP signals. Using this method, we performed large-scale imaging of visually evoked spine activity from layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons and revealed three patterns of dendritic functional architectures of synaptic inputs: dendrites with clusters of spines of similar responses, dendrites with spines of diverse responses, and dendrites with spines where the majority of them show no visual response. Our model suggests that only a small fraction of spines on dendrites of clustered architectures are sufficient to generate sharply tuned output.

">Gene therapy for targeting a prenatally enriched potassium channel associated with severe childhood epilepsy and premature death</a></h4>

              
                Dysfunction of the sodium-activated potassium channel KNa1.1 (encoded by KCNT1) is associated with a severe condition characterized by frequent seizures (up to hundreds per day) and is often fatal by age three years. We defined the early developmental onset of KNa1.1 channels in prenatal and neonatal brain tissue, establishing a timeline for pathophysiology and a window for therapeutic intervention. Using patch-clamp electrophysiology, we observed age-dependent increases in KNa1.1 K+ conductance. In neurons derived from a child with a gain-of-function KCNT1 pathogenic variant (p.R474H), we detected abnormal excitability and action potential afterhyperpolarization kinetics. In a clinical trial, two individuals with the p.R474H variant showed dramatic reductions in seizure occurrence and severity with a first-in-human antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) RNA therapy. ASO-treated p.R474H neurons in vitro exhibited normalized spiking and burst properties. Finally, we demonstrated the feasibility of ASO knockdown of KNa1.1 in mid-gestation human neurons, suggesting potential for early therapeutic intervention before the onset of epileptic encephalopathy.

">Cortical norepinephrine-astrocyte signaling critically mediates learned behavior</a></h4>

              
                Updating behavior based on feedback from the environment is a crucial means by which organisms learn and develop optimal behavioral strategies. Norepinephrine (NE) release from the locus coeruleus (LC) has been shown to mediate learned behaviors such that in a task with graded stimulus uncertainty and performance, a high level of NE released after an unexpected outcome causes improvement in subsequent behavior. Yet, how the transient activity of LC-NE neurons, lasting tens of milliseconds, influences behavior several seconds later, is unclear. Here, we show that NE acts directly on cortical astrocytes via Adra1a adrenergic receptors to elicit sustained increases in intracellular calcium. Chemogenetic blockade of astrocytic calcium elevation prevents the improvement in behavioral performance. NE-activated calcium invokes purinergic pathways in cortical astrocytes that signal to neurons; pathway-specific astrocyte gene expression is altered in mice trained on the task, and blocking neuronal adenosine-sensitive A1 receptors also prevents post-reinforcement behavioral gain. Finally, blocking either astrocyte calcium dynamics or A1 receptors alters encoding of the task in prefrontal cortex neurons, preventing the post-reinforcement change in discriminability of rewarded and unrewarded stimuli underlying behavioral improvement. Together, these data demonstrate that astrocytes, rather than indirectly reflecting neuronal drive, play a direct, instrumental role in representing task-relevant information and signaling to neurons to mediate a fundamental component of learning in the brain.

">GABAergic neurons can facilitate the propagation of cortical spreading depolarization: experiments in mouse neocortical slices and a novel neural field computational model</a></h4>

              
                Cortical spreading depolarization (CSD) is a wave of depolarization with local onset and extended propagation implicated in several pathological conditions. Its mechanisms have been extensively investigated, including our recent studies showing with experimental and computational approaches that the hyperactivity of GABAergic neurons can initiate migraine-related CSD because of spiking-generated extracellular potassium (K+) build-up. However, less is known about the role played by GABAergic neurons in CSD propagation. Here we studied mechanisms of CSD propagation, focusing on the role of GABAergic neurons, with experiments performed in mouse brain slices and with a new spatially extended neural field computational model. Experimentally, we induced CSD by applying brief puffs of potassium chloride (KCl) in somatosensory cortex slices from wild type and VGAT-ChR2-tdtomato mice, which specifically express the excitatory opsin channelrhodopsin (ChR2) in GABAergic neurons. We evaluated the role of GABAergic neurons in CSD propagation by modulating their activity with optogenetic illumination and their synaptic connections with pharmacological tools. We have developed the computational model to obtain realistic simulations of both initiation and propagation of CSD. It includes large populations of interconnected excitatory and inhibitory neurons, as well as the effect of extracellular ion concentrations on their features. We found that the decrease of the synaptic activity of GABAergic neurons can enhance CSD propagation, because of the reduction of the inhibitory synaptic weight, whereas their spiking activity can enhance CSD propagation because of extracellular K+ upload. However, differently from for CSD initiation, the latter effect is normally hidden by the action of GABAergic synaptic transmission. A reduction of GABAergic synaptic transmission, which can be observed in pathological states, can reveal the potentiating effect of the K+ upload induced by GABAergic activation. The neural field model that we implemented can generate accurate simulations of CSD, providing testable hypotheses on mechanisms, and can also be used for modeling other (patho)-physiological activities of neuronal networks.

">Impulsive adolescents exhibit inefficient processing and a low decision threshold when decoding facial expressions of emotions</a></h4>

              
                Background: Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a debilitating psychiatric illness whose symptoms frequently emerge during adolescence. Initial studies in adults suggest that the interpersonal difficulties common in BPD may emerge from disrupted processing of social and emotional stimuli. Less is known about these processes in adolescents with BPD symptoms, despite substantial changes in socioemotional processing during this developmental period. Methods: 86 adolescents and young adults with and without BPD symptoms completed an emotional interference task involving the identification of a facial emotion expression in the presence of a conflict or congruent emotion word. We used hierarchical drift diffusion modeling to index speed of processing and decision boundary. Using Bayesian multilevel regression, we characterized age-related differences in facial emotion processing. We then examined whether BPD symptom dimensions were associated with facial emotion processing on this task. To determine the specificity of our effects, we analyzed behavioral data from a corresponding nonemotional interference task. Results: Impulsivity, but not negative affectivity or interpersonal dysfunction, predicted inefficient processing when presented with conflicting negative emotional stimuli. Across both tasks, impulsivity in adolescents was further associated with a lower decision boundary. Impulsive adolescents were especially likely to make fast, but inaccurate decisions about another person's emotional state. Conclusion: Impulsive adolescents with BPD symptoms are prone to making errors when appraising facial expressions of emotions, which may potentiate or worsen interpersonal conflicts. Our findings highlight the role of lower-level social cognitive processes in interpersonal difficulties among vulnerable youth during a sensitive developmental window.

">Enriched environment requires remodeling of hippocampal perineuronal nets to trigger memory improvement in Alzheimer's mouse model</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major neurodegenerative disorder influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. Engaging in mentally stimulating activities is believed to reduce cognitive decline by establishing a cognitive reserve, though the underlying neurobiological mechanisms remain elusive. In this study, we explore the role of parvalbumin-expressing inhibitory neurons (PV) and their associated perineuronal nets (PNN) in cognitive deficits observed in AD. Using the Tg2576 mouse model, we demonstrate that 10 days of exposure to an enriched environment (EE) significantly restores spatial and social memory, accompanied by an increase in PV and PV/PNN cell populations in the hippocampus. Notably, preventing PV/PNN remodeling in the CA1 region during EE abolishes the spatial memory improvements, whereas localized neuregulin-1 (NRG1) injections induce PV/PNN remodeling and restore memory function. These findings suggest that hippocampal PV/PNN remodeling is essential for the cognitive benefits of EE in AD, highlighting this neuronal population as a critical substrate for cognitive reserve. This study provides new insights into the mechanisms by which environmental factors may mitigate cognitive decline in AD, offering potential avenues for therapeutic interventions.

">Equivalence between representational similarity analysis, centered kernel alignment, and canonical correlations analysis</a></h4>

              
                Centered kernel alignment (CKA) and representational similarity analysis (RSA) of dissimilarity matrices are two popular methods for comparing neural systems in terms of representational geometry. Although they follow a conceptually similar approach, typical implementations of CKA and RSA tend to result in numerically different outcomes. Here, I show that these two approaches are largely equivalent once one incorporates a mean-centering step into RSA. This equivalence holds for both linear and nonlinear variants of these methods. These connections are simple to derive, but appear to have been thus far overlooked in the context of comparing neural representations. By unifying these measures, this paper hopes to simplify a complex and fragmented literature on this subject.

">Variable Presence of an Evolutionarily New Brain Structure is Related to Trait Impulsivity</a></h4>

              
                Background: Impulsivity is a multidimensional construct reflecting poor constraint over one's behaviors. Clinical psychology research identifies separable impulsivity dimensions that are each unique transdiagnostic indicators for psychopathology. Yet, despite this apparent clinical importance, the shared and unique neuroanatomical correlates of these factors remain largely unknown. Concomitantly, neuroimaging research identifies variably present human brain structures implicated in cognition and disorder: the folds (sulci) of the cerebral cortex located in the latest developing and most evolutionarily expanded hominoid-specific association cortices. Methods: We tethered these two fields to test whether variability in one such structure in anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), the paracingulate sulcus (PCGS), was related to individual differences in trait impulsivity. 120 adult participants with internalizing or externalizing psychopathology completed a magnetic resonance imaging scan and the Three-Factor Impulsivity Index. Using precision imaging techniques, we manually identified the PCGS, when present, and acquired quantitative folding metrics (PCGS length and ACC local gyrification index). Results: Neuroanatomical-behavioral analyses revealed that participants with leftward or symmetrical PCGS patterns had greater severity of Lack of Follow Through (LFT), which captures inattention and lack of perseverance, than those with rightward asymmetry. Neuroanatomical-functional analyses identified that the PCGS co-localized with a focal locus found in a neuroimaging meta-analysis on a feature underlying LFT. Both quantitative folding metrics did not relate to any impulsivity dimension. Conclusions: This study advances understanding of the neuroanatomical correlates of impulsivity and establishes the notion that the topographical organization of distinct, hominoid-specific cortical expanses underlie separable impulsivity dimensions with robust, transdiagnostic implications for psychopathology.

">The language network ages well: Preserved selectivity, lateralization, and within-network functional synchronization in older brains</a></h4>

              
                Healthy aging is associated with structural and functional brain changes. However, cognitive abilities differ from one another in how they change with age: whereas executive functions, like working memory, show age-related decline, aspects of linguistic processing remain relatively preserved (Hartshorne et al., 2015). This heterogeneity of the cognitive-behavioral landscape in aging predicts differences among brain networks in whether and how they should change with age. To evaluate this prediction, we used individual-subject fMRI analyses ('precision fMRI') to examine the language-selective network (Fedorenko et al., 2024) and the Multiple Demand (MD) network, which supports executive functions (Duncan et al., 2020), in older adults (n=77) relative to young controls (n=470). In line with past claims, relative to young adults, the MD network of older adults shows weaker and less spatially extensive activations during an executive function task and reduced within-network functional synchronization. However, in stark contrast to the MD network, we find remarkable preservation of the language network in older adults. Their language network responds to language as strongly and selectively as in younger adults, and is similarly lateralized and internally synchronized. In other words, the language network of older adults looks indistinguishable from that of younger adults. Our findings align with behavioral preservation of language skills in aging and suggest that some networks remain young-like, at least on standard measures of function and connectivity.

">Psilocybin Reduces Grooming in the SAPAP3 Knockout Mouse Model of Compulsive Behaviour</a></h4>

              
                Psilocybin is a serotonergic psychedelic compound which shows promise for treating compulsive behaviours. This is particularly pertinent as compulsive disorders require research into new pharmacological treatment options as the current frontline treatments such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, require chronic administration, have significant side effects, and leave almost half of the clinical population refractory to treatment. In this study, we investigated psilocybin administration in male and female SAPAP3 knockout (KO) mice, a well-validated mouse model of obsessive compulsive and related disorders. We assessed the effects of acute psilocybin (1 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) administration on head twitch and locomotor behaviour as well as anxiety- and compulsive-like behaviours at multiple time-points (1-, 3- and 8-days post-injection). While psilocybin did not have any effect on anxiety-like behaviours, we revealed for the first time that acute psilocybin administration led to enduring reductions in compulsive behaviour in male SAPAP3 KO mice and reduced grooming behaviour in female WT and SAPAP3 KO mice. We also found that psilocybin increased locomotion in wild-type littermates but not in SAPAP3 KO mice, suggesting in vivo serotonergic dysfunctions in KO animals. On the other hand, the typical head-twitch response following acute psilocybin (confirming its hallucinogenic-like effect at this dose) was observed in both genotypes. Our novel findings suggest that acute psilocybin may have potential to reduce compulsive-like behaviours (up to 1 week after a single injection). Our study can inform future research directions as well as supporting the utility of psilocybin as a novel treatment option for compulsive disorders.

                -Synuclein (-syn) strains can serve as discriminators between Parkinson's disease (PD) from other -synucleinopathies. The relationship between -syn strain dynamics and clinical performance as patients transition from normal cognition (NC) to cognitive impairment (CI) is not known. Here, we show that the biophysical properties and neurotoxicity of -syn strains change as PD cognitive status transitions from NC to mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) and dementia (PD-D). Both cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses reveal distinct -syn strains in PD patients correlating to their level of cognitive impairment. This study presents evidence that individuals with PD have different -syn strains that change in accordance with their cognitive status and highlights the potential of -syn strain dynamics to guide future diagnosis, management, and stratification of PD patients.

">The computational bottleneck of basal ganglia output (and what to do about it)</a></h4>

              
                What the basal ganglia do is an oft-asked question; answers range from the selection of actions to the specification of movement to the estimation of time. Here I argue that how the basal ganglia do what they do is a less-asked but equally important question. I show that the output regions of the basal ganglia create a stringent computational bottleneck, both structurally, because they have far fewer neurons than do their target regions, and dynamically, because of their tonic, inhibitory output. My proposed solution to this bottleneck is that the activity of an output neuron is setting the weight of a basis function, a function defined by that neuron's synaptic contacts. I illustrate how this may work in practice, allowing basal ganglia output to shift cortical dynamics and control eye movements via the superior colliculus. This solution can account for troubling issues in our understanding of the basal ganglia: why we see output neurons increasing their activity during behaviour, rather than only decreasing as predicted by theories based on disinhibition, and why the output of the basal ganglia seems to have so many codes squashed into such a tiny region of the brain.

	<p>Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD), the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder and the leading cause of dementia worldwide, profoundly impacts health and quality of life. While cognitive impairments&amp;amp;mdash;such as memory loss, attention deficits, and disorientation&amp;amp;mdash;predominate in AD, motor symptoms, though common, remain underexplored. These motor symptoms, including gait disturbances, reduced cardiorespiratory fitness, muscle weakness, sarcopenia, and impaired balance, are often associated with advanced stages of AD and contribute to increased mortality. Emerging evidence, however, suggests that motor symptoms may be present in earlier stages and can serve as predictive markers for AD in older adults. Despite a limited understanding of the underlying mechanisms driving these motor symptoms, several key pathways have been identified, offering avenues for further investigation. This review provides an in-depth analysis of motor symptoms in AD, discussing its progression, potential mechanisms, and therapeutic strategies. Addressing motor symptoms alongside cognitive decline may enhance patient functionality, improve quality of life, and support more comprehensive disease management strategies.</p>

	<p>Background. This study aims to determine if Riluzole usage can change the function and excitability of motor neurons. Methods. The clinical data and indices of motor neuron excitability were assessed using high-density surface EMG parameters from 80 ALS participants. The persistent inward current was assessed using the discharge rate from paired motor units obtained from the tibialis anterior muscle. This enabled the discharge rate at recruitment, peak discharge rates and the hysteresis of the recruitment&amp;amp;ndash;derecruitment frequencies (also known as delta F) to be calculated. Limbs were classified according to their strength. Results. No differences in these motor neuron discharge properties were found according to whether Riluzole was used. Conclusions. The possible interpretations of this finding are discussed.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is associated with several coexisting diseases or comorbidities, including inflammatory and metabolic disorders. In fact, ASD symptoms may be associated with immune system dysfunction. However, studies investigating the peripheral blood levels of immune cells are lacking and have provided mixed findings. In this study, we evaluated the relationship between the intensity level of ASD symptoms and the inflammatory and metabolic profiles in 154 children and adolescents (2&amp;amp;ndash;17 years). Methods: Bayesian multilevel models were used to examine the relationship between their symptom intensities and inflammatory/metabolic profiles. Results: Heavier children had higher values for triglyceride and insulin levels. Children with a level 3 of ASD intensity had higher free fatty acids levels. However, when adjusting for ASD intensity, gender, medication use, or weight status, older children appeared to have higher values of triglycerides, insulin levels, and free fatty acids. Conclusions: We concluded that as Brazilian children with ASD became older, they had a higher risk for insulin resistance.</p>

                <p>Injuries to the central nervous system (CNS) can cause severe neurological deficits. Axonal regrowth is a fundamental process for the reconstruction of compensatory neuronal networks after injury; however, it is extremely limited in the adult mammalian CNS. In this study, we conducted a loss-of-function genetic screen in cortical neurons, combined with a Web resource-based phenotypic screen, and identified synaptotagmin 4 (Syt4) as a novel regulator of axon elongation. Silencing Syt4 in primary cultured cortical neurons inhibits neurite elongation, with changes in gene expression involved in signaling pathways related to neuronal development. In a spinal cord injury model, inhibition of Syt4 expression in cortical neurons prevented axonal sprouting of the corticospinal tract, as well as neurological recovery after injury. These results provide a novel therapeutic approach to CNS injury by modulating Syt4 function.</p>

                <p>Neuregulin1 (Nrg1) signaling is critical for neuronal development and function from fate specification to synaptic plasticity. Type III Nrg1 is a synaptic protein which engages in bidirectional signaling with its receptor ErbB4. Forward signaling engages ErbB4 phosphorylation, whereas back signaling engages two known mechanisms: (1) local axonal PI3K-AKT signaling and (2) cleavage by -secretase resulting in cytosolic release of the intracellular domain (ICD), which can traffic to the nucleus (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B3">Bao et al., 2003</cross-ref>; <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B21">Hancock et al., 2008</cross-ref>). To dissect the contribution of these alternate signaling strategies to neuronal development, we generated a transgenic mouse with a missense mutation (V<SUB>321</SUB>L) in the Nrg1 transmembrane domain that disrupts nuclear back signaling with minimal effects on forward signaling or local back signaling and was previously found to be associated with psychosis (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B45">Walss-Bass et al., 2006</cross-ref>). We combined RNA sequencing, retroviral fate mapping of neural stem cells, behavioral analyses, and various network analyses of transcriptomic data to investigate the effect of disrupting Nrg1 nuclear back signaling in the dentate gyrus (DG) of male and female mice. The V<SUB>321</SUB>L mutation impairs nuclear translocation of the Nrg1 ICD and alters gene expression in the DG. V<SUB>321</SUB>L mice show reduced stem cell proliferation, altered cell cycle dynamics, fate specification defects, and dendritic dysmorphogenesis. Orthologs of known schizophrenia (SCZ)-susceptibility genes were dysregulated in the V<SUB>321</SUB>L DG. These genes coordinated a larger network with other dysregulated genes. Weighted gene correlation network analysis and protein interaction network analyses revealed striking similarity between DG transcriptomes of V<SUB>321</SUB>L mouse and humans with SCZ.</p>

                <p>Large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have associated intronic variants in <I>PDE4B</I>, encoding cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase-4B (PDE4B), with increased risk for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), as well as schizophrenia and substance use disorders that are often comorbid with it. However, the pathophysiological mechanisms of genetic risk involving PDE4B are poorly understood. To examine the effects of PDE4B variation on phenotypes with translational relevance to psychiatric disorders, we focused on PDE4B missense variant M220T, which is present in the human genome as rare coding variant rs775201287. When expressed in HEK-293 cells, PDE4B1-M220T exhibited an attenuated response to a forskolin-elicited increase in the intracellular cAMP concentration. In behavioral tests, homozygous <I>Pde4b</I><sup>M220T</sup> male mice with a C57BL/6JJcl background exhibited increased reactivity to novel environments, startle hyperreactivity, prepulse inhibition deficits, altered cued fear conditioning, and enhanced spatial memory, accompanied by an increase in cAMP signaling pathway-regulated expression of BDNF in the hippocampus. In response to a traumatic event (10 tone&ndash;shock pairings), neuronal activity was decreased in the cortex but enhanced in the amygdala and hippocampus of <I>Pde4b</I><sup>M220T</sup> mice. At 24&nbsp;h post-trauma, <I>Pde4b</I><sup>M220T</sup> mice exhibited increased startle hyperreactivity and decreased plasma corticosterone levels, similar to phenotypes exhibited by PTSD patients. Trauma-exposed <I>Pde4b</I><sup>M220T</sup> mice also exhibited a slower decay in freezing at 15 and 30&nbsp;d post-trauma, demonstrating enhanced persistence of traumatic memories, similar to that exhibited by PTSD patients. These findings provide substantive mouse model evidence linking PDE4B variation to PTSD-relevant phenotypes and thus highlight how genetic variation of PDE4B may contribute to PTSD risk.</p>

                <p>Neural decoding is a tool for understanding how activities from a population of neurons inside the brain relate to the outside world and for engineering applications such as brain&ndash;machine interfaces. However, neural decoding studies mainly focused on different decoding algorithms rather than different neuron types which could use different coding strategies. In this study, we used two-photon calcium imaging to assess three auditory spatial decoders (space map, opponent channel, and population pattern) in excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the dorsal inferior colliculus of male and female mice. Our findings revealed a clustering of excitatory neurons that prefer similar interaural level difference (ILD), the primary spatial cues in mice, while inhibitory neurons showed random local ILD organization. We found that inhibitory neurons displayed lower decoding variability under the opponent channel decoder, while excitatory neurons achieved higher decoding accuracy under the space map and population pattern decoders. Further analysis revealed that the inhibitory neurons&rsquo; preference for ILD off the midline and the excitatory neurons&rsquo; heterogeneous ILD tuning account for their decoding differences. Additionally, we discovered a sharper ILD tuning in the inhibitory neurons. Our computational model, linking this to increased presynaptic inhibitory inputs, was corroborated using monaural and binaural stimuli. Overall, this study provides experimental and computational insight into how excitatory and inhibitory neurons uniquely contribute to the coding of sound locations.</p>

                <p>Neural circuits supporting innate behaviors, such as feeding, exploration, and social interaction, intermingle in the lateral hypothalamus (LH). Although previous studies have shown that individual LH neurons change their firing relative to the baseline during one or more behaviors, the firing rate dynamics of LH populations within behavioral episodes and the coordination of behavior-related LH populations remain largely unknown. Here, using unsupervised graph-based clustering of LH neurons firing rate dynamics in freely behaving male mice, we identified distinct populations of cells whose activity corresponds to feeding, specific times during feeding bouts, or other innate behaviors&mdash;social interaction and novel object exploration. Feeding-related cells fired together with a higher probability during slow and fast gamma oscillations (30&ndash;60 and 60&ndash;90&nbsp;Hz) than during nonrhythmic epochs. In contrast, the cofiring of neurons signaling other behaviors than feeding was overall similar between slow gamma and nonrhythmic epochs but increased during fast gamma oscillations. These results reveal a neural organization of ethological hierarchies in the LH and point to behavior-specific motivational systems, the dysfunction of which may contribute to mental disorders.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/43/e0621242024?rss=1">Coupling of Slow Oscillations in the Prefrontal and Motor Cortex Predicts Onset of Spindle Trains and Persistent Memory Reactivations</a></h4>

              
                <p>Sleep is known to drive the consolidation of motor memories. During nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, the close temporal proximity between slow oscillations (SOs) and spindles ("nesting" of SO-spindles) is known to be essential for consolidation, likely because it is closely associated with the reactivation of awake task activity. Interestingly, recent work has found that spindles can occur in temporal clusters or "trains." However, it remains unclear how spindle trains are related to the nesting phenomenon. Here, we hypothesized that spindle trains are more likely when SOs co-occur in the prefrontal and motor cortex. We conducted simultaneous neural recordings in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and primary motor cortex (M1) of male rats training on the reach-to-grasp motor task. We found that intracortically recorded M1 spindles are organized into distinct temporal clusters. Notably, the occurrence of temporally precise SOs between mPFC and M1 was a strong predictor of spindle trains. Moreover, reactivation of awake task patterns is much more persistent during spindle trains in comparison with that during isolated spindles. Together, our work suggests that the precise coupling of SOs across mPFC and M1 may be a potential driver of spindle trains and persistent reactivation of motor memory during NREM sleep.</p>

                <p>We used virus-mediated anterograde and retrograde tracing, optogenetic modulation, immunostaining, in situ hybridization, and patch-clamp recordings in acute brain slices to study the release mechanism and &mu;-opioid modulation of the dual glutamatergic/GABAergic inputs from the ventral tegmental area and supramammillary nucleus to the granule cells of the dorsal hippocampus of male and female mice. In keeping with previous reports showing that the two transmitters are released by separate active zones within the same terminals, we found that the short-term plasticity and pharmacological modulation of the glutamatergic and GABAergic currents are indistinguishable. We further found that glutamate and GABA release at these synapses are both virtually completely mediated by N- and P/Q-type calcium channels. We then investigated &mu;-opioid modulation of these synapses and found that activation of &mu;-opioid receptors (MORs) strongly inhibits the glutamate and GABA release, mostly through inhibition of presynaptic N-type channels. However, the modulation by MORs of these dual synapses is complex, as it likely includes also a disinhibition due to downmodulation of local GABAergic interneurons which make direct axo-axonic contacts with the dual glutamatergic/GABAergic terminals. We discuss how this opioid modulation may enhance LTP at the perforant path inputs, potentially contributing to reinforce memories of drug-associated contexts.</p>

                <p>The brain's extracellular matrix (ECM) regulates neuronal plasticity and animal behavior. ECM staining shows a net-like structure around a subset of neurons, a ring-like structure at the nodes of Ranvier, and diffuse staining in the interstitial matrix. However, understanding the structural features of ECM deposition across various neuronal types and subcellular compartments remains limited. To visualize the organization pattern and assembly process of the hyaluronan-scaffolded ECM in the brain, we fused a HaloTag to hyaluronan proteoglycan link protein 1, which links hyaluronan and proteoglycans. Expression or application of the probe in primary rat neuronal cultures enables us to identify spatial and temporal regulation of ECM deposition and heterogeneity in ECM aggregation among neuronal populations. Dual-color birthdating shows the ECM assembly process in culture and in vivo. Sparse expression in mouse brains of either sex reveals detailed ECM architectures around excitatory neurons and developmentally regulated dendritic ECM. Our study uncovers extensive structural features of the brain's ECM, suggesting diverse roles in regulating neuronal plasticity.</p>

                <p>Perivascular mural cells including vascular smooth cells (VSMCs) and pericytes are integral components of the vascular system. In the central nervous system (CNS), pericytes are also indispensable for the blood&ndash;brain barrier (BBB), blood&ndash;spinal cord barrier, and blood&ndash;retinal barrier and play key roles in maintaining cerebrovascular and neuronal functions. However, the functional specifications of pericytes between CNS and peripheral organs have not been resolved at the genetic and molecular levels. Hence, the generation of reliable CNS pericyte-specific models and genetic tools remains very challenging. Here, we report a new CNS pericyte marker in mice. This putative cation-transporting ATPase 13A5 (<I>Atp13a5</I>) marker was identified through single-cell transcriptomics, based on its specificity to brain pericytes. We further generated a knock-in model with both tdTomato reporter and Cre recombinase. Using this model to trace the distribution of <I>Atp13a5-</I>positive pericytes in mice, we found that the tdTomato reporter reliably labels the CNS pericytes, including the ones in spinal cord and retina but not peripheral organs. Interestingly, brain pericytes are likely shaped by the developing neural environment, as <I>Atp13a5-</I>positive pericytes start to appear around murine embryonic day 15 (E15) and expand along the cerebrovasculature. Thus, <I>Atp13a5</I> is a specific marker of CNS pericyte lineage, and this <I>Atp13a5-</I>based model is a reliable tool to explore the heterogeneity of pericytes and BBB functions in health and diseases.</p>

                <p>Thalamocortical pathways from the rodent ventral posterior (VP) thalamic complex to the somatosensory cerebral cortex areas are a key model in modern neuroscience. However, beyond the intensively studied projection from medial VP (VPM) to the primary somatosensory area (S1), the wiring of these pathways remains poorly characterized. We combined micropopulation tract-tracing and single-cell transfection experiments to map the pathways arising from different portions of the VP complex in male mice. We found that pathways originating from different VP regions show differences in area/lamina arborization pattern and axonal varicosity size. Neurons from the rostral VPM subnucleus innervate trigeminal S1 in point-to-point fashion. In contrast, a caudal VPM subnucleus innervates heavily and topographically second somatosensory area (S2), but not S1. Neurons in a third, intermediate VPM subnucleus innervate through branched axons both S1 and S2, with markedly different laminar patterns in each area. A small anterodorsal subnucleus selectively innervates dysgranular S1. The parvicellular VPM subnucleus selectively targets the insular cortex and adjacent portions of S1 and S2. Neurons in the rostral part of the lateral VP nucleus (VPL) innervate spinal S1, while caudal VPL neurons simultaneously target S1 and S2. Rostral and caudal VP nuclei show complementary patterns of calcium-binding protein expression. In addition to the cortex, neurons in caudal VP subnuclei target the sensorimotor striatum. Our finding of a massive projection from VP to S2 separate from the VP projections to S1 adds critical anatomical evidence to the notion that different somatosensory submodalities are processed in parallel in S1 and S2.</p>

                <p>Estrogens act through nuclear and membrane-initiated signaling. Estrogen receptor alpha (ER&alpha;) is critical for reproduction, but the relative contribution of its nuclear and membrane signaling to the central regulation of reproduction is unclear. To address this question, two complementary approaches were used: estetrol (E<SUB>4</SUB>) a natural estrogen acting as an agonist of nuclear ERs, but as an antagonist of their membrane fraction, and the C451A-ER&alpha; mouse lacking mER&alpha;. E<SUB>4</SUB> dose- dependently blocks ovulation in female rats, but the central mechanism underlying this effect is unknown. To determine whether E<SUB>4</SUB> acts centrally to control ovulation, its effect was tested on the positive feedback of estradiol (E<SUB>2</SUB>) on neural circuits underlying luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion. In ovariectomized females chronically exposed to a low dose of E<SUB>2</SUB>, estradiol benzoate (EB) alone or combined with progesterone (P) induced an increase in the number of kisspeptin (Kp) and gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons coexpressing Fos, a marker of neuronal activation. E<SUB>4</SUB> blocked these effects of EB, but not when combined to P. These results indicate that E<SUB>4</SUB> blocked the central induction of the positive feedback in the absence of P, suggesting an antagonistic effect of E<SUB>4</SUB> on mER&alpha; in the brain as shown in peripheral tissues. In parallel, as opposed to wild-type females, C451A-ER&alpha; females did not show the activation of Kp and GnRH neurons in response to EB unless they are treated with P. Together these effects support a role for membrane-initiated estrogen signaling in the activation of the circuit mediating the LH surge.</p>

                Introduction Mitochondria are cell organelles that function as the cell’s main power plant, producing ATP, the main energy molecule in cells. Mitochondria play an important role in the context of neuroprotection, and mitochondrial function has been implicated in various neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Recent research in the field of neuroprotection has focused on the development of therapies that target mitochondria. Natural ingredients have long been used in traditional medicine and show potential as neuroprotective agents. Methods In this work, a literature review methodology is employed to gather data from the Scopus database using the keywords natural agents, herb*, neuroprotective, and mitochondria. The data were analyzed using Biblioshiny and VOSviewer software to produce visualizations and bibliometric maps. We conducted quantitative and qualitative analyses. Results The research trend found are documents by year, most global cited document, most relevant sources, A factorial map illustrating the leading contributors of papers, documents by author, documents by country or territory, documents by subject area, network visualization, overlay visualization of scopus database using vosviewer, density visualization, thematic map, thematic evolution, cluster analysis, qualitative analysis, and word cloud. Conclusions Natural Agent Neurotropik is a natural substance that influences the brain’s nervous system and peripheral nervous system, enhancing cognition, mood, and brain function. Derived from herbs, spices, and herbal products, it has advantages over other natural agents in energy production, brain biogenesis, and neuroprotection. Natural agents’ compositional heterogeneity affects reproductive results. Proper characterization and standardized extraction techniques are crucial for establishing plant extracts’ chemical profile. Dosage consistency is essential for standardized results. Long-term safety and potential toxicity should be evaluated. Comparing natural medicines with synthetic pharmaceuticals can enhance therapy efficacy and reduce drug resistance. Further research is needed to assess neuroprotection and mitochondrial function.

                Introduction Diarrhea is a significant health problem in the Third World. Identification of the pathogen that causes diarrhea is vital for measures to prevent and control this disease. There are also very few reports of diarrhea in Sudan. Our study aimed to determine the Prevalence of specific protozoan pathogens (Entamoeba histolytica, Cryptosporidium parvum., and Giardia spp) in children in Khartoum, Sudan. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional survey among children under five years of age hospitalized with acute diarrhea between April and December 2014. Diarrheal stool samples were collected, and E. histolytica, C. parvum, and Giardia spp were examined using multiplex real-time PCR. Results Four hundred and thirty-seven children with acute diarrhea were included in this study; the higher prevalence of diarrhea was in the age ≤ 2 years old (403, 92.2%), >2–≤4 years (32, 7.3%), and >4–<5 years (2, 0.5%). The male-to-female ratio in this study was 1:1.7. Infection with intestinal parasite was found in 155 (35.5%) cases, and co-infection was detected in 16 (3.7%) cases. Giardia spp (18.8%) and C. parvum (15.8%) were the most frequently identified parasites, followed by E. histolytica (0.9). The parasite infection rate was highest and lowest in the under 2-year-old group 143 (35.5%) and the 2–4-year-old group 12 (37.5%). The infection rate was higher in boys 104 (37.7%) than in girls 51 (31.7%). The number of positive cases was higher in the rainy season (August to December) 143 (37.4%), corresponding with that in the dry Season (April to June) 12 (21.8%). Discussion Our present study demonstrated the high prevalence of Giardia spp and C. parvum in children with diarrhea in the Khartoum region and the usefulness of the multiplex real-time method in disclosing pathogenic protozoal agents. Our result highlighted the necessity of developing intervention measurement and control strategies to deal with childhood parasitic diarrhea in this region.

                Objective To analyze the effectiveness of various techniques available for printing, finishing and polishing of 3D printed prosthesis. Methods The articles were selected from electronic databases including PubMed and Scopus. Recently, lot of advancements have been observed in the field of 3D printing in dentistry. Results Numerous studies were found explaining the factors affecting the surface roughness such as printing speed, direction, layer thickness, post curing, etc., and the significance in achieving a smooth surface finish of a 3D printed prosthesis. The methods employed to achieve this range, similar to conventional and chairside polishing, are to use advanced coating materials such as light cured glazes to nanoparticles. Conclusion 3D printing is being used in day-to-day practice and the prosthesis must be aesthetic looking to satisfy the patients’ expectations. There is a lack of data supporting any one polishing method for the prosthesis. There is a need for further research on the existing techniques and newer advancements yielding aesthetic prostheses with an optimal surface finish.

Public gene expression databases are a rapidly expanding resource of organism responses to diverse perturbations, presenting both an opportunity and a challenge for bioinformatics workflows to extract actionable knowledge of transcription regulatory network function. Here, we introduce a five-step computational pipeline, called iModulonMiner, to compile, process, curate, analyze, and characterize the totality of RNA-seq data for a given organism or cell type. This workflow is centered around the data-driven computation of co-regulated gene sets using Independent Component Analysis, called iModulons, which have been shown to have broad applications. As a demonstration, we applied this workflow to generate the iModulon structure of <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> using all high-quality, publicly-available RNA-seq data. Using this structure, we predicted regulatory interactions for multiple transcription factors, identified groups of co-expressed genes that are putatively regulated by undiscovered transcription factors, and predicted properties of a recently discovered single-subunit phage RNA polymerase. We also present a Python package, PyModulon, with functions to characterize, visualize, and explore computed iModulons. The pipeline, available at https://github.com/SBRG/iModulonMiner, can be readily applied to diverse organisms to gain a rapid understanding of their transcriptional regulatory network structure and condition-specific activity.

The rapid development of vaccines to combat the spread of COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, is a great scientific achievement. Before the development of the COVID-19 vaccines, most studies capitalized on the available data that did not include pharmaceutical measures. Such studies focused on the impact of non-pharmaceutical measures such as social distancing, sanitation, use of face masks, and lockdowns to study the spread of COVID-19. In this study, we used the SIDARTHE-V model, an extension of the SIDARTHE model, which includes vaccination rollouts. We studied the impact of vaccination on the severity of the virus, specifically focusing on death rates, in African countries. The SIRDATHE-V model parameters were extracted by simultaneously fitting the COVID-19 cumulative data of deaths, recoveries, active cases, and full vaccinations reported by the governments of Ghana, Kenya, Mozambique, Nigeria, South Africa, Togo, and Zambia. Using South Africa as a case study, our analysis showed that the cumulative death rates declined drastically with the increased extent of vaccination drives. Whilst the infection rates sometimes increased with the arrival of new coronavirus variants, the death rates did not increase as they did before vaccination.

                <p>by Felix Ezequiel Gerbaldo, Emanuel Sonder, Vincent Fischer, Selina Frei, Jiayi Wang, Katharina Gapp, Mark D. Robinson, Pierre-Luc Germain</p>

ATAC-seq has emerged as a rich epigenome profiling technique, and is commonly used to identify Transcription Factors (TFs) underlying given phenomena. A number of methods can be used to identify differentially-active TFs through the accessibility of their DNA-binding motif, however little is known on the best approaches for doing so. Here we benchmark several such methods using a combination of curated datasets with various forms of short-term perturbations on known TFs, as well as semi-simulations. We include both methods specifically designed for this type of data as well as some that can be repurposed for it. We also investigate variations to these methods, and identify three particularly promising approaches (a chromVAR-limma workflow with critical adjustments, monaLisa and a combination of GC smooth quantile normalization and multivariate modeling). We further investigate the specific use of nucleosome-free fragments, the combination of top methods, and the impact of technical variation. Finally, we illustrate the use of the top methods on a novel dataset to characterize the impact on DNA accessibility of TRAnscription Factor TArgeting Chimeras (TRAFTAC), which can deplete TFs—in our case NFkB—at the protein level.

                Background Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) is predominant cultured species in aquaculture. However, there is a scarcity of literature regarding relationship between guava and star gooseberry leaf extract and the condition factor. Thus, the present study aims to investigate the effect of guava and star gooseberry leaf extract-supplemented diets on the specific growth rate, length-weight relationship, and condition factor of Nile tilapia. Methods Six hundred and thirty Nile tilapia (8.7±0.4 g) were randomly distributed among twenty-one tanks (30 fish per tank) within a recirculation system. Over a 60-day period, the fish were fed diets supplemented with 5g/Kg and 10g/Kg of guava leaf extract (GLE-5, GLE-10), star gooseberry leaf extract (SGLE-5, SGLE-10), and a mixture of both (MxLE-5, MXLE-10). Subsequently, specific growth rate, length-weight relationship, and condition factor were determined. Results After 60 days, the specific growth rate was significantly higher in all the GLE, SGLE, and MxLE groups compared to the control group. The final lengths and weights differed significantly both in the control group and all the GLE, SGLE, and MxLE groups. The analysis of the regression equation indicated a positive correlation (r = 0.970, 0.977, 0.976, 0.974, 0.974, 0.974, and 0.969) between the length and weight of Nile tilapia in the control group and in all the GLE, SGLE, and MxLE groups. The regression exponent “b” values in all the GLE, SGLE, and MxLE groups were >3, indicating a positive allometric growth pattern in Nile tilapia compared to the control (b=2.866), which exhibited a negative allometry. The final condition factor values did not differ significantly in either the control group or any of the plant extract groups. Conclusions Nile tilapia exhibited positive allometric growth patterns and maintained good health when fed with GLE, SGLE, and MxLE groups. Therefore, these plant extracts demonstrate suitability for commercial Nile tilapia production.

                <p>Cryptogenic new-onset refractory status epilepticus (cNORSE) is a devastating condition with unclear pathogenesis. Here, we analyzed the genetic underprints of 31 cNORSE patients from an autoimmune encephalitis observational cohort through whole-genome sequencing. Compared to their controls, cNORSE patients exhibited elevated polygenic risk scores (PRS) for traits associated with autoimmune diseases. The individual PRS against these diseases were correlated with specific clinical phenotypes of cNORSE. The variants were enriched in genes expressed in the central nervous system and lymphocytes. These results suggest a shared genetic framework between cNORSE and other autoimmune/autoinflammatory diseases, and its involvement in the disease pathogenesis. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

<p>We investigated the immunoreactivity of neuroplasticity-related molecular markers such as Aldoc, PLCB3, and PLCB4 in the cerebellar cortex and related nuclei of rhesus macaque monkeys. We then compared these findings with those of previous studies on such markers in rodents. The current study shed light on the molecular basis underlying differences in cerebellar function between primates and rodents.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Cerebellar molecular signatures in primates remain largely unexplored. Here, we investigated the immunoreactivity of neuroplasticity-related molecular markers, including aldolase C (Aldoc), phospholipase C beta 3 (PLCB3), and phospholipase C beta 4 (PLCB4) in the cerebellar cortex and associated nuclei of rhesus macaque monkeys (<i>Macaca mulatta</i>). Our main findings are as follows: First, the cerebellar vermis in macaques exhibited striped compartmentalization for all markers, with the striped expression boundary of PLCB3 being less distinct than those of Aldoc and PLCB4. Second, the striped pattern was less pronounced in the cerebellar hemisphere compared to the vermis, with signals in the hemisphere being predominantly intense throughout. Third, distinct zonal patterns and elevated signals for Aldoc and PLCB3 were observed in the cerebellar deep nuclei. Specifically, the fastigial nucleus displayed intense Aldoc signals in both caudal and rostral regions, while the dentate nucleus displayed strong Aldoc signals in both ventral and dorsal regions. Compared to previous rodent studies, the macaque cerebellum demonstrated a higher proportion of intense signal areas and distinct compartmentalization patterns in both cortical and deep nuclei. These findings offer crucial insights into the unique molecular organization of the primate cerebellum, enhancing our understanding of the advanced neuroplasticity, cognitive, and motor capabilities in primates.</p>
