	<p>Mood disorders and substance use disorder (SUD) are of immense medical and social concern. Although significant progress on neuronal involvement in mood and reward circuitries has been achieved, it is only relatively recently that the role of glia in these disorders has attracted attention. Detailed understanding of the glial functions in these devastating diseases could offer novel interventions. Here, following a brief review of circuitries involved in mood regulation and reward perception, the specific contributions of neurotrophic factors, neuroinflammation, and gut microbiota to these diseases are highlighted. In this context, the role of specific glial cells (e.g., microglia, astroglia, oligodendrocytes, and synantocytes) on phenotypic manifestation of mood disorders or SUD are emphasized. In addition, use of this knowledge in the potential development of novel therapeutics is touched upon.</p>

	<p>This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of rTMS in treating sleep disorders in PD. It included 24 patients with PD who had sleep disorders. Group allocations (active or sham with a ratio of 2:1) were placed in serially numbered closed envelopes. Each patient was evaluated with the following: MDS-UPDRS, Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s Disease Sleep Scale (PDSS), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and polysomnography (PSG) before and 10 days after the treatment sessions. Each session consisted of 10 trains, 20 Hz, 10 sec for each, over the parietal cortex (bilaterally). Scores of UPDRS, BDI, and PDSS improved significantly in the active group but not in the sham group. The PSG data showed that sleep onset and rapid eye movement (REM) latencies (min), REM duration, and time spent awake (both as %TST) were improved after rTMS in the active group compared with the sham group. The number of awakenings, the wake-after-sleep onset index, the arousal index, and periodic leg movements (PLMs) were all significantly reduced in the active group but not in the sham group. Ten sessions of 20 Hz rTMS over parietal cortexes improved sleep quality and PLMs in patients with PD. The improvement in PSG and PDSS were correlated with improvements in UPDRS and BDI scores.</p>

	<p>To date, most studies examined the effects of cold water immersion (CWI) on neuromuscular control following exercise solely on measuring proprioception, no study explores changes in the brain and muscles. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of CWI following exercise on knee neuromuscular control capacity, and physiological and perceptual responses. In a crossover control design, fifteen participants performed an exhaustion exercise. Subsequently, they underwent a 10 min recovery intervention, either in the form of passively seated rest (CON) or CWI at 15 &amp;amp;deg;C. The knee proprioception, oxygenated cerebral hemoglobin concentrations (&amp;amp;Delta;[HbO]), and muscle activation during the proprioception test, physiological and perceptual responses were measured. CWI did not have a significant effect on proprioception at the post-intervention but attenuated the reductions in &amp;amp;Delta;[HbO] in the primary sensory cortex and posterior parietal cortex (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). The root mean square of vastus medialis was higher in the CWI compared to the CON. CWI effectively reduced core temperature and mean skin temperature and improved the rating of perceived exertion and thermal sensation. These results indicated that 10 min of CWI at 15 &amp;amp;deg;C post-exercise had no negative effect on the neuromuscular control of the knee joint but could improve subjective perception and decrease body temperature.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/11/5/ENEURO.0469-23.2024?rss=1">Paradoxical Boosting of Weak and Strong Spatial Memories by Hippocampal Dopamine Uncaging</a></h4>

              
                <p>The ability to remember changes in the surroundings is fundamental for daily life. It has been proposed that novel events producing dopamine release in the hippocampal CA1 region could modulate spatial memory formation. However, the role of hippocampal dopamine increase on weak or strong spatial memories remains unclear. We show that male mice exploring two objects located in a familiar environment for 5&nbsp;min created a short-term memory (weak) that cannot be retrieved 1&nbsp;d later, whereas 10&nbsp;min exploration created a long-term memory (strong) that can be retrieved 1&nbsp;d later. Remarkably, hippocampal dopamine elevation during the encoding of weak object location memories (OLMs) allowed their retrieval 1&nbsp;d later but dopamine elevation during the encoding of strong OLMs promoted the preference for a familiar object location over a novel object location after 24&nbsp;h. Moreover, dopamine uncaging after the encoding of OLMs did not have effect on weak memories whereas on strong memories diminished the exploration of the novel object location. Additionally, hippocampal dopamine elevation during the retrieval of OLMs did not allow the recovery of weak memories and did not affect the retrieval of strong memory traces. Finally, dopamine elevation increased hippocampal theta oscillations, indicating that dopamine promotes the recurrent activation of specific groups of neurons. Our experiments demonstrate that hippocampal dopaminergic modulation during the encoding of OLMs depends on memory strength indicating that hyperdopaminergic levels that enhance weak experiences could compromise the normal storage of strong memories.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/11/5/ENEURO.0528-23.2024?rss=1">The Impact of Spectral and Temporal Degradation on Vocoded Speech Recognition in Early-Blind Individuals</a></h4>

              
                <p>This study compared the impact of spectral and temporal degradation on vocoded speech recognition between early-blind and sighted subjects. The participants included 25 early-blind subjects (30.32 &plusmn; 4.88&nbsp;years; male:female, 14:11) and 25 age- and sex-matched sighted subjects. Tests included monosyllable recognition in noise at various signal-to-noise ratios (&ndash;18 to &ndash;4&nbsp;dB), matrix sentence-in-noise recognition, and vocoded speech recognition with different numbers of channels (4, 8, 16, and 32) and temporal envelope cutoff frequencies (50 vs 500&nbsp;Hz). Cortical-evoked potentials (N2 and P3b) were measured in response to spectrally and temporally degraded stimuli. The early-blind subjects displayed superior monosyllable and sentence recognition than sighted subjects (all <I>p</I> &lt; 0.01). In the vocoded speech recognition test, a three-way repeated-measure analysis of variance (two groups <FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">x</FONT> four channels <FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">x</FONT> two cutoff frequencies) revealed significant main effects of group, channel, and cutoff frequency (all <I>p</I> &lt; 0.001). Early-blind subjects showed increased sensitivity to spectral degradation for speech recognition, evident in the significant interaction between group and channel (<I>p</I> = 0.007). N2 responses in early-blind subjects exhibited shorter latency and greater amplitude in the 8-channel (<I>p</I> = 0.022 and 0.034, respectively) and shorter latency in the 16-channel (<I>p</I> = 0.049) compared with sighted subjects. In conclusion, early-blind subjects demonstrated speech recognition advantages over sighted subjects, even in the presence of spectral and temporal degradation. Spectral degradation had a greater impact on speech recognition in early-blind subjects, while the effect of temporal degradation was similar in both groups.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/11/5/ENEURO.0538-23.2024?rss=1">Basal Forebrain Cholinergic Neurons Have Specific Characteristics during the Perinatal Period</a></h4>

              
                <p>Cholinergic neurons of the basal forebrain represent the main source of cholinergic innervation of large parts of the neocortex and are involved in adults in the modulation of attention, memory, and arousal. During the first postnatal days, they play a crucial role in the development of cortical neurons and cortical cytoarchitecture. However, their characteristics, during this period have not been studied. To understand how they can fulfill this role, we investigated the morphological and electrophysiological maturation of cholinergic neurons of the substantia innominata&ndash;nucleus basalis of Meynert (SI/NBM) complex in the perinatal period in mice. We show that cholinergic neurons, whether or not they express gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) as a cotransmitter, are already functional at Embryonic Day 18. Until the end of the first postnatal week, they constitute a single population of neurons with a well developed dendritic tree, a spontaneous activity including bursting periods, and a short-latency response to depolarizations (early-firing). They are excited by both their GABAergic and glutamatergic afferents. During the second postnatal week, a second, less excitable, neuronal population emerges, with a longer delay response to depolarizations (late-firing), together with the hyperpolarizing action of GABA<SUB>A</SUB> receptor-mediated currents. This classification into early-firing (40%) and late-firing (60%) neurons is again independent of the coexpression of GABAergic markers. These results strongly suggest that during the first postnatal week, the specific properties of developing SI/NBM cholinergic neurons allow them to spontaneously release acetylcholine (ACh), or ACh and GABA, into the developing cortex.</p>

                <p>A dynamic environment, such as the one we inhabit, requires organisms to continuously update their knowledge of the setting. While the prefrontal cortex is recognized for its pivotal role in regulating such adaptive behavior, the specific contribution of each prefrontal area remains elusive. In the current work, we investigated the direct involvement of two major prefrontal subregions, the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC, A32D + A32V) and the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC, VO + LO), in updating pavlovian stimulus&ndash;outcome (S&ndash;O) associations following contingency degradation in male rats. Specifically, animals had to learn that a particular cue, previously fully predicting the delivery of a specific reward, was no longer a reliable predictor. First, we found that chemogenetic inhibition of mPFC, but not of OFC, neurons altered the rats&rsquo; ability to adaptively respond to degraded and non-degraded cues. Next, given the growing evidence pointing at noradrenaline (NA) as a main neuromodulator of adaptive behavior, we decided to investigate the possible involvement of NA projections to the two subregions in this higher-order cognitive process. Employing a pair of novel retrograde vectors, we traced NA projections from the locus ceruleus (LC) to both structures and observed an equivalent yet relatively segregated amount of inputs. Then, we showed that chemogenetic inhibition of NA projections to the mPFC, but not to the OFC, also impaired the rats&rsquo; ability to adaptively respond to the degradation procedure. Altogether, our findings provide important evidence of functional parcellation within the prefrontal cortex and point at mPFC NA as key for updating pavlovian S&ndash;O associations.</p>

                <p>The neurovascular unit (NVU) includes multiple different cell types, including neurons, astrocytes, endothelial cells, and pericytes, which respond to insults on very different time or dose scales. We defined differential vulnerability among these cell types, using response to two different insults: oxygen&ndash;glucose deprivation (OGD) and thrombin-mediated cytotoxicity. We found that neurons are most vulnerable, followed by endothelial cells and astrocytes. After temporary focal cerebral ischemia in male rats, we found significantly more injured neurons, compared with astrocytes in the ischemic area, consistent with differential vulnerability in vivo. We sought to illustrate different and shared mechanisms across all cell types during response to insult. We found that gene expression profiles in response to OGD differed among the cell types, with a paucity of gene responses shared by all types. All cell types activated genes relating to autophagy, apoptosis, and necroptosis, but the specific genes differed. Astrocytes and endothelial cells also activated pathways connected to DNA repair and antiapoptosis. Taken together, the data support the concept of differential vulnerability in the NVU and suggest that different elements of the unit will evolve from salvageable to irretrievable on different time scales while residing in the same brain region and receiving the same (ischemic) blood flow. Future work will focus on the mechanisms of these differences. These data suggest future stroke therapy development should target different elements of the NVU differently.</p>

                <p>Creating and evaluating predictions are considered important features in sensory perception. Little is known about processing differences between the senses and their cortical substrates. Here, we tested the hypothesis that olfaction, the sense of smell, would be highly dependent on (nonolfactory) object-predictive cues and involve distinct cortical processing features. We developed a novel paradigm to compare prediction error processing across senses. Participants listened to spoken word cues (e.g., "lilac") and determined whether target stimuli (odors or pictures) matched the word cue or not. In two behavioral experiments (total <I>n</I> = 113; 72 female), the disparity between congruent and incongruent response times was exaggerated for olfactory relative to visual targets, indicating a greater dependency on predictive verbal cues to process olfactory targets. A preregistered fMRI study (<I>n</I> = 30; 19 female) revealed the anterior cingulate cortex (a region central for error detection) being more activated by incongruent olfactory targets, indicating a role for olfactory predictive error processing. Additionally, both the primary olfactory and visual cortices were significantly activated for incongruent olfactory targets, suggesting olfactory prediction errors are dependent on cross-sensory processing resources, whereas visual prediction errors are not. We propose that olfaction is characterized by a strong dependency on predictive (nonolfactory) cues and that odors are evaluated in the context of such predictions by a designated transmodal cortical network. Our results indicate differences in how predictive cues are used by different senses in rapid decision-making.</p>

                <p>Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a noninvasive neuromodulation technique gaining more attention in neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). Due to the phenotypic heterogeneity of NDDs, tDCS is unlikely to be equally effective in all individuals. The present study aimed to establish neuroanatomical markers in typically developing (TD) individuals that may be used for the prediction of individual responses to tDCS. Fifty-seven male and female children received 2&nbsp;mA anodal and sham tDCS, targeting the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC<SUB>left</SUB>), right inferior frontal gyrus, and bilateral temporoparietal junction. Response to tDCS was assessed based on task performance differences between anodal and sham tDCS in different neurocognitive tasks (<I>N</I>-back, flanker, Mooney faces detection, attentional emotional recognition task). Measures of cortical thickness (CT) and surface area (SA) were derived from 3 Tesla structural MRI scans. Associations between neuroanatomy and task performance were assessed using general linear models (GLM). Machine learning (ML) algorithms were employed to predict responses to tDCS. Vertex-wise estimates of SA were more closely linked to differences in task performance than measures of CT. Across ML algorithms, highest accuracies were observed for the prediction of <I>N</I>-back task performance differences following stimulation of the DLPFC<SUB>left</SUB>, where 65% of behavioral variance was explained by variability in SA. Lower accuracies were observed for all other tasks and stimulated regions. This suggests that it may be possible to predict individual responses to tDCS for some behavioral measures and target regions. In the future, these models might be extended to predict treatment outcome in individuals with NDDs.</p>

                <p>In competitive interactions, humans have to flexibly update their beliefs about another person's intentions in order to adjust their own choice strategy, such as when believing that the other may exploit their cooperativeness. Here we investigate both the neural dynamics and the causal neural substrate of belief updating processes in humans. We used an adapted prisoner's dilemma game in which participants explicitly predicted the coplayer's actions, which allowed us to quantify the prediction error between expected and actual behavior. First, in an EEG experiment, we found a stronger medial frontal negativity (MFN) for negative than positive prediction errors, suggesting that this medial frontal ERP component may encode unexpected defection of the coplayer. The MFN also predicted subsequent belief updating after negative prediction errors. In a second experiment, we used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to investigate whether the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) causally implements belief updating after unexpected outcomes. Our results show that dmPFC TMS impaired belief updating and strategic behavioral adjustments after negative prediction errors. Taken together, our findings reveal the time course of the use of prediction errors in social decisions and suggest that the dmPFC plays a crucial role in updating mental representations of others' intentions.</p>

                <p>Most of mammalian physiology is under the control of biological rhythms, including the endocrine system with time-varying hormone secretion. Precision neuroimaging studies provide unique insights into how the endocrine system dynamically regulates aspects of the human brain. Recently, we established estrogen's ability to drive widespread patterns of connectivity and enhance the global efficiency of large-scale brain networks in a woman sampled every 24&nbsp;h across 30 consecutive days, capturing a complete menstrual cycle. Steroid hormone production also follows a pronounced sinusoidal pattern, with a peak in testosterone between 6 and 7 A.M. and nadir between 7 and 8 P.M. To capture the brain's response to diurnal changes in hormone production, we carried out a companion precision imaging study of a healthy adult man who completed MRI and venipuncture every 12&ndash;24&nbsp;h across 30 consecutive days. Results confirmed robust diurnal fluctuations in testosterone, 17&beta;-estradiol&mdash;the primary form of estrogen&mdash;and cortisol. Standardized regression analyses revealed widespread associations between testosterone, estradiol, and cortisol concentrations and whole-brain patterns of coherence. In particular, functional connectivity in the Dorsal Attention Network was coupled with diurnally fluctuating hormones. Further, comparing dense-sampling datasets between a man and a naturally cycling woman revealed that fluctuations in sex hormones are tied to patterns of whole-brain coherence in both sexes and to a heightened degree in the male. Together, these findings enhance our understanding of steroid hormones as rapid neuromodulators and provide evidence that diurnal changes in steroid hormones are associated with patterns of whole-brain functional connectivity.</p>

                <p>When performing movements in rapid succession, the brain needs to coordinate ongoing execution with the preparation of an upcoming action. Here we identify the processes and brain areas involved in this ability of online preparation. Human participants (both male and female) performed pairs of single-finger presses or three-finger chords in rapid succession, while 7T fMRI was recorded. In the overlap condition, they could prepare the second movement during the first response and in the nonoverlap condition only after the first response was completed. Despite matched perceptual and movement requirements, fMRI revealed increased brain activity in the overlap condition in regions along the intraparietal sulcus and ventral visual stream. Multivariate analyses suggested that these areas are involved in stimulus identification and action selection. In contrast, the dorsal premotor cortex, known to be involved in planning upcoming movements, showed no discernible signs of heightened activity. This observation suggests that the bottleneck during simultaneous action execution and preparation arises at the level of stimulus identification and action selection, whereas movement planning in the premotor cortex can unfold concurrently with the execution of a current action without requiring additional neural activity.</p>

                <p>In developmental language disorder (DLD), learning to comprehend and express oneself with spoken language is impaired, but the reason for this remains unknown. Using millisecond-scale magnetoencephalography recordings combined with machine learning models, we investigated whether the possible neural basis of this disruption lies in poor cortical tracking of speech. The stimuli were common spoken Finnish words (e.g., dog, car, hammer) and sounds with corresponding meanings (e.g., dog bark, car engine, hammering). In both children with DLD (10 boys and 7 girls) and typically developing (TD) control children (14 boys and 3 girls), aged 10&ndash;15&nbsp;years, the cortical activation to spoken words was best modeled as time-locked to the unfolding speech input at ~100&nbsp;ms latency between sound and cortical activation. Amplitude envelope (amplitude changes) and spectrogram (detailed time-varying spectral content) of the spoken words, but not other sounds, were very successfully decoded based on time-locked brain responses in bilateral temporal areas; based on the cortical responses, the models could tell at ~75&ndash;85% accuracy which of the two sounds had been presented to the participant. However, the cortical representation of the amplitude envelope information was poorer in children with DLD compared with TD children at longer latencies (at ~200&ndash;300&nbsp;ms lag). We interpret this effect as reflecting poorer retention of acoustic&ndash;phonetic information in short-term memory. This impaired tracking could potentially affect the processing and learning of words as well as continuous speech. The present results offer an explanation for the problems in language comprehension and acquisition in DLD.</p>

                <p>Humans have the remarkable ability to vividly retrieve sensory details of past events. According to the theory of sensory reinstatement, during remembering, brain regions specialized for processing specific sensory stimuli are reactivated to support content-specific retrieval. Recently, several studies have emphasized transformations in the spatial organization of these reinstated activity patterns. Specifically, studies of scene stimuli suggest a clear anterior shift in the location of retrieval activations compared with the activity observed during perception. However, it is not clear that such transformations occur universally, with inconsistent evidence for other important stimulus categories, particularly faces. One challenge in addressing this question is the careful delineation of face-selective cortices, which are interdigitated with other selective regions, in configurations that spatially differ across individuals. Therefore, we conducted a multisession neuroimaging study to first carefully map individual participants&rsquo; (nine males and seven females) face-selective regions within ventral temporal cortex (VTC), followed by a second session to examine the activity patterns within these regions during face memory encoding and retrieval. While face-selective regions were expectedly engaged during face perception at encoding, memory retrieval engagement exhibited a more selective and constricted reinstatement pattern within these regions, but did not show any consistent direction of spatial transformation (e.g., anteriorization). We also report on unique human intracranial recordings from VTC under the same experimental conditions. These findings highlight the importance of considering the complex configuration of category-selective cortex in elucidating principles shaping the neural transformations that occur from perception to memory.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/22/e2223232024?rss=1">The Brains Topographical Organization Shapes Dynamic Interaction Patterns That Support Flexible Behavior Based on Rules and Long-Term Knowledge</a></h4>

              
                <p>Adaptive behavior relies both on specific rules that vary across situations and stable long-term knowledge gained from experience. The frontoparietal control network (FPCN) is implicated in the brain's ability to balance these different influences on action. Here, we investigate how the topographical organization of the cortex supports behavioral flexibility within the FPCN. Functional properties of this network might reflect its juxtaposition between the dorsal attention network (DAN) and the default mode network (DMN), two large-scale systems implicated in top-down attention and memory-guided cognition, respectively. Our study tests whether subnetworks of FPCN are topographically proximal to the DAN and the DMN, respectively, and how these topographical differences relate to functional differences: the proximity of each subnetwork is anticipated to play a pivotal role in generating distinct cognitive modes relevant to working memory and long-term memory. We show that FPCN subsystems share multiple anatomical and functional similarities with their neighboring systems (DAN and DMN) and that this topographical architecture supports distinct interaction patterns that give rise to different patterns of functional behavior. The FPCN acts as a unified system when long-term knowledge supports behavior but becomes segregated into discrete subsystems with different patterns of interaction when long-term memory is less relevant. In this way, our study suggests that the topographical organization of the FPCN and the connections it forms with distant regions of cortex are important influences on how this system supports flexible behavior.</p>

                <p>Spinal cerebrospinal fluid-contacting neurons (CSF-cNs) form an evolutionary conserved bipolar cell population localized around the central canal of all vertebrates. CSF-cNs were shown to express molecular markers of neuronal immaturity into adulthood; however, the impact of their incomplete maturation on the chloride (Cl<sup>&ndash;</sup>) homeostasis as well as GABAergic signaling remains unknown. Using adult mice from both sexes, in situ hybridization revealed that a proportion of spinal CSF-cNs (18.3%) express the Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup>-Cl<sup>&ndash;</sup> cotransporter 1 (NKCC1) allowing intracellular Cl<sup>&ndash;</sup> accumulation. However, we did not find expression of the K<sup>+</sup>-Cl<sup>&ndash;</sup> cotransporter 2 (KCC2) responsible for Cl<sup>&ndash;</sup> efflux in any CSF-cNs. The lack of KCC2 expression results in low Cl<sup>&ndash;</sup> extrusion capacity in CSF-cNs under high Cl<sup>&ndash;</sup> load in whole-cell patch clamp. Using cell-attached patch clamp allowing recordings with intact intracellular Cl<sup>&ndash;</sup> concentration, we found that the activation of ionotropic GABA<SUB>A</SUB> receptors (GABA<SUB>A</SUB>-Rs) induced both depolarizing and hyperpolarizing responses in CSF-cNs. Moreover, depolarizing GABA responses can drive action potentials as well as intracellular calcium elevations by activating voltage-gated calcium channels. Blocking NKCC1 with bumetanide inhibited the GABA-induced calcium transients in CSF-cNs. Finally, we show that metabotropic GABA<SUB>B</SUB> receptors have no hyperpolarizing action on spinal CSF-cNs as their activation with baclofen did not mediate outward K<sup>+</sup> currents, presumably due to the lack of expression of G-protein&ndash;coupled inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) channels. Together, these findings outline subpopulations of spinal CSF-cNs expressing inhibitory or excitatory GABA<SUB>A</SUB>-R signaling. Excitatory GABA may promote the maturation and integration of young CSF-cNs into the existing spinal circuit.</p>

                <p>The autonomic nervous system (ANS) regulates the body's physiology, including cardiovascular function. As the ANS develops during the second to third trimester, fetal heart rate variability (HRV) increases while fetal heart rate (HR) decreases. In this way, fetal HR and HRV provide an index of fetal ANS development and future neurobehavioral regulation. Fetal HR and HRV have been associated with child language ability and psychomotor development behavior in toddlerhood. However, their associations with postbirth autonomic brain systems, such as the brainstem, hypothalamus, and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), have yet to be investigated even though brain pathways involved in autonomic regulation are well established in older individuals. We assessed whether fetal HR and HRV were associated with the brainstem, hypothalamic, and dACC functional connectivity in newborns. Data were obtained from 60 pregnant individuals (ages 14&ndash;42) at 24&ndash;27 and 34&ndash;37&nbsp;weeks of gestation using a fetal actocardiograph to generate fetal HR and HRV. During natural sleep, their infants (38 males and 22 females) underwent a fMRI scan between 40 and 46&nbsp;weeks of postmenstrual age. Our findings relate fetal heart indices to brainstem, hypothalamic, and dACC connectivity and reveal connections with widespread brain regions that may support behavioral and emotional regulation. We demonstrated the basic physiologic association between fetal HR indices and lower- and higher-order brain regions involved in regulatory processes. This work provides the foundation for future behavioral or physiological regulation research in fetuses and infants.</p>

                Background This study compares propellant fuels‚Äô specific thrust and impulse parameters using nanocarbon variant fuels from coconut shells and coal. Specific impulses and impulses are essential parameters that determine rocket performance. The specific thrust and impulses are influenced by fuel type, material composition, heat flow, and burning time parameters. The characteristics of nanocarbon as a fuel are proven to have high-value features and a long combustion time. This parameter is essential to add value to specific thrusts and impulses. Methods The method to prove the quality of solid fuel material was done experimentally. The composition of the propellant fuel variant mixed with Ammonium Perchlorate (NH4ClO4) as an oxidizer through the printing process and sample testing was carried out using scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD), combustion time, and specific impulse tests. Results Test results with the composition of CBK2 (Coconut Shell + NH4ClO4 + Binder + Al = 15: 70: 10: 5) produced a specific impulse of 267 seconds or an increase of 37 seconds without carbon. CBB2 (Coal + NH4ClO4 + Binder + Al = 15: 70: 10: 5) produced a specific impulse of 261 seconds or an increase of 31 seconds. Conclusions The composition of nanocarbon as a solid fuel propellant has been proven to increase a rocket‚Äôs thrust and specific impulses. After all the material variants have been tested for thrust and specific impulse, the best rocket propellant is CBK2.

                We develop a thermodynamic model describing the binding of RNA binding proteins (RBP) to oligomers in vitro. We apply expectation-maximization to infer the specificity of RBPs, represented as position-specific weight matrices (PWMs), by maximizing the likelihood of RNA Bind‚Äôn Seq data from the ENCODE project. Analyzing these public data we find sequence motifs that can partly explain the data for more than half of the studied 111 RBPs, and for 48 of the proteins these motifs are consistent with the known specificity. Our code is publicly available, facilitating analysis of RBP binding data.

The field of 3D genome organization produces large amounts of sequencing data from Hi-C and a rapidly-expanding set of other chromosome conformation protocols (3C+). Massive and heterogeneous 3C+ data require high-performance and flexible processing of sequenced reads into contact pairs. To meet these challenges, we present <i>pairtools</i>‚Äìa flexible suite of tools for contact extraction from sequencing data. <i>Pairtools</i> provides modular command-line interface (CLI) tools that can be flexibly chained into data processing pipelines. The core operations provided by <i>pairtools</i> are parsing of.sam alignments into Hi-C pairs, sorting and removal of PCR duplicates. In addition, <i>pairtools</i> provides auxiliary tools for building feature-rich 3C+ pipelines, including contact pair manipulation, filtration, and quality control. Benchmarking <i>pairtools</i> against popular 3C+ data pipelines shows advantages of <i>pairtools</i> for high-performance and flexible 3C+ analysis. Finally, <i>pairtools</i> provides protocol-specific tools for restriction-based protocols, haplotype-resolved contacts, and single-cell Hi-C. The combination of CLI tools and tight integration with Python data analysis libraries makes <i>pairtools</i> a versatile foundation for a broad range of 3C+ pipelines.

                <p>by Kerr Ding, Jiaqi Luo, Yunan Luo</p>

Machine learning (ML) is increasingly being used to guide biological discovery in biomedicine such as prioritizing promising small molecules in drug discovery. In those applications, ML models are used to predict the properties of biological systems, and researchers use these predictions to prioritize candidates as new biological hypotheses for downstream experimental validations. However, when applied to unseen situations, these models can be overconfident and produce a large number of false positives. One solution to address this issue is to quantify the model‚Äôs prediction uncertainty and provide a set of hypotheses with a controlled false discovery rate (FDR) pre-specified by researchers. We propose CPEC, an ML framework for FDR-controlled biological discovery. We demonstrate its effectiveness using enzyme function annotation as a case study, simulating the discovery process of identifying the functions of less-characterized enzymes. CPEC integrates a deep learning model with a statistical tool known as conformal prediction, providing accurate and FDR-controlled function predictions for a given protein enzyme. Conformal prediction provides rigorous statistical guarantees to the predictive model and ensures that the expected FDR will not exceed a user-specified level with high probability. Evaluation experiments show that CPEC achieves reliable FDR control, better or comparable prediction performance at a lower FDR than existing methods, and accurate predictions for enzymes under-represented in the training data. We expect CPEC to be a useful tool for biological discovery applications where a high yield rate in validation experiments is desired but the experimental budget is limited.

                <p>by Kanyarat Jitmana, Jason I. Griffiths, Sian Fereday, Anna DeFazio, David Bowtell, for Australian Ovarian Cancer Study , Frederick R. Adler</p>

A time-series analysis of serum Cancer Antigen 125 (CA-125)levels was performed in 791 patients with high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) from the Australian Ovarian Cancer Study to evaluate the development of chemoresistance and response to therapy. To investigate chemoresistance and better predict the treatment effectiveness, we examined two traits: <i>resistance</i> (defined as the rate of CA-125 change when patients were treated with therapy) and <i>aggressiveness</i> (defined as the rate of CA-125 change when patients were not treated). We found that as the number of treatment lines increases, the data-based resistance increases (a decreased rate of CA-125 decay). We use mathematical models of two distinct cancer cell types, treatment-sensitive cells and treatment-resistant cells, to estimate the values and evolution of the two traits in individual patients. By fitting to individual patient HGSOC data, our models successfully capture the dynamics of the CA-125 level. The parameters estimated from the mathematical models show that patients with inferred low growth rates of treatment-sensitive cells and treatment-resistant cells (low model-estimated aggressiveness) and a high death rate of treatment-resistant cells (low model-estimated resistance) have longer survival time after completing their second-line of therapy. These findings show that mathematical models can characterize the degree of <i>resistance</i> and <i>aggressiveness</i> in individual patients, which improves our understanding of chemoresistance development and could predict treatment effectiveness in HGSOC patients.

                <p>by Andriana Manousidaki, Anna Little, Yuying Xie</p>

Recent advances in single-cell technologies have enabled high-resolution characterization of tissue and cancer compositions. Although numerous tools for dimension reduction and clustering are available for single-cell data analyses, these methods often fail to simultaneously preserve local cluster structure and global data geometry. To address these challenges, we developed a novel analyses framework, Single-Cell Path Metrics Profiling (scPMP), using power-weighted path metrics, which measure distances between cells in a data-driven way. Unlike Euclidean distance and other commonly used distance metrics, path metrics are density sensitive and respect the underlying data geometry. By combining path metrics with multidimensional scaling, a low dimensional embedding of the data is obtained which preserves both the global data geometry and cluster structure. We evaluate the method both for clustering quality and geometric fidelity, and it outperforms current scRNAseq clustering algorithms on a wide range of benchmarking data sets.

                Background Twenty-two Arab countries share a common language, history, and culture. Nevertheless, governmental policies, healthcare systems, and resources differ from one Arab country to another. We have been following Coronavirus (COVID-19) from the beginning in each Arab country. In the present study, we aimed to assess the prevalence of COVID-19 in the Arab world and to compare these findings with other significantly affected countries. Methods Websites of the World Health Organization, World COVID-vaccinations tracker, Worldometer, and Ministries of Health were used to extract COVID-19 data in all Arab countries between the period January 2020 to December 2022. Results All Arab countries had 14,218,042 total confirmed COVID-19 cases, 13,384,924 total recovered cases and 173,544 total related deaths. The trend demonstrated that the third quarter of 2021 recorded the highest death toll and the first quarter of 2022 recorded the highest number of confirmed and recovered cases. Compared to the top 15 affected countries, the Arab world ranked last as it had the lowest overall incidence per million population (PMP) of 31,609. The data on total deaths PMP showed that India had the lowest number of deaths with only 377 cases followed by the Arab world with 386 cases. Conclusions Although the number of confirmed, death, and recovered cases of COVID-19 have greatly reduced in the last quarter of 2022 in most Arab countries, many Arab countries still need to re-campaign about COVID-19 vaccines and raise awareness programs about boosters. COVID-19 has had a relatively smaller impact on Arab countries than on other countries that have been significantly affected.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-790/v2?src=rss">Effect of family-centered care interventions on well-being of caregivers of children with cerebral palsy: a systematic review [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Caring for a child with long-term functional limitations can have a negative impact on the physical and psychological well-being of the caregiver. Family-centered care (FCC) interventions have the potential to empower caregivers and contribute to their well-being. This systematic review aimed to synthesize existing evidence on the effectiveness of FCC interventions in improving the well-being of caregivers of children with cerebral palsy (CP), and identify the key components of such interventions that are most commonly practiced and deemed effective. Methods This review systematically searched seven databases for randomized controlled trials that evaluated the effectiveness of any FCC intervention on the well-being of caregivers of children with or at risk of CP. We used the Cochrane RoB 2.0 tool to assess risk of bias and Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) checklist for critical appraisal. Due to high heterogeneity of studies, narrative synthesis was used to summarize the data. Results The review consists of 11 studies which were categorized into five sections based on the components of FCC intervention provided in each individual study: 1. Information provision, and Enabling and partnership (n= 5); 2. Information provision, and Respectful and supportive care (n= 1); 3. Enabling and partnership (n= 2); 4. Enabling and partnership, and Respectful and supportive care (n= 2); 5. Information provision, Enabling and partnership and Respectful and supportive care (n= 1). Risk of bias was low in four studies, unclear in two studies, and high in five studies. Conclusion FCC interventions were found to be effective in improving caregivers‚Äô satisfaction with attainment of child and caregiver goals. Evidence from multiple studies does not strongly support the effectiveness of FCC interventions on caregiver‚Äôs mental health, parenting and personal outcomes. Limited evidence precludes a conclusion on the effectiveness of the components of FCC on well-being of caregivers of children with CP.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-255/v3?src=rss">The identification of retro-DNAs in primate genomes as DNA transposons mobilizing via retrotransposition [version 3; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Mobile elements (MEs) constitute a major portion of the genome in primates and other higher eukaryotes, and they play important role in genome evolution and gene function. MEs can be divided into two fundamentally different classes: DNA transposons which transpose in the genome in a ‚Äúcut-and-paste‚Äù style, and retrotransposons which propagate in a ‚Äúcopy-and-paste‚Äù fashion via a process involving transcription and reverse-transcription. In primate genomes, DNA transposons are mostly dead, while many retrotransposons are still highly active. We report here the identification of a unique group of MEs, which we call ‚Äúretro-DNAs‚Äù, for their combined characteristics of these two fundamentally different ME classes. Methods A comparative computational genomic approach was used to analyze the reference genome sequences of 10 primate species consisting of five apes, four monkeys, and marmoset. Results From our analysis, we identified a total of 1,750 retro-DNAs, representing 748 unique insertion events in the genomes of ten primate species including human. These retro-DNAs contain sequences of DNA transposons but lack the terminal inverted repeats (TIRs), the hallmark of DNA transposons. Instead, they show characteristics of retrotransposons, such as polyA tails, longer target-site duplications (TSDs), and the ‚ÄúTT/AAAA‚Äù insertion site motif, suggesting the use of the L1-based target-primed reverse transcription (TPRT) mechanism. At least 40% of these retro-DNAs locate into genic regions, presenting potentials for impacting gene function. More interestingly, some retro-DNAs, as well as their parent sites, show certain levels of expression, suggesting that they have the potential to create more retro-DNA copies in the present primate genomes. Conclusions Although small in number, the identification of these retro-DNAs reveals a new mean for propagating DNA transposons in primate genomes without active canonical DNA transposon activity. Our data also suggest that the TPRT machinery may transpose a wider variety of DNA sequences in the genomes.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) is a critical inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system that plays a vital role in modulating neuronal excitability. Dysregulation of GABAergic signaling, particularly involving the cotransporters NKCC1 and KCC2, has been implicated in various pathologies, including epilepsy, schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder, Down syndrome, and ischemia. NKCC1 facilitates chloride influx, whereas KCC2 mediates chloride efflux via potassium gradient. Altered expression and function of these cotransporters have been associated with excitotoxicity, inflammation, and cellular death in ischemic events characterized by reduced cerebral blood flow, leading to compromised tissue metabolism and subsequent cell death. NKCC1 inhibition has emerged as a potential therapeutic approach to attenuate intracellular chloride accumulation and mitigate neuronal damage during ischemic events. Similarly, targeting KCC2, which regulates chloride efflux, holds promise for improving outcomes and reducing neuronal damage under ischemic conditions. This review emphasizes the critical roles of GABA, NKCC1, and KCC2 in ischemic pathologies and their potential as therapeutic targets. Inhibiting or modulating the activity of these cotransporters represents a promising strategy for reducing neuronal damage, preventing excitotoxicity, and improving neurological outcomes following ischemic events. Furthermore, exploring the interactions between natural compounds and NKCC1/KCC2 provides additional avenues for potential therapeutic interventions for ischemic injury.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91429">Tuning apicobasal polarity and junctional recycling in the hemogenic endothelium orchestrates the morphodynamic complexity of emerging pre-hematopoietic stem cells</a></h4>

              
                Hematopoietic stem cells emerge in the embryo from an aortic-derived tissue called the hemogenic endothelium (HE). The HE appears to give birth to cells of different nature and fate but the molecular principles underlying this complexity are largely unknown. Here we show, in the zebrafish embryo, that two cell types emerge from the aortic floor with radically different morphodynamics. With the support of live imaging, we bring evidence suggesting that the mechanics underlying the two emergence types rely, or not, on apicobasal polarity establishment. While the first type is characterized by reinforcement of apicobasal polarity and maintenance of the apical/luminal membrane until release, the second type emerges via a dynamic process reminiscent of trans-endothelial migration. Interfering with Runx1 function suggests that the balance between the two emergence types depends on tuning apicobasal polarity at the level of the HE. In support of this and unexpectedly, we show that Pard3ba ‚Äì one of the four Pard3 proteins expressed in the zebrafish ‚Äì is sensitive to interference with Runx1 activity, in aortic endothelial cells. This supports the idea of a signaling cross talk controlling cell polarity and its associated features, between aortic and hemogenic cells. In addition, using new transgenic fish lines that express Junctional Adhesion Molecules and functional interference, we bring evidence for the essential role of ArhGEF11/PDZ-RhoGEF in controlling the HE-endothelial cell dynamic interface, including cell-cell intercalation, which is ultimately required for emergence completion. Overall, we highlight critical cellular and dynamic events of the endothelial-to-hematopoietic transition that support emergence complexity, with a potential impact on cell fate.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/76803">Brain representations of motion and position in the double-drift illusion</a></h4>

              
                In the ‚Äòdouble-drift‚Äô illusion, local motion within a window moving in the periphery of the visual field alters the window‚Äôs perceived path. The illusion is strong even when the eyes track a target whose motion matches the window so that the stimulus remains stable on the retina. This implies that the illusion involves the integration of retinal signals with non-retinal eye-movement signals. To identify where in the brain this integration occurs, we measured BOLD fMRI responses in visual cortex while subjects experienced the double-drift illusion. We then used a combination of univariate and multivariate decoding analyses to identify (1) which brain areas were sensitive to the illusion and (2) whether these brain areas contained information about the illusory stimulus trajectory. We identified a number of cortical areas that responded more strongly during the illusion than a control condition that was matched for low-level stimulus properties. Only in area hMT+ was it possible to decode the illusory trajectory. We additionally performed a number of important controls that rule out possible low-level confounds. Concurrent eye tracking confirmed that subjects accurately tracked the moving target; we were unable to decode the illusion trajectory using eye position measurements recorded during fMRI scanning, ruling out explanations based on differences in oculomotor behavior. Our results provide evidence for a perceptual representation in human visual cortex that incorporates extraretinal information.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94167">Pan-cortical 2-photon mesoscopic imaging and neurobehavioral alignment in awake, behaving mice</a></h4>

              
                The flow of neural activity across the neocortex during active sensory discrimination is constrained by task-specific cognitive demands, movements, and internal states. During behavior, the brain appears to sample from a broad repertoire of activation motifs. Understanding how these patterns of local and global activity are selected in relation to both spontaneous and task-dependent behavior requires in-depth study of densely sampled activity at single neuron resolution across large regions of cortex. In a significant advance toward this goal, we developed procedures to record mesoscale 2-photon Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging data from two novel <i>in vivo</i> preparations that, between them, allow for simultaneous access to nearly all 0f the mouse dorsal and lateral neocortex. As a proof of principle, we aligned neural activity with both behavioral primitives and high-level motifs to reveal the existence of large populations of neurons that coordinated their activity across cortical areas with spontaneous changes in movement and/or arousal. The methods we detail here facilitate the identification and exploration of widespread, spatially heterogeneous neural ensembles whose activity is related to diverse aspects of behavior.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93357">Reactivation strength during cued recall is modulated by graph distance within cognitive maps</a></h4>

              
                Declarative memory retrieval is thought to involve reinstatement of neuronal activity patterns elicited and encoded during a prior learning episode. Furthermore, it is suggested that two mechanisms operate during reinstatement, dependent on task demands: individual memory items can be reactivated simultaneously as a clustered occurrence or, alternatively, replayed sequentially as temporally separate instances. In the current study, participants learned associations between images that were embedded in a directed graph network and retained this information over a brief 8 min consolidation period. During a subsequent cued recall session, participants retrieved the learned information while undergoing magnetoencephalographic recording. Using a trained stimulus decoder, we found evidence for clustered reactivation of learned material. Reactivation strength of individual items during clustered reactivation decreased as a function of increasing graph distance, an ordering present solely for successful retrieval but not for retrieval failure. In line with previous research, we found evidence that sequential replay was dependent on retrieval performance and was most evident in low performers. The results provide evidence for distinct performance-dependent retrieval mechanisms, with graded clustered reactivation emerging as a plausible mechanism to search within abstract cognitive maps.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92511">mitoBKCa is functionally expressed in murine and human breast cancer cells and potentially contributes to metabolic reprogramming</a></h4>

              
                Alterations in the function of K<sup>+</sup> channels such as the voltage- and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> channel of large conductance (BK<sub>Ca</sub>) reportedly promote breast cancer (BC) development and progression. Underlying molecular mechanisms remain, however, elusive. Here, we provide electrophysiological evidence for a BK<sub>Ca</sub> splice variant localized to the inner mitochondrial membrane of murine and human BC cells (mitoBK<sub>Ca</sub>). Through a combination of genetic knockdown and knockout along with a cell permeable BK<sub>Ca</sub> channel blocker, we show that mitoBK<sub>Ca</sub> modulates overall cellular and mitochondrial energy production, and mediates the metabolic rewiring referred to as the ‚ÄòWarburg effect‚Äô, thereby promoting BC cell proliferation in the presence and absence of oxygen. Additionally, we detect mitoBK<sub>Ca</sub> and BK<sub>Ca</sub> transcripts in low or high abundance, respectively, in clinical BC specimens. Together, our results emphasize, that targeting mitoBK<sub>Ca</sub> could represent a treatment strategy for selected BC patients in future.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94869">Dual engagement of the nucleosomal acidic patches is essential for deposition of histone H2A.Z by SWR1C</a></h4>

              
                The yeast SWR1C chromatin remodeling enzyme catalyzes the ATP-dependent exchange of nucleosomal histone H2A for the histone variant H2A.Z, a key variant involved in a multitude of nuclear functions. How the 14-subunit SWR1C engages the nucleosomal substrate remains largely unknown. Studies on the ISWI, CHD1, and SWI/SNF families of chromatin remodeling enzymes have demonstrated key roles for the nucleosomal acidic patch for remodeling activity, however a role for this nucleosomal epitope in nucleosome editing by SWR1C has not been tested. Here, we employ a variety of biochemical assays to demonstrate an essential role for the acidic patch in the H2A.Z exchange reaction. Utilizing asymmetrically assembled nucleosomes, we demonstrate that the acidic patches on each face of the nucleosome are required for SWR1C-mediated dimer exchange, suggesting SWR1C engages the nucleosome in a ‚Äòpincer-like‚Äô conformation, engaging both patches simultaneously. Loss of a single acidic patch results in loss of high affinity nucleosome binding and nucleosomal stimulation of ATPase activity. We identify a conserved arginine-rich motif within the Swc5 subunit that binds the acidic patch and is key for dimer exchange activity. In addition, our cryoEM structure of a Swc5‚Äìnucleosome complex suggests that promoter proximal, histone H2B ubiquitylation may regulate H2A.Z deposition. Together these findings provide new insights into how SWR1C engages its nucleosomal substrate to promote efficient H2A.Z deposition.

                The role of the diverse brain cell types in focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) development and epileptogenicity is not fully understood. Here, we performed multi-omics single-cell sequencing to characterize the chromatin accessibility and transcriptomes of cortical lesions and non-lesion areas from individuals with FCD IIa and IIb, the most prevalent presentations of this neurodevelopmental disorder. Our integrative analyses of the multimodal cell atlas, encompassing 61,525 nuclei with paired open chromatin and gene expression, uncovered a selective loss of upper-layer excitatory neurons and identified a lesion-specific population expressing NEFM, a neurofilament associated with dysmorphic neurons. In glial compartments, we observed a shift towards immature astrocytic populations exhibiting features of reactive astrocytes and balloon cells. Moreover, we identified activated microglial cell states emerging in FCD IIb, indicating that neuroinflammation contributes to FCD pathogenesis. This multimodal cell atlas is a valuable resource for exploring the cellular landscape and informing novel therapeutic approaches for cortical malformations.

">Attentional propagation of conceptual information in the human brain</a></h4>

              
                The visual environment is complicated, and humans and other animals accordingly prioritise some sources of information over others through the deployment of spatial attention. We presume that attention has the ultimate purpose of guiding the abstraction of information from perceptual experience in the development of concepts and categories. However, neuroscientific investigation has focussed closely on identification of the systems and algorithms that support attentional control, or that instantiate the effect of attention on sensation and perception. Much less is known about how attention impacts the acquisition and activation of high-level information in the brain. Here, we use machine learning of EEG and concurrently-recorded EEG/MRI to temporally and anatomically characterise the neural network that abstracts from attended perceptual information to activate and construct semantic and conceptual representations. We find that the trial-wise amplitude of N2pc - an ERP component closely linked to selective attention - predicts the rapid emergence of information about semantic categories in EEG. Similar analysis of EEG/MRI shows that N2pc predicts MRI-derived category information in a network including VMPFC, posterior parietal cortex, and anterior insula. These brain areas appear critically involved in the attention-mediated translation of perceptual information to concepts, semantics, and action plans.

                Neurological and ocular manifestations were reported in COVID-19 patients and in SARS-CoV-2 infected animal models. However, the effects of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VoC) on the eyes and the retina remain unclear. Here, we investigate the cellular and molecular consequences of SARS-CoV-2 VoC infection on the eye and retina in mice and hamsters. Infection with the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 and the Gamma VoC induced a subtle increase in the eye volume of K18-hAce2 mice, but no morphological alteration was observed in hamsters eyes. Evaluation of the ocular tropism revealed that distinct SARS-CoV-2 VoC reached the eye globe, but not the retina of K18-hAce2 mice. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 variants are detected in the hamsters retina during both acute infection and after disease recovery. Despite the presence of viral RNA, no inflammation was observed in the hamster retina, as evidenced by unchanged microglial cell density and unaltered gene expression of several immune mediators. Altogether, these findings indicate a limited impact of SARS-CoV-2 variants on the eye and retina.

                Memory consolidation is highly influenced by ongoing experiences. We explore the temporal rules that determine whether events are cooperatively associated or competitively separated. We show that neutral events are associated with fearful events if they occur within less than 30 minutes. In some individuals, memory association can lead to a competitive suppression of the fearful response by the neutral event. Activation of the thalamic MGm inputs to the lateral amygdala, led to an increase in memory association, whereas manipulation of the cortical inputs had no effect. Introducing a third event leads to competition depending on the temporal relationship between the initial association and the competitive event. Our results show a critical temporal rule of memory association, modulated by thalamic activity that shapes fear memory consolidation.

                The present study investigated the neuromodulatory substrates of salience processing and its impact on memory encoding and behaviour, with a specific focus on two distinct types of salience: reward and contextual unexpectedness. 46 participants performed a novel task paradigm modulating these two aspects independently and allowing for investigating their distinct and interactive effects on memory encoding while undergoing high resolution fMRI. By using advanced image processing techniques tailored to examine midbrain and brainstem nuclei with high precision, our study additionally aimed to elucidate differential activation patterns in subcortical nuclei in response to reward-associated and contextually unexpected stimuli, including distinct pathways involving in particular dopaminergic modulation. We observed a differential involvement of the ventral striatum, substantia nigra and caudate nucleus, as well as a functional specialisation within the subregions of the cingulate cortex for the two salience types. Moreover, distinct subregions within the substantia nigra in processing salience could be identified. Dorsal areas preferentially processed salience related to stimulus processing (of both reward and contextual unexpectedness) versus ventral areas were involved in salience-related memory encoding (for contextual unexpectedness only). These functional specialisations within SN are in line with different projection patterns of dorsal and ventral SN to brain areas supporting attention and memory, respectively. By disentangling stimulus processing and memory encoding related to two salience types, we hope to further consolidate our understanding of neuromodulatory structures' differential as well as interactive roles in modulating behavioural responses to salient events.

">Deficiency of the histone lysine demethylase KDM5B causes autism-like phenotypes via increased NMDAR signalling</a></h4>

              
                Loss-of-function mutations in genes encoding lysine methyltransferases (KMTs) and demethylases (KDMs) responsible for regulating the trimethylation of histone 3 on lysine 4 (H3K4me3) are associated with neurodevelopmental conditions, including autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability. To study the specific role of H3K4me3 demethylation, we investigated neurodevelopmental phenotypes in mice without KDM5B demethylase activity. These mice exhibited autism-like behaviours and increased brain size. H3K4me3 levels and the expression of neurodevelopmental genes were increased in the developing Kdm5b mutant neocortex. These included elevated expression of Grin2d. The Grin2d gene product NMDAR2D was increased in synaptosomes isolated from the Kdm5b-deficient neocortex and treating mice with the NMDAR antagonist memantine rescued deficits in ultrasonic vocalisations and reduced repetitive digging behaviours. These findings suggest that increased H3K4me3 levels and associated Grin2d gene upregulation disrupt brain development and function, leading to socio-communication deficits and repetitive behaviours, and identify a potential therapeutic target for neurodevelopmental disorders associated with KDM5B deficiency.

                Semantic representation emerges from distributed multisensory modalities, yet a comprehensive understanding of the functional changing pattern within convergence zones or hubs integrating multisensory semantic information remains elusive. In this study, employing information-theoretic metrics, we quantified gesture and speech information, alongside their interaction, utilizing entropy and mutual information (MI). Neural activities were assessed via interruption effects induced by High-Definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS). Additionally, chronometric double-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and high-temporal event-related potentials were utilized to decipher dynamic neural changes resulting from various information contributors. Results showed gradual inhibition of both inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and posterior middle temporal gyrus (pMTG) as degree of gesture-speech integration, indexed by MI, increased. Moreover, a time-sensitive and staged progression of neural engagement was observed, evidenced by distinct correlations between neural activity patterns and entropy measures of speech and gesture, as well as MI, across early sensory and lexico-semantic processing stages. These findings illuminate the gradual nature of neural activity during multisensory gesture-speech semantic processing, shaped by dynamic gesture constraints and speech encoding, thereby offering insights into the neural mechanisms underlying multisensory language processing.

">Developmental maturation of millimeter-scale functional networks across brain areas</a></h4>

              
                Interacting with the environment to process sensory information, generate perceptions, and shape behavior engages neural networks in brain areas with highly varied representations, ranging from unimodal sensory cortices to higher-order association areas. Recent work suggests a much greater degree of commonality across areas, with distributed and modular networks present in both sensory and non-sensory areas during early development. However, it is currently unknown whether this initially common modular structure undergoes an equally common developmental trajectory, or whether such a modular functional organization persists in some areas -- such as primary visual cortex -- but not others. Here we examine the development of network organization across diverse cortical regions in ferrets of both sexes using in vivo widefield calcium imaging of spontaneous activity. We find that all regions examined, including both primary sensory cortices (visual, auditory, and somatosensory -- V1, A1, and S1, respectively) and higher order association areas (prefrontal and posterior parietal cortices) exhibit a largely similar pattern of changes over an approximately 3 week developmental period spanning eye opening and the transition to predominantly externally-driven sensory activity. We find that both a modular functional organization and millimeter-scale correlated networks remain present across all cortical areas examined. These networks weakened over development in most cortical areas, but strengthened in V1. Overall, the conserved maintenance of modular organization across different cortical areas suggests a common pathway of network refinement, and suggests that a modular organization -- known to encode functional representations in visual areas -- may be similarly engaged in highly diverse brain areas.

                The comorbidity of autism spectrum disorders and severe gastrointestinal symptoms is well- established, yet the molecular underpinnings remain unknown. The identification of high-confidence large-effect autism risk genes offers the opportunity to identify convergent, underlying biology by studying these genes in the context of the gastrointestinal system. Here we show that the expression of these genes is enriched in human prenatal gut neurons as well as their migratory progenitors, suggesting that the development and/or function of these neurons may be disrupted by autism-associated pathogenic variants, leading to gastrointestinal dysfunction. Here we document the prevalence of gastrointestinal issues in patients with large-effect variants in sixteen of these genes, highlighting dysmotility, consistent with potential enteric neuron dysfunction. Using the high- throughput diploid frog Xenopus tropicalis, we individually target five of these genes (SYNGAP1, CHD8, SCN2A, CHD2, and DYRK1A) and observe disrupted enteric neuronal progenitor migration for each. More extensive analysis of DYRK1A reveals that perturbation causes gut dysmotility in vivo, which can be ameliorated by treatment with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (escitalopram) or a serotonin receptor 6 agonist, identified by in vivo drug screening. This work suggests that atypical development of enteric neurons contributes to the gastrointestinal distress commonly seen in individuals with autism and that increasing serotonin signaling may be a productive therapeutic avenue.

	<p>Protein kinase C (PKC) is a diverse enzyme family crucial for cell signalling in various organs. Its dysregulation is linked to numerous diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular disorders, and neurological problems. In the brain, PKC plays pivotal roles in synaptic plasticity, learning, memory, and neuronal survival. Specifically, PKC&amp;amp;rsquo;s involvement in Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s Disease (AD) pathogenesis is of significant interest. The dysregulation of PKC signalling has been linked to neurological disorders, including AD. This review elucidates PKC&amp;amp;rsquo;s pivotal role in neurological health, particularly its implications in AD pathogenesis and chronic alcohol addiction. AD, characterised by neurodegeneration, implicates PKC dysregulation in synaptic dysfunction and cognitive decline. Conversely, chronic alcohol consumption elicits neural adaptations intertwined with PKC signalling, exacerbating addictive behaviours. By unravelling PKC&amp;amp;rsquo;s involvement in these afflictions, potential therapeutic avenues emerge, offering promise for ameliorating their debilitating effects. This review navigates the complex interplay between PKC, AD pathology, and alcohol addiction, illuminating pathways for future neurotherapeutic interventions.</p>

	<p>Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD), multiple sclerosis (MS), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are examples of neurodegenerative movement disorders (NMDs), which are defined by a gradual loss of motor function that is frequently accompanied by cognitive decline. Although genetic abnormalities have long been acknowledged as significant factors, new research indicates that epigenetic alterations are crucial for the initiation and development of disease. This review delves into the complex interactions that exist between the pathophysiology of NMDs and epigenetic mechanisms such DNA methylation, histone modifications, and non-coding RNAs. Here, we examine how these epigenetic changes could affect protein aggregation, neuroinflammation, and gene expression patterns, thereby influencing the viability and functionality of neurons. Through the clarification of the epigenetic terrain underpinning neurodegenerative movement disorders, this review seeks to enhance comprehension of the underlying mechanisms of the illness and augment the creation of innovative therapeutic strategies.</p>

	<p>Anthropometric measures at birth, indexing prenatal growth, are associated with later cognitive development. Children in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) are at elevated risk for impaired prenatal and early postnatal growth and enduring cognitive deficits. However, the associations of neonatal physical growth with neural activity are not well-characterized in LMIC contexts, given the dearth of early childhood neuroimaging research in these settings. The current study examined birth length, weight, and head circumference as predictors of EEG relative power over the first three years of life in rural Limpopo Province, South Africa, controlling for postnatal growth and socioeconomic status (SES). A larger head circumference at birth predicted lower relative gamma power, lower right hemisphere relative beta power, and higher relative alpha and theta power. A greater birth length also predicted lower relative gamma power. There were interactions with timepoints such that the associations of birth head circumference and length with EEG power were most pronounced at the 7-month assessment and were attenuated at the 17- and 36-month assessments. The results identify birth head circumference and length as specific predictors of infant neural activity within an under-resourced context.</p>

	<p>Restrictive dieters are those who expect to achieve body shape and weight control through dieting. However, they often have difficulty suppressing the desire to consume food when confronted with it. It has been shown that when high- and low-calorie foods are presented together, the attention of restrictive eaters is preferentially directed to high-calorie foods. However, whether attentional bias occurs when low-calorie foods are present alone and whether the allocation of attentional resources is consistent with that for high-calorie foods has yet to be explored. The present study focused on the effects of high-/low-calorie foods on attentional bias in restrictive dieters. Seventy-eight participants were recruited to participate in the experiment via the Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire (DEBQ) scale, which is administered in a rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) task. The results revealed that failed restrictive dieters had the lowest percentage of correct answers at the lag2 level, indicating attentional bias. Failed restrictive dieters allocated more attentional resources to high-calorie foods than to low-calorie foods. Restrictive dieters showed no attentional bias when low-calorie foods were presented alone. The results suggest that low-calorie foods do not elicit an attentional bias in restrictive dieters and that the allocation of attentional resources is not consistent when compared to that for high-calorie foods.</p>

                Background Head injuries are considered as a silent epidemic due to the high incidence rate throughout the world. The main cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with head injury is cerebral edema which is defined as abnormal fluid accumulation in the brain parenchyma. Mannitol is a hyperosmolar solution given to reduce fluid volume in the brain. Increased high intracranial pressure can affect prognosis and can be evaluated by assessing clinical outcomes in patients with severe traumatic brain injury using the Glasgow Outcome Discharge Scale (GODS) instrument. Methods Observational analytical study with a cross sectional design on 50 patients with severe traumatic brain injury at dr. Zainoel Abidin General Hospital Banda Aceh to determine the effect of mannitol use on the clinical outcomes of severe traumatic brain injury patients which used t test analysis. Results The mean value of the group that received mannitol had a higher GODS score than the group that did not receive mannitol. The results of the T test between groups obtained a p value of 0.000 which is smaller than 0.05, so it can be concluded that the use of mannitol has an effect on the GODS score in Severe traumatic brain injury patients. The results showed that the mean GODS value in patients who received mannitol was higher than those who did not receive mannitol. Conclusion This concludes that the administration of mannitol is effective in improving the clinical outcomes of patients with severe traumatic brain injury at dr. Zainoel Abidin General Hospital Banda Aceh.

                Background The objectives of the study were to assess the quality of life (QOL) among women with breast cancer and associate the QOL with selected background variables. Methods A cross-sectional descriptive study was adopted for the study. Data collection was done in oncology units of tertiary care centers. The sample type includes woman with breast cancer at stage I or II or IIIa as per TNM classification. A purposive sampling technique was followed with a total sample size of 60. The tool used was the Quality of Life (QOL) questionnaire - Breast Cancer Version by National Medical Center & Beckman Research institute. Results The QOL among study participants revealed that 42 (70%) had average QOL and 18 (30%) had poor QOL. The QOL was examined in various domains such as physical wellbeing, where the mean score was 38.47, the psychological wellbeing mean score was 60.58, social wellbeing mean was 38.10 and spiritual wellbeing mean was 38.58. There was an association between residence and occupation with QOL at p<0.05. Further there was an association between the clinical variable such as period and stages of cancer at p<0.05 and type of treatment at p<0.01. Conclusions Breast cancer diagnosis has an undeniable effect on women at work, home and can have rapid consequences for other members in the family. Evaluation of QOL and associated factors would help the health care professionals especially nurses to organize health promotion activities and counselling sessions in varied health care settings to overcome challenges and improve Quality of Life.

                <p>What factors are associated with career outcomes among biomedical PhDs? Research to date has focused on drivers of interest in (and intention to pursue) various careers, especially during graduate school, but fewer studies have investigated participants&rsquo; ultimate career outcomes. Even less is known about what factors matter for groups historically underrepresented in the US science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce, such as women, some racial and ethnic groups, and persons with disabilities (  <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B94">National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics (NCSES), 2021a</cross-ref>). This study reports a new analysis of data from 781 PhD neuroscientists that were obtained from a retrospective survey (  <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B96">Ullrich et al., 2021</cross-ref>) to investigate the factors that influence the career sector in which neuroscience PhDs are employed and whether there were group differences according to social identity. We find evidence of academia as a "default path" for incoming PhD students, but interest in different careers increases over time. Those who remained in academia had greater acceptance of the structural aspects of academic careers, such as promotion and tenure processes, and greater faculty support during postdoctoral training. Conversely, prioritizing monetary compensation and/or varied work were associated with not being in academia, while a strong interest in research was positively associated with being in nonacademic research. Somewhat surprisingly, there were few interactions with gender, and no interactions with underrepresentation status, although perhaps this was due to lower statistical power for these analyses. Our findings also underscore the role of advisors, networking, and personal relationships in securing employment in STEM.</p>

                <p>A hallmark of Parkinson's disease is the appearance of correlated oscillatory discharge throughout the cortico-basal ganglia (BG) circuits. In the primate globus pallidus (GP), where the discharge of GP neurons is normally uncorrelated, pairs of GP neurons exhibit oscillatory spike correlations with a broad distribution of pairwise phase delays in experimental parkinsonism. The transition to oscillatory correlations is thought to indicate the collapse of the normally segregated information channels traversing the BG. The large phase delays are thought to reflect pathological changes in synaptic connectivity in the BG. Here we study the structure and phase delays of spike correlations measured from neurons in the mouse external GP (GPe) subjected to identical 1&ndash;100&nbsp;Hz sinusoidal drive but recorded in separate experiments. First, we found that spectral modes of a GPe neuron's empirical instantaneous phase response curve (iPRC) elucidate at what phases of the oscillatory drive the GPe neuron locks when it is entrained and the distribution of phases at which it spikes when it is not. Then, we show that in this case the pairwise spike cross-correlation equals the cross-correlation function of these spike phase distributions. Finally, we show that the distribution of GPe phase delays arises from the diversity of iPRCs and is broadened when the neurons become entrained. Modeling GPe networks with realistic intranuclear connectivity demonstrates that the connectivity decorrelates GPe neurons without affecting phase delays. Thus, common oscillatory input gives rise to GPe correlations whose structure and pairwise phase delays reflect their intrinsic properties captured by their iPRCs.</p>

                <p>Norepinephrine (NE), a neuromodulator released by locus ceruleus (LC) neurons throughout the cortex, influences arousal and learning through extrasynaptic vesicle exocytosis. While NE within cortical regions has been viewed as a homogenous field, recent studies have demonstrated heterogeneous axonal dynamics and advances in GPCR-based fluorescent sensors permit direct observation of the local dynamics of NE at cellular scale. To investigate how the spatiotemporal dynamics of NE release in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) affect neuronal firing, we employed in vivo two-photon imaging of layer 2/3 of the PFC in order to observe fine-scale neuronal calcium and NE dynamics concurrently. In this proof of principle study, we found that local and global NE fields can decouple from one another, providing a substrate for local NE spatiotemporal activity patterns. Optic flow analysis revealed putative release and reuptake events which can occur at the same location, albeit at different times, indicating the potential to create a heterogeneous NE field. Utilizing generalized linear models, we demonstrated that cellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluctuations are influenced by both the local and global NE field. However, during periods of local/global NE field decoupling, the local field drives cell firing dynamics rather than the global field. These findings underscore the significance of localized, phasic NE fluctuations for structuring cell firing, which may provide local neuromodulatory control of cortical activity.</p>

The National Mesothelioma Virtual Bank (NMVB) is a biobank in which mesothelioma annotated biospecimens can be made widely available to the research community. Here, we summarized the significant research findings from 20 publications that utilized the NMVB samples for novel biomarker and therapeutic discoveries. The results showed that the use of the NMVB resource was dispersed among a variety of basic science topics including, but not limited to, biomarkers, abnormal gene expression, and potential therapeutic targets. Positive biomarkers included several miRNAs and antibodies, HMGB1, ATG5, PIAS3, pancytokeratin and GATA3. Genes that had mutations or high/low levels of expression were BAP1, a human control gene of importance in this disease, as well as various cytokines, and checkpoint inhibitors TM4SF1, PKM2, ARHGDIA, COBLL1, WT1, FOXM1, and CD30. Treatments investigated include thiostrepton, interferon-Œ≤ gene, and Brentuximab. Publications reviewed indicated a significant impact of the NMVB resource utilized in significant studies focusing on biomarker and therapeutic discoveries, which can act as a model for rare diseases, especially in oncology.

                This article attempts to explore the synthetic relationship between group identities and their effects on cultural memory in Margaret Atwood‚Äôs The Testaments. It will investigate how Atwood‚Äôs dystopian fiction conspicuously weaves threads of cultural identity in the totalitarian society. While examining the work, the researchers found three forms of Memory Figures channelizing society: Architecture and time, Identical groupings, and Language. With significant attention to the prequel, The Handmaid‚Äôs Tale, this article will consider The Testaments for the dissection of hard-wired cultural memory formation. This article focuses on how a politically unsettled society of Gilead, through its Memory Figures, inscribes a cultural narrative while instructing individual memories. Atwood‚Äôs usage of these Memory Figures to achieve a theocratic regime has been scrutinized in this article. The Architecture of Gilead was given an intrusive wall of glass, where the symbol of eyes prevails, to externalize the surveillance of God on each one of its citizens, thereby forming a cultural memory of subjectivity. To make the citizens identify with groups, this theocratic regime specifies roles to citizens according to their rank for men and according to reproductive efficiency for women. Keeping in view the relevance of language in forming cultural memory, Atwood prescribed a set of greetings such as ‚Äòunder his eyes,‚Äô and ‚Äòpraise be‚Äô to make profound imprints on the individual memory of citizens, which has been discussed in the study. These three Memory Figures simultaneously form collective memory imprints on the citizens of Gilead, which in time became inherent cultural memories. This article explores how, by politicizing the issue of cultural memory in The Testaments, Atwood taps into the agency of people and establishes language control (communicative) to form the cultural memory narrative.

                Membranous nephropathy (MN) is the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in adults. It may be idiopathic or due to secondary causes. Among the secondary causes, heavy metals like mercury are the one among others. Here is a male with nil comorbidities who, upon exposure to mercury-containing skin cream, developed proteinuria, which, on evaluation, was found to have dual renal lesions like membranous nephropathy and chronic interstitial nephritis. The uniform PLA2R staining within the glomerular capillary walls shows the ability of mercury to induce inflammation and autoimmunity. This case strengthens the findings of in vitro studies about mercury-induced inflammatory processes.

                Introduction Comprehensive oral care is a service centered around the patient, and individuals who need it the most often face limited access. Patient perception acts as a guide for enhancing quality, ensuring patients‚Äô future intent to utilize the services and facilitating recommendations to others. The present study aimed to assess the patients‚Äô perception of comprehensive dental services availed at a Primary Health Center (PHC). Methods This qualitative study was based on a phenomenological interpretive approach, and judgment sampling method was employed. A validated interview guide, developed from relevant literature was employed in the local language to conduct interviews among adults visiting the PHC, gathering their views regarding the services provided. The interviews were audio recorded on a digital voice recorder, and files were password protected. Content saturation guided the determination of the final number of participants interviewed. After translating and transcribing the interviews, thematic analysis and coding were performed using ATLAS. ti 23 for Windows. Results A total of 12 participants were included in the study, following data saturation. Among them, there were 8(66.7%) female and 4(33.3%) male participants. Ten overarching main themes were discerned through the assigned codes, including positive views, neutral views, negative views, previous dental clinics visited, previous experience with dental treatment, treatments sought at the center, referrals, source of information about the dental center, subsequent visits and suggestions for improvement. Conclusions The findings of this study revealed a positive patient perception of the comprehensive dental services offered at the PHC. Through insightful interviews, various strengths, and areas for improvement regarding the center and care provision were identified. These insights provide valuable suggestions that can be applied to elevate the utilization of dental services, ensuring continuous improvement in patient care.

                Background Technology has completely transformed healthcare, starting with X-ray machines and MRIs to telehealth and robotic surgeries to e-health records. The launch of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) serves as a milestone in medical history, offering benefits such as smaller incisions, shorter hospital stays, and faster recovery, making it a preferred surgical option. This study mainly explores patients‚Äô willingness to adopt robot-assisted surgery (RAS) technology in a surgical intervention and is assessed in the backdrop of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). Methods This research project employs a post-positivist research philosophy and a cross-sectional research design. A structured, pre-tested questionnaire was used to collect data from 280 respondents. Results The results revealed that trust had a significant impact on Perceived Usefulness (Œ≤ = 0.099) and Perceived Ease of Use (Œ≤ = .157), and eHealth literacy had a significant impact on Perceived Ease of Use (Œ≤ = 0.438) and Perceived Usefulness (Œ≤ = 0.454). Additionally, Perceived Usefulness partially influenced behavioral intention (Œ≤ = 0.123), and attitude had a significant influence on behavioral intention (Œ≤ = 0.612). The analysis revealed an insignificant impact of eHealth literacy on Perceived Usefulness (Œ≤ = 0.067). The Standard Root Mean Square Residual (SRMR) value was <0.8. Mediation analysis also revealed partial mediation between the constructs. The SRMR rating of this model is 0.067, indicating that it fits the data well. Conclusion This study revealed that a patient's intention will be high if he or she believes that RAS is beneficial in treating his or her ailment. In comparison, information related to RAS is clearly known, and it does not directly affect selection intention. eHealth literacy is a significant antecedent to patients‚Äô behavioral intention. Hence, the healthcare industry must devise strategies to promote the acceptance of RAS at all levels.

                Background Access to sample-level metadata is important when selecting public metagenomic sequencing datasets for reuse in new biological analyses. The Standards, Precautions, and Advances in Ancient Metagenomics community (SPAAM, https://spaam-community.org) has previously published AncientMetagenomeDir, a collection of curated and standardised sample metadata tables for metagenomic and microbial genome datasets generated from ancient samples. However, while sample-level information is useful for identifying relevant samples for inclusion in new projects, Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) library construction and sequencing metadata are also essential for appropriately reprocessing ancient metagenomic data. Currently, recovering information for downloading and preparing such data is difficult when laboratory and bioinformatic metadata is heterogeneously recorded in prose-based publications. Methods Through a series of community-based hackathon events, AncientMetagenomeDir was updated to provide standardised library-level metadata of existing and new ancient metagenomic samples. In tandem, the companion tool 'AMDirT' was developed to facilitate rapid data filtering and downloading of ancient metagenomic data, as well as improving automated metadata curation and validation for AncientMetagenomeDir. Results AncientMetagenomeDir was extended to include standardised metadata of over 6000 ancient metagenomic libraries. The companion tool 'AMDirT' provides both graphical- and command-line interface based access to such metadata for users from a wide range of computational backgrounds. We also report on errors with metadata reporting that appear to commonly occur during data upload and provide suggestions on how to improve the quality of data sharing by the community. Conclusions Together, both standardised metadata reporting and tooling will help towards easier incorporation and reuse of public ancient metagenomic datasets into future analyses.

                <p>by Franz Wurm, Benjamin Ernst, Marco Steinhauser</p>

The structural credit assignment problem arises when the causal structure between actions and subsequent outcomes is hidden from direct observation. To solve this problem and enable goal-directed behavior, an agent has to infer structure and form a representation thereof. In the scope of this study, we investigate a possible solution in the human brain. We recorded behavioral and electrophysiological data from human participants in a novel variant of the bandit task, where multiple actions lead to multiple outcomes. Crucially, the mapping between actions and outcomes was hidden and not instructed to the participants. Human choice behavior revealed clear hallmarks of credit assignment and learning. Moreover, a computational model which formalizes action selection as the competition between multiple representations of the hidden structure was fit to account for participants data. Starting in a state of uncertainty about the correct representation, the central mechanism of this model is the arbitration of action control towards the representation which minimizes surprise about outcomes. Crucially, single-trial latent-variable analysis reveals that the neural patterns clearly support central quantitative predictions of this surprise minimization model. The results suggest that neural activity is not only related to reinforcement learning under correct as well as incorrect task representations but also reflects central mechanisms of credit assignment and behavioral arbitration.

                <p>by Lucy Lansch-Justen, Meriem El Karoui, Helen K. Alexander</p>

Exposure to environmental stressors, including certain antibiotics, induces stress responses in bacteria. Some of these responses increase mutagenesis and thus potentially accelerate resistance evolution. Many studies report increased mutation rates under stress, often using the standard experimental approach of fluctuation assays. However, single-cell studies have revealed that many stress responses are heterogeneously expressed in bacterial populations, which existing estimation methods have not yet addressed. We develop a population dynamic model that considers heterogeneous stress responses (subpopulations of cells with the response <i>off</i> or <i>on</i>) that impact both mutation rate and cell division rate, inspired by the DNA-damage response in <i>Escherichia coli</i> (SOS response). We derive the mutant count distribution arising in fluctuation assays under this model and then implement maximum likelihood estimation of the mutation-rate increase specifically associated with the expression of the stress response. Using simulated mutant count data, we show that our inference method allows for accurate and precise estimation of the mutation-rate increase, provided that this increase is sufficiently large and the induction of the response also reduces the division rate. Moreover, we find that in many cases, either heterogeneity in stress responses or mutant fitness costs could explain similar patterns in fluctuation assay data, suggesting that separate experiments would be required to identify the true underlying process. In cases where stress responses and mutation rates are heterogeneous, current methods still correctly infer the effective increase in population mean mutation rate, but we provide a novel method to infer distinct stress-induced mutation rates, which could be important for parameterising evolutionary models.

                <p>by Xi Chen, Tam√°s I. J√≥zsa, Danilo Cardim, Chiara Robba, Marek Czosnyka, Stephen J. Payne</p>

In ischaemic stroke, a large reduction in blood supply can lead to the breakdown of the blood-brain barrier and to cerebral oedema after reperfusion therapy. The resulting fluid accumulation in the brain may contribute to a significant rise in intracranial pressure (ICP) and tissue deformation. Changes in the level of ICP are essential for clinical decision-making and therapeutic strategies. However, the measurement of ICP is constrained by clinical techniques and obtaining the exact values of the ICP has proven challenging. In this study, we propose the first computational model for the simulation of cerebral oedema following acute ischaemic stroke for the investigation of ICP and midline shift (MLS) relationship. The model consists of three components for the simulation of healthy blood flow, occluded blood flow and oedema, respectively. The healthy and occluded blood flow components are utilized to obtain oedema core geometry and then imported into the oedema model for the simulation of oedema growth. The simulation results of the model are compared with clinical data from 97 traumatic brain injury patients for the validation of major model parameters. Midline shift has been widely used for the diagnosis, clinical decision-making, and prognosis of oedema patients. Therefore, we focus on quantifying the relationship between ICP and midline shift (MLS) and identify the factors that can affect the ICP-MLS relationship. Three major factors are investigated, including the brain geometry, blood-brain barrier damage severity and the types of oedema (including rare types of oedema). Meanwhile, the two major types (stress and tension/compression) of mechanical brain damage are also presented and the differences in the stress, tension, and compression between the intraparenchymal and periventricular regions are discussed. This work helps to predict ICP precisely and therefore provides improved clinical guidance for the treatment of brain oedema.

                <p>by Thomas Rawson, Wes Hinsley, Raphael Sonabend, Elizaveta Semenova, Anne Cori, Neil M Ferguson</p>

Considerable spatial heterogeneity has been observed in COVID-19 transmission across administrative areas of England throughout the pandemic. This study investigates what drives these differences. We constructed a probabilistic case count model for 306 administrative areas of England across 95 weeks, fit using a Bayesian evidence synthesis framework. We incorporate the impact of acquired immunity, of spatial exportation of cases, and 16 spatially-varying socio-economic, socio-demographic, health, and mobility variables. Model comparison assesses the relative contributions of these respective mechanisms. We find that spatially-varying and time-varying differences in week-to-week transmission were definitively associated with differences in: time spent at home, variant-of-concern proportion, and adult social care funding. However, model comparison demonstrates that the impact of these terms is negligible compared to the role of spatial exportation between administrative areas. While these results confirm the impact of some, but not all, static measures of spatially-varying inequity in England, our work corroborates the finding that observed differences in disease transmission during the pandemic were predominantly driven by underlying epidemiological factors rather than aggregated metrics of demography and health inequity between areas. Further work is required to assess how health inequity more broadly contributes to these epidemiological factors.

                <p>by Akseli Niemel√§, Artturi Koivuniemi</p>

Lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) exhibits Œ±-activity on high-density and Œ≤-activity on low-density lipoproteins. However, the molecular determinants governing LCAT activation by different apolipoproteins remain elusive. Uncovering these determinants would offer the opportunity to design and explore advanced therapies against dyslipidemias. Here, we have conducted coarse-grained and all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of LCAT with nanodiscs made with Œ±-helical amphiphilic peptides either derived from apolipoproteins A1 and E (apoA1 and apoE) or apoA1 mimetic peptide 22A that was optimized to activate LCAT. This study aims to explore what drives the binding of peptides to our previously identified interaction site in LCAT. We hypothesized that this approach could be used to screen for binding sites of LCAT in different apolipoproteins and would provide insights to differently localized LCAT activities. Our screening approach was able to discriminate apoA1 helixes 4, 6, and 7 as key contributors to the interaction with LCAT supporting the previous research data. The simulations provided detailed molecular determinants driving the interaction with LCAT: the formation of hydrogen bonds or salt bridges between peptides E4 or D4 and LCAT S236 or K238 residues. Additionally, salt bridging between R7 and D73 was observed, depending on the availability of R7. Expanding our investigation to diverse plasma proteins, we detected novel LCAT binding helixes in apoL1, apoB100, and serum amyloid A. Our findings suggest that the same binding determinants, involving E4 or D4 -S236 and R7-D73 interactions, influence LCAT Œ≤-activity on low-density lipoproteins, where apoE and or apoB100 are hypothesized to interact with LCAT.

Novel mosquito genetic control tools, such as CRISPR-based gene drives, hold great promise in reducing the global burden of vector-borne diseases. As these technologies advance through the research and development pipeline, there is a growing need for modeling frameworks incorporating increasing levels of entomological and epidemiological detail in order to address questions regarding logistics and biosafety. Epidemiological predictions are becoming increasingly relevant to the development of target product profiles and the design of field trials and interventions, while entomological surveillance is becoming increasingly important to regulation and biosafety. We present MGDrivE 3 (Mosquito Gene Drive Explorer 3), a new version of a previously-developed framework, MGDrivE 2, that investigates the spatial population dynamics of mosquito genetic control systems and their epidemiological implications. The new framework incorporates three major developments: i) a decoupled sampling algorithm allowing the vector portion of the MGDrivE framework to be paired with a more detailed epidemiological framework, ii) a version of the Imperial College London malaria transmission model, which incorporates age structure, various forms of immunity, and human and vector interventions, and iii) a surveillance module that tracks mosquitoes captured by traps throughout the simulation. Example MGDrivE 3 simulations are presented demonstrating the application of the framework to a CRISPR-based homing gene drive linked to dual disease-refractory genes and their potential to interrupt local malaria transmission. Simulations are also presented demonstrating surveillance of such a system by a network of mosquito traps. MGDrivE 3 is freely available as an open-source R package on CRAN (https://cran.r-project.org/package=MGDrivE2) (version 2.1.0), and extensive examples and vignettes are provided. We intend the software to aid in understanding of human health impacts and biosafety of mosquito genetic control tools, and continue to iterate per feedback from the genetic control community.

                <p>by Andre J. Faure, Ben Lehner, Ver√≥nica Mir√≥ Pina, Claudia Serrano Colome, Donate Weghorn</p>

Accurate models describing the relationship between genotype and phenotype are necessary in order to understand and predict how mutations to biological sequences affect the fitness and evolution of living organisms. The apparent abundance of epistasis (genetic interactions), both between and within genes, complicates this task and how to build mechanistic models that incorporate epistatic coefficients (genetic interaction terms) is an open question. The Walsh-Hadamard transform represents a rigorous computational framework for calculating and modeling epistatic interactions at the level of individual genotypic values (known as genetical, biological or physiological epistasis), and can therefore be used to address fundamental questions related to sequence-to-function encodings. However, one of its main limitations is that it can only accommodate two alleles (amino acid or nucleotide states) per sequence position. In this paper we provide an extension of the Walsh-Hadamard transform that allows the calculation and modeling of background-averaged epistasis (also known as ensemble epistasis) in genetic landscapes with an arbitrary number of states per position (20 for amino acids, 4 for nucleotides, etc.). We also provide a recursive formula for the inverse matrix and then derive formulae to directly extract any element of either matrix without having to rely on the computationally intensive task of constructing or inverting large matrices. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of our theory by using it to model epistasis within both simulated and empirical multiallelic fitness landscapes, revealing that both pairwise and higher-order genetic interactions are enriched between physically interacting positions.

                <p>by Claudia Pascovich Rognoni, Diego Serantes, Alejo Rodriguez, Diego Mateos, Joaqu√≠n Gonz√°lez, Diego Gallo, Mayda Rivas, Andrea Devera, Patricia Lagos, Nicol√°s Rubido, Pablo Torterolo</p>

The dorsal (DRN) and median (MRN) raphe are important nuclei involved in similar functions, including mood and sleep, but playing distinct roles. These nuclei have a different composition of neuronal types and set of neuronal connections, which among other factors, determine their neuronal dynamics. Most works characterize the neuronal dynamics using classic measures, such as using the average spiking frequency (FR), the coefficient of variation (CV), and action potential duration (APD). In the current study, to refine the characterization of neuronal firing profiles, we examined the neurons within the raphe nuclei. Through the utilization of nonlinear measures, our objective was to discern the redundancy and complementarity of these measures, particularly in comparison with classic methods. To do this, we analyzed the neuronal basal firing profile in both nuclei of urethane-anesthetized rats using the Shannon entropy (Bins Entropy) of the inter-spike intervals, permutation entropy of ordinal patterns (OP Entropy), and Permutation Lempel-Ziv Complexity (PLZC). Firstly, we found that classic (i.e., FR, CV, and APD) and nonlinear measures fail to distinguish between the dynamics of DRN and MRN neurons, except for the OP Entropy. We also found strong relationships between measures, including the CV with FR, CV with Bins entropy, and FR with PLZC, which imply redundant information. However, APD and OP Entropy have either a weak or no relationship with the rest of the measures tested, suggesting that they provide complementary information to the characterization of the neuronal firing profiles. Secondly, we studied how these measures are affected by the oscillatory properties of the firing patterns, including rhythmicity, bursting patterns, and clock-like behavior. We found that all measures are sensitive to rhythmicity, except for the OP Entropy. Overall, our work highlights OP Entropy as a powerful and useful quantity for the characterization of neuronal discharge patterns.

                <p>by Shoutik Mukherjee, Behtash Babadi</p>

Central in the study of population codes, coordinated ensemble spiking activity is widely observable in neural recordings with hypothesized roles in robust stimulus representation, interareal communication, and learning and memory formation. Model-free measures of synchrony characterize coherent pairwise activity but not higher-order interactions, a limitation transcended by statistical models of ensemble spiking activity. However, existing model-based analyses often impose assumptions about the relevance of higher-order interactions and require repeated trials to characterize dynamics in the correlational structure of ensemble activity. To address these shortcomings, we propose an adaptive greedy filtering algorithm based on a discretized mark point-process model of ensemble spiking and a corresponding statistical inference framework to identify significant higher-order coordination. In the course of developing a precise statistical test, we show that confidence intervals can be constructed for greedily estimated parameters. We demonstrate the utility of our proposed methods on simulated neuronal assemblies. Applied to multi-electrode recordings from human and rat cortical assemblies, our proposed methods provide new insights into the dynamics underlying localized population activity during transitions between brain states.

                <p>by Irina Kovlyagina, Anna Wierczeiko, Hristo Todorov, Eric Jacobi, Margarita Tevosian, Jakob von Engelhardt, Susanne Gerber, Beat Lutz</p>

Trait anxiety is a major risk factor for stress-induced and anxiety disorders in humans. However, animal models accounting for the interindividual variability in stress vulnerability are largely lacking. Moreover, the pervasive bias of using mostly male animals in preclinical studies poorly reflects the increased prevalence of psychiatric disorders in women. Using the threat imminence continuum theory, we designed and validated an auditory aversive conditioning-based pipeline in both female and male mice. We operationalised trait anxiety by harnessing the naturally occurring variability of defensive freezing responses combined with a model-based clustering strategy. While sustained freezing during prolonged retrieval sessions was identified as an anxiety-endophenotype biomarker in both sexes, females were consistently associated with an increased freezing response. RNA-sequencing of CeA, BLA, ACC, and BNST revealed massive differences in phasic and sustained responders‚Äô transcriptomes, correlating with transcriptomic signatures of psychiatric disorders, particularly post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Moreover, we detected significant alterations in the excitation/inhibition balance of principal neurons in the lateral amygdala. These findings provide compelling evidence that trait anxiety in inbred mice can be leveraged to develop translationally relevant preclinical models to investigate mechanisms of stress susceptibility in a sex-specific manner.

                <p>by Andrew Chang, Xiangbin Teng, M. Florencia Assaneo, David Poeppel</p>

Music and speech are complex and distinct auditory signals that are both foundational to the human experience. The mechanisms underpinning each domain are widely investigated. However, what perceptual mechanism transforms a sound into music or speech and how <i>basic</i> acoustic information is required to distinguish between them remain open questions. Here, we hypothesized that a sound‚Äôs amplitude modulation (AM), an essential temporal acoustic feature driving the auditory system across processing levels, is critical for distinguishing music and speech. Specifically, in contrast to paradigms using naturalistic acoustic signals (that can be challenging to interpret), we used a noise-probing approach to untangle the auditory mechanism: If AM rate and regularity are critical for perceptually distinguishing music and speech, judging artificially noise-synthesized ambiguous audio signals should align with their AM parameters. Across 4 experiments (<i>N</i> = 335), signals with a higher peak AM frequency tend to be judged as speech, lower as music. Interestingly, this principle is consistently used by all listeners for speech judgments, but only by musically sophisticated listeners for music. In addition, signals with more regular AM are judged as music over speech, and this feature is more critical for music judgment, regardless of musical sophistication. The data suggest that the auditory system can rely on a low-level acoustic property as basic as AM to distinguish music from speech, a simple principle that provokes both neurophysiological and evolutionary experiments and speculations.

Despite significant progress in understanding epigenetic reprogramming of cells, the mechanistic basis of ‚Äúorgan reprogramming‚Äù by (epi-)gene‚Äìenvironment interactions remained largely obscure. Here, we use the ether-induced haltere-to-wing transformations in <i>Drosophila</i> as a model for epigenetic ‚Äúreprogramming‚Äù at the whole organism level. Our findings support a mechanistic chain of events explaining why and how brief embryonic exposure to ether leads to haltere-to-wing transformations manifested at the larval stage and on. We show that ether interferes with protein integrity in the egg, leading to altered deployment of Hsp90 and widespread repression of Trithorax-mediated establishment of active H3K4me3 chromatin marks throughout the genome. Despite this global reduction, Ubx targets and wing development genes preferentially retain higher levels of H3K4me3 that predisposes these genes for later up-regulation in the larval haltere disc, hence the wing-like outcome. Consistent with compromised protein integrity during the exposure, the penetrance of bithorax transformations increases by genetic or chemical reduction of Hsp90 function. Moreover, joint reduction in <i>Hsp90</i> and <i>trx</i> gene dosage can cause bithorax transformations even without exposure to ether, supporting an underlying epistasis between <i>Hsp90</i> and <i>trx</i> loss-of-functions. These findings implicate environmental disruption of protein integrity at the onset of histone methylation with altered epigenetic regulation of developmental patterning genes. The emerging picture provides a unique example wherein the alleviation of the Hsp90 ‚Äúcapacitor function‚Äù by the environment drives a morphogenetic shift towards an ancestral-like body plan. The morphogenetic impact of chaperone response during a major setup of epigenetic patterns may be a general scheme for organ reprogramming by environmental cues.

Cholesterol metabolism is vital for multiple cancer progression, while how cholesterol affects lung, a low-cholesterol tissue, for cancer metastasis and the underlying mechanism remain unclear. In this study, we found that metastatic lung adenocarcinoma cells acquire cellular dehydrocholesterol and cholesterol by endogenous cholesterol biosynthesis, instead of uptake upon cholesterol treatment. Besides, we demonstrated that exogenous cholesterol functions as signaling molecule to induce FOXA3, a key transcription factor for lipid metabolism via GLI2. Subsequently, ChIP-seq analysis and molecular studies revealed that FOXA3 transcriptionally activated Hmgcs1, an essential enzyme of cholesterol biosynthesis, to induce endogenous dehydrocholesterol and cholesterol level for membrane composition change and cell migration. Conversely, FOXA3 knockdown or knockout blocked cholesterol biosynthesis and lung adenocarcinoma metastasis in mice. In addition, the potent FOXA3 inhibitor magnolol suppressed metastatic gene programs in lung adenocarcinoma patient-derived organoids (PDOs). Altogether, our findings shed light onto unique cholesterol metabolism and FOXA3 contribution to lung adenocarcinoma metastasis.

                Background Sonneratia caseolaris, known as the red pidada, has been widely utilized by the Indonesian. S. caseolaris leaves contain various active compounds, contributing to their popularity in the treatment of various diseases. Mangrove leaves are also known to exhibit very high antioxidant activity. This study aims to assess the antioxidant activity of S . caseolaris leaves extracted using different solvents. The resulting extract was evaluated for antioxidant activity by the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging activity (DPPH) techniques. Methods Analysis of total flavonoids, total phenols, identification of active compounds with Liquid Chromatography High Resolution Mass Spectrometry (LC-HRMS), and bioinformatics were also carried out to obtain temporary conclusions about the antioxidant activity of S. caseolaris leaf extract. Results The results indicated that S. caseolaris leaves extracted with methanol and distilled water exhibited the highest antioxidant activity compared to other extracts. The analysis of total flavonoids and total phenols yielded results consistent with the antioxidant activity tests. LC-HRMS results identified three compounds in all S. caseolaris leaf extracts with antioxidant activity, namely Tempo, Choline, and Betaine. Tempo demonstrated a higher antioxidant activity than Choline and Betaine, as indicated by the binding affinity values in the bioinformatics analysis. Conclusions It is evident that S. caseolaris leaf extract has the potential to serve as an effective an antioxidant agent. Further research is needed to elucidate confirm the potential compounds in Sonneratia caseolaris leaves water extract interact with the target protein Keap1. S. caseolaris, in order to utilize them as active components in food and enhance antioxidant consumption among consumers.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-542/v1?src=rss">Analytical observational study of salmonella PCR and its comparison with routine laboratory parameters in cases of enteric fever in tertiary care hospital in central India [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Enteric fever, predominantly caused by Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi, remains a significant global health concern, particularly in resource-limited settings. The diagnostic landscape for enteric fever relies on traditional methods such as the Widal test and blood culture, each with inherent limitations regarding sensitivity and turnaround time. Methods The study will employ an Analytical Observational Study design conducted at Acharya Vinoba Bhave Rural Hospital in central India over a two-year period. Participants will include adults above 18 years admitted to the ward or Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with acute febrile illnesses. Inclusion criteria encompass a wide age range, ensuring a diverse study population. Peripheral blood samples will be collected for Salmonella PCR, Widal testing, and blood culture. Dot-PCR for Typhi will be employed, and DNA extraction will follow strict protocols. Data will be systematically recorded, and statistical analyses, including sensitivity, specificity, and comparative assessments, will be conducted to evaluate diagnostic performance. Expected Outcome It is anticipated that Salmonella PCR will exhibit superior sensitivity and specificity compared to traditional diagnostic methods, offering a more rapid and accurate identification of enteric fever cases. The study aims to contribute valuable evidence supporting the incorporation of Salmonella PCR into routine diagnostic algorithms, potentially revolutionizing the approach to enteric fever diagnosis. Moreover, insights gained from the study are expected to inform clinical practices, enhance patient management, and potentially reduce the economic burden associated with misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis of enteric fever. The outcomes of this research are poised to impact public health strategies, providing a foundation for more effective and efficient diagnostic protocols in the context of enteric fever.

                Background Gall bladder carcinoma (GBC) is a challenging malignancy characterized by late-stage diagnosis and poor prognosis. Early detection and accurate staging are crucial for improving patient outcomes. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) offer non-invasive imaging modalities that may aid in the evaluation of GBC. Choline, a metabolite detected by MRS, has been implicated in tumor growth and may serve as a potential biomarker for GBC. This study aims to investigate the role of MRI and MRS in evaluating choline levels as biomarkers for GBC. Method A prospective observational study will be conducted involving patients with suspected or confirmed GBC referred to the Department of Radiology, AVBRH, Sawangi. Patients meeting inclusion criteria will undergo MRI scans and MRS examinations to assess tumor characteristics and choline levels. Data collected will include MRI images, MRS spectra, histopathological results, and clinical outcomes. Statistical analysis will be performed to examine correlations between MRI findings, choline levels, and histopathological characteristics. Expected Outcome It is anticipated that MRI and MRS will demonstrate utility in evaluating choline levels as imaging biomarkers for GBC. Correlations between choline levels, tumor characteristics, and clinical outcomes are expected to provide valuable insights into the role of choline in GBC pathogenesis and prognosis. If successful, MRI and MRS could serve as non-invasive tools for early detection, staging, and treatment response monitoring in GBC, ultimately leading to improved patient outcomes and management strategies.

                Background Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) is predominant cultured species in aquaculture. However, there is a scarcity of literature regarding relationship between guava and star gooseberry leaf extract and the condition factor. Thus, the present study aims to investigate the effect of guava and star gooseberry leaf extract-supplemented diets on the specific growth rate, length-weight relationship, and condition factor of Nile tilapia. Methods Six hundred and thirty Nile tilapia (8.7¬±0.4 g) were randomly distributed among twenty-one tanks (30 fish per tank) within a recirculation system. Over a 60-day period, the fish were fed diets supplemented with 5g/Kg and 10g/Kg of guava leaf extract (GLE-5, GLE-10), star gooseberry leaf extract (SGLE-5, SGLE-10), and a mixture of both (MxLE-5, MXLE-10). Subsequently, specific growth rate, length-weight relationship, and condition factor were determined. Results After 60 days, the specific growth rate was significantly higher in all the GLE, SGLE, and MxLE groups compared to the control group. The final lengths and weights differed significantly both in the control group and all the GLE, SGLE, and MxLE groups. The analysis of the regression equation indicated a positive correlation (r = 0.970, 0.977, 0.976, 0.974, 0.974, 0.974, and 0.969) between the length and weight of Nile tilapia in the control group and in all the GLE, SGLE, and MxLE groups. The regression exponent "b" values in all the GLE, SGLE, and MxLE groups were >3, indicating a positive allometric growth pattern in Nile tilapia compared to the control (b=2.866), which exhibited a negative allometry. The final condition factor values did not differ significantly in either the control group or any of the plant extract groups. Conclusions Nile tilapia exhibited positive allometric growth patterns and maintained good health when fed with GLE, SGLE, and MxLE groups. Therefore, these plant extracts demonstrate suitability for commercial Nile tilapia production.

                Background Phyllodes tumor is a rare fibroepithelial neoplasm of the breast, which is classified histologically as benign, borderline, or malignant. Accurate preoperative diagnosis allows the correct surgical planning and reoperation avoidance. Objective To describe the clinical presentation and radiologic features of phyllodes tumors and differentiate between benign and non-benign (borderline and malignant) groups. Methods A retrospective study of 57 patients with a diagnosis of phyllodes tumor who had preoperative imaging (mammography, ultrasound, or CT chest) and histological confirmation. The data was collected from 1 June 2011 to 30 September 2021. The imaging features of the phyllodes tumors were described according to the 5th edition of the ACR BI-RADS lexicon. For comparing between two groups, the student t-test, Wilcoxon rank sum test, Chi-square test, and Fisher‚Äôs exact test were used for statistical analyses. The logistic regression analysis was calculated for non-benign phyllodes tumor prediction. Results From 57 patients, the pathologic results were benign for 43 cases and non-benign phyllodes tumors for 14 cases. There was no differentiation of mammographic and CT features between benign and non-benign groups. Non-benign phyllodes tumors had the statistical significance of menopausal status, entire breast involvement, tumor size larger than 10 cm, and heterogeneous echo on univariable analysis. After multivariable analysis, menopausal status (odd ratios=13.79, p=0.04) and presence of vessels in the rim (odd ratios=16.51, p=0.019) or absent vascularity (odd ratios=8.45, p=0.047) on doppler ultrasound were significantly increased possibility of non-benign phyllodes tumor. Conclusions Menopausal status and presence of vessels in the rim or absent vascularity on Doppler ultrasound were important predictors for the diagnosis of non-benign phyllodes tumor.

                Background This study aimed to evaluate the characteristics of diabetic foot ulcers in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in Iraq. Methods The study included 881 participants with T2DM and different types of foot ulcers, who attended a specialized diabetes center. Data on demographics, clinical characteristics, biochemical investigations, comorbidities, and treatment regimens were collected and analyzed. Results The majority of the cases (96.8%) were due to T2DM, with an average age of 58 years and a mean BMI of 30 kg/m2. Participants had elevated serum creatinine, blood urea, and glucose levels, with uncontrolled HbA1c levels. Comorbidities included hypertension, ischemic heart disease, diabetic neuropathy, and retinopathy. Most participants were on insulin and statins. Diabetic foot ulcers were mainly on the right foot (48%) and classified as Grade 2 in Wagner's system. Some participants had Charcot deformity or stages of amputation. Conclusions Random plasma glucose levels and diabetic retinopathy were significantly associated with the classification of foot ulcers. Further research is needed to explore additional variables related to T2DM and foot ulcers, emphasizing the importance of glucose control and retinopathy in ulcer classification.

                Exercise training is an important strategy to counteract cognitive and brain health decline during aging. Evidence from systematic reviews and meta-analyses supports the notion of beneficial effects of exercise in cognitively unimpaired and impaired older individuals. However, the effects are often modest, and likely influenced by moderators such as exercise training parameters, sample characteristics, outcome assessments, and control conditions. Here, we discuss evidence on the impact of exercise on cognitive and brain health outcomes in healthy aging and in individuals with or at risk for cognitive impairment and neurodegeneration. We also review neuroplastic adaptations in response to exercise and their potential neurobiological mechanisms. We conclude by highlighting goals for future studies, including addressing unexplored neurobiological mechanisms and the inclusion of under-represented populations.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/87523">An important role for triglyceride in regulating spermatogenesis</a></h4>

              
                <i>Drosophila</i> is a powerful model to study how lipids affect spermatogenesis. Yet, the contribution of neutral lipids, a major lipid group which resides in organelles called lipid droplets (LD), to sperm development is largely unknown. Emerging evidence suggests LD are present in the testis and that loss of neutral lipid- and LD-associated genes causes subfertility; however, key regulators of testis neutral lipids and LD remain unclear. Here, we show LD are present in early-stage somatic and germline cells within the <i>Drosophila</i> testis. We identified a role for triglyceride lipase <i>brummer</i> (<i>bmm</i>) in regulating testis LD, and found that whole-body loss of <i>bmm</i> leads to defects in sperm development. Importantly, these represent cell-autonomous roles for <i>bmm</i> in regulating testis LD and spermatogenesis. Because lipidomic analysis of <i>bmm</i> mutants revealed excess triglyceride accumulation, and spermatogenic defects in <i>bmm</i> mutants were rescued by genetically blocking triglyceride synthesis, our data suggest that <i>bmm</i>-mediated regulation of triglyceride influences sperm development. This identifies triglyceride as an important neutral lipid that contributes to <i>Drosophila</i> sperm development, and reveals a key role for <i>bmm</i> in regulating testis triglyceride levels during spermatogenesis.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/84855">Analysis of science journalism reveals gender and regional disparities in coverage</a></h4>

              
                Science journalism is a critical way for the public to learn about and benefit from scientific findings. Such journalism shapes the public‚Äôs view of the current state of science and legitimizes experts. Journalists can only cite and quote a limited number of sources, who they may discover in their research, including recommendations by other scientists. Biases in either process may influence who is identified and ultimately included as a source. To examine potential biases in science journalism, we analyzed 22,001 non-research articles published by Nature and compared these with Nature-published research articles with respect to predicted gender and name origin. We extracted cited authors‚Äô names and those of quoted speakers. While citations and quotations within a piece do not reflect the entire information-gathering process, they can provide insight into the demographics of visible sources. We then predicted gender and name origin of the cited authors and speakers. We compared articles with a comparator set made up of first and last authors within primary research articles in Nature and a subset of Springer Nature articles in the same time period. In our analysis, we found a skew toward quoting men in Nature science journalism. However, quotation is trending toward equal representation at a faster rate than authorship rates in academic publishing. Gender disparity in Nature quotes was dependent on the article type. We found a significant over-representation of names with predicted Celtic/English origin and under-representation of names with a predicted East Asian origin in both in extracted quotes and journal citations but dampened in citations.

                As the most common degenerative joint disease, osteoarthritis (OA) contributes significantly to pain and disability during aging. Several genes of interest involved in articular cartilage damage in OA have been identified. However, the direct causes of OA are poorly understood. Evaluating the public human RNA-seq dataset showed that <i>CBFB</i> (subunit of a heterodimeric CbfŒ≤/Runx1, Runx2, or Runx3 complex) expression is decreased in the cartilage of patients with OA. Here, we found that the chondrocyte-specific deletion of <i>Cbfb</i> in tamoxifen-induced <i>Cbfb<sup>f/f</sup>;Col2a1-CreER<sup>T</sup></i> mice caused a spontaneous OA phenotype, worn articular cartilage, increased inflammation, and osteophytes. RNA-sequencing analysis showed that CbfŒ≤ deficiency in articular cartilage resulted in reduced cartilage regeneration, increased canonical Wnt signaling and inflammatory response, and decreased Hippo/Yap signaling and TgfŒ≤ signaling. Immunostaining and western blot validated these RNA-seq analysis results. ACLT surgery-induced OA decreased CbfŒ≤ and Yap expression and increased active Œ≤-catenin expression in articular cartilage, while local AAV-mediated <i>Cbfb</i> overexpression promoted Yap expression and diminished active Œ≤-catenin expression in OA lesions. Remarkably, AAV-mediated <i>Cbfb</i> overexpression in knee joints of mice with OA showed the significant protective effect of CbfŒ≤ on articular cartilage in the ACLT OA mouse model. Overall, this study, using loss-of-function and gain-of-function approaches, uncovered that low expression of CbfŒ≤ may be the cause of OA. Moreover, Local admission of <i>Cbfb</i> may rescue and protect OA through decreasing Wnt/Œ≤-catenin signaling, and increasing Hippo/Yap signaling and TgfŒ≤/Smad2/3 signaling in OA articular cartilage, indicating that local <i>Cbfb</i> overexpression could be an effective strategy for treatment of OA.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88054">Chromosomal instability induced in cancer can enhance macrophage-initiated immune responses that include anti-tumor IgG</a></h4>

              
                Solid tumors generally exhibit chromosome copy number variation, which is typically caused by chromosomal instability (CIN) in mitosis. The resulting aneuploidy can drive evolution and associates with poor prognosis in various cancer types as well as poor response to T-cell checkpoint blockade in melanoma. Macrophages and the SIRPŒ±-CD47 checkpoint are understudied in such contexts. Here, CIN is induced in poorly immunogenic B16F10 mouse melanoma cells using spindle assembly checkpoint MPS1 inhibitors that generate persistent micronuclei and diverse aneuploidy while skewing macrophages toward a tumoricidal ‚ÄòM1-like‚Äô phenotype based on markers and short-term anti-tumor studies. Mice bearing CIN-afflicted tumors with wild-type CD47 levels succumb similar to controls, but long-term survival is maximized by SIRPŒ± blockade on adoptively transferred myeloid cells plus anti-tumor monoclonal IgG. Such cells are the initiating effector cells, and survivors make de novo anti-cancer IgG that not only promote phagocytosis of CD47-null cells but also suppress tumor growth. CIN does not affect the IgG response, but pairing CIN with maximal macrophage anti-cancer activity increases durable cures that possess a vaccination-like response against recurrence.

                <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> (Mtb) is known to survive within macrophages by compromising the integrity of the phagosomal compartment in which it resides. This activity primarily relies on the ESX-1 secretion system, predominantly involving the protein duo ESAT-6 and CFP-10. CFP-10 likely acts as a chaperone, while ESAT-6 likely disrupts phagosomal membrane stability via a largely unknown mechanism. we employ a series of biochemical analyses, protein modeling techniques, and a novel ESAT-6-specific nanobody to gain insight into the ESAT-6‚Äôs mode of action. First, we measure the binding kinetics of the tight 1:1 complex formed by ESAT-6 and CFP-10 at neutral pH. Subsequently, we demonstrate a rapid self-association of ESAT-6 into large complexes under acidic conditions, leading to the identification of a stable tetrameric ESAT-6 species. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we pinpoint the most probable interaction interface. Furthermore, we show that cytoplasmic expression of an anti-ESAT-6 nanobody blocks Mtb replication, thereby underlining the pivotal role of ESAT-6 in intracellular survival. Together, these data suggest that ESAT-6 acts by a pH-dependent mechanism to establish two-way communication between the cytoplasm and the Mtb-containing phagosome.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90782">The antigenic landscape of human influenza N2 neuraminidases from 2009 until 2017</a></h4>

              
                Human H3N2 influenza viruses are subject to rapid antigenic evolution which translates into frequent updates of the composition of seasonal influenza vaccines. Despite these updates, the effectiveness of influenza vaccines against H3N2-associated disease is suboptimal. Seasonal influenza vaccines primarily induce hemagglutinin-specific antibody responses. However, antibodies directed against influenza neuraminidase (NA) also contribute to protection. Here, we analysed the antigenic diversity of a panel of N2 NAs derived from human H3N2 viruses that circulated between 2009 and 2017. The antigenic breadth of these NAs was determined based on the NA inhibition (NAI) of a broad panel of ferret and mouse immune sera that were raised by infection and recombinant N2 NA immunisation. This assessment allowed us to distinguish at least four antigenic groups in the N2 NAs derived from human H3N2 viruses that circulated between 2009 and 2017. Computational analysis further revealed that the amino acid residues in N2 NA that have a major impact on susceptibility to NAI by immune sera are in proximity of the catalytic site. Finally, a machine learning method was developed that allowed to accurately predict the impact of mutations that are present in our N2 NA panel on NAI. These findings have important implications for the renewed interest to develop improved influenza vaccines based on the inclusion of a protective NA antigen formulation.

	<p>Invasive dental procedures, such as wisdom teeth removal, have been identified as potential triggers for vascular events due to the entry of oral bacteria into the bloodstream, leading to acute vascular inflammation and endothelial dysfunction. This study presents the case of a 27-year-old healthy male who developed ischemic stroke resulting from bacteremia after undergoing wisdom teeth extraction. Initially, the patient experienced fever and malaise, which were followed by right-sided hemiplegia. Diagnostic imaging, including a CT scan, identified a subacute infarction in the posterior crus of the left internal capsule, and MRI findings indicated inflammatory changes in the masticatory muscles. Further investigations involving biopsies of the masticatory muscles, along with blood and cerebrospinal fluid samples, confirmed bacterial meningitis with associated vasculitis. Notably, oral bacteria linked to periodontitis, including Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Tannerella forsythia, and Parvimonas micra, were found in the biopsies and microbiological analyses. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case showing that bacteremia following dental procedures can lead to such severe neurological outcomes. This case underscores the importance of recognizing bacteremia-induced vasculitis in patients presenting with neurological symptoms post-dental procedures, emphasizing the broader implications of oral infections in such pathologies.</p>

     alt="Hyperphosphorylated tau in Alzheimer's disease disseminates along pathways predicted by the Structural Model for Cortico-cortical Connections"/>
<p>The Structural Model of Cortico-cortical Connections, developed with synaptic tract-tracing in nonhuman primates, predicts the laminar pattern of cortico-cortical connections based on the cortical type of the connected areas. In Alzheimer's disease, hyperphosphorylated tau spreads along cortical areas in a predictable manner according to the Braak stages. We show that such spread follows synaptic pathways predicted by the Structural Model whose principles are applicable to the human cerebral cortex to infer laminar patterns of cortico-cortical connections.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>In Alzheimer¬¥s disease (AD), hyperphosphorylated tau spreads along the cerebral cortex in a stereotypical pattern that parallels cognitive deterioration. Tau seems to spread transsynaptically along cortico-cotical pathways that, according to synaptic tract-tracing studies in nonhuman primates, have specific laminar patterns related to the cortical type of the connected areas. This relation is described in the Structural Model. In the present article, we study the laminar distribution of hyperphosphorylated tau, labeled with the antibody AT8, along temporal cortical types in postmortem human brains with different AD stages to test the predictions of the Structural Model. Brains from donors without dementia had scant AT8-immunorreactive (AT8-ir) neurons in allo-, meso-, and isocortical types. In early AD stages, the mesocortical dysgranular type, including part of the transentorhinal cortex, had the highest AT8 immunostaining and AT8-ir neurons density. In advanced AD stages, AT8 immunostaining increased along the isocortical types until reaching the auditory koniocortex. Regarding laminar patterns, in early AD stages there were more AT8-ir neurons in supragranular layers in each de novo involved neocortical type; in advanced AD stages, AT8-ir neurons were equally distributed in supra- and infragranular layers. These AT8-ir laminar patterns are compatible with the predictions of the Structural Model. In summary, we show that hyperphosphorylated tau initially accumulates in allo-, meso-, and isocortical types, offer a proof of concept for the validity of the Structural Model to predict synaptic pathway organization in the human cerebral cortex, and highlight the relevance of nonhuman primate tract-tracing studies to understand human neuropathology.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Aging is widely acknowledged as the primary risk factor for brain degeneration, with Parkinson's disease (PD) tending to follow accelerated aging trajectories. We aim to investigate the impact of structural brain aging on the temporal dynamics of a large-scale functional network in PD. We enrolled 62 PD patients and 32 healthy controls (HCs). The level of brain aging was determined by calculating global and local brain age gap estimates (G-brainAGE and L-brainAGE) from structural images. The neural network activity of the whole brain was captured by identifying coactivation patterns (CAPs) from resting-state functional images. Intergroup differences were assessed using the general linear model. Subsequently, a spatial correlation analysis between the L-brainAGE difference map and CAPs was conducted to uncover the anatomical underpinnings of functional alterations. Compared to HCs (‚àí3.73‚Äâyears), G-brainAGE was significantly higher in PD patients (+1.93‚Äâyears), who also exhibited widespread elevation in L-brainAGE. G-brainAGE was correlated with disease severity and duration. PD patients spent less time in CAPs involving activated default mode and the fronto-parietal network (DMN-FPN), as well as the sensorimotor and salience network (SMN-SN), and had a reduced transition frequency from other CAPs to the DMN-FPN and SMN-SN CAPs. Furthermore, the pattern of localized brain age acceleration showed spatial similarities with the SMN-SN CAP. Accelerated structural brain aging in PD adversely affects brain function, manifesting as dysregulated brain network dynamics. These findings provide insights into the neuropathological mechanisms underlying neurodegenerative diseases and imply the possibility of interventions for modifying PD progression by slowing the brain aging process.</p>

                Prion diseases are a group of neurodegenerative disorders caused by misfolding of proteins into pathogenic conformations that self-template to spread disease. Although this mechanism is largely associated with the prion protein (PrP) in classical prion diseases, a growing literature indicates that other proteins, including Œ±-synuclein, rely on a similar disease mechanism. Notably, Œ±-synuclein misfolds into distinct conformations, or strains, that cause discrete clinical disorders including multiple system atrophy (MSA) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Because the recognized similarities between PrP and Œ±-synuclein are increasing, this review article draws from research on PrP to identify the host and strain factors that impact disease pathogenesis, predominantly in rodent models, and focuses on key considerations for future research on Œ±-synuclein prions.

                Concepts from network science and graph theory, including the framework of network motifs, have been frequently applied in studying neuronal networks and other biological complex systems. Network-based approaches can also be used to study the functions of individual neurons, where cellular elements such as ion channels and membrane voltage are conceptualized as nodes within a network, and their interactions are denoted by edges. Network motifs in this context provide functional building blocks that help to illuminate the principles of cellular neurophysiology. In this review we build a case that network motifs operating within neurons provide tools for defining the functional architecture of single-neuron physiology and neuronal adaptations. We highlight the presence of such computational motifs in the cellular mechanisms underlying action potential generation, neuronal oscillations, dendritic integration, and neuronal plasticity. Future work applying the network motifs perspective may help to decipher the functional complexities of neurons and their adaptation during health and disease.

                Peng et¬†al. have discovered functionally independent dual neural circuits, including the neurons in the ventral hippocampus (vHPC), nucleus accumbens, lateral septum, and basolateral amygdala, that regulate the affective empathy between mice. They also classified the neurons in the vHPC that encode observational fear.

">Repetitive mild closed-head injury induced synapse loss and increased local BOLD-fMRI signal homogeneity</a></h4>

              
                Repeated mild head injuries due to sports, or domestic violence and military service are increasingly linked to debilitating symptoms in the long term. Although symptoms may take decades to manifest, potentially treatable neurobiological alterations must begin shortly after injury. Better means to diagnose and treat traumatic brain injuries, requires an improved understanding of the mechanisms underlying progression and means through which they can be measured. Here, we employ a repetitive mild closed-head injury (rmTBI) and chronic variable stress (CVS) mouse model to investigate emergent structural and functional brain abnormalities. Brain imaging is achieved with [18F]SynVesT-1 positron emission tomography, with the synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A ligand marking synapse density and BOLD (blood-oxygen-level-dependent) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Animals were scanned six weeks after concluding rmTBI/Stress procedures. Injured mice showed widespread decreases in synaptic density coupled with an increase in local BOLD-fMRI synchrony detected as regional homogeneity. Injury-affected regions with higher synapse density showed a greater increase in fMRI regional homogeneity. Taken together, these observations may reflect compensatory mechanisms following injury. Multimodal studies are needed to provide deeper insights into these observations.

	<p>Objective: Patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD) report to be especially prone to social emotions like shame and guilt. At the same time, these emotions seem to play an important role in BPD pathology. The present study aimed to deepen the knowledge about the processes behind shame and guilt in patients with BPD. Methods: Twenty patients with BPD and twenty healthy controls (HCs) took part in an experiment that induced shame and guilt by imagining scenarios during scanning using functional brain imaging. Participants also filled out self-report questionnaires and took part in diagnostic interviews. Results: BPD patients reported more proneness to guilt but not to shame than the HCs. There was no difference in the self-reported intensity rating of experimentally induced emotions between the groups. Between-group contrast of neural signals in the shame condition revealed a stronger activation of cingulate and fusiform gyrus for the BPD patients compared to the controls, and a more pronounced activation in the lingual gyrus and cuneus for the HCs. In the guilt condition, activation in the caudate nucleus, the fusiform gyrus, and the posterior cingulate cortex was stronger in BPD patients, while HC showed stronger activations in cuneus, lingual gyrus, and fronto-temporal regions. Conclusions: Differences in the neuro-functional processes between BPD patients and HC were found, even though the two groups did not differ in their self-report of subjective proneness to guilt and emotional intensity of shame and guilt during the experiment. While the HCs may be engaged more by the emotional scenarios themselves, the BPD patients may be more occupied with cognitive regulatory and self-referential processing.</p>

	<p>R4Alz is utilized for the early detection of minor neurocognitive disorders. It was designed to assess three main dimensions of cognitive-control abilities: working-memory capacity, attentional control, and executive functioning. Objectives: To reveal the cognitive-control dimensions that can differentiate between adults and older adults with healthy cognition, people with subjective cognitive impairment, and people diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment by examining the factorial structure of the R4Alz tool. Methods: The study comprised 404 participants: (a) healthy adults (n = 192), (b) healthy older adults (n = 29), (c) people with SCI (n = 74), and (d) people diagnosed with MCI (n = 109). The R4Alz battery was administered to all participants, including tests that assess short-term memory storage, information processing, information updating in working memory, and selective, sustained and divided attention), task/rule-switching, inhibitory control, and cognitive flexibility. Results: A two-factorial structural model was confirmed for R4Alz, with the first factor representing &amp;amp;ldquo;fluid intelligence (FI)&amp;amp;rdquo; and the second factor reflecting &amp;amp;ldquo;executive functions (EF)&amp;amp;rdquo;. Both FI and EFs discriminate among all groups. Conclusions: The R4Alz battery presents sound construct validity, evaluating abilities in FI and EF. Both abilities can differentiate very early cognitive impairment (SCI) from healthy cognitive aging and MCI.</p>

	<p>Background and Objectives: Spinal surgery, particularly for cervical pathologies such as myelopathy and radiculopathy, requires a blend of theoretical knowledge and practical skill. The complexity of these conditions, often necessitating surgical intervention, underscores the need for intricate understanding and precision in execution. Advancements in neurosurgical training, especially with the use of low-cost 3D models for simulating cervical spine tumor removal, are revolutionizing this field. These models provide the realistic and hands-on experience crucial for mastering complex neurosurgical techniques, filling gaps left by traditional educational methods. Materials and Methods: This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of 3D-printed cervical vertebrae models in enhancing surgical skills, focusing on tumor removal, and involving 20 young neurosurgery residents. These models, featuring silicone materials to simulate the spinal cord and tumor tissues, provided a realistic training experience. The training protocol included a laminectomy, dural incision, and tumor resection, using a range of microsurgical tools, focusing on steps usually performed by senior surgeons. Results: The training program received high satisfaction rates, with 85% of participants extremely satisfied and 15% satisfied. The 3D models were deemed very realistic by 85% of participants, effectively replicating real-life scenarios. A total of 80% found that the simulated pathologies were varied and accurate, and 90% appreciated the models&amp;amp;rsquo; accurate tactile feedback. The training was extremely useful for 85% of the participants in developing surgical skills, with significant post-training confidence boosts and a strong willingness to recommend the program to peers. Conclusions: Continuing laboratory training for residents is crucial. Our model offers essential, accessible training for all hospitals, regardless of their resources, promising improved surgical quality and patient outcomes across various pathologies.</p>

	<p>The gold standard test for diagnosing dysphagia is the videofluoroscopic swallowing study (VFSS). However, the accuracy of this test varies depending on the specialist&amp;amp;rsquo;s skill level. We proposed a VFSS-based artificial intelligence (AI) web application to diagnose dysphagia. Video from the VFSS consists of multiframe data that contain approximately 300 images. To label the data, the server separated them into frames during the upload and stored them as a video for analysis. Then, the separated data were loaded into a labeling tool to perform the labeling. The labeled file was downloaded, and an AI model was developed by training with You Only Look Once (YOLOv7). Using a utility called SplitFolders, the entire dataset was divided according to a ratio of training (70%), test (10%), and validation (20%). When a VFSS video file was uploaded to an application equipped with the developed AI model, it was automatically classified and labeled as oral, pharyngeal, or esophageal. The dysphagia of a person was categorized as either penetration or aspiration, and the final analyzed result was displayed to the viewer. The following labeling datasets were created for the AI learning: oral (n = 2355), pharyngeal (n = 2338), esophageal (n = 1480), penetration (n = 1856), and aspiration (n = 1320); the learning results of the YOLO model, which analyzed dysphagia using the dataset, were predicted with accuracies of 0.90, 0.82, 0.79, 0.92, and 0.96, respectively. This is expected to help clinicians more efficiently suggest the proper dietary options for patients with oropharyngeal dysphagia.</p>

	<p>Epilepsy is a neurological disease that affects approximately 50 million people worldwide. Despite an existing abundance of antiepileptic drugs, lifelong disease treatment is often required but could be improved with alternative drugs that have fewer side effects. Given that epileptic seizures stem from abnormal neuronal discharges predominately modulated by the human sodium channel Nav1.2, the quest for novel and potent Nav1.2 blockers holds promise for epilepsy management. Herein, an in vivo approach was used to detect new antiepileptic compounds using the maximum electroshock test on mice. Pre-treatment of mice with extracts from the Ficus religiosa plant ameliorated the tonic hind limb extensor phase of induced convulsions. Subsequently, an in silico approach identified potential Nav1.2 blocking compounds from F. religiosa using a combination of computational techniques, including molecular docking, prime molecular mechanics/generalized Born surface area (MM/GBSA) analysis, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation studies. The molecular docking and MM/GBSA analysis indicated that out of 82 compounds known to be present in F. religiosa, seven exhibited relatively strong binding affinities to Nav1.2 that ranged from &amp;amp;minus;6.555 to &amp;amp;minus;13.476 kcal/mol; similar or with higher affinity than phenytoin (&amp;amp;minus;6.660 kcal/mol), a known Na+-channel blocking antiepileptic drug. Furthermore, MD simulations revealed that two compounds: 6-C-glucosyl-8-C-arabinosyl apigenin and pelargonidin-3-rhamnoside could form stable complexes with Nav1.2 at 300 K, indicating their potential as lead antiepileptic agents. In summary, the combination of in vivo and in silico approaches supports the potential of F. religiosa phytochemicals as natural antiepileptic therapeutic agents.</p>

	<p>Tinnitus is a common phantom auditory percept believed to be related to plastic changes in the brain due to hearing loss. However, tinnitus can also occur in the absence of any clinical hearing loss. In this case, since there is no hearing loss, the mechanisms that drive plastic changes remain largely enigmatic. Previous studies showed subtle differences in sound-evoked brain activity associated with tinnitus in subjects with tinnitus and otherwise normal hearing, but the results are not consistent across studies. Here, we aimed to investigate these differences using monaural rather than binaural stimuli. Sound-evoked responses were measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in participants with and without tinnitus. All participants had clinically normal audiograms. The stimuli were pure tones with frequencies between 353 and 8000 Hz, presented monaurally. A Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of the response in the auditory cortex revealed no difference in tonotopic organization, which confirmed earlier studies. A GLM analysis showed hyperactivity in the lateral areas of the bilateral auditory cortex. Consistent with the tonotopic map, this hyperactivity mainly occurred in response to low stimulus frequencies. This may be related to hyperacusis. Furthermore, there was an interaction between stimulation side and tinnitus in the parahippocampus. This may reflect an interference between tinnitus and spatial orientation.</p>

">Multimodal identification of the mouse brain using simultaneous Ca2+ imaging and fMRI</a></h4>

              
                Individual differences in neuroimaging are of interest to clinical and cognitive neuroscientists based on their potential for guiding the personalized treatment of various heterogeneous neurological conditions and diseases. Despite many advantages, the workhorse in this arena, BOLD (blood-oxygen-level-dependent) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) suffers from low spatiotemporal resolution and specificity as well as a propensity for noise and spurious signal corruption. To better understand individual differences in BOLD-fMRI data, we can use animal models where fMRI, alongside complementary but more invasive contrasts, can be accessed. Here, we apply simultaneous wide-field fluorescence calcium imaging and BOLD-fMRI in mice to interrogate individual differences using a connectome-based identification framework adopted from the human fMRI literature. This approach yields high spatiotemporal resolution cell-type specific signals (here, from glia, excitatory, as well as inhibitory interneurons) from the whole cortex. We found mouse multimodal connectome-based identification to be successful and explored various features of these data.

">Digital cognitive assessments as low-burden markers for predicting future cognitive decline and tau accumulation across the Alzheimer's spectrum</a></h4>

              
                Digital cognitive assessments, particularly those that can be done at home, present as low burden biomarkers for participants and patients alike, but their effectiveness in diagnosis of Alzheimers or predicting its trajectory is still unclear. Here, we assessed what utility or added value these digital cognitive assessments provide for identifying those at high risk for cognitive decline. We analyzed >500 ADNI participants who underwent a brief digital cognitive assessment and A{beta}/tau PET scans, examining their ability to distinguish cognitive status and predict cognitive decline. Performance on the digital cognitive assessment were superior to both cortical A{beta} and entorhinal tau in detecting mild cognitive impairment and future cognitive decline, with mnemonic discrimination deficits emerging as the most critical measure for predicting decline and future tau accumulation. Digital assessments are effective in identifying at-risk individuals, supporting their utility as low-burden tools for early Alzheimers detection and monitoring.

">Hippocampal mGluR5 levels are comparable in Alzheimer's and control brains, and divergently influenced by amyloid and tau in control brain</a></h4>

              
                BackgroundMetabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) modulates excitatory glutamatergic synaptic transmission and plays an important role in learning and memory formation and in neurodegeneration and amyloid deposition in Alzheimers disease (AD). Conflicting results on the cerebral mGluR5 levels in AD have been reported based on in vivo and postmortem studies. Here, we aimed to assess alterations in hippocampal mGluR5 expression in AD, and the associations between mGluR5 expression and pathologies.

MethodsImmunofluorescence staining for mGluR5 was performed on postmortem brain tissue from 34 AD patients and 31 nondemented controls (NCs) and from aged 3xTg and arcA{beta} model mice of AD. Autoradiography was performed on brain tissue slices from arcA{beta} mice using mGluR5 tracer [18F]PSS232. Analysis of different cellular source of GRM5 RNA in human and mouse brains was performed. Proteomic profiling and pathway analysis were performed on hippocampal tissue from aged 3xTg mice and wild-type mice.

ResultsNo differences in hippocampal mGluR5 expression or entorhinal cortical GRM5 RNA levels were detected between the AD and NC groups. Hippocampal mGluR5 levels increased with Braak stage and decreased with amyloid level in the NC group. No correlations were detected between the levels of mGluR5 and amyloid, tau, or Iba1/P2X7R in the hippocampus of AD patients and NC cases. Ex vivo autoradiography revealed comparable cerebral levels of [18F]PSS232 in arcA{beta} mice compared to nontransgenic mice. GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses revealed that the Shank3, Grm5 and glutamatergic pathways were upregulated in hippocampal tissue from aged 3xTg mice compared to wild-type mice.

ConclusionThis study revealed no difference in hippocampal mGluR5 levels between AD patients and NCs and revealed the divergent influence of amyloid and tau pathologies on hippocampal mGluR5 levels in NCs. Species differences were observed in the GRM5 RNA level as well as at the cellular location.

">Early life intestinal inflammation alters gut microbiome, impairing gut-brain communication and reproductive behavior in mice</a></h4>

              
                Despite recent advances in understanding the connection between the gut microbiota and the brain, there remains a wide knowledge gap in how gut inflammation impacts brain development. Microbiota-derived metabolite signaling from the gut to the brain is required for normal development of microglia, the brains resident immune cells. Disruption of the microbiota-brain communication has been linked to impaired behaviours and Autism Spectrum Disorder. We hypothesized that intestinal inflammation in early life would negatively affect neurodevelopment through dysregulation of microbiota communication to brain microglia. To test this hypothesis, we developed a novel pediatric model of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). IBD is an incurable condition affecting millions of people worldwide, characterized by chronic intestinal inflammation, and has comorbid symptoms of anxiety, depression and cognitive impairment. Significantly, 25% of IBD patients are diagnosed during childhood, and the effect of chronic inflammation during this critical period of development is largely unknown. We developed a chemical model of pediatric chronic IBD by repeatedly treating juvenile mice with dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) in drinking water. DSS-treated mice displayed increased intestinal inflammation, altered microbiota and changes in circulating metabolites. We also found that alterations in gut microbiota had long-term impacts on female microglia and male sex-specific behaviours and testosterone regulation, consistent with delayed puberty observed in male IBD patients. Our research expands our understanding of microbiota-microglia communication underlying development. The gut-brain axis is an exciting target for personalized medicine as microbiome manipulations could be feasible for early intervention to reverse deficits due to juvenile inflammation.

HighlightsEarly life gut inflammation produces sex-specific i) microbiome, ii) sex hormone and iii) behavioural impacts

Both sexes show disrupted gut bacterial members that regulate sex hormone levels

Male mice demonstrate deficits in mate seeking, which may be mediated by reduced seminal vesicle mass and reduced androgen levels

Female mice lack behavioural deficits, but demonstrate increased amoeboid microglia in the hippocampus

">Molecular Specializations Underlying Phenotypic Differences in Inner Ear Hair Cells of Zebrafish and Mice</a></h4>

              
                Hair cells (HCs) are the sensory receptors of the auditory and vestibular systems in the inner ears of vertebrates that selectively transduce mechanical stimuli into electrical activity. Although all HCs have the hallmark stereocilia bundle for mechanotransduction, HCs in non-mammals and mammals differ in their molecular specialization in the apical, basolateral and synaptic membranes. HCs of non-mammals, such as zebrafish (zHCs), are electrically tuned to specific frequencies and possess an active process in the stereocilia bundle to amplify sound signals. Mammalian cochlear HCs, in contrast, are not electrically tuned and achieve amplification by somatic motility of outer HCs (OHCs). To understand the genetic mechanisms underlying differences among adult zebrafish and mammalian cochlear HCs, we compared their RNA-seq-characterized transcriptomes, focusing on protein-coding orthologous genes related to HC specialization. There was considerable shared expression of gene orthologs among the HCs, including those genes associated with mechanotransduction, ion transport/channels, and synaptic signaling. For example, both zebrafish and mouse HCs express Tmc1, Lhfpl5, Tmie, Cib2, Cacna1d, Cacnb2, Otof, Pclo and Slc17a8. However, there were some notable differences in expression among zHCs, OHCs, and inner HCs (IHCs), which likely underlie the distinctive physiological properties of each cell type. Tmc2 and Cib3 were not detected in adult mouse HCs but tmc2a and b and cib3 were highly expressed in zHCs. Mouse HCs express Kcna10, Kcnj13, Kcnj16, and Kcnq4, which were not detected in zHCs. Chrna9 and Chrna10 were expressed in mouse HCs. In contrast, chrna10 was not detected in zHCs. OHCs highly express Slc26a5 which encodes the motor protein prestin that contributes to OHC electromotility. However, zHCs have only weak expression of slc26a5, and subsequently showed no voltage dependent electromotility when measured. Notably, the zHCs expressed more paralogous genes including those associated with HC-specific functions and transcriptional activity, though it is unknown whether they have functions similar to their mammalian counterparts. There was overlap in the expressed genes associated with a known hearing phenotype. Our analyses unveil substantial differences in gene expression patterns that may explain phenotypic specialization of zebrafish and mouse HCs. This dataset also includes several protein-coding genes to further the functional characterization of HCs and study of HC evolution from non-mammals to mammals.

">Angiogenesis in the mature mouse cortex is governed in a region specific and Notch1 dependent manner</a></h4>

              
                Cerebral angiogenesis is well appreciated in development and after injury, but the extent to which it occurs across cortical regions in normal adult mice and underlying mechanisms, is incompletely understood. Using in vivo imaging, we show that angiogenesis in anterior-medial cortical regions (retrosplenial and sensorimotor cortex), was exceptionally rare. By contrast, angiogenesis was significantly elevated in posterior-lateral regions such as visual cortex, primarily within 200{micro}m of the cortical surface. There were no regional differences in vessel pruning or sex effects except for the length and depth of new capillaries. To understand mechanisms, we surveyed gene expression and found Notch related genes were enriched in ultra-stable retrosplenial versus visual cortex. Using endothelial specific knockdown of Notch1, cerebral angiogenesis was significantly increased along with genes implicated in angiogenesis (Apln, Angpt2, Cdkn1a). Our study shows that angiogenesis is regionally dependent and manipulations of Notch1 signaling could unlock the angiogenic potential of the mature vasculature.

">A connectomics-driven analysis reveals novel characterization of border regions in mouse visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                Leveraging retinotopic maps to parcellate the visual cortex into its respective sub-regions has long been a canonical approach to characterizing the functional organization of visual areas in the mouse brain. However, with the advent of extensive connectomics datasets like MICrONS, we can now perform more granular analyses on biological neural networks, enabling us to better characterize the structural and functional profile of the visual cortex. In this work, we propose a statistical framework for analyzing the MICrONS dataset, focusing our efforts on the network encompassed by the retinotopically-induced V1, RL, and AL visual areas. In particular, we bridge the gap between connectomics and retinotopy by identifying several structural and functional differences between these regions. Most notably, by placing our attention on the borders between these regions, we demonstrate how connectomics, in some ways, supersedes retinotopy, providing evidence for two major findings. One, by comparing the V1-RL and RL-AL border regions, we show that not all borders in the visual cortex are the same with respect to structure and function. Two, we propose a novel interpretation for the V1-RL border region in particular, motivating it as a subnetwork that possesses heightened synaptic connectivity and more synchronous neural activity. Going one step further, we analyze structure and function in tandem by measuring information flow along synapses, demonstrating that the V1-RL border serves as a bridge for communication between the V1 and RL visual areas, offering justification as to why it presents itself uniquely with respect to both structure and function.

">Characterization of sleep in a mouse model of CLN3 disease revealed sex-specific sleep disturbances</a></h4>

              
                The neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs) are a group of recessively inherited neurodegenerative diseases characterized by lysosomal storage of fluorescent materials. CLN3 disease, or juvenile Batten disease, is the most common NCL that is caused by mutations in the Ceroid Lipofuscinosis, Neuronal 3 (CLN3) gene. Sleep disturbances are among the most common symptoms associated with CLN3 disease, yet this is understudied and has not been delineated in an animal model of the disease. The current study utilized a non-invasive, automated piezoelectric motion sensing system (PiezoSleep) to classify sleep and wakefulness in a Cln3{phi}..ex1-6/{phi}..ex1-6 (Cln3KO) mouse model and age- and sex-matched wild-type (WT) controls. The sleep-wake classification by PiezoSleep was found to be about 90% accurate when validated against simultaneous gold standard polysomnographic recordings including electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG) in a small cohort of WT and Cln3KO mice. Our large cohort PiezoSleep study reveals sleep abnormalities during the light period (LP) in male Cln3KO mice compared to WT male, and more subtle differences in Cln3KO female mice throughout the dark period (DP) compared to WT female, recapitulating sleep abnormalities seen in CLN3 disease patients. Our characterization of sleep in a mouse model of CLN3 disease contributes to a better understanding of the sleep disturbances commonly reported for CLN3 disease and other NCLs, which will facilitate the development of new disease treatment and management strategies.

">Estimating steady-state evoked potentials in the limit of short data duration and low stimulation frequency.</a></h4>

              
                Because of their high signal-to-noise ratio and robustness to artifacts, Steady-State Evoked Potentials (SSEP) - the periodic responses elicited by periodic stimulation designs - are increasingly used in human neuroscience for measuring stimulus-specific brain responses in a short presentation time. While widely applied to measure sensory responses with stimulation frequencies higher than 8 Hz, they are also successful to investigate high-order processes and/or early development characterized by slower time scales, requiring very low stimulation frequencies around 1 Hz. However, applications of these low frequency paradigms on developmental or clinical populations, typically relying on very short data recordings, pose a methodological challenge for SSEP estimation. Here we tackled this challenge by investigating the method of analysis that most efficiently compute SSEP at low stimulation frequencies in the limit of short data, and by estimating the minimum data length necessary to obtain a reliable response. We compared the performance of the three most commonly used measures of SSEP (power spectrum (PS), evoked power spectrum (EPS) and inter-trial coherence (ITC)) at progressively shorter data segments both on simulated data and on EEG responses to on-off checkerboard stimulation at two  low frequencies (4 Hz and 0.8 Hz). Results, consistent between simulated and real data, show that while for long data length EPS and ITC outperform PS, for short data length the three measures are equivalent, and the crucial parameter is the length of the sliding window over which each measure is computed: the longer the better for PS and EPS, whereas the opposite occurs for ITC. For the analysed dataset, the shortest data length required to estimate a reliable SSEP is as short as 8 cycles of stimulation, independently from the stimulation frequency. This study provides practical indications for reliable and efficient application of low-frequency SSEP designs on short data recordings.

">Circadian clock neurons use activity-regulated gene expression for structural plasticity</a></h4>

              
                Drosophila s-LNv circadian pacemaker neurons show dramatic structural plasticity, with their projections expanded at dawn and then retracted by dusk. This predictable plasticity makes s-LNvs ideal to study molecular mechanisms of plasticity. Although s-LNv plasticity is controlled by their molecular clock, changing s-LNv excitability also regulates plasticity. Here, we tested the idea that s-LNvs use activity-regulated genes to control plasticity. We found that inducing expression of either of the activity-regulated transcription factors Hr38 or Sr (orthologs of mammalian Nr4a1 and Egr1) is sufficient to rapidly expand s-LNv projections. Conversely, transiently knocking down expression of either Hr38 or sr blocks expansion of s-LNv projections at dawn. We show that Hr38 rapidly induces transcription of sif, which encodes a Rac1 GEF required for s-LNv plasticity rhythms. We conclude that the s-LNv molecular clock controls s-LNv excitability, which couples to an activity-regulated gene expression program to control s-LNv plasticity.

">The UFMylation pathway is impaired in Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                BackgroundAlzheimers disease (AD) is characterized by the presence of neurofibrillary tangles made of hyperphosphorylated tau and senile plaques composed of beta-amyloid. These pathognomonic deposits have been implicated in the pathogenesis, although the molecular mechanisms and consequences remain undetermined. UFM1 is an important, but understudied ubiquitin-like protein that is covalently attached to substrates. This UFMylation has recently been identified as major modifier of tau aggregation upon seeding in experimental models. However, potential alterations of the UFM1 pathway in human AD brain have not been investigated yet.

MethodsHere we used frontal and temporal cortex samples from individuals with or without AD to measure the protein levels of the UFMylation pathway in human brain. We used multivariable regression analyses followed by Bonferroni correction for multiple testing to analyze associations of the UFMylation pathway with neuropathological characteristics, primary biochemical measurements of tau and additional biochemical markers from the same cases. We further studied associations of the UFMylation cascade with cellular stress pathways using Spearman correlations with bulk RNAseq expression data and functionally validated these interactions using gene-edited neurons that were generated by CRISPR-Cas9.

ResultsCompared to controls, human AD brain had increased protein levels of UFM1. Our data further indicates that this increase mainly reflects conjugated UFM1 indicating hyperUFMylation in AD. UFMylation was strongly correlated with pathological tau in both AD-affected brain regions. In addition, we found that the levels of conjugated UFM1 were negatively correlated with soluble levels of the deUFMylation enzyme UFSP2. Functional analysis of UFM1 and/or UFSP2 knockout neurons revealed that the DNA damage response as well as the unfolded protein response are perturbed by changes in neuronal UFM1 signaling.

ConclusionsThere are marked changes in the UFMylation pathway in human AD brain. These changes are significantly associated with pathological tau, supporting the idea that the UFMylation cascade might indeed act as a modifier of tau pathology in human brain. Our study further nominates UFSP2 as an attractive target to reduce the hyperUFMylation observed in AD brain but also underscores the critical need to identify risks and benefits of manipulating the UFMylation pathway as potential therapeutic avenue for AD.

">Patterned Electrical Brain Stimulation by a Wireless Network of Implantable Microdevices</a></h4>

              
                Transmitting meaningful information into brain circuits by electronic means is a challenge facing brain-computer interfaces. A key goal is to find an approach to inject spatially structured local current stimuli across swaths of sensory areas of the cortex. Here, we introduce a fully wireless approach to multipoint patterned electrical microstimulation by a spatially distributed epicortically implanted network of silicon microchips to target specific areas of the cortex. Each sub-millimeter-sized microchip harvests energy from an external radio-frequency source and converts this into biphasic current injected focally into tissue by a pair of integrated microwires. The amplitude, period, and repetition rate of injected current from each chip are controlled across the implant network by implementing a pre-scheduled, collision-free bitmap wireless communication protocol featuring sub-millisecond latency. As an in vivo demonstration, a network of 30 wireless stimulators was chronically implanted into motor and sensory areas of the cortex in a freely moving rat for three months. We explored the effects of patterned intracortical electrical stimulation on trained animal behavior at average RF powers well below safety limits.

">Muscle-derived miR-200a-3p through light-intensity exercise may contribute to improve memory dysfunction in type 2 diabetic mice</a></h4>

              
                BackgroundMemory dysfunction associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) poses a considerable threat to overall well-being. Engaging in light-intensity exercise has been shown to exert favorable effects on hippocampal function and molecular profiles, including Mct2 mRNA and miR-200a-3p. Nonetheless, a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms underlying the positive impact of light-intensity exercise remains elusive. Here, we assessed the influence of exosomal miR-200a-3p secretion from gastrocnemius muscles in T2DM mice undergoing light-intensity exercise intervention, focusing on its potential to ameliorate memory dysfunction.

Basic proceduresWe initially assessed the effects of light-intensity exercise (7.0 m/min for healthy mice, 5.0 m/min for ob/ob mice, 30 min/day, five days/week, over a four-week period) on memory function, hippocampal mRNA associated with memory function, and the secretion of exosomal miR-200a-3p from their gastrocnemius muscle. Subsequently, the impact of a daily intraperitoneal injection of the miR-200a-3p mimic over a four-week duration was investigated, focusing on its influence on hippocampal dysregulation in ob/ob mice.

Main findingsThe light-intensity exercise intervention increased gastrocnemius muscle-derived and plasma exosomal miR-200a-3p levels in ob/ob mice, concomitant with improved memory dysfunction. Intriguingly, the daily intraperitoneal injection of mmu-miR-200a-3p mimic also demonstrated an ameliorative effect on memory function in ob/ob mice. Notably, both the exercise intervention and miR-200a-3p mimic treatment induced downregulation in hippocampal Keap1 mRNA and upregulation in mRNA of Hsp90aa1 and Mct2 in ob/ob mice.

Principal conclusionsThe current results imply that the augmentation of exosomal miR-200a-3p derived from the gastrocnemius muscle contributes to the amelioration of memory dysfunction in T2DM undergoing light-intensity exercise. Additionally, it is proposed that miR-200a-3p emulates the effects of light-intensity exercise, suggesting a potential therapeutic pathway for addressing hippocampal complications in the context of T2DM.

">The fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, as a micro-robotics platform.</a></h4>

              
                Engineering small autonomous agents capable of operating in the microscale environment remains a key challenge, with current systems still evolving. Our study explores the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, a classic model system in biology and a species adept at microscale interaction, as a biological platform for micro-robotics. Initially, we focus on remotely directing the walking paths of fruit flies in an experimental arena. We accomplish this through two distinct approaches: harnessing the fruit flies opto-motor response and optogenetic modulation of its olfactory system. These techniques facilitate reliable and repeated guidance of flies between arbitrary spatial locations. We guide flies along predetermined trajectories, enabling them to scribe patterns resembling textual characters through their locomotion. We enhance olfactory-guided navigation through additional optogenetic activation of positive valence mushroom body output neurons. We extend this control to collective behaviors in shared spaces and navigation through constrained maze-like environments. We further use our guidance technique to enable flies to carry a load across designated points in space, establishing the upper bound on their weight carrying capabilities. Additionally, we demonstrate that visual guidance can facilitate novel interactions between flies and objects, showing that flies can consistently relocate a small spherical object over significant distances. Beyond expanding tools available for micro-robotics, these novel behavioral contexts can provide insights into the neurological basis of behavior in fruit flies.

">Senescent-like microglia limit remyelination through the senescence associated secretory phenotype</a></h4>

              
                The capacity to regenerate myelin in the central nervous system (CNS) diminishes with age. This decline is particularly evident in multiple sclerosis (MS), which has been suggested to exhibit features of accelerated biological aging. Whether cellular senescence, a hallmark of aging, contributes to remyelination impairment remains unknown. Here, we show that senescent cells (SCs) accumulate within demyelinated lesions after injury, and their elimination enhances remyelination in young mice but not in aged mice. In young mice, we observed the upregulation of senescence-associated transcripts primarily in microglia after demyelination, followed by their reduction during remyelination. However, in aged mice, senescence-associated factors persisted within lesions, correlating with inefficient remyelination. We found that SC elimination enhanced remyelination in young mice but was ineffective in aged mice. Proteomic analysis of senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) revealed elevated levels of CCL11/Eotaxin-1 in lesions, which was found to inhibit efficient oligodendrocyte maturation. These results suggest therapeutic targeting of SASP components, such as CCL11, may improve remyelination in aging and MS.

">Tonotopy is not preserved in a descending stage of auditory cortex</a></h4>

              
                Previous studies based on layer specificity suggest that ascending signals from the thalamus to sensory neocortex preserve spatially organized information, but it remains unknown whether sensory information descending from sensory neocortex to thalamus also maintains such spatial organization pattern. By focusing on projection specificity, we mapped tone response properties of two groups of cortical neurons in the primary auditory cortex (A1), based on the relationship between their specific connections to other regions and their function in ascending (thalamocortical recipient, TR neurons) or descending (corticothalamic, CT neurons) auditory information. A clear tonotopic gradient was observed among TR, but not CT neurons. Additionally, CT neurons exhibited markedly higher heterogeneity in their frequency tuning and had broader bandwidth than TR neurons. These results reveal that the information flow descending from A1 to thalamus via CT neurons does not arrange tonotopically, suggesting that the descending information flow possibly contributes to higher-order feedback processing of diverse auditory inputs.

">Testing the application of plasma glucocorticoids and their ratios as biomarkers of acute and chronic stress in rescued wild koala patients: a pilot study</a></h4>

              
                Koalas (Phascolarctos cinereus) are one of the most iconic marsupial species endemic to Australia. However, their population is declining due to threats including habitat loss, disease, dog attacks, and vehicle collisions. These threats also serve as acute or chronic stressors that impact koala welfare and conservation. Cortisol is widely used as a biomarker to study stress in koalas. However, plasma cortisol concentration is less studied due to its limited ability to assess chronic stress and welfare concerns. Dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHEAS) and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) are biomarkers that could potentially detect chronic stress due to their antagonising and inhibitory effects on cortisol. In this study, we used plasma cortisol and the ratio of DHEAS and DHT to cortisol to assess stress in rescued koalas (n = 10) admitted to RSPCA Queensland. Although no significant differences were found between koalas across all biomarkers and the ratios failed to detect chronic stressors, similar trends were found consistently, suggesting the potential use of the biomarkers to assess stress. Across all biomarkers, the highest medians were found in koalas with Chlamydia-related reproductive disease and oxalate nephrosis and the lowest medians were found in koalas with Chlamydia-related conjunctivitis. Higher medians were also found consistently in females (n = 3) and adult koalas. In addition, insignificant negative correlations were found across all biomarkers between age, weight, and body conditioning scores, except for the positive correlation between weight and cortisol and cortisol:DHT. Overall, the consistency of trends and the insignificant differences found across biomarkers in our study suggested that using a single biomarker to assess chronic stress is insufficient, especially for hospital-based studies limited by sample population. Thus, this pilot study provides first step towards developing a koala-specific allostatic load index based on multiple stress biomarkers to understand chronic stress in rescued koalas.

Lay summaryStress in koalas can be challenging for their welfare and conservation. In this study, we tested plasma glucocorticoids and their ratios as biomarkers of acute and chronic stress. Our finding showed ratios of DHEAS and DHT to cortisol are comparable across stress parameters and animal demographic characteristics. This study serves as a foundational framework for developing a stress index based on multiple biomarkers that could be useful tool for koala welfare.

">Diffusion model-based image generation from rat brain activity</a></h4>

              
                Brain-computer interface (BCI) technology has gained recognition in various fields, including clinical applications, assistive technology, and human-computer interaction research. BCI enables communication, control, and monitoring of the affective/cognitive states of users. Recently, BCI has also found applications in the artistic field, enabling real-time art composition using brain activity signals, and engaging performers, spectators, or an entire audience with brain activity-based artistic environments. Existing techniques use specific features of brain activity, such as the P300 wave and SSVEPs, to control drawing tools, rather than directly reflecting brain activity in the output image. In this study, we present a novel approach that uses a latent diffusion model, a type of deep neural network, to generate images directly from continuous brain activity. We demonstrate this technology using local field potentials from the neocortex of freely moving rats. This system continuously converted the recorded brain activity into images. Our end-to-end method for generating images from brain activity opens up new possibilities for creative expression and experimentation.

">CRASH2p: Closed-loop Two Photon Imaging in Freely Moving Animals</a></h4>

              
                Direct measurement of neural activity in freely moving animals is essential for understanding how the brain controls and represents behaviors. Genetically encoded calcium indicators report neural activity as changes in fluorescence intensity, but brain motion confounds quantitative measurement of fluorescence. Translation, rotation, and deformation of the brain and the movements of intervening scattering or auto-fluorescent tissue all alter the amount of fluorescent light captured by a microscope. Compared to single-photon approaches, two photon microscopy is less sensitive to scattering and off-target fluorescence, but more sensitive to motion, and two photon imaging has always required anchoring the microscope to the brain. We developed a closed-loop resonant axial-scanning high-speed two photon (CRASH2p) microscope for real-time 3D motion correction in unrestrained animals, without implantation of reference markers. We complemented CRASH2p with a novel scanning strategy and a multi-stage registration pipeline. We performed volumetric ratiometrically corrected functional imaging in the CNS of freely moving Drosophila larvae and discovered previously unknown neural correlates of behavior.

">Different state-dependence of population codes across cortex</a></h4>

              
                During perceptual decision-making, behavioral performance varies with changes in internal states such as arousal, motivation, and strategy. Yet it is unknown how these internal states affect information coding across cortical regions involved in differing aspects of sensory perception and decision-making. We recorded neural activity from the primary auditory cortex (AC) and posterior parietal cortex (PPC) in mice performing a navigation-based sound localization task. We then modeled transitions in the behavioral strategies mice used during task performance. Mice transitioned between three latent performance states with differing decision-making strategies: an  optimal state and two  sub-optimal states characterized by choice bias and frequent errors. Performance states strongly influenced population activity patterns in association but not sensory cortex. Surprisingly, activity of individual PPC neurons was better explained by external inputs and behavioral variables during suboptimal behavioral performance than in the optimal performance state. Furthermore, shared variability across neurons (coupling) in PPC was strongest in the optimal state. In AC, shared variability was similarly weak across all performance states. Together, these findings indicate that neural activity in association cortex is more strongly linked to internal state than in sensory cortex.

	<p>Depression is the most common mental disorder worldwide. Both antidepressants and psychotherapy are effective in treating depression, but the response to these treatments is often incomplete. Yoga-based interventions (YBIs) have been advocated by some researchers as a promising form of alternative treatment for depression. Recent research has attempted to identify the biological mechanisms associated with the antidepressant actions of YBIs. In this scoping review, conducted according to the PRISMA-ScR guidelines, the PubMed and Scopus databases were searched to retrieve research on biomarkers of response to YBIs in patients with depression. These studies were also critically reviewed to evaluate their methodological quality and any sources of bias. Nineteen studies were included in the review. Based on these studies, there is preliminary evidence that YBIs may be associated with increased serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and reduced serum cortisol and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in patients with depression. However, many of these changes were also observed in the control arms, and the overall quality of the research was low. At present, it cannot be concluded that there are reliable biomarkers of response to YBIs in depression, though there are some potential biological correlates. Further advances in this field will depend critically on improvements in study design, particularly the minimization of sources of bias and the selection of more specific and sensitive biomarkers based on existing evidence from other treatment modalities.</p>

	<p>Over the past twenty years, scientific research on body representations has grown significantly, with Body Memory (BM) emerging as a prominent area of interest in neurorehabilitation. Compared to other body representations, BM stands out as one of the most obscure due to the multifaceted nature of the concept of &amp;amp;ldquo;memory&amp;amp;rdquo; itself, which includes various aspects (such as implicit vs. explicit, conscious vs. unconscious). The concept of body memory originates from the field of phenomenology and has been developed by research groups studying embodied cognition. In this narrative review, we aim to present compelling evidence from recent studies that explore various definitions and explanatory models of BM. Additionally, we will provide a comprehensive overview of the empirical settings used to examine BM. The results can be categorized into two main areas: (i) how the body influences our memories, and (ii) how memories, in their broadest sense, could generate and/or influence metarepresentations&amp;amp;mdash;the ability to reflect on or make inferences about one&amp;amp;rsquo;s own cognitive representations or those of others. We present studies that emphasize the significance of BM in experimental settings involving patients with neurological and psychiatric disorders, ultimately analyzing these findings from an ontogenic perspective.</p>

                <p>Seizures are generally associated with epilepsy but may also be a symptom of many other neurological conditions. A hallmark of a seizure is the intensity of the local neuronal activation, which can drive large-scale gene transcription changes. Such changes in the transcriptional profile likely alter neuronal function, thereby contributing to the pathological process. Therefore, there is a strong clinical imperative to characterize how gene expression is changed by seizure activity. To this end, we developed a simplified ex vivo technique for studying seizure-induced transcriptional changes. We compared the RNA sequencing profile in mouse neocortical tissue with up to 3&nbsp;h of epileptiform activity induced by 4-aminopyridine (4AP) relative to control brain slices not exposed to the drug. We identified over 100 genes with significantly altered expression after 4AP treatment, including multiple genes involved in MAPK, TNF, and neuroinflammatory signaling pathways, all of which have been linked to epilepsy previously. Notably, the patterns in male and female brain slices were almost identical. Various immediate early genes were among those showing the largest upregulation. The set of down-regulated genes included ones that might be expected either to increase or to decrease neuronal excitability. In summary, we found the seizure-induced transcriptional profile complex, but the changes aligned well with an analysis of published epilepsy-associated genes. We discuss how simple models may provide new angles for investigating seizure-induced transcriptional changes.</p>

                <p>High-density linear probes, such as Neuropixels, provide an unprecedented opportunity to understand how neural populations within specific laminar compartments contribute to behavior. Marmoset monkeys, unlike macaque monkeys, have a lissencephalic (smooth) cortex that enables recording perpendicular to the cortical surface, thus making them an ideal animal model for studying laminar computations. Here we present a method for acute Neuropixels recordings in the common marmoset (<I>Callithrix jacchus</I>). The approach replaces the native dura with an artificial silicon-based dura that grants visual access to the cortical surface, which is helpful in avoiding blood vessels, ensures perpendicular penetrations, and could be used in conjunction with optical imaging or optogenetic techniques. The chamber housing the artificial dura is simple to maintain with minimal risk of infection and could be combined with semichronic microdrives and wireless recording hardware. This technique enables repeated acute penetrations over a period of several months. With occasional removal of tissue growth on the pial surface, recordings can be performed for a year or more. The approach is fully compatible with Neuropixels probes, enabling the recording of hundreds of single neurons distributed throughout the cortical column.</p>

                <p>by Samuel H. Church, Jasmine L. Mah, Casey W. Dunn</p>

Comparisons of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data across species can reveal links between cellular gene expression and the evolution of cell functions, features, and phenotypes. These comparisons evoke evolutionary histories, as depicted by phylogenetic trees, that define relationships between species, genes, and cells. This Essay considers each of these in turn, laying out challenges and solutions derived from a phylogenetic comparative approach and relating these solutions to previously proposed methods for the pairwise alignment of cellular dimensional maps. This Essay contends that species trees, gene trees, cell phylogenies, and cell lineages can all be reconciled as descriptions of the same concept‚Äîthe tree of cellular life. By integrating phylogenetic approaches into scRNA-seq analyses, challenges for building informed comparisons across species can be overcome, and hypotheses about gene and cell evolution can be robustly tested.

                <p>by Meng-Han Joseph Chung, Rebecca J. Fox, Michael D. Jennions</p>

When males compete, sexual selection favors reproductive traits that increase their mating or fertilization success (pre- and postcopulatory sexual selection). It is assumed that males face a trade-off between these 2 types of sexual traits because they both draw from the same pool of resources. Consequently, allocation into mate acquisition or ejaculation should create similar trade-offs with other key life history traits. Tests of these assumptions are exceedingly rare. Males only ejaculate after they mate, and the costs of ejaculation are therefore highly confounded with those of mating effort. Consequently, little is known about how each component of reproductive allocation affects a male‚Äôs future performance. Here, we ran an experiment using a novel technique to distinguish the life history costs of mating effort and ejaculation for mosquitofish (<i>Gambusia holbrooki</i>). We compared manipulated males (mate without ejaculation), control males (mate and ejaculate), and na√Øve males (neither mate nor ejaculate) continuously housed with a female and 2 rival males. We assessed their growth, somatic maintenance, mating and fighting behavior, and sperm traits after 8 and 16 weeks. Past mating effort significantly lowered a male‚Äôs future mating effort and growth, but not his sperm production, while past sperm release significantly lowered a male‚Äôs future ejaculate quantity, but not his mating effort. Immune response was the only trait impacted by both past mating effort and past ejaculation. These findings challenge the assumption that male reproductive allocation draws from a common pool of resources to generate similar life history costs later in life. Instead, we provide clear evidence that allocation into traits under pre- and postcopulatory sexual selection have different trait-specific effects on subsequent male reproductive performance.

                Background The application of disinfectants on dental instruments is one way to prevent cross-infection. Cross infection can occur due to microorganisms found in blood, saliva and dental plaque which can contaminate the instruments used by dental health workers. Thus, indirect contact transmission of pathogenic microorganisms occurs from instruments that have been contaminated by dental health workers. Ozone water and 4.8% chloroxylenol are disinfecting agents used to disinfect medical instruments. This study aimed to determine the effectiveness of disinfection of ozone water and 4.8% chloroxylenol in reducing the number of bacterial colonies on dental extraction instruments at the USU Dental and Oral Hospital between October-December 2022. Methods The samples used were mandibular molar pliers that have been used in tooth extraction procedures. This study was experimental and used three sample groups, where each group consisted of 10 tooth extraction instruments. The treatment group used ozone water and 4.8% chloroxylenol and the negative control group was cleaned with distilled water. The test effectiveness in this study used bacteria colony counter using the scatter cup method. Data were analyzed using the Kruskal Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests. Results The results of the data analysis showed a p-value ‚â§0.001, which means that there was a significant difference in the disinfection using ozone water and 4.8% chloroxylenol on the number of bacterial colonies on dental extraction instruments. The results of this study show that the average number of bacterial colonies formed in the ozone water treatment group was 4.00 ¬± 4.32, 16.00 ¬± 6.65 in the 4.8% chloroxylenol treatment group, and 217.50 ¬± 39.24 in the negative control group (Aquadest). Conclusions From this study it can be said that ozone water is more effective in disinfecting dental extraction instruments than 4.8% chloroxylenol.

                Background: Home-based rehabilitation exercise following Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA) shows similar outcomes compared to supervised outpatient rehabilitation exercise. Little is known about patients‚Äô experiences with home-based rehabilitation, and this study aimed to investigate patient-perceived facilitators and barriers to home-based rehabilitation exercise and general physical activity after THA. Methods: Semi-structured interviews of qualitative design were conducted with 22 patients who had undergone THA and who had performed home-based rehabilitation exercise. The study took place in a regional hospital in Denmark between January 2018 and May 2019. Data was analyzed using an interpretive thematic analysis approach, with theoretical underpinning from the concept ‚Äòconduct of everyday life‚Äô.¬†The study is embedded within the Pragmatic Home-Based Exercise Therapy after Total Hip Arthroplasty-Silkeborg trial (PHETHAS-1), which aims to quantitatively investigate recovery outcomes after a home-based rehabilitation exercise program. Results: The main theme, ‚Äòwishing to return to the well-known everyday life‚Äô, and the subtheme ‚Äògeneral physical activity versus rehabilitation exercise‚Äô were identified. Generally, participants found the home-based rehabilitation exercise boring but were motivated by the goal of returning to their habitual conduct of everyday life and performing their usual general physical activities. Participants enrolled in the PHETHAS-1 study used the enrollment as part of their motivation for doing the exercises.¬† Both pain and the absence of pain were identified as barriers for doing home-based rehabilitation exercise. Pain could cause insecurity about possible medical complications, while the absence of pain could lead to the rehabilitation exercise being perceived as pointless. Conclusions: The overall goal for the THA patients was to return to their habitual everyday life. This goal served as a facilitator for undertaking home-based rehabilitation exercise. Being able to perform usual activities paradoxically became a barrier for some participants, as they were more motivated to engage in general physical activity than the rehabilitation exercise.

                Background Periodontal regeneration therapies frequently involve autologous platelet concentrates (APCs). They can be used in sinus lift surgeries and socket preservation, among other clinical settings. Platelet rich fibrin (PRF) membrane has been used to treat gingival recession in individuals or groups of individuals using a coronally progressed or lateral pedicle flap. In the treatment of mixed periodontic endodontic lesion/furcation defect, PRF functions as a healing and interpositional biomaterial, filling a cystic cavity. PRF is known to help the bone regeneration process. In the last few years, efforts have been made to enhance the PRFs characteristics and quality. One of them is titanium platelet rich fibrin (T-PRF). Third-generation platelet concentrate no longer contains silica, and its preparation in glass vacuum containers, that no longer creates any known concerns. The effectiveness PRF‚Äôs has been evaluated in connective tissue and bone repair. The aim of this study is to compare T-PRF to other platelet concentrates and different treatment modalities for periodontal regenerative procedures. Methods A protocol of this systematic review have been registered in prospero (CRD42022293545). The online database searched were PUBMED, COCHRANE for published articles up to November 2022 without language restrictions. Studies in trial registers, handsearching, bibliographic references of relevant articles were also checked. Data collection and analysis was done by individual authors. Independent eligibility assessments were conducted by four review authors. Then, using the standard Cochrane methodology, four review authors extracted the data and evaluated the risk of bias for individual studies. We developed ‚ÄúSummary of findings‚Äù tables and used GRADE to evaluate the evidence. Results Three studies were included for meta-analysis. Results of meta-analysis supported that T-PRF is effective for correction of both hard and soft tissue defects. Conclusions The overall qualitative and quantitative analysis suggest that T-PRF has superior structural properties and thicker fibrin network for ensuring predictable success periodontal regenerative procedures.

                This meta-analysis is an investigation into anomalous perception (i.e., conscious identification of information without any conventional sensorial means). The technique used for eliciting an effect is the Ganzfeld condition (a form of sensory homogenization that eliminates distracting peripheral noise). The database consists of studies published between January 1974 and December 2020 inclusive. The overall effect size estimated both with a frequentist and a Bayesian random-effect model, were in close agreement yielding an effect size of approximately .08 (.04 -.12). This result passed four publication bias tests and seems not contaminated by questionable research practices. Trend analysis carried out with a cumulative meta-analysis and a meta-regression model with year of publication as a covariate, did not indicate sign of decline of this effect size. The moderators‚Äô analyses show that the selected participants‚Äô effect size was almost three-times that obtained by non-selected participants and that tasks that simulate telepathic communication show a two-fold effect size for tasks requiring the participants to guess a target.

                Background Neonatal Respiratory Distress Syndrome (NRDS) remains a significant challenge in neonatal care, often leading to respiratory compromise and neuromuscular dysfunction. While advances in medical management have improved outcomes, adjunctive therapies such as physical rehabilitation offer potential benefits yet require further investigation. This protocol outlines a randomized controlled trial aiming to evaluate the effect of Physical Rehabilitation using Oro Motor Stimulation, Manual Airway Clearance Technique, Positioning, Tactile, and Kinesthetic Stimulation (PROMPT) protocol on respiratory and neuromuscular function in neonates with NRDS. Methods The trial will include 38 neonates diagnosed with NRDS, randomly allocated into two groups: the intervention group receiving the PROMPT protocol alongside standard care, and the control group receiving standard care alone. The PROMPT protocol comprises a comprehensive approach targeting oromotor stimulation, manual airway clearance technique, optimal positioning, and tactile/kinesthetic stimulation. Outcome measures Primary outcomes will focus on respiratory parameters such as oxygenation index, ventilatory support requirements, and neuromuscular function assessed through muscle tone and reflexes. Secondary outcomes will encompass length of hospital stay, incidence of complications, and neurodevelopmental outcomes at follow-up. Results Data analysis will employ appropriate statistical methods to compare outcomes between the intervention and control groups, with adjustments for potential confounders. Ethical approval has been obtained, and informed consent will be obtained from parents or legal guardians before enrolment. Conclusion This trial protocol aims to provide valuable insights into the efficacy and safety of the PROMPT protocol as a rehabilitative intervention for NRDS. The findings may inform future clinical practice and contribute to optimizing care strategies for neonates with NRDS, ultimately improving their short- and long-term outcomes.

                Background Fatty liver, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular disease are just a few of the well-known cardiometabolic complications associated with childhood obesity. Microalbuminuria (MA) is a sign of early kidney impairment, as seen in adults, and recent research supports its presence in children with obesity as well as its potential relationship with cardiometabolic variables. Both adults and children share this well-established pathophysiological theory. Indicated a close connection with the main aspect of fatness, such as IR, through the renal hemodynamic effects of insulin. More scientific consideration must be given to the assessment of primary kidney injury in obese children, given the pathological and prognostic implications of this association in everyday practise (counting an elevated danger of developing long term renal disorder over time). Method case-control study is going to be conducted among the patients of AVBRH hospital. A total of thirty participants with fifteen obese and fifteen non obeses controls were included in this study. Result The expected result of the study can determine the correlation between obesity and microalbuminuria, The value of microalbuminuria is high in obese patients as compared to nonobese patients. Conclusion The risk of problems in obese patients can be predicted using microalbuminuria, which can help lower the overall morbidity and mortality associated with renal function.

                Background Over the past few decades, WHO has made massive efforts to promote the development of a vaccine against Lassa virus (LASV), one of the top ten priority pathogens for research and development under the WHO R&D Blueprint for Emerging Infections. To date, several vaccines are at different stages of development. In this scenario, a validated and standardised assay to measure LSV neutralising antibodies is urgently needed for vaccine development and comparison. Methods The neutralisation assay remains the gold standard for determining antibody efficacy. Here we have proposed a safe and validated pseudotyped neutralisation assay for LASV, taking advantage of the development of the first WHO International Standard and Reference Panel for Anti-Lassa Fever (NIBSC code 21/332). Results and Conclusions The proposed results demonstrate that the pseudotyped luciferase neutralisation assay is a specific serological test for the measurement of LASV neutralising antibodies without cross-reacting with standard sera specific for heterologous viral infections. In addition, the assay is accurate, precise, and linear according to criteria and statistical analyses defined and accepted by international guidelines.

                Background RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is a widely used technique in many scientific studies. Given the plethora of models and software packages that have been developed for processing and analyzing RNA-seq datasets, choosing the most appropriate ones is a time-consuming process that requires an in-depth understanding of the data, as well as of the principles and parameters of each tool. In addition, packages designed for individual tasks are developed in different programming languages and have dependencies of various degrees of complexity, which renders their installation and execution challenging for users with limited computational expertise. Workflow languages and execution engines with support for virtualization and encapsulation options such as containers and Conda environments facilitate these tasks considerably. The resulting computational workflows can then be reliably shared with the scientific community, enhancing reusability and the reproducibility of results as individual analysis steps are becoming more transparent and portable. Methods Here we present ZARP, a general purpose RNA-seq analysis workflow that builds on state-of-the-art software in the field to facilitate the analysis of RNA-seq datasets. ZARP is developed in the Snakemake workflow language and can run locally or in a cluster environment, generating extensive reports not only of the data but also of the options utilized. It is built using modern technologies with the ultimate goal to reduce the hands-on time for bioinformaticians and non-expert users and serve as a template for future workflow development. To this end, we also provide ZARP-cli, a dedicated command-line interface that may make running ZARP on an RNA-seq library of interest as easy as executing a single two-word command. Conclusions ZARP is a powerful RNA-seq analysis workflow that is easy to use even for beginners, built using best software development practices, available under a permissive Open Source license and open to contributions by the scientific community.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The consolidation of memory is thought to ultimately depend on the synthesis of new proteins, since translational inhibitors such as anisomycin and cycloheximide adversely affect the permanence of long-term memory. However, when applied directly in brain, these agents also profoundly suppress neural activity to an extent that is directly correlated to the degree of protein synthesis inhibition caused. Given that neural activity itself is likely to help mediate consolidation, this finding is a serious criticism of the strict de novo protein hypothesis of memory. Here, we test the neurophysiological effects of another translational inhibitor, emetine. Unilateral intra-hippocampal infusion of emetine suppressed ongoing local field and multiunit activity at ipsilateral sites as compared to the contralateral hippocampus in a fashion that was positively correlated to the degree of protein synthesis inhibition as confirmed by autoradiography. This suppression of activity was also specific to the circumscribed brain region in which protein synthesis inhibition took place. These experiments provide further evidence that ongoing protein synthesis is necessary and fundamental for neural function and suggest that the disruption of memory observed in behavioral experiments using translational inhibitors may be due, in large part, to neural suppression.</p>

                Petrous face meningioma presents a significant difficulty in neurosurgery because of its complex anatomical position near cranial nerves, brainstem, and important blood vessels. This case report describes the clinical course and successful surgical treatment of a 50-year-old female patient who had a two-month history of ataxia, along with a one-week episode of severe headache and vomiting. An MRI verified the existence of a petrous face meningioma after a thorough diagnostic assessment. Following that, the patient had a left retro-sigmoid craniotomy, which led to the complete excision of the tumour and relief of symptoms. A thorough one-month follow-up examination showed no recurring symptoms, suggesting a positive result and successful clearance of the meningioma. This case highlights the need of timely diagnosis and surgical treatment in dealing with petrous face meningioma, focusing on attaining complete tumour excision. This case demonstrates the success of complete removal of a tumour and the possibility of full return of neurological function in individuals with similar symptoms. This article enhances the current literature by offering insights into the management of petrous face meningioma and recommending a thorough surgical strategy to improve patient outcomes.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-531/v1?src=rss">Bibliometric Analysis of Islamic Crowdfunding: A Literature Review of Its Journey [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background The potential of Islamic crowdfunding to encourage the development of Islamic fintech globally, even in countries with non-Muslim majority populations, needs to be examined in a literature study on this issue. More extensive research is needed regarding the factors that most reliably predict the success of Islamic crowdfunding, such as compliance with Islamic crowdfunding laws, sustainability, and the potential of Islamic finance. This article describes a comprehensive and systematic Literature Review (SLR) regarding papers published in the field of Islamic crowdfunding. This research aims to contribute to a better understanding of Islamic crowdfunding, provide useful information for practitioners, and stimulate further research in the field to increase the success of Islamic crowdfunding. Methods We conducted a review of selected papers to identify gaps and significant issues in Islamic crowdfunding, providing guidance for future researchers. This article review was based on 704 articles retrieved using the keyword ‚ÄúIslamic crowdfunding‚Äù from the Scopus database between 2013 and 2022. To minimize bias, we formulated 5 research questions to guide our analysis: RQ1: How do publication and citation rates vary annually? RQ2: How can we determine the most influential studies based on citation counts for each keyword? RQ3: What are the most common subject areas addressed in Islamic crowdfunding literature from 2013 to 2022? RQ4: What are the most frequently used keywords in Scopus documents? RQ5: How are Islamic values discussed in articles related to Islamic crowdfunding? Results The findings of this research demonstrate that Islamic crowdfunding, characterized by interdisciplinary scholarship, has emerged as an increasingly significant alternative for aiding society and the economy. It contributes to poverty alleviation and the development of specific sectors through channels such as crowdfunding for small and medium enterprises and social projects tailored to meet the diverse needs of Muslims. However, the challenge facing the future development of Sharia crowdfunding is that, despite its benefit of increasing community participation in projects aligned with religious values, it also carries the potential risk of investment losses and non-compliance with Sharia principles. Ways to address the current scarcity of Sharia fintech are also needed, ensuring its broader acceptance across all societal levels, and enhancing Muslims‚Äô understanding of compliance with Islamic religious rules, particularly Fiqh law. Conclusion Urgently needed are specific fiqh regulatory guidelines to ensure that Sharia-compliant crowdfunding adheres to Islamic principles. Government support, particularly through legislation in countries where the majority of the population is Muslim, is crucial to enhance public participation and trust in Sharia crowdfunding.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-530/v1?src=rss">Association of maternal and cord vitamin B12 levels with anthropometry in term neonates born to malnourished mothers in coastal South India [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Malnourished pregnant women are at increased risk of micronutrient deficiency. We assessed the vitamin B12 status in both malnourished and normally nourished pregnant women and their neonates. Additionally, we studied the association between maternal B12 levels, cord B12 levels and neonatal anthropometry. Methods This cross-sectional study enrolled 63 malnourished and 63 normally nourished mothers and neonates. Maternal and cord blood samples were collected at the time of delivery for estimation of vitamin B12 levels. Maternal and cord vitamin B12 levels were compared using the Mann‚ÄìWhitney U test. Neonatal anthropometry was correlated with maternal and cord B12 levels using Spearman‚Äôs correlation. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 25. Results Mean maternal age was 26.58 yrs. The median cord B12 levels were lower than the maternal B12 levels. Maternal B12 levels showed a strong positive correlation with cord B12 levels (rho = 0.879; p < 0.001). Maternal (p < 0.001) and cord (p < 0.001) vitamin B12 levels were significantly lower in the malnourished group than in the normally nourished group. In malnourished group, 66.8% mothers and 95.2% neonates were Vitamin B12 deficient, whereas 1.5% mothers and 4.7% neonates were vitamin B12 deficient in normally nourished group. In the malnourished group, maternal B12 levels were positively correlated with birth weight (rho 0.363, p = 0.003) and length (rho 0.330, p =0.008), whereas cord B12 levels were positively correlated with birth weight in the normally nourished group. (rho 0.277 p= 0.028) Conclusion High rates of vitamin B12 deficiency were observed in malnourished mothers and neonates. There was a positive correlation between birth weight, length, and maternal vitamin B12 levels in malnourished mothers. These findings emphasize the need to address maternal malnutrition and vitamin B12 deficiency to improve neonatal health.

                A majority of humans maintain normal function despite exposure to severe stress. Work in rodents reveals that such stress resilience is mediated largely by the induction of molecular, cellular, and circuit adaptations that actively drive resilience. Such discoveries are guiding the development of novel treatments for human stress disorders.

                In novel environments, animals must simultaneously map their surroundings and form goals within them. Dan et¬†al. combine anatomy, physiology, perturbation, and behavior to show how genetically specified circuit architectures with localized plasticity couple multiple evolving internal representations to make this learning fast yet flexible.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(24)00325-8?rss=yes">Compensatory enhancement of input maintains aversive dopaminergic reinforcement in hungry Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Meschi et¬†al. discover a detailed neuronal mechanism through which a hormonal signal of nutrient deficit modulates aversive learning. Hormone-responsive neurons in the base of the fly brain enhance the gain of ascending input pathways that transduce punishing shock and bitter taste to dopaminergic neurons that write aversive memories.
