	<p>Decision-making is a cognitive process involving working memory, executive function, and attention. However, the connectivity of large-scale brain networks during decision-making is not well understood. This is because gaining access to large-scale brain networks in humans is still a novel process. Here, we used SEEG (stereoelectroencephalography) to record neural activity from the default mode network (DMN), dorsal attention network (DAN), and frontoparietal network (FN) in ten humans while they performed a gambling task in the form of the card game, &amp;amp;ldquo;War&amp;amp;rdquo;. By observing these networks during a decision-making period, we related the activity of and connectivity between these networks. In particular, we found that gamma band activity was directly related to a participant&amp;amp;rsquo;s ability to bet logically, deciding what betting amount would result in the highest monetary gain or lowest monetary loss throughout a session of the game. We also found connectivity between the DAN and the relation to a participant&amp;amp;rsquo;s performance. Specifically, participants with higher connectivity between and within these networks had higher earnings. Our preliminary findings suggest that connectivity and activity between these networks are essential during decision-making.</p>

	<p>Electrophysiological methods of research are widely used in neurobiology. To assess the bioelectrical activity of the brain in small laboratory animals, electrocorticography (ECoG) is most often used, which allows the recording of signals directly from the cerebral cortex. To date, a number of methodological approaches to the manufacture and implantation of ECoG electrodes have been proposed, the complexity of which is determined by experimental tasks and logistical capabilities. Existing methods for analyzing bioelectrical signals are used to assess the functional state of the nervous system in test animals, as well as to identify correlates of pathological changes or pharmacological effects. The review presents current areas of applications of ECoG in neuropharmacological studies in small laboratory animals. Traditionally, this method is actively used to study the antiepileptic activity of new molecules. However, the possibility of using ECoG to assess the neuroprotective activity of drugs in models of traumatic, vascular, metabolic, or neurodegenerative CNS damage remains clearly underestimated. Despite the fact that ECoG has a number of disadvantages and methodological difficulties, the recorded data can be a useful addition to traditional molecular and behavioral research methods. An analysis of the works in recent years indicates a growing interest in the method as a tool for assessing the pharmacological activity of psychoactive drugs, especially in combination with classification and prediction algorithms.</p>

                <p>As rapid responders to their environments, microglia engage in functions that are mirrored by their cellular morphology. Microglia are classically thought to exhibit a ramified morphology under homeostatic conditions which switches to an ameboid form during inflammatory conditions. However, microglia display a wide spectrum of morphologies outside of this dichotomy, including rod-like, ramified, ameboid, and hypertrophic states, which have been observed across brain regions, neurodevelopmental timepoints, and various pathological contexts. We applied dimensionality reduction and clustering to consider contributions of multiple morphology measures together to define a spectrum of microglial morphological states in a mouse dataset that we used to demonstrate the utility of our toolset. Using ImageJ, we first developed a semiautomated approach to characterize 27 morphology features from hundreds to thousands of individual microglial cells in a brain region-specific manner. Within this pool of features, we defined distinct sets of highly correlated features that describe different aspects of morphology, including branch length, branching complexity, territory span, and circularity. When considered together, these sets of features drove different morphological clusters. Our tools captured morphological states similarly and robustly when applied to independent datasets and using different immunofluorescent markers for microglia. We have compiled our morphology analysis pipeline into an accessible, easy-to-use, and fully open-source ImageJ macro and R package that the neuroscience community can expand upon and directly apply to their own analyses. Outcomes from this work will supply the field with new tools to systematically evaluate the heterogeneity of microglia morphological states across various experimental models and research questions.</p>

                <p>Brain activity implies the orchestrated functioning of interconnected brain regions. Typical in vitro models aim to mimic the brain using single human pluripotent stem cell-derived neuronal networks. However, the field is constantly evolving to model brain functions more accurately through the use of new paradigms, e.g., brain-on-a-chip models with compartmentalized structures and integrated sensors. These methods create novel data requiring more complex analysis approaches. The previously introduced circular tripartite network concept models the connectivity between spatially diverse neuronal structures. The model consists of a microfluidic device allowing axonal connectivity between separated neuronal networks with an embedded microelectrode array to record both local and global electrophysiological activity patterns in the closed circuitry. The existing tools are suboptimal for the analysis of the data produced with this model. Here, we introduce advanced tools for synchronization and functional connectivity assessment. We used our custom-designed analysis to assess the interrelations between the kainic acid (KA)-exposed proximal compartment and its nonexposed distal neighbors before and after KA. Novel multilevel circuitry bursting patterns were detected and analyzed in parallel with the inter- and intracompartmental functional connectivity. The effect of KA on the proximal compartment was captured, and the spread of this effect to the nonexposed distal compartments was revealed. KA induced divergent changes in bursting behaviors, which may be explained by distinct baseline activity and varied intra- and intercompartmental connectivity strengths. The circular tripartite network concept combined with our developed analysis advances importantly both face and construct validity in modeling human epilepsy in vitro.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/11/7/ENEURO.0112-24.2024?rss=1">Oscillatory Neural Correlates of Police Firearms Decision-Making in Virtual Reality</a></h4>

              
                <p>We investigated the neural signatures of expert decision-making in the context of police training in a virtual reality&ndash;based shoot/don&rsquo;t shoot scenario. Police officers can use stopping force against a perpetrator, which may require using a firearm and each decision made by an officer to discharge their firearm or not has substantial implications. Therefore, it is important to understand the cognitive and underlying neurophysiological processes that lead to such a decision. We used virtual reality&ndash;based simulations to elicit ecologically valid behavior from authorized firearms officers (AFOs) in the UK and matched novices in a shoot/don't shoot task and recorded electroencephalography concurrently. We found that AFOs had consistently faster response times than novices, suggesting our task was sensitive to their expertise. To investigate differences in decision-making processes under varying levels of threat and expertise, we analyzed electrophysiological signals originating from the anterior cingulate cortex. In line with similar response inhibition tasks, we found greater increases in preresponse theta power when participants inhibited the response to shoot when under no threat as compared with shooting. Most importantly, we showed that when preparing against threat, theta power increase was greater for experts than novices, suggesting that differences in performance between experts and novices are due to their greater orientation toward threat. Additionally, shorter beta rebounds suggest that experts were "ready for action" sooner. More generally, we demonstrate that the investigation of expert decision-making should incorporate naturalistic stimuli and an appropriate control group to enhance validity.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/11/7/ENEURO.0165-24.2024?rss=1">Assembling a Coculture System to Prepare Highly Pure Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell-Derived Neurons at Late Maturation Stages</a></h4>

              
                <p>Generation of human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived motor neurons (MNs) offers an unprecedented approach to modeling movement disorders such as dystonia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. However, achieving survival poses a significant challenge when culturing induced MNs, especially when aiming to reach late maturation stages. Utilizing hiPSC-derived motor neurons and primary mouse astrocytes, we assembled two types of coculture systems: direct coculturing of neurons with astrocytes and indirect coculture using culture inserts that physically separate neurons and astrocytes. Both systems significantly enhance neuron survival. Compared with these two systems, no significant differences in neurodevelopment, maturation, and survival within 3&nbsp;weeks, allowing to prepare neurons at maturation stages. Using the indirect coculture system, we obtained highly pure MNs at the late mature stage from hiPSCs. Transcriptomic studies of hiPSC-derived MNs showed a typical neurodevelopmental switch in gene expression from the early immature stage to late maturation stages. Mature genes associated with neurodevelopment and synaptogenesis are highly enriched in MNs at late stages, demonstrating that these neurons achieve maturation. This study introduces a novel tool for the preparation of highly pure hiPSC-derived neurons, enabling the determination of neurological disease pathogenesis in neurons at late disease onset stages through biochemical approaches, which typically necessitate highly pure neurons. This advancement is particularly significant in modeling age-related neurodegeneration.</p>

                Background Scientific publishing is a critical part of scientific enquiry; individual excellence is often measured by the number of publications, and the journals in which these publications appeared count enormously. Open Science practices, such as open access, open review, random gatekeeping and shared governance, are implemented in various journals and publishing platforms, providing alternative ways of publishing. But how are these practices trusted? Methods We have created a theoretical framework for trust in the context of academic publishing and investigated to what extent Dutch researchers find these ways of publishing trustworthy. We have performed a survey to compare the trustworthiness of novel and classical ways of publishing and conducted multiple interviews to figure out why scientists find certain publishing practices more attractive than others. Results In the academic publishing system, we have identified various interdependent relationships between stakeholders in which there is a certain level of uncertainty; therefore, we can assume that trust plays a relevant role here. Based on the literature review and interview results, trustworthiness turned out to be one of the most important factors in choosing journals to read relevant scientific discoveries and to publish papers. The survey results suggest that some aspects of open publishing, such as open access, open peer review and shared governance are well-known and widely accepted and trusted amongst the participants, while others, like participatory peer review or random gatekeeping, were less known. In these cases, many researchers formulated concerns about the competence of the randomly assigned gatekeeper and the reviewers coming from the wider community. Conclusions Our results highlight a shift in social norms within the Dutch scientific community, formulating critical voices towards the profit-oriented nature of classical scientific publishing and highlighting the importance of open access to scientific results, supporting open peer review and publishers with shared governance.

                Background Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a widespread malignancy globally, yet effective therapeutic approaches for advanced, metastatic, and chemo-resistant cases remain limited. In this study, we knocked out CRC cell line HCT 116 for two autophagy genes (ATG5 and ATG7), then we conducted a transcriptomic analysis on those isogenic cell lines. which revealed an upregulation of Krϋppel-like factor 3 (KLF3) expression, that was biologically validated. Methods In this study, we performed CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing on HCT 116 followed with transcriptomics analysis on HCT 116 KO cells for ATG5 and ATG7. Various bioinformatics analyses were performed to investigate the KLF3/8 with autophagy and affected functional pathways, and immune genes related to the different types. Validation of expression in different cell lines were done using qPCR and Western blot. Results To further investigate the role of autophagy genes in CRC, we utilized publicly available data and web-based tools. Our analysis showed a marked correlation between KLF3/KLF8 and the expression of autophagy genes in CRC, denoting that its upregulation is likely to be a compensatory mechanism. We also examined the co-expression of autophagy genes and KLF3/KLF8 with multiple markers of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and significant positive correlations were observed. Moreover, KLF8 expression was upregulated at the mRNA level in the metastatic cell lines LoVo and SK-CO-1, compared to HCT 116. Interestingly, KLF3/KLF8 expression was high in MSS molecular subtype of CRC as shown in HCT 116 cell line knocked in with MLH gene as well as they were negatively correlated with crucial immune-infiltrating cells such as CD8+ cells, indicating their potential as a negative biomarker for response to immunotherapy. Conclusion Our study proposes that a synergistic approach involving the inhibition of KLF8 and autophagy holds a potential therapeutic target for effectively tackling metastatic CRC cells, especially in cases characterized by deficient mismatch repair (MMR).

                Protein-glutamine gamma-glutamyltransferase 2 (TGM2) is a Ca2+ dependent enzyme that catalyzes transglutaminase cross-linking modifications. TGM2 is involved in various diseases, either in a protective or contributory manner, making it a crucial protein to study and determine its therapeutic potential. Identifying high-performing TGM2 antibodies would facilitate these investigations. Here we have characterized seventeen TGM2 commercial antibodies for western blot and sixteen for immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence. The implemented standardized experimental protocol is based on comparing read-outs in knockout cell lines against their isogenic parental controls. This study is part of a larger, collaborative initiative seeking to address antibody reproducibility issues by characterizing commercially available antibodies for human proteins and publishing the results openly as a resource for the scientific community. While the use of antibodies and protocols vary between laboratories, we encourage readers to use this report as a guide to select the most appropriate antibodies for their specific needs.

                Background Urban slums are hotspots of infectious diseases like COVID-19 as was seen in the waves of 2020 and 2021. One of the primary reasons why slums are disproportionately affected is their location in inaccessible and uninhabitable zones, crowded and poorly ventilated living spaces, unsanitary conditions and common facilities (water taps, common toilets, etc.). Staying at home during pandemics is hardly an option for slum dwellers as it often means giving up work and even basic necessities. Methodology This paper aims to understand the habitat vulnerabilities of slums in the two Indian megacities of Pune and Surat which were the worst hit during both waves. The study is done at the level of wards, which is the smallest administrative boundary, taking the habitat vulnerability (congestion and access to basic services). To identify the explanatory variables which increase the vulnerability of slums to infectious diseases, literature study is done on the triggering factors which affect habitat vulnerability derived from common characteristics and definitions of slum. Results The aim of the research is to categorize the slums into 3 levels of risk zones and map them subsequently. Conclusion This study will help in formulating a model to prioritize the allocation of sparse resources in developing countries to tackle the habitat vulnerabilities of the slum dwellers especially during health emergencies of contagious diseases like COVID-19.

                <p>by Andres J. Nevarez, Anusorn Mudla, Sabrina A. Diaz, Nan Hao</p>

Melanoma showcases a complex interplay of genetic alterations and intra- and inter-cellular morphological changes during metastatic transformation. While pivotal, the role of specific mutations in dictating these changes still needs to be fully elucidated. Telomerase promoter mutations (TERTp mutations) significantly influence melanoma’s progression, invasiveness, and resistance to various emerging treatments, including chemical inhibitors, telomerase inhibitors, targeted therapy, and immunotherapies. We aim to understand the morphological and phenotypic implications of the two dominant monoallelic TERTp mutations, C228T and C250T, enriched in melanoma metastasis. We developed isogenic clonal cell lines containing the TERTp mutations and utilized dual-color expression reporters steered by the endogenous Telomerase promoter, giving us allelic resolution. This approach allowed us to monitor morpholomic variations induced by these mutations. TERTp mutation-bearing cells exhibited significant morpholome differences from their wild-type counterparts, with increased allele expression patterns, augmented wound-healing rates, and unique spatiotemporal dynamics. Notably, the C250T mutation exerted more pronounced changes in the morpholome than C228T, suggesting a differential role in metastatic potential. Our findings underscore the distinct influence of TERTp mutations on melanoma’s cellular architecture and behavior. The C250T mutation may offer a unique morpholomic and systems-driven advantage for metastasis. These insights provide a foundational understanding of how a non-coding mutation in melanoma metastasis affects the system, manifesting in cellular morpholome.

                <p>by Riho Yamamoto, Hinata Miki, Ayaka Itani, Norio Takeshita</p>

The importance of fungi in ecological systems and pathogenicity hinges on their ability to search for nutrients, substrates, and hosts. Despite this, the question of whether fungal hyphae exhibit chemotropism toward them remains largely unresolved and requires close examination at the cellular level. Here, we designed a microfluidic device to assess hyphal chemotropism of <i>Aspergillus nidulans</i> in response to carbon and nitrogen sources, as well as pH. Within this device, hyphae could determine their growth direction in a two-layer flow with distinct compositions that were adjacent but non-mixing. Under conditions with and without a carbon source, hyphae changed growth direction to remain in the presence of a carbon source, but it was still difficult to distinguish between differences in growth and chemotropism. Although nitrogen sources such as ammonia and nitrate are important for growth, the hyphae indicated negative chemotropism to avoid them depending on the specific transporters. This fungus grows equally well at the colony level in the pH range of 4 to 9, but the hyphae exhibited chemotropism to acidic pH. The proton pump PmaA is vital for the chemotropism to acid pH, while the master regulatory for pH adaptation PacC is not involved, suggesting that chemotropism and adaptive growth via gene expression regulation are distinct regulatory mechanisms. Despite various plasma membrane transporters are distributed across membranes except at the hyphal tip, the control of growth direction occurs at the tip. Finally, we explored the mechanisms linking these two phenomena, tip growth and chemotropism.

<p>Carnosine prevents the sickness state and memory block induced by an immune challenge in the invertebrate model, <i>Lymnaea stagnalis</i>.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Carnosine is a naturally occurring endogenous dipeptide with well-recognized anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and neuroprotective effects at the central nervous system level. To date, very few studies have been focused on the ability of carnosine to rescue and/or enhance memory. Here, we used a well-known invertebrate model system, the pond snail <i>Lymnaea stagnalis</i>, and a well-studied associative learning procedure, operant conditioning of aerial respiration, to investigate the ability of carnosine to enhance long-term memory (LTM) formation and reverse memory obstruction caused by an immune challenge (i.e., lipopolysaccharide [LPS] injection). Exposing snails to 1 mM carnosine for 1 h before training in addition to enhancing memory formation resulted in a significant upregulation of the expression levels of key neuroplasticity genes (i.e., glutamate ionotropic receptor <i>N</i>-methyl-<span class="smallCaps">d</span>-aspartate [NMDA]-type subunit 1—LymGRIN1, and the transcription factor cAMP-response element-binding protein 1—LymCREB1) in snails' central ring ganglia. Moreover, pre-exposure to 1 mM carnosine before an LPS injection reversed the memory deficit brought about by inflammation, by preventing the upregulation of key targets for immune and stress response (i.e., Toll-like receptor 4—LymTLR4, molluscan defense molecule—LymMDM, heat shock protein 70—LymHSP70). Our data are thus consistent with the hypothesis that carnosine can have positive benefits on cognitive ability and be able to reverse memory aversive states induced by neuroinflammation.</p>

                Background Sustainable modular dwelling design for rural areas should focus on creating healthy and economically accessible spaces, sensitive to local needs and integrating environmental, functional, sociological and technological aspects. Flexibility is essential to reduce the initial investment and allow future transformations, optimizing the recovery and reuse of materials. These houses must be adaptable, safe and have basic services, satisfying the needs and stages of families’ development. In Ecuador, poverty and energy inefficiency worsen the quality of life in rural areas. This project in the Cebadas parish proposes modular dwelling that applies bioclimatic and sustainable criteria, using local materials to improve habitability and promote the social and economic development of the community. Method The research approach is qualitative-quantitative. Qualitative, since it is necessary to identify the qualities of the sector, bibliographic exploration of guidelines and sustainable strategies. Quantitative, to evaluate the degree of affectation through a diagnosis of the study site and to provide efficient solutions that respond to the context and social reality. Results The spaces presented in the proposal respond to the spatial need for growth and expansion of the users of the sector, through 6 basic guidelines that this type of dwelling should have: Environment, Visual, Form, Function, Bioclimatic and Materials. Conclusions The flexible modular dwelling project for rural environments addresses complex housing needs, highlighting the flexibility and adaptability of an expandable module. It includes income generation with a duplex apartment, fosters communal and cultural life with public and commercial spaces, promotes tourism and rural development with landscape design and crops. In addition, it ensures sustainability through bioclimatic strategies and responsible use of resources.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92406">Divergent folding-mediated epistasis among unstable membrane protein variants</a></h4>

              
                Many membrane proteins are prone to misfolding, which compromises their functional expression at the plasma membrane. This is particularly true for the mammalian gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor GPCRs (GnRHR). We recently demonstrated that evolutionary GnRHR modifications appear to have coincided with adaptive changes in cotranslational folding efficiency. Though protein stability is known to shape evolution, it is unclear how cotranslational folding constraints modulate the synergistic, epistatic interactions between mutations. We therefore compared the pairwise interactions formed by mutations that disrupt the membrane topology (V276T) or tertiary structure (W107A) of GnRHR. Using deep mutational scanning, we evaluated how the plasma membrane expression of these variants is modified by hundreds of secondary mutations. An analysis of 251 mutants in three genetic backgrounds reveals that V276T and W107A form distinct epistatic interactions that depend on both the severity and the mechanism of destabilization. V276T forms predominantly negative epistatic interactions with destabilizing mutations in soluble loops. In contrast, W107A forms positive interactions with mutations in both loops and transmembrane domains that reflect the diminishing impacts of the destabilizing mutations in variants that are already unstable. These findings reveal how epistasis is remodeled by conformational defects in membrane proteins and in unstable proteins more generally.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88591">MotorNet, a Python toolbox for controlling differentiable biomechanical effectors with artificial neural networks</a></h4>

              
                Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are a powerful class of computational models for unravelling neural mechanisms of brain function. However, for neural control of movement, they currently must be integrated with software simulating biomechanical effectors, leading to limiting impracticalities: (1) researchers must rely on two different platforms and (2) biomechanical effectors are not generally differentiable, constraining researchers to reinforcement learning algorithms despite the existence and potential biological relevance of faster training methods. To address these limitations, we developed MotorNet, an open-source Python toolbox for creating arbitrarily complex, differentiable, and biomechanically realistic effectors that can be trained on user-defined motor tasks using ANNs. MotorNet is designed to meet several goals: ease of installation, ease of use, a high-level user-friendly application programming interface, and a modular architecture to allow for flexibility in model building. MotorNet requires no dependencies outside Python, making it easy to get started with. For instance, it allows training ANNs on typically used motor control models such as a two joint, six muscle, planar arm within minutes on a typical desktop computer. MotorNet is built on PyTorch and therefore can implement any network architecture that is possible using the PyTorch framework. Consequently, it will immediately benefit from advances in artificial intelligence through PyTorch updates. Finally, it is open source, enabling users to create and share their own improvements, such as new effector and network architectures or custom task designs. MotorNet’s focus on higher-order model and task design will alleviate overhead cost to initiate computational projects for new researchers by providing a standalone, ready-to-go framework, and speed up efforts of established computational teams by enabling a focus on concepts and ideas over implementation.

                Fertilization occurs before the completion of oocyte meiosis in the majority of animal species and sperm contents move long distances within the zygotes of mouse and <i>C. elegans</i>. If incorporated into the meiotic spindle, paternal chromosomes could be expelled into a polar body resulting in lethal monosomy. Through live imaging of fertilization in <i>C. elegans</i>, we found that the microtubule disassembling enzymes, katanin and kinesin-13 limit long-range movement of sperm contents and that maternal ataxin-2 maintains paternal DNA and paternal mitochondria as a cohesive unit that moves together. Depletion of katanin or double depletion of kinesin-13 and ataxin-2 resulted in the capture of the sperm contents by the meiotic spindle. Thus limiting movement of sperm contents and maintaining cohesion of sperm contents within the zygote both contribute to preventing premature interaction between maternal and paternal genomes.

                Current methods to quantify the fraction of aminoacylated tRNAs, also known as the tRNA charge, are limited by issues with either low throughput, precision, and/or accuracy. Here, we present an optimized charge transfer RNA sequencing (tRNA-Seq) method that combines previous developments with newly described approaches to establish a protocol for precise and accurate tRNA charge measurements. We verify that this protocol provides robust quantification of tRNA aminoacylation and we provide an end-to-end method that scales to hundreds of samples including software for data processing. Additionally, we show that this method supports measurements of relative tRNA expression levels and can be used to infer tRNA modifications through reverse transcription misincorporations, thereby supporting multipurpose applications in tRNA biology.

                Behavioral responses to many odorants are not fixed but are flexible, varying based on organismal needs. How such variations arise and the role of various neuromodulators in achieving flexible neural-to-behavioral mapping is not fully understood. In this study, we examined how serotonin modulates the neural and behavioral responses to odorants in locusts (<i>Schistocerca americana</i>). Our results indicated that serotonin can increase or decrease appetitive behavior in an odor-specific manner. On the other hand, in the antennal lobe, serotonergic modulation enhanced odor-evoked response strength but left the temporal features or the combinatorial response profiles unperturbed. This result suggests that serotonin allows for sensitive and robust recognition of odorants. Nevertheless, the uniform neural response amplification appeared to be at odds with the observed stimulus-specific behavioral modulation. We show that a simple linear model with neural ensembles segregated based on behavioral relevance is sufficient to explain the serotonin-mediated flexible mapping between neural and behavioral responses.

">An intrinsic hierarchical, retinotopic organization of pulvinar connectivity in the human neonate</a></h4>

              
                Thalamic connectivity is crucial for the development of the neocortex. The pulvinar nuclei are thought to be particularly important for visual development due to their involvement in various functions that emerge early in infancy. The development of these connections constrains the role the pulvinar plays in infant visual processing and the maturation of associated cortical networks. However, the extent to which pulvino-cortical pathways found in adults are established at birth remains largely unknown, limiting our understanding of how these thalamic connections may support infant vision. To address this gap, we examined the organization of pulvino-cortical connections in human neonates using probabilistic tractography analyses on diffusion imaging data. Our findings revealed the presence of white matter pathways between the pulvinar and each individual visual area at birth. These pathways exhibited specificity in their connectivity within the pulvinar, reflecting both intraareal retinotopic organization and the hierarchical organization across ventral, lateral, and dorsal visual cortical pathways. These connections could enable detailed processing of information across sensory space and communication along distinct processing pathways. Comparative analyses revealed that the large-scale organization of pulvino-cortical connectivity in neonates mirrored that of adults. However, connectivity with ventral visual cortex was less adult-like than the other cortical pathways, aligning with prior findings of protracted development associated with the visual recognition pathway. These results deepen our understanding of the developmental trajectory of thalamocortical connections and provide a framework for how subcortical may support early perceptual abilities and scaffold the development of cortex.

">Unique longitudinal contributions of sulcal interruptions to reading acquisition in children</a></h4>

              
                A growing body of literature indicates strong associations between indentations of the cerebral cortex (i.e., sulci) and individual differences in cognitive performance. Interruptions, or gaps, of sulci (historically known as pli de passage) are particularly intriguing as previous work suggests that these interruptions have a causal effect on cognitive development. Here, we tested how the presence and morphology of sulcal interruptions in the left posterior occipitotemporal sulcus (pOTS) longitudinally impact the development of a culturally-acquired skill: reading. Forty-three children were successfully followed from age 5 in kindergarten, at the onset of literacy instruction, to ages 7 and 8 with assessments of cognitive, pre-literacy, and literacy skills, as well as MRI anatomical scans at ages 5 and 8. Crucially, we demonstrate that the presence of a left pOTS gap at 5 years is a specific and robust longitudinal predictor of better future reading skills in children, with large observed benefits on reading behavior ranging from letter knowledge to reading comprehension. The effect of left pOTS interruptions on reading acquisition accumulated through time, and was larger than the impact of benchmark cognitive and familial predictors of reading ability and disability. Finally, we show that increased local U-fiber white matter connectivity associated with such sulcal interruptions possibly underlie these behavioral benefits, by providing a computational advantage. To our knowledge, this is the first quantitative evidence supporting a potential integrative gray-white matter mechanism underlying the cognitive benefits of macro-anatomical differences in sulcal morphology related to longitudinal improvements in a culturally-acquired skill.

">Event boundaries drive norepinephrine release and distinctive neural representations of space in the rodent hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                Episodic memories are temporally segmented around event boundaries that tend to coincide with moments of environmental change. During these times, the state of the brain should change rapidly, or reset, to ensure that the information encountered before and after an event boundary is encoded in different neuronal populations. Norepinephrine (NE) is thought to facilitate this network reorganization. However, it is unknown whether event boundaries drive NE release in the hippocampus and, if so, how NE release relates to changes in hippocampal firing patterns. The advent of the new GRABNE sensor now allows for the measurement of NE binding with sub-second resolution. Using this tool in mice, we tested whether NE is released into the dorsal hippocampus during event boundaries defined by unexpected transitions between spatial contexts and presentations of novel objections. We found that NE binding dynamics were well explained by the time elapsed after each of these environmental changes, and were not related to conditioned behaviors, exploratory bouts of movement, or reward. Familiarity with a spatial context accelerated the rate in which phasic NE binding decayed to baseline. Knowing when NE is elevated, we tested how hippocampal coding of space differs during these moments. Immediately after context transitions we observed relatively unique patterns of neural spiking which settled into a modal state at a similar rate in which NE returned to baseline. These results are consistent with a model wherein NE release drives hippocampal representations away from a steady-state attractor. We hypothesize that the distinctive neural codes observed after each event boundary may facilitate long-term memory and contribute to the neural basis for the primacy effect.

">MRI signatures of cortical microstructure in human development align with oligodendrocyte cell-type expression</a></h4>

              
                Neuroanatomical changes to the cortex during adolescence have been well documented using MRI, revealing ongoing cortical thinning and volume loss with age. However, the underlying cellular mechanisms remain elusive with conventional neuroimaging. Recent advances in MRI hardware and new biophysical models of tissue informed by diffusion MRI data hold promise for identifying the cellular changes driving these morphological observations. This study used ultra-strong gradient MRI to obtain high-resolution, in vivo estimates of cortical neurite and soma microstructure in sample of typically developing children and adolescents. Cortical neurite signal fraction, attributed to neuronal and glial processes, increased with age (mean R2fneurite=.53, p<3.3e-11, 11.91% increase over age), while apparent soma radius decreased (mean R2Rsoma=.48, p<4.4e-10, 1% decrease over age) across domain-specific networks. To complement these findings, developmental patterns of cortical gene expression in two independent post-mortem databases were analysed. This revealed increased expression of genes expressed in oligodendrocytes, and excitatory neurons, alongside a relative decrease in expression of genes expressed in astrocyte, microglia and endothelial cell-types. Age-related genes were significantly enriched in cortical oligodendrocytes, oligodendrocyte progenitors and Layer 5-6 neurons (pFDR<.001) and prominently expressed in adolescence and young adulthood. The spatial and temporal alignment of oligodendrocyte cell-type gene expression with neurite and soma microstructural changes suggest that ongoing cortical myelination processes contribute to adolescent cortical development. These findings highlight the role of intra-cortical myelination in cortical maturation during adolescence and into adulthood.

">Hypersynchronous iPSC-derived SHANK2 neuronal networks are rescued by mGluR5 agonism</a></h4>

              
                Variants in the gene encoding the postsynaptic scaffolding protein SHANK2 are associated with several neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder. Here, we used in vitro multielectrode arrays and pharmacological manipulations to characterize how functional connectivity and network-level firing properties were altered in cultures of human iPSC-derived SHANK2 neurons. Using two isogenic pairs of SHANK2 cell lines, we showed that the SHANK2 hyperconnectivity phenotype was recapitulated at the network level. SHANK2 networks displayed significantly increased frequency and reduced duration of network burst events relative to controls. SHANK2 network activity was hypersynchronous, with increased functional correlation strength between recording channels. Analysis of intra-network burst firing dynamics revealed that spikes within SHANK2 network bursts were organized into high-frequency trains, producing a distinctive network burst shape. Calcium-dependent events called reverberating super bursts (RSBs) were observed in control networks but rarely occurred in SHANK2 networks. SHANK2 network hypersynchrony and numbers of strong correlations were fully rescued by the group 1 mGluR agonist DHPG, that also restored detection of RSBs and significantly improved network burst frequency and duration metrics. Our results demonstrate that SHANK2 variants produce a functional hyperconnectivity phenotype that deviates from the developmental trajectory of isogenic control networks. Furthermore, the hypersynchronous phenotype was rescued by pharmacologically regulating glutamatergic neurotransmission.

">MIND WANDERING DURING IMPLICIT LEARNING IS ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED PERIODIC EEG ACTIVITY AND IMPROVED EXTRACTION OF HIDDEN PROBABILISTIC PATTERNS</a></h4>

              
                Mind wandering, occupying 30-50% of our waking time, remains an enigmatic phenomenon in cognitive neuroscience. Predominantly viewed negatively, mind wandering is often associated with detrimental impacts on attention-demanding (model-based) tasks in both natural settings and laboratory conditions. Mind wandering however, might not be detrimental for all cognitive domains. We proposed that mind wandering may facilitate model-free processes, such as probabilistic learning, which relies on the automatic acquisition of statistical regularities with minimal attentional demands. We administered a well-established implicit probabilistic learning task combined with mind wandering thought probes in healthy adults (N = 37, 30 females). To explore the neural correlates of mind wandering and probabilistic learning, participants were fitted with high-density electroencephalography. Our findings indicate that probabilistic learning was not only immune to periods of mind wandering, but was positively associated with it. Spontaneous, as opposed to deliberate mind wandering, was particularly beneficial for extracting the probabilistic patterns hidden in the visual stream. Additionally, cortical oscillatory activity in the low-frequency (slow and delta) range, indicative of covert sleep-like states, was associated with both mind wandering and improved probabilistic learning, particularly in the early stages of the task. Given the importance of probabilistic implicit learning in predictive processing, our findings provide novel insights into the potential cognitive benefits of task-unrelated thoughts in addition to shedding light on its neural mechanisms. This surprising benefit challenges the predominant view of mind wandering as solely detrimental and highlights its complex role in human cognition, especially in memory consolidation.

">Interaural level difference sensitivity in neonatally deafened rats fitted with bilateral cochlear implants</a></h4>

              
                Bilateral cochlear implant (CI) patients exhibit significant limitations in spatial hearing. Their ability to process interaural time differences (ITDs) is often impaired, while their ability to process interaural level differences (ILDs) remains comparatively good. Clinical studies aiming to identify the causes of these limitations are often plagued by confounds and ethical limitations. Recent behavioral work suggests that rats may be a good animal model for studying binaural hearing under neuroprosthetic stimulation, as rats develop excellent ITD sensitivity when provided with suitable CI stimulation. However, their ability to use ILDs has not yet been characterized. Objective of this study is to address this knowledge gap. Neontally deafened rats were bilaterally fitted with CIs, and trained to lateralize binaural stimuli according to ILD. Their behavioral ILD thresholds were measured at pulse rates from 50 to 2400 pps. CI rats exhibited high sensitivity to ILDs with thresholds of a few dB at all tested pulse rates. We conclude that early deafened rats develop good sensitivity, not only to ITDs but also to ILDs, if provided with appropriate CI stimulation. Their generally good performance, in line with expectations from other mammalian species, validates rats as an excellent model for research on binaural auditory prostheses.

">Healthy aging delays and dedifferentiates high-level visual representations</a></h4>

              
                Healthy aging impacts visual information processing with consequences for subsequent high-level cognition and everyday behavior, but the underlying neural changes in visual representations remain unknown. Here, we investigate the nature of representations underlying object recognition in older compared to younger adults by tracking them in time using EEG, across space using fMRI, and by probing their behavioral relevance using similarity judgements. Applying a multivariate analysis framework to combine experimental assessments, four key findings about how brain aging impacts object recognition emerge. First, aging selectively delays the formation of object representations, profoundly changing the chronometry of visual processing. Second, the delay in the formation of object representations emerges in high-level rather than low- and mid-level ventral visual cortex, supporting the theory that brain areas developing last deteriorate first. Third, aging reduces content selectivity in high-level ventral visual cortex, indicating age-related neural dedifferentiation as the mechanism of representational change. Finally, we demonstrate that the identified representations of the aging brain are behaviorally relevant, ascertaining ecological relevance. Together, our results reveal the impact of healthy aging on the visual brain.

">The representational nature of spatio-temporal recurrent processing in visual object recognition</a></h4>

              
                The human brain orchestrates object vision through an interplay of feedforward processing in concert with recurrent processing. However, where, when and how recurrent processing contributes to visual processing is incompletely understood due to the difficulties in teasing apart feedforward and recurrent processing. We combined a backward masking paradigm with multivariate analysis on EEG and fMRI data to isolate and characterize the nature of recurrent processing. We find that recurrent processing substantially shapes visual representations across the ventral visual stream, starting early on at around 100ms in early visual cortex (EVC) and in two later phases of around 175 and 300ms in lateral occipital cortex (LOC), adding persistent rather than transient neural dynamics to visual processing. Using deep neural network models for comparison with the brain, we show that recurrence changes the feature format in LOC from predominantly mid-level to more high-level features. Finally, we show that recurrence is mediated by four distinct spectro-temporal neural components in EVC and LOC, which span the theta to beta frequency range. Together, our results reveal the nature and mechanisms of the effects of recurrent processing on the visual representations in the human brain.

">Understanding the development of neural abnormalities in adolescents with mental health problems: a longitudinal study</a></h4>

              
                Many mental health problems are neurodevelopmental in nature and have an onset during childhood. Mental health disorders are associated with neural abnormalities, but it is unclear when those emerge and how this relates to the development of different mental health problems. We used data from the largest longitudinal neurodevelopmental study to identify the structural and functional brain changes that co-occur with the onset of six mental health problems. The results showed premorbid brain-wide abnormalities that were comparable between internalizing and different from externalizing problems, and differential neurodevelopmental trajectories for specific brain regions in 11- to 12-year-old adolescents who developed ADHD, conduct, depressive and oppositional defiant problems. These results reveal that the onset of different mental health problems co-occur with common as well as problem-specific brain abnormalities.

">Extracellular matrix integrity regulates GABAergic plasticity in the hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                The brain's extracellular matrix (ECM) is crucial for neural circuit functionality, synaptic plasticity, and learning. While the role of the ECM in excitatory synapses has been extensively studied, its influence on inhibitory synapses, particularly on GABAergic long-term plasticity, remains poorly understood. This study aims to elucidate the effects of ECM components on inhibitory synaptic transmission and plasticity in the hippocampal CA1 region. We focus on the roles of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) and hyaluronic acid in modulating inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) at two distinct inhibitory synapses formed by somatostatin (SST)-positive and parvalbumin (PV)-positive interneurons onto pyramidal cells (PCs). Using optogenetic stimulation in brain slices, we observed that acute degradation of ECM constituents by hyaluronidase or chondroitinase-ABC did not affect basal inhibitory synaptic transmission. However, short-term plasticity, particularly burst-induced depression, was enhanced at PV[-&gt;]PC synapses following enzymatic treatments. Long-term plasticity experiments demonstrated that CSPGs are essential for NMDA-induced iLTP at SST[-&gt;]PC synapses, whereas the digestion of hyaluronic acid by hyaluronidase impaired iLTP at PV[-&gt;]PC synapses. This indicates a synapse-specific role of CSPGs and hyaluronic acid in regulating GABAergic plasticity. Additionally, we report the presence of cryptic GABAergic plasticity at PV[-&gt;]PC synapses induced by prolonged NMDA application, which became evident after CSPG digestion and was absent under control conditions. Our results underscore the differential impact of ECM degradation on inhibitory synaptic plasticity, highlighting the synapse-specific interplay between ECM components and specific GABAergic synapses. This offers new perspectives in studies on learning and critical period timing.

                Noradrenergic afferents to hypothalamic corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) neurons provide a major excitatory drive for somatic stress activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. We showed that glucocorticoids rapidly desensitize CRH neurons to norepinephrine and suppress inflammation-induced HPA activation via a glucocorticoid receptor- and endocytosis-dependent mechanism. Here, we show that 1 adrenoreceptor (AR1) trafficking is regulated by convergent glucocorticoid and nitric oxide synthase signaling mechanisms. Live-cell imaging of AR1b-eGFP-expressing hypothalamic cells revealed rapid corticosterone-stimulated redistribution of internalized AR1 from rapid recycling endosomes to late endosomes and lysosomes via a nitrosylation-regulated mechanism. Proximity assay demonstrated interaction of glucocorticoid receptors with AR1b and {beta}-arrestin, and showed corticosterone blockade of norepinephrine-stimulated AR1b/{beta}-arrestin interaction, which may prevent AR1b from entering the rapid recycling endosomal pathway. These findings demonstrate a rapid glucocorticoid regulation of G protein-coupled receptor trafficking and provide a molecular mechanism for rapid glucocorticoid desensitization of noradrenergic signaling in CRH neurons.

">Gustatory Thalamic Neurons Mediate Aversive Behaviors</a></h4>

              
                The parvicellular part of the ventral posteromedial nucleus (VPMpc) of the thalamus, also known as the gustatory thalamus, receives input from the parabrachial nucleus and relays taste sensation to the gustatory (or insular) cortex. Prior research has focussed on the role of the VPMpc in relaying taste signals. Here we provide evidence showing that VPMpc also mediates aversive behaviors. By recording calcium transients in vivo from single neurons in mice, we show that neurons expressing cholecystokinin and the mu-opioid receptor in the VPMpc respond to various noxious stimuli and fear memory. Chemogenetic and optogenetic activation of these neurons enhances the response to aversive stimuli, whereas silencing them attenuates aversive behaviors. The VPMpc neurons directly innervate neurons in the insular cortex and rostral lateral amygdala. This study expands the role of the VPMpc to include mediating aversive and threating signals to the insular cortex and lateral amygdala.

">Model of a striatal circuit exploring biological mechanisms underlying decision-making during normal and disordered states</a></h4>

              
                Decision-making requires continuous adaptation to internal and external contexts. Changes in decision-making are reliable transdiagnostic symptoms of neuropsychiatric disorders. We created a computational model demonstrating how the striosome compartment of the striatum constructs a mathematical space for decision-making computations depending on context, and how the matrix compartment defines action value depending on the space. The model explains multiple experimental results and unifies other theories like reward prediction error, roles of the direct versus indirect pathways, and roles of the striosome versus matrix, under one framework. We also found, through new analyses, that striosome and matrix neurons increase their synchrony during difficult tasks, caused by a necessary increase in dimensionality of the space. The model makes testable predictions about individual differences in disorder susceptibility, decision-making symptoms shared among neuropsychiatric disorders, and differences in neuropsychiatric disorder symptom presentation. The model reframes the role of the striosomal circuit in neuroeconomic and disorder-affected decision-making.

">Low-side and multitone suppression in the base of the gerbil cochlea</a></h4>

              
                The cochlea's mechanical response to sound stimulation is nonlinear, likely due to saturation of the mechano-electric transduction current that is part of an electromechanical feedback loop. The ability of a second tone or tones to reduce the response to a probe tone is one manifestation of nonlinearity, termed suppression. Using optical coherence tomography to measure motion within the organ of Corti, regional motion variations have been observed. Here, we report on the suppression that occurs within the organ of Corti when a high sound level, low frequency suppressor tone was delivered along with a sweep of discreet single-tones. Responses were measured in the base of the gerbil cochlea at two characteristic frequency locations, with two different directions of observation relative to the sensory tissue's anatomical axes. Suppression extended over a wide frequency range in the outer hair cell region, whereas it was typically limited to the characteristic frequency peak in the reticular lamina region and at the basilar membrane. Aspects of the observed suppression were consistent with the effect of a saturating nonlinearity. Recent measurements have noted the three-dimensional nature of organ of Corti motion. The effects of suppression observed here could be due to a combination of reduced motion amplitude and altered vibration axis.

">Templating of Monomeric Alpha-Synuclein Induces Inflammation and SNpc Dopamine Neuron Death in a Genetic Mouse Model of Synucleinopathy.</a></h4>

              
                While the etiology of most cases of Parkinson's disease (PD) are idiopathic, is has been estimated that 5-10 percent of PD arise from known genetic mutations. The first mutations described that leads to the development of an autosomal dominant form of PD are in the SNCA gene that codes for the protein alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn). alpha-syn is an abundant presynaptic protein that is natively disordered and whose function is still unclear. In PD, alpha-syn misfolds into multimeric beta-pleated sheets that aggregate in neurons (Lewy Bodies/neurites) and spread throughout the neuraxis in a pattern that aligns with disease progression. Here, using IHC, HPLC, and cytokine analysis, we examined the sequelae of intraparenchymal brain seeding of oligomeric pre-formed fibrils (PFFs) and monomeric a-syn in C57BL/6J (WT) and A53T SNCA mutant mice. We found that injection of PFFs, but not monomeric alpha-syn, into the striatum of C57BL/6J mice induced spread of aggregate alpha-syn, loss of SNpc DA neurons and increased neuroinflammation. However, in A53T SNCA mice, we found that both PFFs and monomeric alpha-syn induced this pathology. This suggests that the conformation changes in alpha-syn seen in the A53T strain can recruit wild-type alpha-syn to a pathological misfolded conformation which may provide a mechanism for the induction of PD in humans with SNCA duplication/triplication.

">Effects of two different compounds on seizure suppression using the zebrafish PTZ-seizure model</a></h4>

              
                Epilepsies are a common and severe neurological condition characterized by spontaneous and recurrent seizures. Although anti-seizure medications are effective for most patients, about 30% remain pharmacoresistant. Moreover, uncontrolled seizures are associated with risk factors and shortened life expectancy for individuals with refractory epilepsy. Preclinical studies are an essential step for drug discovery and the zebrafish (Danio rerio) has been successfully employed for this purpose. In this study, we applied the zebrafish PTZ-seizure model to investigate the effect of two compounds on seizure suppression, Tripeptide (p-BTX-I) and the Cx43 peptide CX2. Zebrafish larvae at 6 days post-fertilization (dpf) were exposed to both compounds, according to their group, 24h prior to PTZ-seizure induction. We quantified the compounds effect on seizure latency, number of seizures and transcript levels of genes related to inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis (il1b, tnfa, cox1, cox2a, il6, casp3a, casp9, baxa, bcl2a, nox1, sod1 and cat). Our results showed that CX2 at a concentration of 0.1 {micro}M/mL yielded the best outcome for seizure suppression as it reduced the number of seizures and increased the seizure latency. Additionally, CX2 treatment before PTZ-induced seizures decreased the transcript of il1b, il6, tnfa and cox1 genes, all related to inflammation. A bio-distribution study showed that the CX2 reached the zebrafish brain at both times investigated, 1h and 6h. Similarly, the tripeptide exhibited anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic action, reducing mRNA expression of the il1b and casp9 genes. Our findings suggest that both Tripeptide and CX2 hold translational potential for seizure suppression.

                Exposure to early life adversity (ELA) poses a significant global public health concern, with profound pathophysiological implications for affected individuals. Studies suggest that ELA contributes to endothelial dysfunction, bringing into question the functional integrity of the neurovascular unit in brain regions vulnerable to chronic stress. Despite the importance of the neurovasculature in maintaining normal brain physiology, human neurovascular cells remain poorly characterized, particularly with regard to their contributory role in ELA-associated pathophysiologies. In this study, we present the first comprehensive transcriptomic analysis of intact microvessels isolated from postmortem ventromedial prefrontal cortex samples from adult healthy controls (CTRL) and matched depressed suicides with histories of ELA. Our findings point to substantive differences between men and women, with the latter exhibiting widespread gene expression changes at the neurovascular unit, including the key vascular nodal regulators KLF2 and KLF4, alongside a broad downregulation of immune-related pathways. These results suggest that the neurovascular unit plays a larger role in the neurobiological consequences of ELA in human females.

">Shifts in neural tuning systematically alter sensorimotor learning ability</a></h4>

              
                Sensorimotor learning can change the tuning of neurons in motor-related brain areas and rotate their preferred directions (PDs). These PD rotations are commonly interpreted as reflecting motor command changes; however, cortical neurons that display PD rotations also contribute to sensorimotor learning. Sensorimotor learning should, therefore, alter not only motor commands but also the tuning of neurons responsible for this learning, and thus impact subsequent learning ability. Here, we investigate this possibility with computational modeling and by directly measuring adaptive responses during sensorimotor learning in humans. Modeling shows that the PD rotations induced by sensorimotor learning, predict specific anisotropic changes in PD distributions that in turn predict a specific spatial pattern of changes in learning ability. Remarkably, experiments in humans then reveal large, systematic changes in learning ability in a spatial pattern that precisely reflects these model-predicted changes. We find that this pattern defies conventional wisdom and implements Newton's method, a learning rule where the step size is inversely proportional rather than proportional to the learning gradient's amplitude, limiting overshooting in the adaptive response. Our findings indicate that PD rotation provides a mechanism whereby the motor system can simultaneously learn how to move and learn how to learn.

">Age-related myelin deficits in the auditory brain stem contribute to cocktail party-deficits</a></h4>

              
                Age-related hearing loss is a global health problem of increasing importance. While the role of peripheral hearing loss is well understood and treatments are available, central hearing loss, the ability of the brain to make sense of sound, is much less well understood and no treatments are available. We report on age-related alterations in the auditory brain stem which compromise a listener's ability to isolate a sound from competing background noises, for example in a crowded restaurant. Sound localization depends on extreme temporal precision on the order of microseconds, and the sound localization pathway shows several specializations towards temporal precision. The pathway from the cochlear nucleus to the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB) is heavily myelinated and terminates in the calyx of Held. Using auditory brain stem response measurements (ABRs), we found that the physiological properties of MNTB changes with age. The mechanism is that in older animals, MNTB afferents demyelinate to various degrees, resulting in larger variability in the timing of responses. Myelin is produced by oligodendrocytes, and we found that fewer mature, but more precursor and immature oligodendrocytes are present in MNTB of aged animals, suggesting that the demyelination is an age-related deficit in oligodendrocyte maturation.

">Ototoxicity-related Changes in GABA Immunolabeling Within the Rat Inferior Colliculus</a></h4>

              
                Several studies suggest that hearing loss results in changes in the balance between inhibition and excitation in the inferior colliculus (IC). The IC is an integral nucleus within the auditory brainstem. The majority of ascending pathways from the lateral lemniscus (LL), superior olivary complex (SOC), and cochlear nucleus (CN) synapse in the IC before projecting to the thalamus and cortex. Many of these ascending projections provide inhibitory innervation to neurons within the IC. However, the nature and the distribution of this inhibitory input have only been partially elucidated in the rat. The inhibitory neurotransmitter, gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA), from the ventral nucleus of the lateral lemniscus (VNLL), provides the primary inhibitory input to the IC of the rat with GABA from other lemniscal and SOC nuclei providing lesser, but prominent innervation. There is evidence that hearing related conditions can result in dysfunction of IC neurons. These changes may be mediated in part by changes in GABA inputs to IC neurons. We have previously used gene micro-arrays in a study of deafness-related changes in gene expression in the IC and found significant changes in GAD as well as the GABA transporters and GABA receptors (Holt 2005). This is consistent with reports of age and trauma related changes in GABA (Bledsoe et al, 1995; Mossop et al, 2000; Salvi et al, 2000). Ototoxic lesions of the cochlea produced a permanent threshold shift. The number, intensity, and density of GABA positive axon terminals in the IC were compared in normal hearing and deafened rats. While the number of GABA immunolabeled puncta was only minimally different between groups, the intensity of labeling was significantly reduced. The ultrastructural localization and distribution of labeling was also examined. In deafened animals, the number of immuno gold particles was reduced by 78% in axodendritic and 82% in axosomatic GABAergic puncta. The affected puncta were primarily associated with small IC neurons. These results suggest that reduced inhibition to IC neurons contribute to the increased neuronal excitability observed in the IC following noise or drug induced hearing loss. Whether these deafness-diminished inhibitory inputs originate from intrinsic or extrinsic CNIC sources awaits further study.

                Visualizing the subcellular localization of presynaptic proteins with fluorescent proteins is a powerful tool to dissect the genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying synapse formation and patterning in live animals. Here, we utilize split green and red fluorescent proteins to visualize the localization of endogenously expressed presynaptic proteins at a single neuron resolution in Caenorhabditis elegans. By using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing, we generated a collection of C. elegans strains in which endogenously expressed presynaptic proteins (RAB-3/Rab3, CLA-1/Piccolo, SYD-2/Liprin-, UNC-10/RIM and ELKS-1/ELKS) are tagged with tandem repeats of GFP11 and/or wrmScarlet11. We show that the expression of wrmScarlet1-10 and GFP1-10 under neuron-specific promoters can robustly label presynaptic proteins in different neuron types. We believe that combinations of knock-in strains and wrmScarlet1-10 and GFP1-10 plasmids are a versatile modular system to examine the localization of endogenous presynaptic proteins in any neuron type.

">Pharyngeal neuronal mechanisms governing sour taste perception in Drosophila melanogaster</a></h4>

              
                Sour taste, which is elicited by low pH, may serve to help animals distinguish appetitive from potentially harmful food sources. In all species studied to date, the attractiveness of oral acids is contingent on concentration. Many carboxylic acids are attractive at ecologically relevant concentrations but become aversive beyond some maximal concentration. Recent work found that Drosophila ionotropic receptors IR25a and IR76b expressed by sweet-responsive gustatory receptor neurons (GRNs) in the labellum, a peripheral gustatory organ, mediate appetitive feeding behaviors toward dilute carboxylic acids. Here, we disclose the existence of pharyngeal sensors in D. melanogaster that detect ingested carboxylic acids and are also involved in the appetitive responses to carboxylic acids. These pharyngeal sensors rely on IR51b, IR94a, and IR94h, together with IR25a and IR76b, to drive responses to carboxylic acids. We then demonstrate that optogenetic activation of either Ir94a+ or Ir94h+ GRNs promotes an appetitive feeding response, confirming their contributions to appetitive feeding behavior. Our discovery of internal pharyngeal sour taste receptors opens up new avenues for investigating the internal sensation of tastants in insects.

">Contrast gain control is a reparameterization of a population response curve</a></h4>

              
                Neurons in primary visual cortex (area V1) adapt in different degrees to the average contrast of the environment, suggesting that the representation of visual stimuli may interact with the state of cortical gain control in complex ways. To investigate this possibility, we measured and analyzed the responses of neural populations to visual stimuli as a function of contrast in different environments, each characterized by a unique distribution of contrast. Our findings reveal that, for a given stimulus, the population response can be described by a vector function r(g_e c), where the gain g_e is a decreasing function of the mean contrast of the environment. Thus, gain control can be viewed as a reparameterization of a population response curve, which is invariant across environments. Different stimuli are mapped to distinct curves, all originating from a common origin, corresponding to a zero-contrast response. Altogether, our findings provide a straightforward, geometric interpretation of contrast gain control at the population level and show that changes in gain are well coordinated among members of a neural population.

">Understanding human amygdala function with artificial neural networks</a></h4>

              
                The amygdala is a cluster of subcortical nuclei that receives diverse sensory inputs and projects to the cortex, midbrain and other subcortical structures. Numerous accounts of amygdalar contributions to social and emotional behavior have been offered, yet an overarching description of amygdala function remains elusive. Here we adopt a computationally explicit framework that aims to develop a model of amygdala function based on the types of sensory inputs it receives, rather than individual constructs such as threat, arousal, or valence. Characterizing human fMRI signal acquired as participants viewed a full-length film, we developed encoding models that predict both patterns of amygdala activity and self-reported valence evoked by naturalistic images. We use deep image synthesis to generate artificial stimuli that distinctly engage encoding models of amygdala subregions that systematically differ from one another in terms of their low-level visual properties. These findings characterize how the amygdala compresses high-dimensional sensory inputs into low-dimensional representations relevant for behavior.

">Effects of ketamine on GABAergic and glutamatergic activity in the mPFC: biphasic recruitment of GABA function in antidepressant-like responses</a></h4>

              
                Major depressive disorder (MDD) is associated with disruptions in glutamatergic and GABAergic activity in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), leading to altered synaptic formation and function. Low doses of ketamine rapidly rescue these deficits, inducing fast and sustained antidepressant effects. While it is suggested that ketamine produces a rapid glutamatergic enhancement in the mPFC, the temporal dynamics and the involvement of GABA interneurons in its sustained effects remain unclear. Using simultaneous photometry recordings of calcium activity in mPFC pyramidal and GABA neurons, as well as chemogenetic approaches in Gad1-Cre mice, we explored the hypothesis that initial effects of ketamine on glutamate signaling trigger subsequent enhancement of GABAergic responses, contributing to its sustained antidepressant responses. Calcium recordings revealed a biphasic effect of ketamine on activity of mPFC GABA neurons, characterized by an initial transient decrease (phase 1, <30 min) followed by an increase (phase 2, >60 min), in parallel with a transient increase in excitation/inhibition levels (10 min) and lasting enhancement of glutamatergic activity (30-120 min). Previous administration of ketamine enhanced GABA neuron activity during the sucrose splash test (SUST) and novelty suppressed feeding test (NSFT), 24 h and 72 h post-treatment, respectively. Chemogenetic inhibition of GABA interneurons during the surge of GABAergic activity (phase 2), or immediately before the SUST or NSFT, occluded ketamine's behavioral actions. These results indicate that time-dependent modulation of GABAergic activity is required for the sustained antidepressant-like responses induced by ketamine, suggesting that approaches to enhance GABAergic plasticity and function are promising therapeutic targets for antidepressant development.

">Three Dimensional Multiscalar Neurovascular Nephron Connectivity Map of the Human Kidney Across the Lifespan</a></h4>

              
                The human kidney is a vital organ with a remarkable ability to coordinate the activity of up to a million nephrons, its main functional tissue unit (FTU), and maintain homeostasis. We developed tissue processing and analytical methods to construct a 3D map of neurovascular nephron connectivity of the human kidney and glean insights into how this structural organization enables coordination of various functions of the nephron, such as glomerular filtration, solute and water absorption, secretion by the tubules, and regulation of blood flow and pressure by the juxtaglomerular apparatus, in addition to how these functions change across disease and lifespans. Using light sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) and morphometric analysis we discovered changes in anatomical orientation of the vascular pole, glomerular density, volume, and innervation through postnatal development and ageing. The extensive nerve network exists from cortex FTUs to medullary loop of Henle, providing connectivity within segments of the same nephron, and between separate nephrons. The nerves organize glomeruli into discreet communities (in the same network of nerves). Adjacent glomerular communities are connected to intercommunal, mother glomeruli, by nerves, a pattern repeating throughout the cortex. These neuro-nephron networks are not developed in postnatal kidneys and are disrupted in diseased kidneys (diabetic or hydronephrosis). This structural organization likely poises the entire glomerular and juxtaglomerular FTUs to synchronize responses to perturbations in fluid homeostasis, utilizing mother glomeruli as network control centers.

">Learning and modality independent time cells tile stimulus and post-stimulus period.</a></h4>

              
                Hippocampal cells represent multiple dimensions of stimulus and behavioural context. Time-cells encode the dimension of time between events, but it is unclear if their properties depend on the behavioural paradigm. We find that in the sub-second time-scales of trace eyeblink conditioning (TEC), time cells occur both in stimulus and post-stimulus periods, and are insensitive both to modality and to state of learning. This contrasts with time-cell stimulus-dependence in delay non-match to sample (DNMS) tasks (~10 seconds). We observe 87% turnover of time-cells on successive days, but those time-cells which persist retain selectivity to stimulus and post-stimulus periods respectively. Finally, we show that 60% of time-encoding cells are active after the stimulus period, potentially providing an event trace for the network to link to later stimuli. Overall, TEC time-cells have distinct properties during turnover and are independent from behavioural state and contingency compared to DNMS.

">Molecular architecture of the altered cortical complexity in autism</a></h4>

              
                Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is characterized by difficulties in social interaction, communication challenges, and repetitive behaviors. Despite extensive research, the molecular mechanisms underlying these neurodevelopmental abnormalities remain elusive. We integrated microscale brain gene expression data with macroscale MRI data from 1829 participants, including individuals with ASD and healthy controls, from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) I and II. Using fractal dimension (FD) as an index for quantifying cortical complexity, we identified significant regional alterations in ASD, within the left temporoparietal, left peripheral visual, right central visual, left somatomotor (including the insula), and left ventral attention networks. Partial least squares (PLS) regression analysis revealed gene sets associated with these cortical complexity changes, enriched for biological functions related to synaptic transmission, synaptic plasticity, mitochondrial dysfunction, and chromatin organization. Cell-specific analyses, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis and gene temporal expression profiling further elucidated the dynamic molecular landscape associated with these alterations. These findings indicate that ASD-related alterations in cortical complexity are closely linked to specific genetic pathways. The combined analysis of neuroimaging and transcriptomic data enhances our understanding of how genetic factors contribute to brain structural changes in ASD.

">White matter connections of human ventral temporal cortex are organized by cytoarchitecture, eccentricity, and category-selectivity from birth</a></h4>

              
                Category-selective regions in ventral temporal cortex (VTC) have a consistent anatomical organization, which is hypothesized to be scaffolded by white matter connections. However, it is unknown how white matter connections are organized from birth. Here, we scanned newborn to 6-month-old infants and adults and used a data-driven approach to determine the organization of the white matter connections of VTC. We find that white matter connections are organized by cytoarchitecture, eccentricity, and category from birth. Connectivity profiles of functional regions in the same cytoarchitectonic area are similar from birth and develop in parallel, with decreases in endpoint connectivity to lateral occipital, and parietal, and somatosensory cortex, and increases to lateral prefrontal cortex. Additionally, connections between VTC and early visual cortex are organized topographically by eccentricity bands and predict eccentricity biases in VTC. These data have important implications for theories of cortical functional development and open new possibilities for understanding typical and atypical white matter development.

	<p>Objective: In this study, we investigated the effects of noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS) and exercise on cognition in patients with multiple sclerosis (pwMS). Methods: A literature search was performed using the Cochrane Library, Scopus, PubMed and Web of Science. The time interval used for database construction was up to February 2024; the collected trials were subsequently screened, and the data were extracted. Results: We identified 12 studies with 208 pwMS treated with noninvasive brain stimulation. Seven of the twelve studies concluded that NIBS was effective in improving reaction time, attention and processing speed. Additionally, 26 articles investigated the effect of various types of exercise on cognition among 708 pwMS. Twelve studies used aerobic exercise only, three studies used resistance only, one used yoga, and ten studies used mixed forms of exercise, such as Pilates, resistance and Frenkel coordination. Aerobic exercise was effective in improving at least one cognitive domain in ten studies. Resistance exercise was found to improve cognition in three studies. Yoga failed to show any improvement in one study. Conclusions: NIBS might be an effective intervention for cognition improvement among pwMS. Aerobic exercise and combined forms of exercise are the most frequently investigated and applied and found to be effective. Further studies are needed, especially for resistance, balance and stretching exercises.</p>

	<p>The ability to screen for agents that can promote the development and/or maintenance of neuronal networks creates opportunities for the discovery of novel agents for the treatment of central nervous system (CNS) disorders. Over the past 10 years, advances in robotics, artificial intelligence, and machine learning have paved the way for the improved implementation of live-cell imaging systems for drug discovery. These instruments have revolutionized our ability to quickly and accurately acquire large standardized datasets when studying complex cellular phenomena in real-time. This is particularly useful in the field of neuroscience because real-time analysis can allow efficient monitoring of the development, maturation, and conservation of neuronal networks by measuring neurite length. Unfortunately, due to the relative infancy of this type of analysis, standard practices for data acquisition and processing are lacking, and there is no standardized format for reporting the vast quantities of data generated by live-cell imaging systems. This paper reviews the current state of live-cell imaging instruments, with a focus on the most commonly used equipment (IncuCyte systems). We provide an in-depth analysis of the experimental conditions reported in publications utilizing these systems, particularly with regard to studying neurite outgrowth. This analysis sheds light on trends and patterns that will enhance the use of live-cell imaging instruments in CNS drug discovery.</p>

	<p>Substance use disorders (SUDs) are complex biopsychosocial diseases that cause neurocognitive deficits and neurological impairments by altering the gene expression in reward-related brain areas. Repeated drug use gives rise to alterations in DNA methylation, histone modifications, and the expression of microRNAs in several brain areas that may be associated with the development of psychotic symptoms. The first section of this review discusses how substance use contributes to the development of psychotic symptoms via epigenetic alterations. Then, we present more evidence about the link between SUDs and brain epigenetic alterations. The next section presents associations between paternal and maternal exposure to substances and epigenetic alterations in the brains of offspring and the role of maternal diet in preventing substance-induced neurological impairments. Then, we introduce potential therapeutic agents/approaches such as methyl-rich diets to modify epigenetic alterations for alleviating psychotic symptoms or depression in SUDs. Next, we discuss how substance use&amp;amp;ndash;gut microbiome interactions contribute to the development of neurological impairments through epigenetic alterations and how gut microbiome-derived metabolites may become new therapeutics for normalizing epigenetic aberrations. Finally, we address possible challenges and future perspectives for alleviating psychotic symptoms and depression in patients with SUDs by modulating diets, the epigenome, and gut microbiome.</p>

	<p>Long-duration bedrest impairs upright postural and locomotor control, prompting the need for assessment tools to predict the effects of deconditioning on post-bedrest outcome measures. We developed a tilt board mounted vertically with a horizontal air-bearing sled as a potential supine assessment tool for a future bedrest study. The purpose of this pilot study was to examine the association between supine proprioceptive assessments on the tilt board and upright functional mobility. Seventeen healthy participants completed variations of a supine tilt board task and an upright functional mobility task (FMT), which is an established obstacle avoidance course. During the supine tasks, participants lay on the air-bearing sled with axial loading toward the tilt board. Participants tilted the board to capture virtual targets on an overhead monitor during 30 s trials. The tasks included two dynamic tasks (i.e., double-leg stance matching mediolateral tilt targets over &amp;amp;plusmn;3&amp;amp;deg; or &amp;amp;plusmn;9&amp;amp;deg; ranges) and two static tasks (i.e., single-leg stance maintaining a central target position). The performances during the dynamic tasks were significantly correlated with the FMT time to completion. The dominant-leg static task performance showed a moderate trend with the FMT time to completion. The results indicate that supine proprioceptive assessments may be associated with upright ambulation performance, and thus, support the proposed application in bedrest studies.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/11/7/ENEURO.0019-24.2024?rss=1">Pharmacological Elevation of Catecholamine Levels Improves Perceptual Decisions, But Not Metacognitive Insight</a></h4>

              
                <p>Perceptual decisions are often accompanied by a feeling of decision confidence. Where the parietal cortex is known for its crucial role in shaping such perceptual decisions, metacognitive evaluations are thought to additionally rely on the (pre)frontal cortex. Because of this supposed neural differentiation between these processes, perceptual and metacognitive decisions may be divergently affected by changes in internal (e.g., attention, arousal) and external (e.g., task and environmental demands) factors. Although intriguing, causal evidence for this hypothesis remains scarce. Here, we investigated the causal effect of two neuromodulatory systems on behavioral and neural measures of perceptual and metacognitive decision-making. Specifically, we pharmacologically elevated levels of catecholamines (with atomoxetine) and acetylcholine (with donepezil) in healthy adult human participants performing a visual discrimination task in which we gauged decision confidence, while electroencephalography was measured. Where cholinergic effects were not robust, catecholaminergic enhancement improved perceptual sensitivity, while at the same time leaving metacognitive sensitivity unaffected. Neurally, catecholaminergic elevation did not affect sensory representations of task-relevant visual stimuli but instead enhanced well-known decision signals measured over the centroparietal cortex, reflecting the accumulation of sensory evidence over time. Crucially, catecholaminergic enhancement concurrently impoverished neural markers measured over the frontal cortex linked to the formation of metacognitive evaluations. Enhanced catecholaminergic neuromodulation thus improves perceptual but not metacognitive decision-making.</p>

                <p>Early-life stressors can affect reproductive development and change responses to adult stress. We tested if resource scarcity in the form of limited bedding and nesting (LBN) from postnatal days (PND) 4 to 11 delayed sexual maturation in male and female mice and/or altered the response to an acute, layered, psychosocial stress (ALPS) in adulthood. Contrary to the hypotheses, age and mass at puberty were unaffected by the present application of LBN. Under basal conditions and after ALPS, corticosterone concentrations in males, diestrous females, and proestrous females reared in standard (STD) or LBN environments were similar. ALPS disrupts the luteinizing hormone (LH) surge in most mice when applied on the morning of proestrus; this effect was not changed by resource scarcity. In this study, the paucity of effects in the offspring may relate to a milder response of CBA dams to the paradigm. While LBN dams exited the nest more often and their offspring were smaller than STD-reared offspring on PND11, dam corticosterone concentrations were similar on PND11. To test if ALPS disrupts the LH surge by blunting the increase in excitatory GABAergic input to gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons on the afternoon of proestrus, we conducted whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings. The frequency of GABAergic postsynaptic currents in GnRH neurons was not altered by LBN, ALPS, or their interaction. It remains possible that ALPS acts at afferents of GnRH neurons, changes response of GnRH neurons to input, and/or alters pituitary responsiveness to GnRH and that a more pronounced resource scarcity would affect the parameters studied.</p>

                <p>Midbrain dopamine neurons receive convergent synaptic input from multiple brain areas, which perturbs rhythmic pacemaking to produce the complex firing patterns observed in vivo. This study investigated the impact of single and multiple inhibitory inputs on ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine neuron firing in mice of both sexes using novel experimental measurements and modeling. We first measured unitary inhibitory postsynaptic currents produced by single axons using both minimal electrical stimulation and minimal optical stimulation of rostromedial tegmental nucleus and ventral pallidum afferents. We next determined the phase resetting curve, the reversal potential for GABA<SUB>A</SUB> receptor-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs), and the average interspike membrane potential trajectory during pacemaking. We combined these data in a phase oscillator model of a VTA dopamine neuron, simulating the effects of unitary inhibitory postsynaptic conductances (uIPSGs) on spike timing and rate. The effect of a uIPSG on spike timing was predicted to vary according to its timing within the interspike interval or phase. Simulations were performed to predict the pause duration resulting from the synchronous arrival of multiple uIPSGs and the changes in firing rate and regularity produced by asynchronous uIPSGs. The model data suggest that asynchronous inhibition is more effective than synchronous inhibition, because it tends to hold the neuron at membrane potentials well positive to the IPSC reversal potential. Our results indicate that small fluctuations in the inhibitory synaptic input arriving from the many afferents to each dopamine neuron are sufficient to produce highly variable firing patterns, including pauses that have been implicated in reinforcement.</p>

                Background Software defects can have catastrophic consequences. Therefore, fixing these defects is crucial for the evolution of software. Software Defect Prediction (SDP) enables developers to investigate unscramble faults in the inaugural parts of the software progression mechanism. However, SDP faces many challenges, including the high magnitude of attributes in the datasets, which can degrade the prognostic performance of a defect forecasting model. Feature selection (FS), a compelling instrument for overcoming high dimensionality, selects only the relevant and best features while carefully discarding others. Over the years, several meta-heuristic algorithms such as the Genetic Algorithm (GA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Differential Evolution (DE), and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) have been used to develop defect prediction models. However, these models suffer from several drawbacks, such as high cost, local optima trap, lower convergence rate, and higher parameter tuning. To overcome the above shortcomings, this study aims to develop an innovative FS technique, namely, the Chernobyl Optimization Algorithm (FSCOA), to unwrap the most informative features that can produce a precise prediction model while minimizing errors. Methods The proposed FSCOA approach mimicked the process of nuclear radiation while attacking humans after an explosion. The proposed FSCOA approach was combined with four widely used classifiers, namely Decision Tree (DT), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), Naive Bayes (NB), and Quantitative Discriminant Analysis (QDA), to determine the finest attributes from the SDP datasets. Furthermore, the accuracy of the recommended FSCOA method is correlated with existing FS techniques, such as FSDE, FSPSO, FSACO, and FSGA. The statistical merit of the proposed measure was verified using Friedman and Holm tests. Results The experimental findings showed that the proposed FSCOA approach yielded the best accuracy in most cases and achieved an average rank of 1.75, followed by the other studied FS approaches. Furthermore, the Holm test showed that the p-value was lower than or equivalent to the value of α/(A-i), except for the FSCOA and FSGA and FSCOA and FSACO models. Conclusion The experimental findings showed that the prospective FSCOA procedure eclipsed alternative FS techniques with higher accuracy in almost all cases while selecting optimal features.

                Background Prediabetes, a reversible condition before the onset of diabetes, is a significant concern in healthcare globally. The global prediabetes epidemic has emerged and has considerably impacted health expenditures. Various risk factors play important roles in the progression of prediabetes to diabetes. Intensive lifestyle and pharmacological interventions can significantly reduce the risk of diabetes progression. Objective This study aimed to determine the prevalence, characteristics, and risk factors of prediabetes state of Medan in August 2023. Methods The sample consisted of 89 participants. This was an analytical cross-sectional study in the community that met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The determination of prediabetes is based on the results of blood tests, namely, the examination of fasting blood sugar levels (FBGL), 2-hour postprandial oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1C). Other examinations included lipid profiling (total cholesterol, HDL-C, LDL-C, and triglycerides). Data processing was performed using SPSS via univariate and bivariate analyses (chi-square test). Results Of the 89 participants, the prevalence of prediabetes based on HbA1c, FBGL and 2-hours OGTT levels was 28.1%, 50.6%, and 28.1%, respectively. 82% of the participants were female, and 53.9% were overweight or obese based on body mass index (BMI). The risk factors related to the prevalence of prediabetes were HbA1c level, impaired FBGL, and impaired 2-hours OGTT. Other risk factors such as age, sex, daily exercise, diet, BMI, waist-hip ratio, acanthosis nigricans, lipid profile, and blood pressure did not correlate significantly with the risk factors (p>0.05). Conclusion This study found that the prevalence of prediabetes was 67.4% in Medan, 82% of the participants were female, and more than 50% of participants were overweight or obese. HbA1c, FBGL, and 2-hour postprandial OGTT were the most important risk factors for prediabetes.

                Background Gingival recession is a concern in aesthetic and functional perspective. The tunneling technique (TT) is one of the effective root coverage treatments in some gingival recession defects and is associated with favorable outcomes. This paper aims to evaluate the effectiveness of platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) and connective tissue graft (CTG) in gingival recession treatment with TT. Methods This systematic review used the PRISMA method and electronic bibliographic searches were conducted on seven databases (Google Scholar, Wiley, Pubmed, Sage, Ovid Technologies, Quintessence Publishing, Springer) from December 2018 to January 2023. The search focused on randomized clinical trials (RCTs) that reported TT outcomes in the treatment of Miller class I and II recession with a minimum of six months follow-up. Results Three out of 399 studies met the inclusion criteria. The three selected studies presented PRF and CTG use in multiple gingival recessions to evaluate tissue condition and clinical parameters before and after the surgical procedure. The clinical parameters evaluated were probing pocket depth (PPD), recession width (RW), width of keratinized gingiva (WKG), and vertical depth of recession (VDR). TT with PRF and TT with CTG is effective in treating gingival recession. PRF is well accepted by patients with a less invasive procedure compared to the CTG procedure. However, TT with CTG showed better results in all parameters at follow-up. Conclusions TT with PRF can be used as an alternative to treat some gingival recession defects. However, TT with CTG produced better clinical results in recession closure.

                Background Since the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 outbreak a global pandemic and the global spread had created several challenges for the general public and the healthcare workers across the world, the primary aim of this study was to assess the psychological stress, sleep quality, and health-related quality of life (QoL) of individuals with multiple health issues during home quarantine caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods The study was conducted between 28th March to 30th April 2020. We recruited 50 individuals who have a history of chronic health issues, and 50 individuals with no health issues for this cross-sectional study. Three questionnaires were used to evaluate the mental health [depression anxiety stress scale (DASS-21)], sleep quality [Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI)], and QoL [short form of health-related questionnaire (SF-36)] of the participants. Statistical analysis was carried out with Student’s t-test, using SPSS software v16. Results Baseline demographic characteristics were homogenous for both groups of participants. Intergroup analysis revealed statistically significant differences in mental health (p<0.001), sleep quality (p<0.001), and QoL (p<0.001) between the two groups. The results showed high levels of depression, anxiety and stress; poor sleep quality and low health-related QoL in Group A as compared to Group B. Conclusion Our findings indicate that individuals with chronic health issues exhibit higher mental health problems, lower quality of sleep and have a lower health-related QoL. More research is required and also government should plan on taking care of those patients.

                <p>by Beth M. Tuschhoff, David A. Kennedy</p>

The presence of heterogeneity in susceptibility, differences between hosts in their likelihood of becoming infected, can fundamentally alter disease dynamics and public health responses, for example, by changing the final epidemic size, the duration of an epidemic, and even the vaccination threshold required to achieve herd immunity. Yet, heterogeneity in susceptibility is notoriously difficult to detect and measure, especially early in an epidemic. Here we develop a method that can be used to detect and estimate heterogeneity in susceptibility given contact by using contact tracing data, which is typically collected early in the course of an outbreak. This approach provides the capability, given sufficient data, to estimate and account for the effects of this heterogeneity before they become apparent during an epidemic. It additionally provides the capability to analyze the wealth of contact tracing data available for previous epidemics and estimate heterogeneity in susceptibility for disease systems in which it has never been estimated previously. The premise of our approach is that highly susceptible individuals become infected more often than less susceptible individuals, and so individuals not infected after appearing in contact networks should be less susceptible than average. This change in susceptibility can be detected and quantified when individuals show up in a second contact network after not being infected in the first. To develop our method, we simulated contact tracing data from artificial populations with known levels of heterogeneity in susceptibility according to underlying discrete or continuous distributions of susceptibilities. We analyzed this data to determine the parameter space under which we are able to detect heterogeneity and the accuracy with which we are able to estimate it. We found that our power to detect heterogeneity increases with larger sample sizes, greater heterogeneity, and intermediate fractions of contacts becoming infected in the discrete case or greater fractions of contacts becoming infected in the continuous case. We also found that we are able to reliably estimate heterogeneity and disease dynamics. Ultimately, this means that contact tracing data alone is sufficient to detect and quantify heterogeneity in susceptibility.

Finding communities in gene co-expression networks is a common first step toward extracting biological insight from these complex datasets. Most community detection algorithms expect genes to be organized into assortative modules, that is, groups of genes that are more associated with each other than with genes in other groups. While it is reasonable to expect that these modules exist, using methods that assume they exist a priori is risky, as it guarantees that alternative organizations of gene interactions will be ignored. Here, we ask: can we find meaningful communities without imposing a modular organization on gene co-expression networks, and how modular are these communities? For this, we use a recently developed community detection method, the weighted degree corrected stochastic block model (SBM), that does not assume that assortative modules exist. Instead, the SBM attempts to efficiently use all information contained in the co-expression network to separate the genes into hierarchically organized blocks of genes. Using RNA-seq gene expression data measured in two tissues derived from an outbred population of, we show that (a) the SBM is able to find ten times as many groups as competing methods, that (b) several of those gene groups are not modular, and that (c) the functional enrichment for non-modular groups is as strong as for modular communities. These results show that the transcriptome is structured in more complex ways than traditionally thought and that we should revisit the long-standing assumption that modularity is the main driver of the structuring of gene co-expression networks.

Collective alignment of cell populations is a commonly observed phenomena in biology. An important example are aligning fibroblasts in healthy or scar tissue. In this work we derive and simulate a mechanistic agent-based model of the collective behaviour of actively moving and interacting cells, with a focus on understanding collective alignment. The derivation strategy is based on energy minimisation. The model ingredients are motivated by data on the behaviour of different populations of aligning fibroblasts and include: Self-propulsion, overlap avoidance, deformability, cell-cell junctions and cytoskeletal forces. We find that there is an optimal ratio of self-propulsion speed and overlap avoidance that maximises collective alignment. Further we find that deformability aids alignment, and that cell-cell junctions by themselves hinder alignment. However, if cytoskeletal forces are transmitted via cell-cell junctions we observe strong collective alignment over large spatial scales.

                <p>by Matthieu Bouguéon, Vincent Legagneux, Octave Hazard, Jérémy Bomo, Anne Siegel, Jérôme Feret, Nathalie Théret</p>

Hepatic stellate cells (HSC) are the source of extracellular matrix (ECM) whose overproduction leads to fibrosis, a condition that impairs liver functions in chronic liver diseases. Understanding the dynamics of HSCs will provide insights needed to develop new therapeutic approaches. Few models of hepatic fibrosis have been proposed, and none of them include the heterogeneity of HSC phenotypes recently highlighted by single-cell RNA sequencing analyses. Here, we developed rule-based models to study HSC dynamics during fibrosis progression and reversion. We used the Kappa graph rewriting language, for which we used tokens and counters to overcome temporal explosion. HSCs are modeled as agents that present seven physiological cellular states and that interact with (TGF<i>β</i>1) molecules which regulate HSC activation and the secretion of type I collagen, the main component of the ECM. Simulation studies revealed the critical role of the HSC inactivation process during fibrosis progression and reversion. While inactivation allows elimination of activated HSCs during reversion steps, reactivation loops of inactivated HSCs (iHSCs) are required to sustain fibrosis. Furthermore, we demonstrated the model’s sensitivity to (TGF<i>β</i>1) parameters, suggesting its adaptability to a variety of pathophysiological conditions for which levels of (TGF<i>β</i>1) production associated with the inflammatory response differ. Using new experimental data from a mouse model of CCl4-induced liver fibrosis, we validated the predicted ECM dynamics. Our model also predicts the accumulation of iHSCs during chronic liver disease. By analyzing RNA sequencing data from patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) associated with liver fibrosis, we confirmed this accumulation, identifying iHSCs as novel markers of fibrosis progression. Overall, our study provides the first model of HSC dynamics in chronic liver disease that can be used to explore the regulatory role of iHSCs in liver homeostasis. Moreover, our model can also be generalized to fibroblasts during repair and fibrosis in other tissues.

                <p>by Chengxin Zhang, Lydia Freddolino</p>

Despite the increasing number of 3D RNA structures in the Protein Data Bank, the majority of experimental RNA structures lack thorough functional annotations. As the significance of the functional roles played by noncoding RNAs becomes increasingly apparent, comprehensive annotation of RNA function is becoming a pressing concern. In response to this need, we have developed FURNA (Functions of RNAs), the first database for experimental RNA structures that aims to provide a comprehensive repository of high-quality functional annotations. These include Gene Ontology terms, Enzyme Commission numbers, ligand-binding sites, RNA families, protein-binding motifs, and cross-references to related databases. FURNA is available at https://seq2fun.dcmb.med.umich.edu/furna/ to enable quick discovery of RNA functions from their structures and sequences.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Intellectual disability is often the outcome of neurodevelopmental disorders and is characterized by significant impairments in intellectual and adaptive functioning. X-linked intellectual disability (XLID) is a subset of these disorders caused by genetic defects on the X chromosome, affecting about 2 out of 1,000 males. In syndromic form, it leads to a broad range of cognitive, behavioral, ocular, and physical disabilities.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Employing exome or genome sequencing, here we identified 4 missense variants (c.475C &gt; G; p.H159D, c.1373C &gt; A; p.T458N, and c.1585G &gt; A; p.E529K, c.953C &gt; T; p.S318L) and a putative truncating variant (c.1413_1414del; p.Y471*) in the <i>SRPK3</i> gene in 9 XLID patients from 5 unrelated families. To validate <i>SRPK3</i> as a novel XLID gene, we established a knockout (KO) model of the <i>SRPK3</i> orthologue in zebrafish.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The 8 patients ascertained postnatally shared common clinical features including intellectual disability, agenesis of the corpus callosum, abnormal eye movement, and ataxia. A ninth case, ascertained prenatally, had a complex structural brain phenotype. Together, these data indicate a pathological role of <i>SRPK3</i> in neurodevelopmental disorders. In post-fertilization day 5 larvae (free swimming stage), KO zebrafish exhibited severe deficits in eye movement and swim bladder inflation, mimicking uncontrolled ocular movement and physical clumsiness observed in human patients. In adult KO zebrafish, cerebellar agenesis and behavioral abnormalities were observed, recapitulating human phenotypes of cerebellar atrophy and intellectual disability.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Overall, these results suggest a crucial role of <i>SRPK3</i> in the pathogenesis of syndromic X-linked intellectual disability and provide new insights into brain development, cognitive and ocular dysfunction in both humans and zebrafish. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96602">Drosophila HCN mediates gustatory homeostasis by preserving sensillar transepithelial potential in sweet environments</a></h4>

              
                Establishing transepithelial ion disparities is crucial for sensory functions in animals. In insect sensory organs called sensilla, a transepithelial potential, known as the sensillum potential (SP), arises through active ion transport across accessory cells, sensitizing receptor neurons such as mechanoreceptors and chemoreceptors. Because multiple receptor neurons are often co-housed in a sensillum and share SP, niche-prevalent overstimulation of single sensory neurons can compromise neighboring receptors by depleting SP. However, how such potential depletion is prevented to maintain sensory homeostasis remains unknown. Here, we find that the <i>Ih-</i>encoded hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channel bolsters the activity of bitter-sensing gustatory receptor neurons (bGRNs), albeit acting in sweet-sensing GRNs (sGRNs). For this task, HCN maintains SP despite prolonged sGRN stimulation induced by the diet mimicking their sweet feeding niche, such as overripe fruit. We present evidence that <i>Ih</i>-dependent demarcation of sGRN excitability is implemented to throttle SP consumption, which may have facilitated adaptation to a sweetness-dominated environment. Thus, HCN expressed in sGRNs serves as a key component of a simple yet versatile peripheral coding that regulates bitterness for optimal food intake in two contrasting ways: sweet-resilient preservation of bitter aversion and the previously reported sweet-dependent suppression of bitter taste.

                The cerebellum contributes to a diverse array of motor conditions, including ataxia, dystonia, and tremor. The neural substrates that encode this diversity are unclear. Here, we tested whether the neural spike activity of cerebellar output neurons is distinct between movement disorders with different impairments, generalizable across movement disorders with similar impairments, and capable of causing distinct movement impairments. Using in vivo awake recordings as input data, we trained a supervised classifier model to differentiate the spike parameters between mouse models for ataxia, dystonia, and tremor. The classifier model correctly assigned mouse phenotypes based on single-neuron signatures. Spike signatures were shared across etiologically distinct but phenotypically similar disease models. Mimicking these pathophysiological spike signatures with optogenetics induced the predicted motor impairments in otherwise healthy mice. These data show that distinct spike signatures promote the behavioral presentation of cerebellar diseases.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96979">A genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screen identifies calreticulin as a selective repressor of ATF6α</a></h4>

              
                Activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) is one of three endoplasmic reticulum (ER) transmembrane stress sensors that mediate the unfolded protein response (UPR). Despite its crucial role in long-term ER stress adaptation, regulation of ATF6 alpha (α) signalling remains poorly understood, possibly because its activation involves ER-to-Golgi and nuclear trafficking. Here, we generated an ATF6α/Inositol-requiring kinase 1 (IRE1) dual UPR reporter CHO-K1 cell line and performed an unbiased genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis screen to systematically profile genetic factors that specifically contribute to ATF6α signalling in the presence and absence of ER stress. The screen identified both anticipated and new candidate genes that regulate ATF6α activation. Among these, calreticulin (CRT), a key ER luminal chaperone, selectively repressed ATF6α signalling: Cells lacking CRT constitutively activated a BiP::sfGFP ATF6α-dependent reporter, had higher BiP levels and an increased rate of trafficking and processing of ATF6α. Purified CRT interacted with the luminal domain of ATF6α <i>in vitro</i> and the two proteins co-immunoprecipitated from cell lysates. CRT depletion exposed a negative feedback loop implicating ATF6α in repressing IRE1 activity basally and overexpression of CRT reversed this repression. Our findings indicate that CRT, beyond its known role as a chaperone, also serves as an ER repressor of ATF6α to selectively regulate one arm of the UPR.

	<p>Transcranial electrical brain stimulation techniques like transcranial direct current (tDCS) and transcranial alternating current (tACS) have emerged as potential tools for treating neurological diseases by modulating cortical excitability. These techniques deliver small electric currents to the brain non-invasively through electrodes on the scalp. tDCS uses constant direct current which weakly alters the membrane voltage of cortical neurons, while tACS utilizes alternating current to target and enhance cortical oscillations, though the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood more specifically. To elucidate how tACS perturbs endogenous network dynamics, we simulated spiking neuron network models. We identified distinct roles of the depolarizing and hyperpolarizing phases in driving network activity towards and away from the strong nonlinearity provided by pyramidal neurons. Exploring resonance effects, we found matching tACS frequency to the network&amp;amp;rsquo;s endogenous resonance frequency creates greater entrainment. Based on this, we developed an algorithm to determine the network&amp;amp;rsquo;s endogenous frequency, phase, and amplitude, then deliver optimized tACS to entrain network oscillations. Together, these computational results provide mechanistic insight into the effects of tACS on network dynamics and could inform future closed-loop tACS systems that dynamically tune stimulation parameters to ongoing brain activity.</p>

	<p>The classification of a pre-processed fMRI dataset using functional connectivity (FC)-based features is considered a challenging task because of the set of high-dimensional FC features and the small dataset size. To tackle this specific set of FC high-dimensional features and a small-sized dataset, we propose here a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN)-based dataset augmenter to first train the cGAN on computed connectivity features of NYU dataset and use the trained cGAN to generate synthetic connectivity features per category. After obtaining a sufficient number of connectivity features per category, a Multi-Head attention mechanism is used as a head for the classification. We name our proposed approach &amp;amp;ldquo;ASD-GANNet&amp;amp;rdquo;, which is end-to-end and does not require hand-crafted features, as the Multi-Head attention mechanism focuses on the features that are more relevant. Moreover, we compare our results with the six available state-of-the-art techniques from the literature. Our proposed approach results using the &amp;amp;ldquo;NYU&amp;amp;rdquo; site as a training set for generating a cGAN-based synthetic dataset are promising. We achieve an overall 10-fold cross-validation-based accuracy of 82%, sensitivity of 82%, and specificity of 81%, outperforming available state-of-the art approaches. A sitewise comparison of our proposed approach also outperforms the available state-of-the-art, as out of the 17 sites, our proposed approach has better results in the 10 sites.</p>

	<p>Background: This longitudinal study aimed to evaluate whether prior engagement in a physical exercise program correlated with enhanced perceptions of quality-of-life components among older adults during the COVID-19 lockdown period. Methods: The cohort comprised elderly individuals (aged &amp;amp;ge; 65 years) who had previously partaken in a 12-week randomized controlled trial investigating the effects of a mixed aerobic&amp;amp;ndash;anaerobic, moderate-intensity exercise program. Participants&amp;amp;rsquo; health-related quality of life was assessed using the Short Form Health Survey-12 item (SF-12) at the beginning of the initial trial and, again, one year later during the COVID-19 lockdown. In the exercise group, 44 participants were included, while the control group consisted of 49 participants, with computer-based, double-blind randomization conducted in Cagliari, Italy. The differences in scores for each SF-12 item between the two groups from T0 to T1 were compared using one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni corrections. Data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 27. Results: No statistically significant differences were observed on average by age (exercise group vs. control group 72.20 &amp;amp;plusmn; 4.78 vs. 72.91 &amp;amp;plusmn; 4.77; F = 0.513, p = 0.476). A decrease from T0 to T1 towards a better score on the SF-12 was observed in the exercise group compared to the control group in item 1 (F = 67.463, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001); in item 5 (F = 4.319, p = 0.041); item 8 (F = 4.269, p = 0.041); item 9 (F = 10.761, p = 0.001); item 10 (F = 170.433, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001); and item 11 (F = 4.075, p = 0.046). Conclusions: The results suggest that participation in a moderate physical exercise program one year prior may have equipped older adults with better coping mechanisms to navigate the stress and isolation imposed by the COVID-19 lockdown, as reflected by their enhanced scores on quality-of-life components pertaining to mental well-being. Exercise may confer a protective effect against the adverse psychological impacts of stressful events like the pandemic, even among older adults with chronic conditions. This study underscores the potential benefits of exercise interventions for promoting quality of life and preventing mood disorders in the elderly population.</p>

	<p>Rare side effects of immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are known as neurological immune-related adverse events (n-irAEs). Typically, n-irAEs affect the peripheral nervous system, primarily presenting as myositis, polyradiculoneuropathy, or cranial neuropathy. Less commonly, they impact the central nervous system, resulting in encephalitis, meningitis, or myelitis. High-grade n-irAEs managing and recognizing remains challenging, considering the risk of mortality and long-term disability. To date, strong scientific data are lacking to support the management of high-grade clinical forms. We performed a systematic literature search, selecting all articles describing high-grade steroid-resistance n-irAEs. and we reported them in a practical review. Specifically, current recommendations advise stopping ICI use and beginning corticosteroid treatment. Our findings highlighted that in steroid-resistant n-irAEs, it should be recommended to quickly escalate to plasma exchange (PLEX) and/or intravenously immunoglobulins (IVIg), usually in association with other immunosuppressants. Furthermore, newer evidence supports the use of drugs that may specifically block inflammation without reducing the anti-tumour effect of ICIs. In this practical review, we provide new evidence regarding the therapeutic approach of high-grade n-irAEs, particularly in steroid-resistant cases. We would also stress the importance of informing the scientific community of the discrepancy between current guidelines and clinical evidence in these rare forms of pathology.</p>

	<p>The cerebellum, a major feature of the hindbrain, lies posterior to the pons and medulla and inferior to the posterior part of the cerebrum. It lies beneath the tentorium cerebelli in the posterior cranial fossa and consists of two lateral hemispheres connected by the vermis. The cerebellum is primarily supplied by three arteries originating from the vertebrobasilar system: the superior cerebellar artery (SCA), the anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA), and the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA). However, variations of the cerebellar arteries may occur, such as duplication of the SCA, SCA creating a common trunk with the posterior cerebral artery, triplication of the AICA, and agenesis of PICA, amongst others. Knowledge of the arterial anatomy of the cerebellum is crucial, as inadequate blood supply to this region can result in diminished motor functioning, significantly impacting the quality of life for patients. The present study demonstrated the importance of adequate anatomical knowledge of the arteries supplying the cerebellum. The PubMed and Embase databases were searched to gather articles on the anatomical characteristics and variations of the arterial supply of the cerebellum. It is the most comprehensive and up-to-date review available in the literature. The possible variations of these vessels may be clinically silent or present with clinical symptoms such as neurovascular compression syndromes of the cranial nerves and aneurysms. With a comprehensive understanding of the cerebellar arterial system, physicians can enhance their diagnostic and treatment capabilities, ultimately leading to more effective management of cerebellar vascular-related issues and other neurological deficits.</p>

	<p>Revascularization surgery for the symptomatic hemisphere with hemodynamic impairment is effective for Moyamoya vasculopathy patients. However, careful patient selection is crucial and ideally supported by advanced quantitative hemodynamic imaging. Recently, blood oxygenation level-dependent cerebrovascular reactivity (BOLD-CVR) and quantitative magnetic resonance angiography with non-invasive optimal vessel analysis (qMRA-NOVA) have gained prominence in assessing these patients. This study aims to present the results of BOLD-CVR and qMRA-NOVA imaging along with the changes in cerebral hemodynamics and flow status following flow augmentation with superficial temporal artery&amp;amp;ndash;middle cerebral artery (STA-MCA) bypass in our Moyamoya vasculopathy patient cohort. Symptomatic patients with Moyamoya vasculopathy treated at the Clinical Neuroscience Center of the University Hospital Zurich who underwent hemodynamic and flow imaging (BOLD-CVR and qMRA-NOVA) before and after bypass were included in the analysis. Reduced hemispheric volume flow rates, as well as impaired BOLD-CVR, were measured in all 12 patients with Moyamoya vasculopathy before STA-MCA bypass surgery. Following the surgical procedure, post-operative BOLD-CVR demonstrated a non-significant increase in BOLD-CVR values within the revascularized, symptomatic middle cerebral artery territory and cerebral hemisphere. The results of the statistical tests should be viewed as indicative due to the small sample size. Additionally, post-operative qMRA-NOVA revealed a significant improvement in the hemispheric volume flow rate of the affected hemisphere due to the additional bypass flow rate. Our findings affirm the presence of hemodynamic and flow impairments in the symptomatic hemisphere of the Moyamoya vasculopathy patients. Bypass surgery proves effective in improving both BOLD-CVR impairment and the hemispheric volume flow rate in our patient cohort.</p>

	<p>Introduction: Intramedullary metastases to the conus medullaris spinalis (IMCM) pose a rare problem in neurosurgical oncology and are usually encountered as a complicated clinical scenario in the setting of advanced systemic malignancy with poor overall survival. Despite the progress in interdisciplinary oncological care, their management remains complicated. Research Question: We performed a PRISMA-guided literature search to achieve a pooled analysis of all previously reported IMCM cases that contained detailed clinical data on this problem to investigate the currently employed management options and respective outcomes. We obtained a clinical vignette and performed a comprehensive narrative review of IMCM management. Materials and Methods: The PubMed/MEDLINE/Google Scholar, Cochrane and Embase databases were systematically searched according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. All relevant publications retrieved were subjected to full-text analysis in detail and pertinent information was extracted. Results: The most common systemic primary tumor site as the origin of IMCM was the lung, followed by the breast. Overall, the pooled median survival was 6 months (range 0.5&amp;amp;ndash;36 months). Patients who received both surgery and radiation therapy had the longest overall survival (OS) (mean 9.9 months) and those who received no oncological treatment (neither surgery nor adjuvant therapy) had the shortest OS (mean 3.6 months). In cases where surgical resection was performed as part of the treatment plan for metastases, those with partial tumor resection had a more favorable neurological outcome than patients who underwent aggressive gross total resection. Conclusions: Based on the results of our analysis, we find that diligent microsurgical resection (subtotal or total) followed by radiation therapy appears as an effective and suitable treatment in select patients with IMCM. When surgery is not feasible as part of the treatment algorithm, radiation therapy alone (conventional or radiosurgery) also appears to be a suitable treatment option that confers a benefit to the patient.</p>

	<p>Upper motor neuron (UMN) dysfunction is an important feature of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) for the diagnosis and understanding of pathogenesis. The identification of UMN signs forms the basis of ALS diagnosis, although may be difficult to discern, especially in the setting of severe muscle weakness. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) techniques have yielded objective physiological biomarkers of UMN dysfunction in ALS, enabling the interrogation of cortical and subcortical neuronal networks with diagnostic, pathophysiological, and prognostic implications. Transcranial magnetic stimulation techniques have provided pertinent pathogenic insights and yielded novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. Cortical hyperexcitability, as heralded by a reduction in short interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) and an increase in short interval intracortical facilitation (SICF), has been associated with lower motor neuron degeneration, patterns of disease evolution, as well as the development of specific ALS clinical features including the split hand phenomenon. Reduction in SICI has also emerged as a potential diagnostic aid in ALS. More recently, physiological distinct inhibitory and facilitatory cortical interneuronal circuits have been identified, which have been shown to contribute to ALS pathogenesis. The triple stimulation technique (TST) was shown to enhance the diagnostic utility of conventional TMS measures in detecting UMN dysfunction. Resting-state EEG is a novel neurophysiological technique developed for directly interrogating cortical neuronal networks in ALS, that have yielded potentially useful physiological biomarkers of UMN dysfunction. The present review discusses physiological biomarkers of UMN dysfunction in ALS, encompassing conventional and novel TMS techniques developed to interrogate the functional integrity of the corticomotoneuronal system, focusing on pathogenic, diagnostic, and prognostic utility.</p>

	<p>Motor impairment is a common issue in stroke patients, often affecting the upper limbs. To this standpoint, robotic neurorehabilitation has shown to be highly effective for motor function recovery. Notably, Machine learning (ML) may be a powerful technique able to identify the optimal kind and intensity of rehabilitation treatments to maximize the outcomes. This retrospective observational research aims to assess the efficacy of robotic devices in facilitating the functional rehabilitation of upper limbs in stroke patients through ML models. Specifically, clinical scales, such as the Fugl-Meyer Assessment (A-D) (FMA), the Frenchay Arm Test (FAT), and the Barthel Index (BI), were used to assess the patients&amp;amp;rsquo; condition before and after robotic therapy. The values of these scales were predicted based on the patients&amp;amp;rsquo; clinical and demographic data obtained before the treatment. The findings showed that ML models have high accuracy in predicting the FMA, FAT, and BI, with R-squared (R2) values of 0.79, 0.57, and 0.74, respectively. The findings of this study suggest that integrating ML into robotic therapy may have the capacity to establish a personalized and streamlined clinical practice, leading to significant improvements in patients&amp;amp;rsquo; quality of life and the long-term sustainability of the healthcare system.</p>

	<p>Flexible pulse-by-pulse regulation of sensorimotor synchronization is crucial for voluntarily showing rhythmic behaviors synchronously with external cueing; however, the underpinning neurophysiological mechanisms remain unclear. We hypothesized that the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) plays a key role by coordinating both proactive and reactive motor outcomes based on contextual mental imagery. To test our hypothesis, a missing-oddball task in finger-tapping paradigms was conducted in 33 healthy young volunteers. The dynamic properties of the dACC were evaluated by event-related deep-brain activity (ER-DBA), supported by event-related potential (ERP) analysis and behavioral evaluation based on signal detection theory. We found that ER-DBA activation/deactivation reflected a strategic choice of motor control modality in accordance with mental imagery. Reverse ERP traces, as omission responses, confirmed that the imagery was contextual. We found that mental imagery was updated only by environmental changes via perceptual evidence and response-based abductive reasoning. Moreover, stable on-pulse tapping was achievable by maintaining proactive control while creating an imagery of syncopated rhythms from simple beat trains, whereas accuracy was degraded with frequent erroneous tapping for missing pulses. We conclude that the dACC voluntarily regulates rhythmic sensorimotor synchronization by utilizing contextual mental imagery based on experience and by creating novel rhythms.</p>

                The Neuroscientist, Ahead of Print. <br/>High-grade gliomas (HGGs) are the commonest primary brain cancers. They are characterized by a pattern of aggressive growth and diffuse infiltration of the host brain that severely limits the efficacy of conventional treatments and patient outcomes, which remain generally poor. Recent work has described a suite of mechanisms via which HGGs interact, predominantly bidirectionally, with various cell types in the host brain including neurons, glial cells, immune cells, and vascular elements to drive tumor growth and invasion. These insights have the potential to inspire novel approaches to HGG therapy that are critically needed. This review explores HGG–host brain interactions and considers whether and how they might be exploited for therapeutic gain.

	<p>Background: Neural efficiency refers to the brain&amp;amp;rsquo;s ability to function with reduced resource expenditure while maintaining high performance levels. Previous research has demonstrated that table tennis athletes have greater neural efficiency at the conscious level. However, it is unknown whether they exhibit greater neural efficiency at the unconscious level. Therefore, this study aims to investigate unconscious perceptual processing and neural efficiency in elite table tennis athletes through tasks involving the judgment of spin serves. Methods: Fifty healthy, right-handed individuals participated in this study, including 25 elite table tennis athletes and 25 control participants without professional training experience. To evaluate the unconscious perceptual characteristics of both groups, we used a combination of masked priming paradigm and event-related potential techniques. Results: The behavioral results reveal that, compared to the control group, the table tennis athletes displayed reduced reaction times (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) and increased priming effects (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) under unconscious conditions. The electrophysiological findings indicated that both groups elicited N1, N2, and P2 components. Notably, compared to the control group, the table tennis athletes exhibited significantly lower amplitude responses at the occipital lobe electrodes PO3, POz, PO4, O1, Oz, and O2 (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Conclusions: These results further support the neural efficiency hypothesis, indicating that prolonged professional training enhances athletes&amp;amp;rsquo; capacities for specialized unconscious cognitive processing.</p>

	<p>The main goal of the current work was to assess the age sensitivity of a novel battery of cool and hot Executive Function (EF) tasks developed for the middle childhood period: the Executive Brain Battery (EBB). To this end, we carried out a first study in which the EBB was administered to six age groups ranging from 6 to 11. Additionally, in a second study, we compared children at the end of middle childhood (age 11 years) and adult performance in the EBB. Results showed that tasks included in the EBB were suitable for all age groups, with more age-related changes being found in cool than hot EF tasks. Moreover, at the end of middle childhood, children reach an adult-like performance in most of these cool and hot tasks. The present findings extend previous research suggesting that cool and hot EFs exhibit different patterns of age-related growth in middle childhood. Additionally, the EEB could become a useful tool for research on EFs during middle childhood that could be adapted for a wide range of populations.</p>

	<p>Patients with substance use disorders (SUDs) often suffer from cognitive dysfunction (CD), affecting their quality of life and daily functioning. Current treatments, including pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy, have limited efficacy and notable side effects. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a non-invasive technique that modulates cortical activity, shows promise in improving cognitive function with minimal side effects and low cost, and could potentially serve as a valuable adjunct to existing therapies. This systematic review aims to evaluate the literature on the effectiveness of tDCS for CD in SUD patients to inform clinical practice and future research. Following PRISMA guidelines, the review includes studies that used tDCS for SUD-related CD. The criteria for inclusion encompassed participants aged 18 and older with a diagnosis of SUD, the use of tDCS (either conventional or high-definition), control groups receiving sham stimulation or no intervention, and cognitive outcome measures for substance-related cognitive function using validated tools. Databases searched were Ovid MEDLINE, PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Scopus, and PsycINFO, with specific keywords. Twenty-two studies met the criteria, suggesting tDCS can improve cognitive functions in SUD patients, though results varied. Effectiveness may depend on the brain area targeted, stimulation parameters, task requirements, and individual differences. tDCS shows potential in treating SUD-related CD, but further research is needed to optimize stimulation protocols and address study variability. Future studies should use functional magnetic resonance imaging to explore the brain mechanisms by which tDCS improves cognitive function in SUDs and focus on larger, long-term trials to confirm efficacy and refine tDCS treatment parameters.</p>

                Despite the growing interest in social prescribing the diversification of health and social care strategies to support the well-being of patients has remained entrenched with a focus on the hospital setting within the Middle East. The United Arab Emirates has commenced progressing community mental health care to lead changes in how care and treatment are delivered within the United Arab Emirates. The authors adopted the use of the framework of Arksey and O’Malley (2005) to provide a systematic approach to searching the literature and creating a comprehensive foundation to guide the review. This scoping review provides a better understanding of the compatibility, content and outcomes of a selection of health models. The scoping review findings will inform the proposed use of social prescribing as an actionable approach to create a focus on the need to include and empower the social determinants of mental health. This article proposes an evidence-based health strategy that supports and enhances recent additions to national legislation on the inclusion of the Mental Health Law within the United Arab Emirates to meditate and prevent inequities in addressing the mental health needs of citizens and residents within the nation’s diverse communities.

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/11/7/ENEURO.0228-24.2024?rss=1">Reading Reshapes Stimulus Selectivity in the Visual Word Form Area</a></h4>

              
                <p>Reading depends on a brain region known as the "visual word form area" (VWFA) in the left ventral occipitotemporal cortex. This region's function is debated because its stimulus selectivity is not absolute, it is modulated by a variety of task demands, and it is inconsistently localized. We used fMRI to characterize the combination of sensory and cognitive factors that activate word-responsive regions that we precisely localized in 16 adult humans (4 male). We then presented three types of character strings: English words, pseudowords, and unfamiliar characters with matched visual features. Participants performed three different tasks while viewing those stimuli: detecting real words, detecting color in the characters, and detecting color in the fixation mark. There were three primary findings about the VWFA's response: (1) It preferred letter strings over unfamiliar characters even when the stimuli were ignored during the fixation task. (2) Compared with those baseline responses, engaging in the word reading task enhanced the response to words but suppressed the response to unfamiliar characters. (3) Attending to the stimuli to judge their color had little effect on the response magnitudes. Thus, the VWFA is uniquely modulated by a cognitive signal that is specific to voluntary linguistic processing and is not additive. Functional connectivity analyses revealed that communication between the VWFA and a left frontal language area increased when the participant engaged in the linguistic task. We conclude that the VWFA is inherently selective for familiar orthography, but it falls under control of the language network when the task demands it.</p>

                <p>Motion-induced anxiety and agoraphobia are more frequent symptoms in patients with vestibular migraine (VM) than migraine without vertigo. The neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is a therapeutic target for migraine and VM, but the link between motion hypersensitivity, anxiety, and CGRP is relatively unexplored, especially in preclinical mouse models. To further examine this link, we tested the effects of systemic CGRP and off-vertical axis rotation (OVAR) on elevated plus maze (EPM) and rotarod performance in male and female C57BL/6J mice. Rotarod ability was assessed using two different dowel diameters: mouse dowel (<I>r</I> = 1.5&nbsp;cm) versus rat dowel (<I>r</I> = 3.5&nbsp;cm). EPM results indicate that CGRP alone or OVAR alone did not increase anxiety indices. However, the combination of CGRP and OVAR did elicit anxiety-like behavior. On the rotarod, CGRP reduced performance in both sexes on a mouse dowel but had no effect on a rat dowel, whereas OVAR had a significant effect on the rat dowel. These results suggest that only the combination of CGRP with vestibular stimulation induces anxiety-like behavior and that CGRP affects the dynamic balance function in mice depending on the type of challenge presented. These findings suggest that anxiety-like behaviors can be teased out from imbalance behaviors in a mouse model of "migraine." Future studies are aimed to determine if CGRP receptor antagonists that have been effective treating migraineurs and mouse "migraine" models may also reduce the anxiety observed in migraine.</p>

                Background Endodontic treatment is the most common method for resolving pulpal and periapical pathology. However, various studies have reported that almost 11%–13% of all teeth that undergo extraction after endodontic treatment show the presence of cracks, craze lines, and vertical root fractures. Teeth with inadequate post endodontic restoration are more prone to fracture and coronal leakage, resulting in the diffusion of oral fluids, bacteria, bacterial products, and possibly root canal treatment failure. Furthermore, studies have advocated the use of endodontically treated teeth with restorative materials that have a similar or higher elastic modulus than the tooth for providing stiffness against forces that cause root fracture. Intraorifice barriers made of restorative materials that can bond to radicular dentin could thus be used to reinforce the radicular dentin while also preventing coronal microleakage. Although the sealing ability of intraorifice barriers has been widely compared in the literature, there have been few studies on the strengthening effect of the materials used in the study as intraorifice barriers when placed into the root canal. As a result, the current in vitro study aims to assess the effect of various materials as intraorifice barriers (Cention N, Resin modified glass ionomer cement, and short fiber reinforced flowable composite) on the force required fracture teeth after root canal treatment. Methods This in vitro study will be done on extracted human mandibular premolars with single root canal where after doing root canal treatment 2-3 mm obturating material would be replaced by intra orifice barriers (Cention N, resin modified glass ionomer cement [RMGIC], and short fiber reinforced flowable composite). The force required to fracture teeth will be calculated using universal testing machine.

                Background: The protein interaction between the viral surface S-glycoprotein and the host angiotensin converting enzyme-2 receptor (ACE2) is key to the virulent nature of SARS-CoV-2. The potential role that effective drug repurposing strategies may have to help stem the impact of future outbreaks has been brought to light in the recent COVID-19 pandemic. This study outlines a comprehensive approach towards in-silico drug discovery which aims to identify hit agents that can be suitably translated into a clinical setting. Methods: We use two different computational platforms to analyze the viral S-glycoprotein in its bound conformational state to the ACE2 receptor. We employed a comprehensive screening approach to shortlist compounds capable of binding to the viral target interface and corroborated these findings using both Schrödinger’s Glide and AutoDock Vina. Molecular dynamic simulation studies further verified the stability of the interaction at the viral-host protein interface. Results: Lymecycline, pentagalloylglucose, polydatin, and hexoprenaline were identified as prime candidates for further studies given the robust and stable nature of their interaction at the viral-host interface and relevance for clinical testing. These agents were shown in a 100-nanosecond simulation trajectory to favorably disrupt key binding interactions at the viral-host interface and may potentially inhibit viral entry into host cells. In all hit molecules it was observed that inhibiting the interaction with the following key viral binding residues: Lys17, Gly496, Tyr 505, and key host residues: His34, Asp38, Lys353, played a critical role toward the inhibition of the viral-host protein interaction. Conclusions: Our study is unique in its comprehensive approach to identify agents that can bind to the S-glycoprotein-ACE2 interface using multiple computational platforms. Among the hit compounds shortlisted in this study, both lymecycline and hexoprenaline may be considered as candidates for preliminarily clinical studies to assess their therapeutic potential in the management of COVID-19 infections.

                Background Systemic hypertension is a global non-communicable disease that creates an essential need for alternate forms of lifestyle modifications, including exercise, to lower elevated blood pressure. Mat Pilates, a feasible form of mind-body coordinated exercise, may provide benefits with limited resources. Objective This randomized controlled trial aimed to assess the efficacy of Mat Pilates on resting blood pressure and health-related quality of life in individuals with systemic hypertension. Methods A two-arm, single-blinded, block randomized controlled trial will be recruited with120 participants into control and experimental groups (1:1 ratio). Mat Pilates will be administered to the experimental group and standard care to the control group for 12 weeks. Resting and central blood pressure, health-related quality of life, and echocardiographic parameters will be measured before and after the trial. We hypothesized that Pilates may not be beneficial in lowering resting blood pressure in hypertensive patients. A repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) will test the within- and between-group effects of Mat Pilates on various outcomes. Ethics and Dissemination The trial was approved by the Institutional Research Committee, Manipal College of Health Professions, Manipal Academy of Higher Education, Kasturba Medical College, and Kasturba Hospital Institutional Ethics Committee, Manipal. Written informed consent will be obtained from all the participants. All stakeholders and committees will communicate key findings regarding the implementation of mind-body association exercises as a measure of lifestyle modification in individuals with systemic hypertension.

                Background Dietary supplements (DS) use among Lebanese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) increased widely due to the country’s economic and financial situation. This study was conducted (1) to estimate the prevalence of DS use among persons with T2DM amid the escalating economic crisis in Lebanon; (2) to explore the knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) of DS use; and (3) to determine any significant association between socio-economic and socio-demographic factors and the use of DS modality Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted during the worst episode of the economic crisis between October and April 2022 on 460 adult patients with T2DM of both sexes. Patients were interviewed using a pre-tested questionnaire. Results Almost 4 out of 10 patients with T2DM in our study were found to be using DS, where 27.6% take multivitamins frequently. One-third of the participants agreed that nutritional supplements are necessary to control diabetes symptoms and complications. Around 41.1% of the participants complained about hypoglycemia and used DS to control their blood sugar levels (56.4%), while the rest used it to improve their health (35.5%) and control their diet (2.2%). The predictors of DS usage were the patient’s level of education [OR=3.9, CI=1.5-10, p=0.003), self-monitoring of blood sugars (OR=4.9, CI=1.68-14.6; p=0.004) and reading the nutrition label [OR=59.3, CI=6.3-55.8, p=0.000]. Conclusion This study estimated the prevalence of DS use and abuse, among persons with diabetes type II and found three significant predictors of DS use among patients with T2DM. Public health experts should encourage healthy discussions and awareness with their patients to comprehend their views regarding DS use.

                Background Blastoid mantle cell lymphoma (B-MCL) is a rare aggressive lymphoma. It is characterized by blastoid morphology with high proliferation and inconsistent immunohistochemistry (IHC), making it a diagnostic challenge for the pathologist. Methods This is a retrospective analytical cohort study. We reviewed biopsy confirmed cases of B-MCL diagnosed over a period of 10 years (January 2012 to December 2022). The clinical presentation, histopathological and IHC findings, treatment received, and survival outcomes were studied. Randomly selected cases of classic MCL (n=12), diagnosed during the same period served as controls. Results A total of 12 cases were studied. Four cases were transformed from previously diagnosed MCL; 8 cases arose de novo. Mean age was 61.17 years and the male: female ratio was 5:1. Half of the cases showed extra nodal extension and 81.8% had bone marrow involvement. Gastrointestinal tract was the most common site of extra nodal involvement. Histopathological examination showed diffuse involvement of the lymph node with medium sized cells. On immunohistochemistry, one of the cases showed loss of CD5 expression while the other had aberrant CD10 expression. Mean Ki-67 index was 58.09% in the cases and 16.33% in controls and was statistically significant (p=0.005). The median overall survival (OS) for cases was 2 years vs 8 years in controls. The p53 over expression (>30% nuclear positivity) was seen in 66.6% cases (4/6). Conclusion There are several factors that contribute to the aggressiveness of B-MCL, and new treatment approaches might be required to improve patient outcomes.

                <p>by Eric Tatara, Qinyun Lin, Jonathan Ozik, Marynia Kolak, Nicholson Collier, Dylan Halpern, Luc Anselin, Harel Dahari, Basmattee Boodram, John Schneider</p>

Access to treatment and medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD) is essential in reducing opioid use and associated behavioral risks, such as syringe sharing among persons who inject drugs (PWID). Syringe sharing among PWID carries high risk of transmission of serious infections such as hepatitis C and HIV. MOUD resources, such as methadone provider clinics, however, are often unavailable to PWID due to barriers like long travel distance to the nearest methadone provider and the required frequency of clinic visits. The goal of this study is to examine the uncertainty in the effects of travel distance in initiating and continuing methadone treatment and how these interact with different spatial distributions of methadone providers to impact co-injection (syringe sharing) risks. A baseline scenario of spatial access was established using the existing locations of methadone providers in a geographical area of metropolitan Chicago, Illinois, USA. Next, different counterfactual scenarios redistributed the locations of methadone providers in this geographic area according to the densities of both the general adult population and according to the PWID population per zip code. We define different reasonable methadone access assumptions as the combinations of short, medium, and long travel distance preferences combined with three urban/suburban travel distance preference. Our modeling results show that when there is a low travel distance preference for accessing methadone providers, distributing providers near areas that have the greatest need (defined by density of PWID) is best at reducing syringe sharing behaviors. However, this strategy also decreases access across suburban locales, posing even greater difficulty in regions with fewer transit options and providers. As such, without an adequate number of providers to give equitable coverage across the region, spatial distribution cannot be optimized to provide equitable access to all PWID. Our study has important implications for increasing interest in methadone as a resurgent treatment for MOUD in the United States and for guiding policy toward improving access to MOUD among PWID.

Adaptive Immune Receptor Repertoire sequencing (AIRR-seq) is a valuable experimental tool to study the immune state in health and following immune challenges such as infectious diseases, (auto)immune diseases, and cancer. Several tools have been developed to reconstruct B cell and T cell receptor sequences from AIRR-seq data and infer B and T cell clonal relationships. However, currently available tools offer limited parallelization across samples, scalability or portability to high-performance computing infrastructures. To address this need, we developed nf-core/airrflow, an end-to-end bulk and single-cell AIRR-seq processing workflow which integrates the Immcantation Framework following BCR and TCR sequencing data analysis best practices. The Immcantation Framework is a comprehensive toolset, which allows the processing of bulk and single-cell AIRR-seq data from raw read processing to clonal inference. nf-core/airrflow is written in Nextflow and is part of the nf-core project, which collects community contributed and curated Nextflow workflows for a wide variety of analysis tasks. We assessed the performance of nf-core/airrflow on simulated sequencing data with sequencing errors and show example results with real datasets. To demonstrate the applicability of nf-core/airrflow to the high-throughput processing of large AIRR-seq datasets, we validated and extended previously reported findings of convergent antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 by analyzing 97 COVID-19 infected individuals and 99 healthy controls, including a mixture of bulk and single-cell sequencing datasets. Using this dataset, we extended the convergence findings to 20 additional subjects, highlighting the applicability of nf-core/airrflow to validate findings in small in-house cohorts with reanalysis of large publicly available AIRR datasets.

                Introduction Amid changing social dynamics, the world of higher education faces, among other challenges, the growing impact on the mental health of students. In this scenario, the Self-Determination Theory (SDT) highlights the important role of autonomy support as it generates positive effects on students' motivation and well-being. Methods The present study tests the predictive capacity of the teacher’s interpersonal style of autonomy support in a higher education institution, in relation to the satisfaction of basic psychological needs, autonomous motivation and depressive symptoms. A sample composed of 356 Spanish university students of which 237 were male (66.57%) from different grades and courses, aged between 17 and 57 years (M = 20.83; SD = 3.44), from middle socioeconomic strata, was used, and selected through purposive sampling. Results After the analysis of structural equations, the results showed that the teacher’s interpersonal style of autonomy support positively predicted the satisfaction of basic psychological needs and this the autonomous motivation; but negatively depressive symptoms. Conclusions The model describes the possible importance of promoting the teacher’s interpersonal style of autonomy support in higher education as a protective factor for well-being and mental health. These findings highlight the importance of motivational strategies that higher education teachers must implement to promote student motivation and well-being.

                Background Renal blood flow (RBF) is regulated by an autonomic nervous system and is reduced in older adults. Massage has been previously found to increase blood flow. Objective This two-armed double-blind, randomized controlled trial aimed to investigate the immediate effects of Thai foot massage (TFM) on RBF, psychological stress, and heart rate variability (HRV) in older adult persons. Material and Methods The 26 healthy older adult volunteers were recruited and randomly assigned to the TFM group (13 persons) and the control group (13 persons). The TFM group received a 15-minute Thai foot massage, and the control group received a 15-minute bed rest. Primary outcomes – RBF parameters [peak systolic velocity (PSV), end-diastolic velocity (EDV), resistive index (RI), volumetric arterial blood flow (VF)] and secondary outcomes – HRV parameters [standard deviation of the normal-to-normal intervals (SDNN), root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD), high frequency (HF), low frequency (LF), and low frequency per high frequency (LF/HF)] were measured after each intervention. Results Results showed that the VF significantly increased after TFM (P < 0.05) but not in control. Meanwhile, the stress index significantly reduced after TFM (P < 0.05). SDNN and RMSSD, the proxies of parasympathetic activity, also significantly increased in the TFM group (p < 0.05). Only RMSSD was significantly enhanced in the control group. No side effects were observed. Conclusion The TFM could increase RBF and alleviate psychological stress through parasympathetic activity actuation. Therefore, this intervention might improve RBF and relieve stress in the older population. Further study should be carried out on a larger population.

                COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in a global pandemic with a rapidly developing global health and economic crisis. Variations in the disease have been observed and have been associated with the genomic sequence of either the human host or the pathogen. Worldwide scientists scrambled initially to recruit patient cohorts to try and identify risk factors. A resource that presented itself early on was the UK Biobank (UKBB), which is investigating the respective contributions of genetic predisposition and environmental exposure to the development of disease. To enable COVID-19 studies, UKBB is now receiving COVID-19 test data for their participants every two weeks. In addition, UKBB is delivering more frequent updates of death and hospital inpatient data (including critical care admissions) on the UKBB Data Portal. This frequently changing dataset requires a tool that can rapidly process and analyse up-to-date data. We developed an R package specifically for the UKBB COVID-19 data, which summarises COVID-19 test results, performs association tests between COVID-19 susceptibility/severity and potential risk factors such as age, sex, blood type, comorbidities and generates input files for genome-wide association studies (GWAS). By applying the R package to data released in April 2021, we found that age, body mass index, socioeconomic status and smoking are positively associated with COVID-19 susceptibility, severity, and mortality. Males are at a higher risk of COVID-19 infection than females. People staying in aged care homes have a higher chance of being exposed to SARS-CoV-2. By performing GWAS, we replicated the 3p21.31 genetic finding for COVID-19 susceptibility and severity. The ability to iteratively perform such analyses is highly relevant since the UKBB data is updated frequently. As a caveat, users must arrange their own access to the UKBB data to use the R package.

[version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Hemodialysis patients are frequently colonized by Staphylococcus aureus, leading to severe infections with high mortality rates. However, little is known about transition from non-colonization to colonization or bacteremia over time. The aim was to analyze the behavior of S. aureus colonization, identifying the probability of transition from non-colonized to colonized state or bacteremia, and the influence of some covariates. Methods The study was conducted in a dialysis unit associated with a high complexity hospital in Medellín between October 2017 and October 2019. An initial measurement was taken to evaluate S. aureus colonization, and follow-up measurements were performed 2 and 6 months later. Bacteremia evolution was monitored for 12 months. A two-state recurrent continuous-time Markov model was constructed to model transition dynamics from non-colonization to S. aureus colonization in hemodialysis patients. Subsequently, the model was applied to a third state of bacteremia. Results Of 178 patients on hemodialysis, 30.3% were colonized by S. aureus. Transition intensity from non-colonization to colonization was three times higher (0.21; CI: 0.14-0.29) than from colonization to non-colonization (0.07; CI: 0.05-0.11). The colonization risk increased in patients with previous infections (HR: 2.28; CI: 0.78-6.68), hospitalization (HR: 1.29; CI: 0.56-2.99) and antibiotics consumption (HR: 1.17; CI: 0.53-2.58). Mean non-colonized state duration was 10.9 months, while in the colonized state was 5.2 months. In the 3-state model, it was found that patients colonized were more likely to develop S. aureus infection (13.9%). Conclusion A more likely transition from non-colonization to colonization was found, which increases with factors such as previous infection. In addition, the development of bacteremia was more likely in colonized than in non-colonized patients. These results underline the importance of surveillance and proper management of S. aureus colonization to prevent serious complications, such as bacteremia, and improve prognosis in this vulnerable population.

                Background The micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) play a pivotal role in the Latin America economy, creating jobs, boosting local economic activity and contribute to the socio-economic development of the region. The purpose is to reflect on the current costs management prices, the common challenges faced by SMEs in the region, and effective strategies to improve the profitability and sustainability of these companies. Methods it is addressed as a review study of type reflective, which used the dialectic as a method for the construction of the speech, based on techniques of triangulation of information. Result in order to obtain the results, these study topics were pre-selected: (a) determinants of the costs of production in the SMES, b) strategies for the reduction and control of production costs, and c) impact of production costs on the profitability of SMES. Conclusion the present research article delves into the pivotal factors influencing production costs within microenterprises and small businesses situated in the Latin American context. This study posits that the determinants underpinning these costs encompass a spectrum of elements including but not limited to labor, raw materials and supplies, energy and utilities, infrastructure and logistics, regulatory frameworks, and administrative intricacies. Furthermore, the intricate interplay of technology adoption and innovative capabilities is also recognized as a crucial facet in this cost determination paradigm. The overarching understanding underscores the direct and substantial influence of these multifaceted determinants on the operational expenditure of microenterprises and small businesses.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Susac syndrome (SuS), multiple sclerosis (MS), and primary angiitis of the central nervous system (PACNS) present diagnostic challenges due to overlapping clinical features. We aimed to enhance diagnostic precision by developing the SPAMS (SuS, PACNS, MS) score, a practical radiological tool.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This multicenter study included 99 patients (43 SuS, 37 MS, 19 PACNS) from South American countries. Relevant MRI features were identified through an elastic-net model determined key variables.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The SPAMS score assigned 2 points for snowball lesions, 1 point for spokes-like lesions, or if there are more than 4 lesions in the corpus callosum, corpus callosum involvement, or cerebellar involvement. It subtracted 1 point if gadolinium-enhancing lesions or 4 points if Dawson's fingers are present. Bootstrapping validated the optimal cutoff at 2 points, exhibiting a diagnostic performance of area under the curve = 0.931, sensitivity = 88%, specificity = 89%, positive predictive value = 88%, negative predictive value = 89%, and accuracy = 88%.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>When specific MRI findings coexisted, the SPAMS score differentiated SuS from MS and PACNS. Access to MRI and standard protocol sequences makes it a valuable tool for timely diagnosis and treatment, potentially preventing disability progression and severe clinical outcomes.

                Frisbie et al. demonstrate that stromal-to-tumor cell mitochondrial transfer drives ovarian cancer metastasis and clonal heterogeneity. Carcinoma-associated mesenchymal stem cells donate mitochondria to vulnerable tumor cells, enhancing tumor cell proliferation, chemoresistance, and respiratory capacity and triggering ANGPTL3 secretion to further promote tumor growth. These findings offer a potential therapeutic target for ovarian cancer.

                mTORC1 is a master metabolic regulator that stimulates anabolic cell growth and proliferation and suppresses catabolic processes such as autophagy. Joshi et al. find that mTORC1 activity oscillates throughout the cell cycle, promoting progression through interphase and entry into mitosis and resulting in differential sensitivity to autophagy induction.

                Lee et al. use naturalistic texture images to test the visual sensitivity of macaque monkeys during development. In interleaved sessions, they record population neural responses using the same stimuli in V1, V2, V4, and IT. Behavioral sensitivity increases with age, but neural sensitivity is adult-like at all ages.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88261">The scheduling of adolescence with Netrin-1 and UNC5C</a></h4>

              
                Dopamine axons are the only axons known to grow during adolescence. Here, using rodent models, we examined how two proteins, Netrin-1 and its receptor, UNC5C, guide dopamine axons toward the prefrontal cortex and shape behaviour. We demonstrate in mice (<i>Mus musculus</i>) that dopamine axons reach the cortex through a transient gradient of Netrin-1-expressing cells – disrupting this gradient reroutes axons away from their target. Using a seasonal model (Siberian hamsters; <i>Phodopus sungorus</i>) we find that mesocortical dopamine development can be regulated by a natural environmental cue (daylength) in a sexually dimorphic manner – delayed in males, but advanced in females. The timings of dopamine axon growth and UNC5C expression are always phase-locked. Adolescence is an ill-defined, transitional period; we pinpoint neurodevelopmental markers underlying this period.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91114">SPAG7 deletion causes intrauterine growth restriction, resulting in adulthood obesity and metabolic dysfunction</a></h4>

              
                From a forward mutagenetic screen to discover mutations associated with obesity, we identified mutations in the <i>Spag7</i> gene linked to metabolic dysfunction in mice. Here, we show that SPAG7 KO mice are born smaller and develop obesity and glucose intolerance in adulthood. This obesity does not stem from hyperphagia, but a decrease in energy expenditure. The KO animals also display reduced exercise tolerance and muscle function due to impaired mitochondrial function. Furthermore, SPAG7-deficiency in developing embryos leads to intrauterine growth restriction, brought on by placental insufficiency, likely due to abnormal development of the placental junctional zone. This insufficiency leads to loss of SPAG7-deficient fetuses in utero and reduced birth weights of those that survive. We hypothesize that a ‘thrifty phenotype’ is ingrained in SPAG7 KO animals during development that leads to adult obesity. Collectively, these results indicate that SPAG7 is essential for embryonic development and energy homeostasis later in life.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91030">RAG1 and RAG2 non-core regions are implicated in leukemogenesis and off-target V(D)J recombination in BCR-ABL1-driven B-cell lineage lymphoblastic leukemia</a></h4>

              
                The evolutionary conservation of non-core RAG regions suggests significant roles that might involve quantitative or qualitative alterations in RAG activity. Off-target V(D)J recombination contributes to lymphomagenesis and is exacerbated by RAG2’ C-terminus absence in <i>Tp53<sup>−/−</sup></i> mice thymic lymphomas. However, the genomic stability effects of non-core regions from both <i>Rag1<sup>c/c</sup></i> and <i>Rag2<sup>c/c</sup></i> in <i>BCR-ABL1</i><sup>+</sup> B-lymphoblastic leukemia (<i>BCR-ABL1</i><sup>+</sup> B-ALL), the characteristics, and mechanisms of non-core regions in suppressing off-target V(D)J recombination remain unclear. Here, we established three mouse models of <i>BCR-ABL1</i><sup>+</sup> B-ALL in mice expressing full-length RAG (Rag<sup>f/f</sup>), core RAG1 (Rag1<sup>c/c</sup>), and core RAG2 (Rag2<sup>c/c</sup>). The <i>Rag<sup>c/c</sup></i> (<i>Rag1<sup>c/c</sup></i> and <i>Rag2<sup>c/c</sup></i>) leukemia cells exhibited greater malignant tumor characteristics compared to <i>Rag<sup>f/f</sup></i> cells. Additionally, <i>Rag<sup>c/c</sup></i> cells showed higher frequency of off-target V(D)J recombination and oncogenic mutations than <i>Rag<sup>f/f</sup></i>. We also revealed decreased RAG cleavage accuracy in <i>Rag<sup>c/c</sup></i> cells and a smaller recombinant size in <i>Rag1<sup>c/c</sup></i> cells, which could potentially exacerbate off-target V(D)J recombination in <i>Rag<sup>c/c</sup></i> cells. In conclusion, these findings indicate that the non-core RAG regions, particularly the non-core region of RAG1, play a significant role in preserving V(D)J recombination precision and genomic stability in <i>BCR-ABL1</i><sup>+</sup> B-ALL.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89986">Cholinergic input to mouse visual cortex signals a movement state and acutely enhances layer 5 responsiveness</a></h4>

              
                Acetylcholine is released in visual cortex by axonal projections from the basal forebrain. The signals conveyed by these projections and their computational significance are still unclear. Using two-photon calcium imaging in behaving mice, we show that basal forebrain cholinergic axons in the mouse visual cortex provide a binary locomotion state signal. In these axons, we found no evidence of responses to visual stimuli or visuomotor prediction errors. While optogenetic activation of cholinergic axons in visual cortex in isolation did not drive local neuronal activity, when paired with visuomotor stimuli, it resulted in layer-specific increases of neuronal activity. Responses in layer 5 neurons to both top-down and bottom-up inputs were increased in amplitude and decreased in latency, whereas those in layer 2/3 neurons remained unchanged. Using opto- and chemogenetic manipulations of cholinergic activity, we found acetylcholine to underlie the locomotion-associated decorrelation of activity between neurons in both layer 2/3 and layer 5. Our results suggest that acetylcholine augments the responsiveness of layer 5 neurons to inputs from outside of the local network, possibly enabling faster switching between internal representations during locomotion.

	<p>To ensure survival, the visual system must rapidly extract the most important elements from a large stream of information. This necessity clashes with the computational limitations of the human brain, so a strong early data reduction is required to efficiently process information in fast vision. A theoretical early vision model, recently developed to preserve maximum information using minimal computational resources, allows efficient image data reduction by extracting simplified sketches containing only optimally informative, salient features. Here, we investigate the neural substrates of this mechanism for optimal encoding of information, possibly located in early visual structures. We adopted a flicker adaptation paradigm, which has been demonstrated to specifically impair the contrast sensitivity of the magnocellular pathway. We compared flicker-induced contrast threshold changes in three different tasks. The results indicate that, after adapting to a uniform flickering field, thresholds for image discrimination using briefly presented sketches increase. Similar threshold elevations occur for motion discrimination, a task typically targeting the magnocellular system. Instead, contrast thresholds for orientation discrimination, a task typically targeting the parvocellular system, do not change with flicker adaptation. The computation performed by this early data reduction mechanism seems thus consistent with magnocellular processing.</p>

	<p>The present study aimed to elucidate the neural mechanisms underpinning the visual recognition of morphologically complex verbs in Korean, a morphologically rich, agglutinative language with inherent polymorphemic characteristics. In an fMRI experiment with a lexical decision paradigm, we investigated whether verb inflection types (base, regular, and irregular) are processed through separate mechanisms or a single system. Furthermore, we explored the semantic influence in processing inflectional morphology by manipulating the semantic ambiguity (homonymous vs. unambiguous) of inflected verbs. The results showed equivalent activation levels in the left inferior frontal gyrus for both regular and irregular verbs, challenging the dichotomy between the two. Graded effects of verb regularity were observed in the occipitotemporal regions, with regular inflections eliciting increased activation in the fusiform and lingual gyri. In the middle occipital gyrus, homonyms showed decreased activation relative to that of unambiguous words, specifically for base and irregular forms. Furthermore, the angular gyrus exhibited significant modulation with all verb types, indicating a semantic influence during morphological processing. These findings support single-system theories and the connectionist framework, challenging the assumptions of purely orthographic morphological decomposition and dual-mechanism accounts. Furthermore, they provide evidence for a semantic influence during morphological processing, with differential reliance on semantic activation for regular and irregular inflections.</p>

	<p>Music is integrated into daily life when listening to it, playing it, and singing, uniquely modulating brain activity. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), celebrated for its ecological validity, has been used to elucidate this music&amp;amp;ndash;brain interaction. This scoping review synthesizes 22 empirical studies using fNIRS to explore the intricate relationship between music and brain function. This synthesis of existing evidence reveals that diverse musical activities, such as listening to music, singing, and playing instruments, evoke unique brain responses influenced by individual traits and musical attributes. A further analysis identifies five key themes, including the effect of passive and active music experiences on relevant human brain areas, lateralization in music perception, individual variations in neural responses, neural synchronization in musical performance, and new insights fNIRS has revealed in these lines of research. While this review highlights the limited focus on specific brain regions and the lack of comparative analyses between musicians and non-musicians, it emphasizes the need for future research to investigate the complex interplay between music and the human brain.</p>

	<p>An efficient mode of evaluation for eye movements is the use of objective eye tracking systems combined with subjective tests (NSUCO or DEM), which are easily applicable across all age groups and in eye care clinical settings. The objective of this study was to characterize fixations during reading in two groups: a group of children with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDG, 24 children, age: 6&amp;amp;ndash;12 years) and a group of children with oculomotor anomalies but without NDD (OAG, 24 children, age: 6&amp;amp;ndash;12 years). The results obtained were compared with those from a control group (CG, 20 children, age: 6&amp;amp;ndash;12 years). Specifically, the outcomes obtained with two subjective score systems, the Northeastern State University College of Optometry&amp;amp;rsquo;s Oculomotor (NSUCO) test and the Developmental Eye Movement (DEM) test, were compared with the objective analysis obtained through a commercially available eye tracker (Tobii Eye X, Tobii, Stockholm, Sweden). Specialized analysis software, namely Clinical Eye Tracker 2020 (Thomson Software Solutions, Welham Green, UK), was used. It was found that children with NDD had impaired oculomotor skills. A higher number of regressions, more fixations, and longer durations of fixations appear to be characteristic signs of this population group. Additionally, children with NDD took longer to complete the DEM test, as well as exhibiting more errors. The use of objective videoculographic systems for eye tracking and subjective tests like the NSUCO or DEM are good tools to assess saccadic movements, allowing the detection of oculomotor abnormalities in children with NDD.</p>

	<p>The purpose of the present study was to examine whether spatial or temporal prediction of the tactile stimulus contributes to tactile sensitivity. To investigate the effect of spatial prediction on tactile sensitivity, electrical stimuli were provided for the digit nerve in one of five fingers, and advanced notice of the stimulating finger was provided before the stimulus in some trials but not in others. There was no significant effect of spatial prediction on the intensity at the perceptual threshold of the digit nerve stimulus. This indicates that spatial prediction of the tactile stimulus does not influence tactile sensitivity. To examine the effect of temporal prediction, an auditory warning cue was provided 0, 1, or 10 s before the electrical stimulus to the digit nerve. The stimulus intensity at the perceptual threshold in the trials with the 1 s warning cue was lower than those with the 0 s warning cue. This indicates that temporal prediction enhances tactile sensitivity. The stimulus intensity at the perceptual threshold in the trials with the 1 s warning cue was lower than those with the 10 s warning cue. This means that the contribution of temporal prediction to the tactile sensitivity is greater as the warning cue is closer to the time of the stimulus. This finding may be explained by a defense mechanism activated when humans predict that a tactile stimulus is coming soon.</p>

	<p>(1) Background: Tinnitus involves the conscious awareness of a tonal or composite noise for which there is no identifiable corresponding external acoustic source. For many people, tinnitus is a disorder associated with symptoms of emotional distress, cognitive dysfunction, autonomic arousal, behavioural changes, and functional disability. Many symptoms can be addressed effectively using education or cognitive behavioural therapy. However, there is no treatment that effectively reduces or alters tinnitus-related neurophysiological activity and thus the tinnitus percept. In this systematic review, we evaluated the effectiveness of neuromodulation therapies for tinnitus that explicitly target pathological synchronous neural activity. (2) Methods: Multiple databases were searched for randomised controlled trials of neuromodulation interventions for tinnitus in adults, with 24 trials included. The risk of bias was assessed, and where appropriate, meta-analyses were performed. (3) Results: Few trials used acoustic, vagal nerve, or transcranial alternating current stimulation, or bimodal stimulation techniques, with limited evidence of neuromodulation or clinical effectiveness. Multiple trials of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) were identified, and a synthesis demonstrated a significant improvement in tinnitus symptom severity in favour of tDCS versus control, although heterogeneity was high. (4) Discussion: Neuromodulation for tinnitus is an emerging but promising field.

                <p>The role of gamma rhythm (30&ndash;80&nbsp;Hz) in visual processing is debated; stimuli like gratings and hue patches generate strong gamma, but many natural images do not. Could image gamma responses be predicted by approximating images as gratings or hue patches? Surprisingly, this question remains unanswered, since the joint dependence of gamma on multiple features is poorly understood. We recorded local field potentials and electrocorticogram from two female monkeys while presenting natural images and parametric stimuli varying along several feature dimensions. Gamma responses to different grating/hue features were separable, allowing for a multiplicative model based on individual features. By fitting a hue patch to the image around the receptive field, this simple model could predict gamma responses to chromatic images across scales with reasonably high accuracy. Our results provide a simple "baseline" model to predict gamma from local image properties, against which more complex models of natural vision can be tested.</p>

                <p>Chronic neuropathic pain can result from nervous system injury and can persist in the absence of external stimuli. Although ongoing pain characterizes the disorder, in many individuals, the intensity of this ongoing pain fluctuates dramatically. Previously, it was identified that functional magnetic resonance imaging signal covariations between the midbrain periaqueductal gray (PAG) matter, rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM), and spinal trigeminal nucleus are associated with moment-to-moment fluctuations in pain intensity in individuals with painful trigeminal neuropathy (PTN). Since this brainstem circuit is modulated by higher brain input, we sought to determine which cortical sites might be influencing this brainstem network during spontaneous fluctuations in pain intensity. Over 12&nbsp;min, we recorded the ongoing pain intensity in 24 PTN participants and classified them as fluctuating (<I>n</I> = 13) or stable (<I>n</I> = 11). Using a PAG seed, we identified connections between the PAG and emotional-affective sites such as the hippocampal and posterior cingulate cortices, the sensory-discriminative posterior insula, and cognitive-affective sites such as the dorsolateral prefrontal (dlPFC) and subgenual anterior cingulate cortices that were altered dependent on spontaneous high and low pain intensity. Additionally, sliding-window functional connectivity analysis revealed that the dlPFC&ndash;PAG connection anticorrelated with perceived pain intensity over the entire 12&nbsp;min period. These findings reveal cortical systems underlying moment-to-moment changes in perceived pain in PTN, which likely cause dysregulation in the brainstem circuits previously identified, and consequently alter the appraisal of pain across time.</p>

                Fondrakö is the local wisdom of the Nias ethnic community and has two functions. First are the oral religious holy book teaching ancestors' values and philosophy. Second is the highest consensus institution of the traditional society formulating and making decisions on the socio-religious law to guarantee the order of the community. This paper explains that social differentiation has happened in the modern era; philosophical values of fondrakö remain to live up to this day and experience the proliferation of rites. The argumentation built through this paper is that primitive culture will not simply disappear in the modern community just because it experiences accommodation and the decrease of emotional intensity into new forms. Social laws of primitive religion are not always contradictory and can run parallel with civilization.

                Background A holistic architectural education is the culmination of learning knowledge, skills, attitudes, and values, which eventually reflects in the quality of graduates. Even though different schools of thought have made various kinds of qualitative contributions towards the evolution of architectural education in India, it has largely been dominated by the quantitative and technical aspects of its regulating framework. Architects engage with the demanding contradictions between responsibilities of an ethical nature, the dynamic challenges of practice, and the intricacies of architectural imagination. The aesthetical and imaginative foundations of the field make it incumbent upon the architects to possess a balance of ecumenical proficiencies for accountability and personalization. The purpose of the study is to identify relevant attributes of Competency Based Education (CBE) that can be adopted for architectural education in India. Methods This research follows a narrative review approach and a descriptive-analytic method to broadly understand the attributes of CBE and its potential relevance to architectural education in India. 313 articles were searched on various search strings based on their relevance to the inquiry. 66 documents written in English language were included and appraised through the Scale of the Assessment for Narrative Review Articles (SANRA) tool to avoid any risk of bias. The PRISMA 2020 checklist and flow diagram has been used to report the findings of this narrative review Result The study identifies eight critical parameters of CBE with respect to its definitions, origins, transitions, regulatory environment, characteristics, approaches and implications on teaching-learning, frameworks and models of assessment; and challenges, which makes a case for the relevance of CBE for architectural education in India, which hasn’t been explored yet. Conclusion The broader expectations of ‘being competent’ can be addressed through a conscious adoption of strategies of relevant attributes of CBE which can encourage building attitudes and temperament for life-long learning

                Background: Edible films intended for food packaging have been produced from hydrocolloids, lipids, resins, and composites, including gelatin. Gelatin is known to have a good filming ability and has been suggested as an alternative to non-biodegradable plastics. Naturally active compounds incorporated into film packaging may not only protect the food product from oxidation and microbial contamination, but they may also alter the physicochemical properties of the film. Silver nanoparticles have been used in food packaging as active agents due to their antibacterial and antifungal properties. The addition may affect the characteristics of the packaging. Therefore, this study aims to determine the effect of the addition of silver nanoparticles on the physicochemical characteristics of edible film from Pangasius sp. skin gelatin. Methods: Mangrove extract of Bruguiera gymnorrhiza was used to synthesize silver into nanoparticle size. In this study, silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) with different concentrations (0, 2, 4 and 8%) were added into gelatin-based edible film. The edible films produced were observed for their physicochemical characteristics, including thickness, tensile strength, elongation, water vapour transmission, moisture content, pH, and colour. Results: AgNPs affected the colour of the fish-gelatin-based edible film, as an increased concentration of AgNPs resulted in a darker film. Nevertheless, the addition of AgNPs showed no significant effect on the thickness (145–216 µm), tensile strength (14.58–19.72 MPa), elongation (21.86–54.19%), water vapour transmission (30.91–42.55 g/m2/day), moisture content (9.57–11.16%) or pH (5.92–6.01) of the fish-gelatin-based edible film. Conclusions: The addition of AgNPs has no significant effect on gelatin-based edible film physicochemical properties except colour. Therefore, the incorporated edible film has the potential to be developed further.

                Foreign bodies (FB) in the aerodigestive tract are common, especially in children. The type of foreign body in the esophagus can vary and include magnets. A magnet that lodges in the esophagus should be extracted within 24 hours to prevent complications due to associated chemical reactions. In rural areas, there are several limitations to extracting FBs from the esophagus. We report a case of a magnetic FB that lodged in the esophagus of a three-year-old boy. The extraction was successfully done by esophagoscopy with the modification of a hook that was attached to the endoscope. This innovation may help physician all over the world, especially in rural areas. In the future, this innovation could be produced on an industrial scale.

                Background Fluid resuscitation is an essential component for sepsis treatment. Although several studies demonstrated that dynamic variables were more accurate than static variables for prediction of fluid responsiveness, fluid resuscitation guidance by dynamic variables is not standard for treatment. The objectives were to determine the effects of dynamic inferior vena cava (IVC)-guided versus (vs.) static central venous pressure (CVP)-guided fluid resuscitation in septic patients on mortality; and others, i.e., resuscitation targets, shock duration, fluid and vasopressor amount, invasive respiratory support, length of stay and adverse events. Methods A single-blind randomized controlled trial was conducted at Thammasat University Hospital between August 2016 and April 2020. Septic patients were stratified by acute physiologic and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II) <25 or ≥25 and randomized by blocks of 2 and 4 to fluid resuscitation guidance by dynamic IVC or static CVP. Results Of 124 patients enrolled, 62 were randomized to each group, and one of each was excluded from mortality analysis. Baseline characteristics were comparable. The 30-day mortality rates between dynamic IVC vs. static CVP groups were not different (34.4% vs. 45.9%, p=0.196). Relative risk for 30-day mortality of dynamic IVC group was 0.8 (95%CI=0.5-1.2, p=0.201). Different outcomes were median (interquartile range) of shock duration (0.8 (0.4-1.6) vs. 1.5 (1.1-3.1) days, p=0.001) and norepinephrine (NE) dose (6.8 (3.9–17.8) vs. 16.1 (7.6–53.6) milligrams, p=0.008 and 0.1 (0.1-0.3) vs. 0.3 (0.1-0.8) milligram⋅kilogram−1, p=0.017). Others were not different. Conclusions Dynamic IVC-guided fluid resuscitation does not affect mortality of septic patients. However, this may reduce shock duration and NE dose, compared with static CVP guidance.

                Background SARS-CoV-2 first appeared in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Looking at the prevalence data in the world and in Indonesia, the highest mortality rate due to COVID-19 involves age, gender and comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus. Severity of the condition also refers to coagulation abnormalities, such as abnormal prothrombin time values. Methods This systematic review study and meta-analysis used online literature sourced from PubMed, Science Direct, EBSCO, Cochrane and Google Scholar. The literature used here is literature that has data on age, sex and prothrombin time of COVID-19 patients with diabetes mellitus whose quality is assessed by the NOS (Newcastle-Ottawa Scale) criteria and processing data using Review Manager 5.4. Results Out of 8711 literatures that were traced from various search sources, there were 46 literatures that were included in this study. The results of the analysis on age showed the Standardized Mean Difference (SMD) value of 0.45 and P <0.0001 (95% CI: 0.23–0.68), the gender analysis showed an Odds Ratio (OR) value of 3.28 and P = 0.01 (95% CI: 1.26–8.52) and the prothrombin time analysis showed SMD values of 0.41 and P = 0.07 (95%CI = -0.03–0.85). Conclusion Older and male COVID-19 patients have a higher risk of having diabetes compared to younger and female COVID-19 patients. As diabetes is a comorbidity in COVID-19, it can be concluded that old age and male sex are associated with a more severe disease.

                <p>by Patrick Bryant, Frank Noé</p>

Structure prediction of protein complexes has improved significantly with AlphaFold2 and AlphaFold-multimer (AFM), but only 60% of dimers are accurately predicted. Here, we learn a bias to the MSA representation that improves the predictions by performing gradient descent through the AFM network. We demonstrate the performance on seven difficult targets from CASP15 and increase the average MMscore to 0.76 compared to 0.63 with AFM. We evaluate the procedure on 487 protein complexes where AFM fails and obtain an increased success rate (MMscore>0.75) of 33% on these difficult targets. Our protocol, AFProfile, provides a way to direct predictions towards a defined target function guided by the MSA. We expect gradient descent over the MSA to be useful for different tasks.

                <p>by David Moreau, Kristina Wiebels</p>

Open science principles are revolutionizing the transparency, reproducibility, and accessibility of research. Meta-analysis has become a key technique for synthesizing data across studies in a principled way; however, its impact is contingent on adherence to open science practices. Here, we outline 9 quick tips for open meta-analyses, aimed at guiding researchers to maximize the reach and utility of their findings. We advocate for outlining preregistering clear protocols, opting for open tools and software, and the use of version control systems to ensure transparency and facilitate collaboration. We further emphasize the importance of reproducibility, for example, by sharing search syntax and analysis scripts, and discuss the benefits of planning for dynamic updating to enable living meta-analyses. We also recommend publication in open-access formats, as well as open data, open code, and open access publication. We close by encouraging active promotion of research findings to bridge the gap between complex syntheses and public discourse, and provide a detailed submission checklist to equip researchers, reviewers and journal editors with a structured approach to conducting and reporting open meta-analyses.

These multicellular bacteria present a sophisticated developmental cycle and play a key role in soil ecology. Little is known about the impact of <i>Streptomyces</i> phage on bacterial physiology. In this study, we investigated the conditions governing the expression and production of “Samy,” a prophage found in <i>Streptomyces ambofaciens</i> ATCC 23877. This siphoprophage is produced simultaneously with the activation of other mobile genetic elements. Remarkably, the presence and production of Samy increases bacterial dispersal under in vitro stress conditions. Altogether, this study unveiled a new property of a bacteriophage infection in the context of multicellular aggregate dynamics.

Alternative transcription start site (TSS) usage regulation has been identified as a major means of gene expression regulation in metazoans. However, in fungi, its impact remains elusive as its study has thus far been restricted to model yeasts. Here, we first re-analyzed TSS-seq data to define genuine TSS clusters in 2 species of pathogenic <i>Cryptococcu</i>s. We identified 2 types of TSS clusters associated with specific DNA sequence motifs. Our analysis also revealed that alternative TSS usage regulation in response to environmental cues is widespread in <i>Cryptococcus</i>, altering gene expression and protein targeting. Importantly, we performed a forward genetic screen to identify a unique transcription factor (TF) named Tur1, which regulates alternative TSS (altTSS) usage genome-wide when cells switch from exponential phase to stationary phase. ChiP-Seq and DamID-Seq analyses suggest that at some loci, the role of Tur1 might be direct. Tur1 has been previously shown to be essential for virulence in <i>C</i>. <i>neoformans</i>. We demonstrated here that a <i>tur1Δ</i> mutant strain is more sensitive to superoxide stress and phagocytosed more efficiently by macrophages than the wild-type (WT) strain.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-833/v1?src=rss">Assessing hard and loose “endpoints”: comparison of patient and expert Bristol Stool Scale scoring of 2280 fecal samples [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Stool consistency is an important outcome measure to evaluate in the investigation of several gastrointestinal diseases. The Bristol Stool Scale (BSS) is one of the most commonly used tools for evaluation of stool consistency. BSS ranges from 1-7 and each score is assigned to a given consistency of the feces. Self-reported characterizations can differ from an expert evaluation, and the reliability of BSS is unclear. We aimed to evaluate the reliability of BSS by comparing patient scores with expert scores. Methods Patients with inflammatory bowel disease collected stool samples throughout a 3-year follow-up. The stool´s consistency was evaluated with BSS by the patients and matched with an expert score. Agreement between patient and expert scores was assessed using Cohen’s kappa. Results BSS scores from 2280 fecal samples collected from 992 patients at up to five time points were included. When all samples were compared, there was good to substantial agreement between patient and expert scores (Cohen’s weighted kappa: 0.66-0.72). When the BSS scores were simplified and categorized as 1 (scores 1-2), 2 (scores 3-5) or 3 (scores 6-7), the agreement improved slightly (Cohen’s weighted kappa: 0.73-0.77). When the scores from the first sample per patient were compared, the experts were more likely to assign higher scores compared to the patient. The proportion of the lowest assigned scores (1-2) was 12.1% for patients and 8.1% for experts. Conclusions The agreement between patient and expert BSS scores is good to substantial, especially when the BSS scores are simplified into three categories.

<br/>
<p>Despite therapeutic suppression of relapses, multiple sclerosis (MS) patients often experience subtle deterioration, which extends beyond the definition of “progression independent of relapsing activity.” We propose the concept of smouldering-associated-worsening (SAW), encompassing physical and cognitive symptoms, resulting from smouldering pathological processes, which remain unmet therapeutic targets. We provide a consensus-based framework of possible pathological substrates and manifestations of smouldering MS, and we discuss clinical, radiological, and serum/cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers for potentially monitoring SAW. Finally, we share considerations for optimizing disease surveillance and implications for clinical trials to promote the integration of smouldering MS into routine practice and future research efforts.
