              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Responses to Song Playback Differ in Sleeping versus Anesthetized Songbirds</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Vocal learning in songbirds is mediated by a highly localized system of interconnected forebrain regions, including recurrent loops that traverse the cortex, basal ganglia, and thalamus. This brain-behavior system provides a powerful model for elucidating mechanisms of vocal learning, with implications for learning speech in human infants, as well as for advancing our understanding of skill learning in general. A long history of experiments in this area has tested neural responses to playback of different song stimuli in anesthetized birds at different stages of vocal development. These studies have demonstrated selectivity for different song types that provide neural signatures of learning. In contrast to the ease of obtaining responses to song playback in anesthetized birds, song-evoked responses in awake birds are greatly reduced or absent, indicating that behavioral state is an important determinant of neural responsivity. Song-evoked responses can be elicited during sleep as well as anesthesia, and the selectivity of responses to song playback in adult birds is highly similar between anesthetized and sleeping states, encouraging the idea that anesthesia and sleep are similar. In contrast to that idea, we report evidence that cortical responses to song playback in juvenile zebra finches (<I>Taeniopygia guttata</I>) differ greatly between sleep and urethane anesthesia. This finding indicates that behavioral states differ in sleep versus anesthesia and raises questions about relationships between developmental changes in sleep activity, selectivity for different song types, and the neural substrate for vocal learning.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Rapid Alternate Monocular Deprivation Does Not Affect Binocular Balance and Correlation in Human Adults</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Recent studies show that the human adult visual system exhibits neural plasticity. For instance, short-term monocular deprivation shifts the eye dominance in favor of the deprived eye. This phenomenon is believed to occur in the primary visual cortex by reinstating neural plasticity. However, it is unknown whether the changes in eye dominance after monocularly depriving the visual input can also be induced by alternately depriving both eyes. In this study, we found no changes in binocular balance and interocular correlation sensitivity after a rapid (7 Hz), alternate, and monocular deprivation for 1 h in adults. Therefore, the effect of short-term monocular deprivation cannot seem to be emulated by alternately and rapidly depriving both eyes.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Early rhythmicity in the fetal suprachiasmatic nuclei in response to maternal signals detected by omics approach</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Philipp Greiner, Pavel Houdek, Martin Sládek, Alena Sumová</p>

The suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the hypothalamus harbor the central clock of the circadian system, which gradually matures during the perinatal period. In this study, time-resolved transcriptomic and proteomic approaches were used to describe fetal SCN tissue-level rhythms before rhythms in clock gene expression develop. Pregnant rats were maintained in constant darkness and had intact SCN, or their SCN were lesioned and behavioral rhythm was imposed by temporal restriction of food availability. Model-selecting tools dryR and CompareRhythms identified sets of genes in the fetal SCN that were rhythmic in the absence of the fetal canonical clock. Subsets of rhythmically expressed genes were assigned to groups of fetuses from mothers with either intact or lesioned SCN, or both groups. Enrichment analysis for GO terms and signaling pathways revealed that neurodevelopment and cell-to-cell signaling were significantly enriched within the subsets of genes that were rhythmic in response to distinct maternal signals. The findings discovered a previously unexpected breadth of rhythmicity in the fetal SCN at a developmental stage when the canonical clock has not yet developed at the tissue level and thus likely represents responses to rhythmic maternal signals.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Transcriptome-wide mapping reveals a diverse dihydrouridine landscape including mRNA</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Austin S. Draycott, Cassandra Schaening-Burgos, Maria F. Rojas-Duran, Loren Wilson, Leonard Schärfen, Karla M. Neugebauer, Sigrid Nachtergaele, Wendy V. Gilbert</p>

Dihydrouridine is a modified nucleotide universally present in tRNAs, but the complete dihydrouridine landscape is unknown in any organism. We introduce dihydrouridine sequencing (D-seq) for transcriptome-wide mapping of D with single-nucleotide resolution and use it to uncover novel classes of dihydrouridine-containing RNA in yeast which include mRNA and small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA). The novel D sites are concentrated in conserved stem-loop regions consistent with a role for D in folding many functional RNA structures. We demonstrate dihydrouridine synthase (DUS)-dependent changes in splicing of a D-containing pre-mRNA in cells and show that D-modified mRNAs can be efficiently translated by eukaryotic ribosomes in vitro. This work establishes D as a new functional component of the mRNA epitranscriptome and paves the way for identifying the RNA targets of multiple DUS enzymes that are dysregulated in human disease.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Endomitosis controls tissue-specific gene expression during development</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Lotte M. van Rijnberk, Ramon Barrull-Mascaró, Reinier L. van der Palen, Erik S. Schild, Hendrik C. Korswagen, Matilde Galli</p>

Polyploid cells contain more than 2 copies of the genome and are found in many plant and animal tissues. Different types of polyploidy exist, in which the genome is confined to either 1 nucleus (mononucleation) or 2 or more nuclei (multinucleation). Despite the widespread occurrence of polyploidy, the functional significance of different types of polyploidy is largely unknown. Here, we assess the function of multinucleation in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> intestinal cells through specific inhibition of binucleation without altering genome ploidy. Through single-worm RNA sequencing, we find that binucleation is important for tissue-specific gene expression, most prominently for genes that show a rapid up-regulation at the transition from larval development to adulthood. Regulated genes include vitellogenins, which encode yolk proteins that facilitate nutrient transport to the germline. We find that reduced expression of vitellogenins in mononucleated intestinal cells leads to progeny with developmental delays and reduced fitness. Together, our results show that binucleation facilitates rapid up-regulation of intestine-specific gene expression during development, independently of genome ploidy, underscoring the importance of spatial genome organization for polyploid cell function.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">The Cif proteins from Wolbachia prophage WO modify sperm genome integrity to establish cytoplasmic incompatibility</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Rupinder Kaur, Brittany A. Leigh, Isabella T. Ritchie, Seth R. Bordenstein</p>

Inherited microorganisms can selfishly manipulate host reproduction to drive through populations. In <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, germline expression of the native <i>Wolbachia</i> prophage WO proteins CifA and CifB cause cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI) in which embryos from infected males and uninfected females suffer catastrophic mitotic defects and lethality; however, in infected females, CifA expression rescues the embryonic lethality and thus imparts a fitness advantage to the maternally transmitted <i>Wolbachia</i>. Despite widespread relevance to sex determination, evolution, and vector control, the mechanisms underlying when and how CI impairs male reproduction remain unknown and a topic of debate. Here, we use cytochemical, microscopic, and transgenic assays in <i>D</i>. <i>melanogaster</i> to demonstrate that CifA and CifB proteins of <i>w</i>Mel localize to nuclear DNA throughout the process of spermatogenesis. Cif proteins cause abnormal histone retention in elongating spermatids and protamine deficiency in mature sperms that travel to the female reproductive tract with Cif proteins. Notably, protamine gene knockouts enhance wild-type CI. In ovaries, CifA localizes to germ cell nuclei and cytoplasm of early-stage egg chambers; however, Cifs are absent in late-stage oocytes and subsequently in fertilized embryos. Finally, CI and rescue are contingent upon a newly annotated CifA bipartite nuclear localization sequence. Together, our results strongly support the Host modification model of CI in which Cifs initially modify the paternal and maternal gametes to bestow CI-defining embryonic lethality and rescue.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">No evidence of fetal defects or anti-syncytin-1 antibody induction following COVID-19 mRNA vaccination</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Alice Lu-Culligan, Alexandra Tabachnikova, Eddy Pérez-Then, Maria Tokuyama, Hannah J. Lee, Carolina Lucas, Valter Silva Monteiro, Marija Miric, Vivian Brache, Leila Cochon, M.

Ko, Saad B. Omer, Akiko Iwasaki</p>

The impact of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) mRNA vaccination on pregnancy and fertility has become a major topic of public interest. We investigated 2 of the most widely propagated claims to determine (1) whether COVID-19 mRNA vaccination of mice during early pregnancy is associated with an increased incidence of birth defects or growth abnormalities; and (2) whether COVID-19 mRNA-vaccinated human volunteers exhibit elevated levels of antibodies to the human placental protein syncytin-1. Using a mouse model, we found that intramuscular COVID-19 mRNA vaccination during early pregnancy at gestational age E7.5 did not lead to differences in fetal size by crown-rump length or weight at term, nor did we observe any gross birth defects. In contrast, injection of the TLR3 agonist and double-stranded RNA mimic polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid, or poly(I:C), impacted growth in utero leading to reduced fetal size. No overt maternal illness following either vaccination or poly(I:C) exposure was observed. We also found that term fetuses from these murine pregnancies vaccinated prior to the formation of the definitive placenta exhibit high circulating levels of anti-spike and anti-receptor-binding domain (anti-RBD) antibodies to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) consistent with maternal antibody status, indicating transplacental transfer in the later stages of pregnancy after early immunization. Finally, we did not detect increased levels of circulating anti-syncytin-1 antibodies in a cohort of COVID-19 vaccinated adults compared to unvaccinated adults by ELISA. Our findings contradict popular claims associating COVID-19 mRNA vaccination with infertility and adverse neonatal outcomes.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Quantitative image analysis in COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome: a cohort observational study. [version 2; peer review: 1 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a severe form of acute lung injury commonly associated with pneumonia, including coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). The resultant effect can be persistent lung damage, but its extent is not known. We used quantitative high resolution computed tomography (QHR-CT) lung scans to radiographically characterize the lung damage in COVID-19 ARDS (CARDS) survivors. Methods Patients with CARDS (N=20) underwent QHR-CT lung scans 60 to 90 days after initial diagnosis, while hospitalized at a long-term acute care hospital (LTACH). QHR-CT assessed for mixed disease (QMD), ground glass opacities (QGGO), consolidation (QCON) and normal lung tissue (QNL). QMD was correlated with respiratory support on admission, tracheostomy decannulation and supplementary oxygen need on discharge. Results Sixteen patients arrived with tracheostomy requiring invasive mechanical ventilation. Four patients arrived on nasal oxygen support. Of the patients included in this study 10 had the tracheostomy cannula removed, four remained on invasive ventilation, and two died. QHR-CT showed 45% QMD, 28.1% QGGO, 3.0% QCON and QNL=23.9%. Patients with mandatory mechanical ventilation had the highest proportion of QMD when compared to no mechanical ventilation. There was no correlation between QMD and tracheostomy decannulation or need for supplementary oxygen at discharge. Conclusions Our data shows severe ongoing lung injury in patients with CARDS, beyond what is usually expected in ARDS. In this severely ill population, the extent of mixed disease correlates with mechanical ventilation, signaling formation of interstitial lung disease. QHR-CT analysis can be useful in the post-acute setting to evaluate for interstitial changes in ARDS.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Assessing the role of vascular risk factors in dementia: Mendelian randomization meta-analysis and comparison with observational estimates [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background:  Although observational studies demonstrate that higher levels of vascular risk factors are associated with an increased risk of dementia, these associations might be explained by confounding or other biases. Mendelian randomization (MR) uses genetic instruments to test causal relationships in observational data. We sought to determine if genetically predicted modifiable risk factors (type 2 diabetes mellitus, low density lipoprotein cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol, total cholesterol, triglycerides, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, body mass index, and circulating glucose) are associated with dementia by meta-analysing published MR studies. Secondary objectives were to identify heterogeneity in effect estimates across primary MR studies and to compare meta-analysis results with observational studies. Methods: MR studies were identified by systematic search of Web of Science, OVID and Scopus. We selected primary MR studies investigating the modifiable risk factors of interest. Only one study from each cohort per risk factor was included. A quality assessment tool was developed to primarily assess the three assumptions of MR for each MR study. Data were extracted on study characteristics, exposure and outcome, effect estimates per unit increase, and measures of variation. Effect estimates were pooled to generate an overall estimate, I2 and Cochrane Q values using fixed-effect model. Results: We screened 5211 studies and included 12 primary MR studies after applying inclusion and exclusion criteria. Higher genetically predicted body mass index was associated with a higher odds of dementia (OR 1.03 [1.01, 1.05] per 5 kg/m2 increase, one study, p=0.00285). Fewer hypothesized vascular risk factors were supported by estimates from MR studies than estimates from meta-analyses of observational studies.   Conclusion: Genetically predicted body mass index was associated with an increase in risk of dementia.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Productivity of mother pigs is lower in countries that still confine them in gestation crates [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: For decades, pig farmers have used gestation crates — small metal enclosures about two feet wide — to confine pregnant sows (female breeding pigs). Gestation crates physically restrain sows for most of their life, preventing them from walking or even turning around. Millions of females are still housed in these systems. Growing societal concern about animal welfare has been pressuring the industry for change, with recent legislation in the European Union and California restricting the use of crates. Still, the notion that gestation crates negatively affect sow welfare has been challenged by producers in regions where crates are widely used, who argue that, by facilitating health monitoring and preventing aggression, crates lead to lower sow mortality and higher piglet outputs per sow. We address these claims by comparing sow mortality and performance across countries with different housing systems. Methods: To this end, we use publicly available data from InterPig, a network of pig production economists in 17 countries that provides internationally harmonized methods for meaningful comparisons of national production data. Results: The results show that sow mortality is significantly higher, and annual pig production per sow significantly lower, in those countries where gestation crates are still the norm compared to countries in the European Union, where use of gestation crates is restricted to up to four weeks after insemination. Conclusions: Claims of higher mortality and reduced productivity per sow in crate-free systems are not substantiated by this data. This evidence should be considered in policies affecting the welfare of breeding pigs.

Damasceno et al. demonstrate that STING activation induces a non-pathogenic TH17 profile. Mechanistically, STING impairs Rorγt-mediated Il17a transcription, thereby reducing IL-17A production. Besides that, STING activation promotes IL-10 expression through AhR signaling pathway.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Oxygen level regulates N-terminal translation elongation of selected proteins through deoxyhypusine hydroxylation</a></h4>

              
                Cells have to regulate their metabolism in response to oxygen levels. Zhang et al. find that oxygen regulates hydroxylation of translation factor eIF5A in yeast. Hydroxylation promotes translation of the N termini of many proteins essential for cell survival in the presence of oxygen in a proline-independent manner.

By generating a proteomic resource, they identify conserved protein-level programs of neurodevelopment and highlight a potential role of RUVBL2 in maintaining integrity of the neural stem cell compartment in organoids.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Regional opportunities for tundra conservation in the next 1000 years</a></h4>

              
                The biodiversity of tundra areas in northern high latitudes is threatened by invasion of forests under global warming. However, poorly understood nonlinear responses of the treeline ecotone mean the timing and extent of tundra losses are unclear, but policymakers need such information to optimize conservation efforts. Our individual-based model LAVESI, developed for the Siberian tundra-taiga ecotone, can help improve our understanding. Consequently, we simulated treeline migration trajectories until the end of the millennium, causing a loss of tundra area when advancing north. Our simulations reveal that the treeline follows climate warming with a severe, century-long time lag, which is overcompensated by infilling of stands in the long run even when temperatures cool again. Our simulations reveal that only under ambitious mitigation strategies (relative concentration pathway 2.6) will ∼30% of original tundra areas remain in the north but separated into two disjunct refugia.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Spatial signatures of anesthesia-induced burst-suppression differ between primates and rodents</a></h4>

              
                During deep anesthesia, the electroencephalographic (EEG) signal of the brain alternates between bursts of activity and periods of relative silence (suppressions). The origin of burst-suppression and its distribution across the brain remain matters of debate. In this work, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to map the brain areas involved in anesthesia-induced burst-suppression across four mammalian species: humans, long-tailed macaques, common marmosets, and rats. At first, we determined the fMRI signatures of burst-suppression in human EEG-fMRI data. Applying this method to animal fMRI datasets, we found distinct burst-suppression signatures in all species. The burst-suppression maps revealed a marked inter-species difference: in rats, the entire neocortex engaged in burst-suppression, while in primates most sensory areas were excluded—predominantly the primary visual cortex. We anticipate that the identified species-specific fMRI signatures and whole-brain maps will guide future targeted studies investigating the cellular and molecular mechanisms of burst-suppression in unconscious states.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Slow fluctuations in ongoing brain activity decrease in amplitude with ageing yet their impact on task-related evoked responses is dissociable from behavior</a></h4>

              
                In humans, ageing is characterized by decreased brain signal variability and increased behavioral variability. To understand how reduced brain variability segregates with increased behavioral variability, we investigated the association between reaction time variability, evoked brain responses and ongoing brain signal dynamics, in young (N=36) and older adults (N=39). We studied the electroencephalogram (EEG) and pupil size fluctuations to characterize the cortical and arousal responses elicited by a cued go/no-go task. Evoked responses were strongly modulated by slow (&lt;2 Hz) fluctuations of the ongoing signals, which presented reduced power in the older participants. Although variability of the evoked responses was lower in the older participants, once we adjusted for the effect of the ongoing signal fluctuations, evoked responses were equally variable in both groups. Moreover, the modulation of the evoked responses caused by the ongoing signal fluctuations had no impact on reaction time, thereby explaining why although ongoing brain signal variability is decreased in older individuals, behavioral variability is not. Finally, we showed that adjusting for the effect of the ongoing signal was critical to unmask the link between neural responses and behavior as well as the link between task-related evoked EEG and pupil responses.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Social-affective features drive human representations of observed actions</a></h4>

              
                Humans observe actions performed by others in many different visual and social settings. What features do we extract and attend when we view such complex scenes, and how are they processed in the brain? To answer these questions, we curated two large-scale sets of naturalistic videos of everyday actions and estimated their perceived similarity in two behavioral experiments. We normed and quantified a large range of visual, action-related and social-affective features across the stimulus sets. Using a cross-validated variance partitioning analysis, we found that social-affective features predicted similarity judgments better than, and independently of, visual and action features in both behavioral experiments. Next, we conducted an electroencephalography (EEG) experiment, which revealed a sustained correlation between neural responses to videos and their behavioral similarity. Visual, action, and social-affective features predicted neural patterns at early, intermediate and late stages respectively during this behaviorally relevant time window. Together, these findings show that social-affective features are important for perceiving naturalistic actions, and are extracted at the final stage of a temporal gradient in the brain.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A cellular and molecular analysis of SoxB-driven neurogenesis in a cnidarian</a></h4>

              
                Neurogenesis is the generation of neurons from stem cells, a process that is regulated by SoxB transcription factors (TFs) in many animals. Although the roles of these TFs are well understood in bilaterians, how their neural function evolved is unclear. Here, we use <i>Hydractinia symbiolongicarpus</i>, a member of the early-branching phylum Cnidaria, to provide insight into this question. Using a combination of mRNA <i>in situ</i> hybridization, transgenesis, gene knockdown, transcriptomics, and <i>in-vivo</i> imaging, we provide a comprehensive molecular and cellular analysis of neurogenesis during embryogenesis, homeostasis, and regeneration in this animal. We show that SoxB genes act sequentially at least in some cases. Stem cells expressing <i>Piwi1</i> and <i>Soxb1</i>, which have a broad developmental potential, become neural progenitors that express <i>Soxb2</i> before differentiating into mature neural cells. Knockdown of SoxB genes resulted in complex defects in embryonic neurogenesis. <i>Hydractinia</i> neural cells differentiate while migrating from the aboral to the oral end of the animal, but it is unclear whether migration per se or exposure to different microenvironments is the main driver of their fate determination. Our data constitute a rich resource for studies aiming at addressing this question, which is at the heart of understanding the origin and development of animal nervous systems.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Differential ion dehydration energetics explains selectivity in the non-canonical lysosomal K+ channel TMEM175</a></h4>

              
                Structures of the human lysosomal K<sup>+</sup> channel transmembrane protein 175 (TMEM175) in open and closed states revealed a novel architecture lacking the canonical K<sup>+</sup> selectivity filter motif present in previously known K<sup>+</sup> channel structures. A hydrophobic constriction composed of four isoleucine residues was resolved in the pore and proposed to serve as the gate in the closed state, and to confer ion selectivity in the open state. Here, we achieve higher-resolution structures of the open and closed states and employ molecular dynamics simulations to analyze the conducting properties of the putative open state, demonstrating that it is permeable to K<sup>+</sup> and, to a lesser degree, also Na<sup>+</sup>. Both cations must dehydrate significantly to penetrate the narrow hydrophobic constriction, but ion flow is assisted by a favorable electrostatic field generated by the protein that spans the length of the pore. The balance of these opposing energetic factors explains why permeation is feasible, and why TMEM175 is selective for K<sup>+</sup> over Na<sup>+</sup>, despite the absence of the canonical selectivity filter. Accordingly, mutagenesis experiments reveal an exquisite sensitivity of the channel to perturbations that mitigate the constriction. Together, these data reveal a novel mechanism for selective permeation of ions by TMEM175 that is unlike that of other K<sup>+</sup> channels.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Magnetic stimulation allows focal activation of the mouse cochlea</a></h4>

              
                Cochlear implants (CIs) provide sound and speech sensations for patients with severe to profound hearing loss by electrically stimulating the auditory nerve. While most CI users achieve some degree of open set word recognition under quiet conditions, hearing that utilizes complex neural coding (e.g., appreciating music) has proved elusive, probably because of the inability of CIs to create narrow regions of spectral activation. Several novel approaches have recently shown promise for improving spatial selectivity, but substantial design differences from conventional CIs will necessitate much additional safety and efficacy testing before clinical viability is established. Outside the cochlea, magnetic stimulation from small coils (micro-coils) has been shown to confine activation more narrowly than that from conventional micro-electrodes, raising the possibility that coil-based stimulation of the cochlea could improve the spectral resolution of CIs. To explore this, we delivered magnetic stimulation from micro-coils to multiple locations of the cochlea and measured the spread of activation utilizing a multi-electrode array inserted into the inferior colliculus; responses to magnetic stimulation were compared to analogous experiments with conventional micro-electrodes as well as to responses when presenting auditory monotones. Encouragingly, the extent of activation with micro-coils was ~60% narrower compared to electric stimulation and largely similar to the spread arising from acoustic stimulation. The dynamic range of coils was more than three times larger than that of electrodes, further supporting a smaller spread of activation. While much additional testing is required, these results support the notion that magnetic micro-coil CIs can produce a larger number of independent spectral channels and may therefore improve auditory outcomes. Further, because coil-based devices are structurally similar to existing CIs, fewer impediments to clinical translational are likely to arise.

                Background: Constitutive knockout of the obsessive-compulsive disorder-associated protein, disks large associated protein 3 (SAPAP3), results in repetitive motor dysfunction, such as excessive grooming, caused by increased metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) activity in striatal direct- and indirect pathway medium spiny neurons (dMSNs and iMSNs, respectively). However, MSN subtype-specific signaling mechanisms that mediate mGluR5-dependent adaptations underlying excessive grooming are not fully understood. Here, we investigate the MSN subtype-specific roles of the striatal signaling hub protein, spinophilin, in mediating repetitive motor dysfunction associated with mGluR5 function. Methods: Quantitative proteomics and immunoblotting were utilized to identify how spinophilin impacts mGluR5 phosphorylation and protein interaction changes. Plasticity and repetitive motor dysfunction associated with mGluR5 action was measured using our novel conditional spinophilin mouse model that had spinophilin knocked out from striatal dMSNs or/and iMSNs. Results: Loss of spinophilin only in iMSNs decreased performance of a novel motor repertoire, but loss of spinophilin in either MSN subtype abrogated striatal plasticity associated with mGluR5 function and prevented excessive grooming caused by SAPAP3 knockout mice and treatment with the mGluR5-specific positive allosteric modulator (VU0360172) without impacting locomotion-relevant behavior. Biochemically, we determined spinophilin's protein interaction correlates with grooming behavior and loss of spinophilin shifts mGluR5 interactions from lipid-raft associated proteins toward postsynaptic density (PSD) proteins implicated in psychiatric disorders. Conclusions: These results identify spinophilin as a novel striatal signaling hub molecule in MSNs that cell subtype-specifically mediates behavioral, functional, and molecular adaptations associated with repetitive motor dysfunction in psychiatric disorders.

                The external globus pallidus (Gpe) is an essential component of the basal ganglia, a group of subcortical nuclei that are involved in control of action. Changes in the firing of GPe neurons are associated with both passive and active body movements. Aberrant activity of GPe neurons has been linked to motor symptoms of a variety of movement disorders, such as Parkinson's Disease, Huntington's disease and dystonia. Recent studies have helped delineate functionally distinct subtypes of GABAergic GPe projection neurons. However, little remains known about specific molecular mechanisms underlying the development of GPe neuronal subtypes. We show that the transcriptional regulator Lmo3 is required for the development of medial ganglionic eminence derived Nkx2.1+ and PV+ GPe neurons, but not FoxP2+ neurons or Npas1+ neurons. As a consequence of the reduction in PV+ neurons, Lmo3-null mice have a reduced pallidal input to the subthalamic nucleus.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The LEGO theory of the developing functional connectome</a></h4>

              
                Decades of human magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) research demonstrate that variance in neuroimaging phenotypes, including functional connectivity, relate to genetics1-5 and predict cognitive traits6-9. The functional connectome affords information transmission through the brain at various spatial scales, from global oscillations between broad cortical regions to fine-scale connections that underlie specific information processing10,11. In adults, while both the coarse- and fine-scale functional connectomes predict cognition6,12-14, the fine-scale connectome predicts twice as much cognitive variance15. Yet, past brain-wide association studies, particularly using large developmental samples, have limited their focus to the coarse connectome to understand the neural underpinnings of individual differences in cognition8,9,16-18. We studied resting-state fMRI in 1,115 children (including 389 twin pairs) and used functional alignment to afford access to individual differences in the fine-scale connectome10,19,20. We found that even though individual differences in the fine-scale connectome are more reliable than those in the coarse-scale connectome, they are less heritable. This surprising result indicates that genetically-determined versus experience-dependent factors in brain development have dissociable effects on these two spatial scales of the connectome. We show further that both connectome scales equally predict a more heritable trait (general cognitive ability) in childhood, but only the fine scale effectively predicts a more experience-driven trait (learning/memory). As such, the developing functional connectome resembles a LEGO set: the specific pieces a child has parameterizes what they will eventually build, but even when given identical sets, two children with unique experiences will build different creations.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Alcohol reverses the effects of KCNJ6 (GIRK2) noncoding variants on excitability of human glutamatergic neurons</a></h4>

              
                Synonymous and noncoding single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the KCNJ6 gene, encoding G protein-gated inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK2) channel subunit 2, have been linked with increased electroencephalographic frontal theta event-related oscillations (ERO) in subjects diagnosed with alcohol use disorder (AUD). To identify molecular and cellular mechanisms while retaining the appropriate genetic background, we generated induced excitatory glutamatergic neurons (iN) from iPSCs derived from four AUD-diagnosed subjects with KCNJ6 variants (Affected: AF) and four control subjects without variants (Unaffected: UN). Neurons were analyzed for changes in gene expression, morphology, excitability and physiological properties. Single cell RNA sequencing suggests that KCNJ6 AF variant neurons have altered patterns of synaptic transmission and cell projection morphogenesis. Results confirm that AF neurons express lower levels of GIRK2, have greater neurite area, and elevated excitability. Interestingly, exposure to intoxicating concentrations of ethanol induces GIRK2 expression and reverses functional effects in AF neurons. Ectopic overexpression of GIRK2 alone mimics the effect of ethanol to normalize induced excitability. We conclude that KCNJ6 variants decrease GIRK2 expression and increase excitability and that this effect can be minimized or reduced with ethanol.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A partially averaged system to model neuron responses to interferential current stimulation</a></h4>

              
                The interferential current (IFC) therapy is a noninvasive electrical neurostimulation technique intended to activate deep neurons using surface electrodes. In IFC, two independent kilohertz-frequency currents purportedly intersect where an interference field is generated. However, the effects of IFC on neurons within and outside the interference field are not completely understood, and it is unclear whether this technique can reliable activate deep target neurons without side effects. In recent years, realistic computational models of IFC have been introduced to quantify the effects of IFC on brain cells, but they are often complex and computationally costly. Here, we introduce a simplified model of IFC based on the FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) model of a neuron. By considering a modified averaging method, we obtain a non-autonomous approximated system, with explicit representation of relevant IFC parameters. For this approximated system we determine conditions under which it reliably approximates the complete FHN system under IFC stimulation, and we mathematically prove its ability to predict nonspiking states. In addition, we perform numerical simulations that show that the interference effect is observed only for a narrow set of IFC parameters and, in particular, for a beat frequency no higher than about 100 [Hz]. Our novel model tailored to the IFC technique contributes to the understanding of neurostimulation modalities using this type of signals, and can have implications in the design of noninvasive electrical stimulation therapies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Estimation of Periodic Signals with Applications to Deep Brain Stimulation</a></h4>

              
                Deep brain stimulation (DBS) therapies have shown clinical success in the treatment of a number of neurological illnesses, including obsessive-compulsive disorder, depression, and Parkinson's disease. An emerging strategy for increasing the efficacy of DBS therapies is to develop closed-loop, adaptive DBS systems that can sense biomarkers associated with particular symptoms and in response, adjust DBS parameters in real-time. The development of such systems requires extensive analysis of the underlying neural signals while DBS is on, so that candidate biomarkers can be identified and the effects of varying the DBS parameters can be better understood. However, DBS creates high amplitude, high frequency stimulation artifacts that prevent the underlying neural signals and thus the biological mechanisms underlying DBS from being analyzed. Additionally, DBS devices often require low sampling rates, which alias the artifact frequency, and rely on wireless data transmission methods that can create signal recordings with missing data of unknown length. Thus, traditional artifact removal methods cannot be applied to this setting. We present a novel periodic artifact removal algorithm for DBS applications that can accurately remove stimulation artifacts in the presence of missing data and in some cases where the stimulation frequency exceeds the Nyquist frequency. The numerical examples suggest that, if implemented on dedicated hardware, this algorithm has the potential to be used in embedded closed-loop DBS therapies to remove DBS stimulation artifacts and hence, to aid in the discovery of candidate biomarkers in real-time. Code for our proposed algorithm is publicly available on Github.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Perceptual decisions exhibit hallmarks of dynamic Bayesian inference</a></h4>

              
                To interpret the sensory environment, the brain combines ambiguous sensory measurements with context-specific prior experience. But environmental contexts can change abruptly and unpredictably, resulting in uncertainty about the current context. Here we address two questions: how should context-specific prior knowledge optimally guide the interpretation of sensory stimuli in changing environments, and do human decision-making strategies resemble this optimum? We probe these questions with a task in which subjects report the orientation of ambiguous visual stimuli that were drawn from three dynamically switching distributions, representing different environmental contexts. We derive predictions for an ideal Bayesian observer that leverages the statistical structure of the task to maximize decision accuracy and show that its decisions are biased by task context. The magnitude of this decision bias is not a fixed property of the sensory measurement but depends on the observer's belief about the current context. The model therefore predicts that decision bias will grow with the reliability of the context cue, the stability of the environment, and with the number of trials since the last context switch. Analysis of human choice data validates all three predictions, providing evidence that the brain continuously updates probabilistic representations of the environment to best interpret an uncertain, ever-changing world.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Midfrontal theta is associated with errors, but no evidence for a link with error-related memory</a></h4>

              
                Midfrontal theta is widely observed in situations with increased demand for cognitive control, such as monitoring response errors. It also plays an important role in the cognitive control involved in memory, supporting processes like the binding of single items into a memory representation or encoding contextual information. In the current study, we explored the link between midfrontal theta and error-related memory. To this end, we recorded EEG from 31 participants while they performed a modified Flanker task. Their memory for the errors made during the task was assessed after each experimental block, and its relationship with error-related midfrontal theta effects was investigated. We have replicated the error-related increase in midfrontal theta power, reported in previous literature. However, this error-related theta effect could not predict subsequent memory of the committed errors. Our findings add to a growing literature on the prefrontal cortex-guided control process in error monitoring and episodic memory.

                Motor simulation interventions involving motor imagery (MI) and action observation (AO) have received considerable interest in the behavioral sciences. A growing body of research has focused on using AO and MI simultaneously, termed combined action observation and motor imagery (AOMI). The current meta-analysis collated and synthesized existing motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitude data from transcranial magnetic stimulation studies and movement outcome data from behavioral studies to quantify changes in corticospinal excitability and motor skill performance for AOMI compared to AO, MI and control conditions. AOMI had a medium positive effect on MEP amplitudes compared to all three conditions. However, for movement outcome data, AOMI had a small to medium positive effect compared to control, but no effect compared to AO and MI conditions. The timing and intensity of transcranial magnetic stimulation moderated facilitation of corticospinal excitability during AOMI, whereas self-reported kinesthetic imagery ability moderated the effects of AOMI on movement outcomes. The results of this meta-analysis are discussed in relation to existing literature on motor simulation and skill acquisition. The limitations within the current literature on AOMI are considered, before providing viable directions for future research on this topic.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Spontaneous object exploration in a recessive gene knockout model of Parkinson's disease: Development and progression of object recognition memory deficits in male Pink1-/- rats.</a></h4>

              
                Cognitive impairments appear at or before motor signs in about one third of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and have a cumulative prevalence of roughly 80% overall. These deficits exact an unrelenting toll on patients' quality and activities of daily life due in part to a lack of available treatments to ameliorate them. This study used three well-validated novel object recognition-based paradigms to explore the suitability of rats with knockout of the PTEN-induced putative kinase1 gene (Pink1) for investigating factors that induce cognitive decline in PD and for testing new ways to mitigate them. Longitudinal testing of rats from three to nine months of age revealed significant impairments in male Pink1-/- rats compared to wild type controls in Novel Object Recognition, Novel Object Location and Object-in-Place tasks. Task-specific differences in the progression of object discrimination/memory deficits across age were also seen. Finally, testing using an elevated plus maze, a tapered balance beam and a grip strength gauge showed that in all cases recognition memory deficits preceded potentially confounding impacts of gene knockout on affect or motor function. Taken together, these findings suggest that knockout of the Pink1 gene negatively impacts the brain circuits and/or neurochemical systems that support performance in object recognition tasks. Further investigations using Pink1-/- rats and object recognition memory tasks should provide new insights into the neural underpinnings of the visual recognition memory and visuospatial information processing deficits that are often seen in PD patients and accelerate the pace of discovery of better ways to treat them.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Video-based automated analysis of MDS-UPDRS III parameters in Parkinson disease</a></h4>

              
                Background: Among motor symptoms of Parkinson disease (PD), including rigidity and resting tremor, bradykinesia is a mandatory feature to define the parkinsonian syndrome. MDS-UPDRS III is the worldwide reference scale to evaluate the parkinsonian motor impairment, especially bradykinesia. However, MDS-UPDRS III constitutes an agent-based score making reproducible measurements and follow-up challenging. Objectives: Using a deep learning approach, we developed a tool to compute an objective score of bradykinesia based on the gold-standard MDS-UPDRS III. Methods: In the Movement Disorder unit of Avicenne University Hospital, we acquired a large database of videos of parkinsonian patients performing MDS-UPDRS III protocols. We applied two deep learning algorithms to detect a two-dimensional (2D) skeleton of the hand composed of 21 predefined points, and transposed it into a three-dimensional (3D) skeleton. Results: We developed a 2D and 3D automated analysis tool to study the evolution of several key parameters during the protocol repetitions of the MDS-UPDRS III. Scores from 2D automated analysis showed a significant correlation with gold-standard ratings of MDS-UPDRS III, measured with coefficients of determination for the tapping (0.609) and hand movements (0.701) protocols using decision tree algorithms. The individual correlations of the different parameters measured with MDS-UPDRS III scores carry meaningful information and are consistent with MDS-UPDRS III guidelines. Conclusion: We developed a deep learning-based tool to reliably score and analyze bradykinesia for parkinsonian patients.

                Avoiding potentially harmful, and consuming safe food is crucial for the survival of living organisms. However, sensory information can change its valence following conflicting experiences. Novelty and aversiveness are the two crucial parameters defining the currently perceived valence of taste. Importantly, the ability of a given taste to serve as CS in conditioned taste aversion (CTA) is dependent on its valence. Activity in anterior insula (aIC) layer IV-VI pyramidal neurons projecting to the basolateral amygdala (BLA) is correlative and necessary for CTA learning and retrieval, as well as the expression of neophobia towards novel tastants, but not learning taste familiarity. Yet, the cellular mechanisms underlying the updating of taste valence representation in this specific pathway are poorly understood. Here, using retrograde viral tracing and whole cell patch-clamp electrophysiology in trained mice, we demonstrate that the intrinsic properties of deep-lying layer IV-VI, but not superficial layer I-III aIC-BLA neurons, are differentially modulated by both novelty and valence, reflecting the subjective predictability of taste valence arising from prior experience. These correlative changes in the profile of intrinsic properties of LIV-VI aIC-BLA neurons were detectable following both simple taste experiences, as well as following memory retrieval, extinction learning and reinstatement.

                Background Most studies on stroke have been designed to examine one deficit in isolation, yet survivors often have multiple deficits in different domains. While the mechanisms underlying multiple-domain deficits remain poorly understood, network-theoretical methods may open new avenues of understanding. Methods 50 subacute stroke patients (7+/-3days post-stroke) underwent diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging and a battery of clinical tests of motor and cognitive functions. We defined indices of impairment in strength, dexterity, and attention. We also computed imaging-based probabilistic tractography and whole brain connectomes. Overlaying individual lesion masks onto the tractograms enabled us to split the connectomes into their affected and unaffected parts and associate them to impairment. Results To efficiently integrate inputs from different sources, brain networks rely on a "rich-club" of a few hub nodes. Lesions harm efficiency, particularly when they target the rich-club. We computed efficiency of the unaffected connectome, and found it was more strongly correlated to impairment in strength, dexterity and attention than efficiency of the total connectome. The magnitude of the correlation between efficiency and impairment followed the order attention > dexterity ~ strength. Network weights associated with the rich-club were more strongly correlated to efficiency than non-rich-club weights. Conclusions Attentional impairment is more sensitive to disruption of coordinated network activity between brain regions than motor impairment, which is sensitive to disruption of localized network activity. Providing more accurate reflections of actually functioning parts of the network enables the incorporation of information about the impact of brain lesions on connectomics contributing to a better understanding of underlying stroke mechanisms.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural mechanisms underlying distractor suppression guided by spatial cues</a></h4>

              
                A growing body of research demonstrates that distracting inputs can be proactively suppressed via spatial cues, nonspatial cues, or experience, which are governed by more than one top-down mechanism of attention. However, how the neural mechanisms underlying spatial distractor cues guide proactive suppression of distracting inputs remains unresolved. Here, we recorded electroencephalography signals from 110 subjects in three experiments to identify the role of alpha activity in proactive distractor suppression induced by spatial cues and its influence on subsequent distractor inhibition. Behaviorally, we found novel spatial changes in spatial distractor cues: cueing distractors far away from the target improves search performance for the target while cueing distractors close to the target hampers performance. Crucially, we found dynamic characteristics of spatial representation for distractor suppression during anticipation. This result was further verified by alpha power increased relatively contralateral to the cued distractor. At both the between- and within-subjects levels, we found that these activities further predicted the decrement of subsequent PD component, which was indicative of reduced distractor interference. Moreover, anticipatory alpha activity and its link with subsequent PD component were specific to the high predictive validity of distractor cue. Together, these results provide evidence for the existence of proactive suppression mechanisms of spatial distractors, support the role of alpha activity as gating by proactive suppression and reveal the underlying neural mechanisms by which cueing the spatial distractor may contribute to reduced distractor interference.

                Ventral visual cortex contains regions of selectivity for domains of ecological importance. Food is an ecologically and evolutionarily important category, whose high degree of visual variability may make the identification of selectivity more challenging. We investigated neural responsiveness to food using natural images combined with large-scale human neuroimaging. Leveraging the improved sensitivity of modern designs and statistical analysis methods, we identified two food-selective regions in the ventral visual cortex. Our results were robust across 8 subjects, multiple independent sets of images and multiple analysis methods. Additionally, these results were not due to stimulus properties or saliency. The identification of food-selective regions stands alongside prior findings of functional selectivity and provides an important addition to our understanding of the organization of knowledge within the human visual system.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Altered dynamical integration/segregation balance during anesthesia-induced loss of consciousness</a></h4>

              
                In recent years, brain imaging studies have begun to shed light on the neural correlates of physiologically-reversible altered states of consciousness such as deep sleep, anesthesia, psychedelic experiences. The emerging consensus is that normal waking consciousness requires the exploration of a dynamical repertoire enabling both global integration i.e. long-distance interactions between brain regions, and segregation, i.e. local processing in functionally specialized clusters. Altered states of consciousness have notably been characterized by a tipping of the integration/segregation balance away from this equilibrium. Historically, functional MRI (fMRI) has been the modality of choice for such investigations. However, fMRI does not enable characterization of the integration/segregation balance at sub-second temporal resolution. Here, we investigated global brain spatiotemporal patterns in electrocorticography (ECoG) data of a monkey (Macaca fuscata) under either ketamine or propofol general anaesthesia. We first studied the effects of these anesthetics from the perspective of band-specific synchronization across the entire ECoG array, treating individual channels as oscillators. We further aimed to determine whether synchrony within spatially localized clusters of oscillators was differently affected by the drugs in comparison to synchronization over spatially distributed subsets of ECoG channels, thereby quantifying changes in integration/segregation balance on physiologically-relevant time scales. The findings reflect global brain dynamics characterized by a loss of long-range integration in multiple frequency bands under both ketamine and propofol anaesthesia, most pronounced in the beta (13-30Hz) and low-gamma bands (30-80Hz), and with strongly preserved local synchrony in all bands.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Brain Serotonergic Fibers Suggest Anomalous Diffusion-Based Dropout in Artificial Neural Networks</a></h4>

              
                Random dropout has become a standard regularization technique in artificial neural networks (ANNs), but it is currently unknown whether an analogous mechanism exists in biological neural networks (BioNNs). If it does, its structure is likely to be optimized by hundreds of millions of years of evolution, which may suggest novel dropout strategies in large-scale ANNs. We propose that the brain serotonergic fibers meet some of the expected criteria because of their ubiquitous presence, stochastic structure, and ability to grow throughout the individual's lifespan. Since the trajectories of serotonergic fibers can be modeled as paths of anomalous diffusion processes, in this proof-of-concept study we investigated a dropout algorithm based on the superdiffusive fractional Brownian motion (FBM). This research contributes to biologically-inspired regularization in ANNs.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Unique Effects of Sedatives, Dissociatives, Psychedelics, Stimulants, and Cannabinoids on Episodic Memory: A Review and Reanalysis of Acute Drug Effects on Recollection, Familiarity, and Metamemory</a></h4>

              
                Despite distinct classes of psychoactive drugs producing putatively unique states of consciousness, there is surprising overlap in terms of their effects on episodic memory and cognition more generally. Episodic memory is supported by multiple subprocesses that have been mostly overlooked in psychopharmacology and could differentiate drug classes. Here, we reanalyzed episodic memory confidence data from 10 previously published datasets (28 drug conditions total) using signal detection models to estimate 2 conscious states involved in episodic memory and 1 consciously-controlled metacognitive process of memory: the retrieval of specific details from one's past (recollection), noetic recognition in the absence of retrieved details (familiarity), and accurate introspection of memory decisions (metamemory). We observed that sedatives, dissociatives, psychedelics, stimulants, and cannabinoids had unique patterns of effects on these mnemonic processes dependent on which phase of memory (encoding, consolidation, or retrieval) was targeted. All drugs at encoding except stimulants impaired recollection, and sedatives, dissociatives, and cannabinoids at encoding impaired familiarity. The effects of sedatives on metamemory were mixed, whereas dissociatives and cannabinoids at encoding tended to enhance metamemory. Surprisingly, psychedelics at encoding tended to enhance familiarity and did not impact metamemory. Stimulants at encoding and retrieval enhanced metamemory, but at consolidation, they impaired metamemory. Together, these findings may have relevance to mechanisms underlying unique subjective phenomena under different drug classes, such as blackouts from sedatives or deja vu from psychedelics. This study provides a framework for interrogating drug effects within a domain of cognition beyond the global impairments on task performance typically reported in psychopharmacology.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Physical resilience in the brain: The effect of white matter disease on brain networks in cognitively normal older adults</a></h4>

              
                BACKGROUND: Physical resilience with age is considered a key feature of healthy aging, but current understanding of the neural contributions to resilience is limited. Additionally, few methods exist to identify physical resilience and observe the mechanisms through which resilience manifests. METHODS: To address these gaps, we used data from 189 participants from the Brain Networks and Mobility (B-NET) study who completed the short physical performance battery (SPPB) as well as its expanded version (eSPPB), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and functional MRI (fMRI). Functional brain networks were generated using graph theory methods. We grouped participants based on SPPB scores (<10=unhealthy & 10-12=healthy) and median splits of white matter hyperintensity volumes: Expected Healthy (EH: low WMH, healthy SPPB, n=81), Expected Impaired (EI: high WMH, unhealthy SPPB, n=42), Unexpected Healthy (UH: high WMH, healthy SPPB, n=53), and Unexpected Impaired (UI: low WMH, unhealthy SPPB, n=13). UH is considered the resilient group due to their maintained function despite elevated WMH burden. Continuous analyses assessed the relationships between network properties, mobility, and cognition. RESULTS: Higher SPPB scores were associated (p<0.01) with greater sensorimotor cortex community structure (SMN-CS) consistency. While no main effect of the resilience interaction term (SPPB*WMH) was found on SMN-CS, UH showed higher numbers of second-order connections between the SMN and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) than EI (p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Increased connectivity between SMN and ACC may be a marker of physical resilience within the brain.

	<p>The c-fos gene was first described as a proto-oncogene responsible for the induction of bone tumors. A few decades ago, activation of the protein product c-fos was reported in the brain after seizures and other noxious stimuli. Since then, multiple studies have used c-fos as a brain activity marker. Although it has been attributed to neurons, growing evidence demonstrates that c-fos expression in the brain may also include glial cells. In this review, we collect data showing that glial cells also express this proto-oncogene. We present evidence demonstrating that at least astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and microglia express this immediate early gene (IEG). Unlike neurons, whose expression changes used to be associated with depolarization, glial cells seem to express the c-fos proto-oncogene under the influence of proliferation, differentiation, growth, inflammation, repair, damage, plasticity, and other conditions. The collected evidence provides a complementary view of c-fos as an activity marker and urges the introduction of the glial cell perspective into brain activity studies. This glial cell view may provide additional information related to the brain microenvironment that is difficult to obtain from the isolated neuron paradigm. Thus, it is highly recommended that detection techniques are improved in order to better differentiate the phenotypes expressing c-fos in the brain and to elucidate the specific roles of c-fos expression in glial cells.</p>

	<p>Previous studies have demonstrated that when presented with a display of spatially arranged letters, participants seem to remember the letters&amp;amp;rsquo; locations when letters are the focus of a recognition test, but do not remember letters&amp;amp;rsquo; identity when locations are tested. This strong binding asymmetry suggests that encoding location may be obligatory when remembering letters, which requires explanation within theories of working memory. We report two studies in which participants focused either on remembering letters or locations for a short interval. At test, positive probes were either intact letter&amp;amp;ndash;location combinations or recombinations of an observed letter and another previously occupied location. Incidental binding is observed when intact probes are recognized more accurately or faster than recombined probes. Here, however, we observed no evidence of incidental binding of location to letter in either experiment, neither under conditions where participants focused on one feature exclusively for a block, nor where the to-be-remembered feature was revealed prior to encoding with a changing pre-cue, nor where the to-be-remembered feature was retro-cued and therefore unknown during encoding. Our results call into question the robustness of a strong, consistent binding asymmetry. They suggest that while incidental location-to-letter binding may sometimes occur, it is not obligatory.</p>

	<p>The general movements (GMs) assessment is useful for the prediction of cerebral palsy (CP) and other developmental disorders. Developmental coordination disorder (DCD) is highly prevalent in low-birth-weight (LBW) infants. We investigated the association between aberrant GMs during early infancy and later motor development in LBW infants. The study included infants who fulfilled the following criteria: GMs assessed at 9&amp;amp;ndash;20 weeks post-term age; developmental quotient (DQ) assessed at 3 years of age using the Kyoto Scale; intelligence quotient (IQ) assessed at 6 years of age. Participants with normal IQs at 6 years of age without a diagnosis of CP (14 males and 37 females, 23&amp;amp;ndash;36 weeks gestation with birth weights of 492&amp;amp;ndash;1498 g) were categorized into normal (n = 39) and aberrant (n = 12) groups based on GMs assessment; DQ was compared between the groups. We investigated the items in the DQ assessment and found that the infants in the aberrant group were more frequently unable to perform. Infants in the aberrant group showed a significantly lower DQ in the &amp;amp;lsquo;postural-motor domain&amp;amp;rsquo;, and were more frequently unable to &amp;amp;lsquo;climb the stairs with alternating legs&amp;amp;rsquo; and &amp;amp;lsquo;Jump from a 15&amp;amp;ndash;20 cm platform&amp;amp;rsquo;. This study highlights that GMs aberrancy in early infancy is associated with a delayed gross motor development, even in children with a typical development. The GMs assessment may be useful for the prediction of DCD.</p>

	<p>We investigate whether regionally-associated primes can affect speech perception in two lexical decision tasks in which New Zealand listeners were exposed to an Australian prime (a kangaroo), a New Zealand prime (a kiwi), and/or a control animal (a horse). The target stimuli involve ambiguous vowels, embedded in a frame that would result in a real word with a KIT or a DRESS vowel and a nonsense word with the alternative vowel; thus, lexical decision responses can reveal which vowel was heard. Our pre-registered design predicted that exposure to the kangaroo would elicit more KIT-consistent responses than exposure to the kiwi. Both experiments showed significant priming effects in which the kangaroo elicited more KIT-consistent responses than the kiwi. The particular locus and details of these effects differed across experiments and participants. Taken together, the experiments reinforce the finding that regionally-associated primes can affect speech perception, but also suggest that the effects are sensitive to experimental design, stimulus acoustics, and individuals&amp;amp;rsquo; production and past experience.</p>

	<p>Many people with psychiatric disorders experience impairments in cognition. These deficits have a significant impact on daily functioning and sometimes even on the further course of their disease. Cognitive remediation (CR) is used as an umbrella term for behavioral training interventions to ameliorate these deficits. In most but not all studies, CR has proven effective in improving cognition and enhancing everyday functional outcomes. In this paper, after quickly summarizing the empirical evidence, practical advice to optimize the effects of CR interventions is provided. We advocate that CR interventions should be as fun and motivating as possible, and therapists should at least consider using positively toned emotional stimuli instead of neutral stimuli. Participants should be screened for basic processing deficits, which should be trained before CR of higher-order cognitive domains. CR should stimulate metacognition and utilize natural settings to invoke social cognition. Wherever possible, CR tasks should link to tasks that participants face in their everyday life. Therapists should consider that participants might also benefit from positive side effects on symptomatology. Finally, the CR approach might even be utilized in settings where the treatment of cognitive impairments is not a primary target.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a rapidly progressive and fatal neurodegenerative disorder that affects upper and lower motor neurons; however, its pathomechanism has not been fully elucidated. Using a comprehensive phosphoproteomic approach, we have identified elevated phosphorylation of Collapsin response mediator protein 1 (Crmp1) at serine 522 in the lumbar spinal cord of ALS model mice overexpressing a human superoxide dismutase mutant (SOD1<sup>G93A</sup>). We investigated the effects of Crmp1 phosphorylation and depletion in <I>SOD1<sup>G93A</sup></I> mice using Crmp1<sup>S522A</sup> (Ser522-&gt;Ala) knock-in (<I>Crmp1<sup>k</sup></I><sup>i</sup><I><sup>/ki</sup></I>) mice in which the S522 phosphorylation site was abolished and <I>Crmp1</I> knock-out (<I>Crmp1</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup>) mice, respectively. <I>Crmp1<sup>ki</sup></I><sup>/</sup><I><sup>ki</sup></I>/<I>SOD1<sup>G93A</sup></I> mice showed longer latency to fall in a rotarod test while <I>Crmp1</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup>/<I>SOD1<sup>G93A</sup></I> mice showed shorter latency compared with <I>SOD1<sup>G93A</sup></I> mice. Survival was prolonged in <I>Crmp1<sup>ki</sup></I><sup>/</sup><I><sup>ki</sup></I>/<I>SOD1<sup>G93A</sup></I> mice but not in <I>Crmp1</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup>/<I>SOD1<sup>G93A</sup></I> mice. In agreement with these phenotypic findings, residual motor neurons and innervated neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) were comparatively well-preserved in <I>Crmp1<sup>ki</sup></I><sup>/</sup><I><sup>ki</sup></I>/<I>SOD1<sup>G93A</sup></I> mice without affecting microglial and astroglial pathology. Pathway analysis of proteome alterations showed that the sirtuin signaling pathway had opposite effects in <I>Crmp1<sup>ki</sup></I><sup>/</sup><I><sup>ki</sup></I>/<I>SOD1<sup>G93A</sup></I> and <I>Crmp1</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup>/<I>SOD1<sup>G93A</sup></I> mice. Our study indicates that modifying CRMP1 phosphorylation is a potential therapeutic strategy for ALS.</p>

                <p>by Nicole Pearcy, Marco Garavaglia, Thomas Millat, James P. Gilbert, Yoseb Song, Hassan Hartman, Craig Woods, Claudio Tomi-Andrino, Rajesh Reddy Bommareddy, Byung-Kwan Cho, David A. Fell, Mark Poolman, John R. King, Klaus Winzer, Jamie Twycross, Nigel P. Minton</p>

Exploiting biological processes to recycle renewable carbon into high value platform chemicals provides a sustainable and greener alternative to current reliance on petrochemicals. In this regard <i>Cupriavidus necator</i> H16 represents a particularly promising microbial chassis due to its ability to grow on a wide range of low-cost feedstocks, including the waste gas carbon dioxide, whilst also naturally producing large quantities of polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) during nutrient-limited conditions. Understanding the complex metabolic behaviour of this bacterium is a prerequisite for the design of successful engineering strategies for optimising product yields. We present a genome-scale metabolic model (GSM) of <i>C</i>. <i>necator</i> H16 (denoted <i>i</i>CN1361), which is directly constructed from the BioCyc database to improve the readability and reusability of the model. After the initial automated construction, we have performed extensive curation and both theoretical and experimental validation. By carrying out a genome-wide essentiality screening using a Transposon-directed Insertion site Sequencing (TraDIS) approach, we showed that the model could predict gene knockout phenotypes with a high level of accuracy. Importantly, we indicate how experimental and computational predictions can be used to improve model structure and, thus, model accuracy as well as to evaluate potential false positives identified in the experiments. Finally, by integrating transcriptomics data with <i>i</i>CN1361 we create a condition-specific model, which, importantly, better reflects PHB production in <i>C</i>. <i>necator</i> H16. Observed changes in the omics data and <i>in-silico</i>-estimated alterations in fluxes were then used to predict the regulatory control of key cellular processes. The results presented demonstrate that <i>i</i>CN1361 is a valuable tool for unravelling the system-level metabolic behaviour of <i>C</i>. <i>necator</i> H16 and can provide useful insights for designing metabolic engineering strategies.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Measuring the unknown: An estimator and simulation study for assessing case reporting during epidemics</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Christopher I. Jarvis, Amy Gimma, Flavio Finger, Tim P. Morris, Jennifer A. Thompson, Olivier le Polain de Waroux, W. John Edmunds, Sebastian Funk, Thibaut Jombart</p>

The fraction of cases reported, known as ‘reporting’, is a key performance indicator in an outbreak response, and an essential factor to consider when modelling epidemics and assessing their impact on populations. Unfortunately, its estimation is inherently difficult, as it relates to the part of an epidemic which is, by definition, not observed. We introduce a simple statistical method for estimating reporting, initially developed for the response to Ebola in Eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), 2018–2020. This approach uses transmission chain data typically gathered through case investigation and contact tracing, and uses the proportion of investigated cases with a known, reported infector as a proxy for reporting. Using simulated epidemics, we study how this method performs for different outbreak sizes and reporting levels. Results suggest that our method has low bias, reasonable precision, and despite sub-optimal coverage, usually provides estimates within close range (5–10%) of the true value. Being fast and simple, this method could be useful for estimating reporting in real-time in settings where person-to-person transmission is the main driver of the epidemic, and where case investigation is routinely performed as part of surveillance and contact tracing activities.

                Background: Participating in theater has been shown to be useful for reducing cognitive decline in older adults. This study focused on the social inclusion aspect of the performing arts and aimed to examine whether participation in the theater could help prevent dementia in older adults who are vulnerable to social exclusion. Methods: Our participants were 371 community-dwelling older adults who belonged to the Gold Arts Club organized by the Saitama Arts Theatre. The change in perceived stress levels after a month and a half of theater practice were compared between older adults with and without financial strain. Results: It was revealed that older adults with financial strain had a significantly greater reduction in perceived stress levels than those without financial strain after a month and a half of theater practice. Conclusions: Since stress is one of the risk factors for cognitive decline, the results of this study suggest that participation in theater may be an effective way of reducing cognitive decline associated with dementia in the older people who feel strained financially.

                Background: Scientific publication during medical training is key to promoting enduring cutting-edge knowledge. The promotion of science among medical students in Latin America is a multisectoral issue that is hampered by the lack of governmental knowledge to invest in national research, as well as by the lack of support from local universities. This study aims to determine the factors associated with the production of a scientific publication during medical training among Latin American medical students of local scientific societies. Methods: This is a secondary data analysis of a cross-sectional study conducted in 2016 that assessed the use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) among medical students from 40 local scientific societies of medical students affiliated with FELSOCEM. Teams from each local scientific society surveyed self-reported scientific publications and explored their association with socioeconomic, academic, and research training conditions. We applied nested models to identify the covariates associated with self-reported scientific publication, obtaining a parsimonious mixed-effects multilevel model grouped by medical scientific society. Results: Of 11,587 participants, the prevalence of scientific publications increased in 36% among medical students affiliated to a Scientific Society of Medical Students [parsimonious prevalence ratio (pPR)=1.36, 95%CI=1.16–1.59], 51% among medical students with advanced English proficiency [pPR=1.51, 95%CI=1.21 – 1.87], 85% among medical students who attended a scientific writing skills course [pPR=1.85, 95%CI=1.59–2.15], 81% among medical students who use Sci-Hub [pPR=1.81, 95%CI=1.50–2.20], and 108% among medical students who have access to a pirated academic account [pPR=2.08, 95%CI=1.83–2.36]. Conclusions: Producing a scientific publication among medical students is associated with being affiliated to a scientific society of medical students, English proficiency, training in scientific writing, use of Sci-Hub, and pirated academic accounts. The results will help clinical educators and medical programs improve resources for training students in high-quality research

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Post-industrial context of cassava bagasse and trend of studies towards a sustainable industry: A scoping review – Part I [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The cassava starch industry is recognized as a source of negative externalities caused by the agroindustrial waste ‘cassava bagasse’. Even though options for bioconversion of cassava bagasse have been introduced, it is also true that hundreds of tons of this waste are produced annually with the consequent negative environmental impact. This agroindustrial context highlights the need for further research in technological proposals aimed at lowering the water contained in cassava bagasse. Methods: We report a scoping review of studies from 2010–2021 that mention the uses of cassava bagasse, as well as the technological options that have become effective for drying fruits and vegetables. The method used for selecting articles was based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) method. Articles selected were taken from the databases of ScienceDirect, Google Scholar, Scopus and Springer. Results: This review highlights fruit and vegetable osmotic dehydration and drying studies assisted by the combination of emerging technologies of osmotic pressure, ultrasound, and electrical pulses. Studies that take advantage of cassava bagasse have focused on biotechnological products, animal and human food industry, and development of biofilms and biomaterials. Conclusions: In this review, we found 60 studies out of 124 that show the advantages of the residual components of cassava bagasse for the development of new products. These studies do not mention any potential use of bagasse fiber for post-industrial purposes, leaving this end products’ final use/disposal unaddressed. A viable solution is osmotic dehydration and drying assisted with electrical pulse and ultrasound that have been shown to improve the drying efficiency of fruits, vegetables and tubers. This greatly improves the drying efficiency of agro-industrial residues such as husks and bagasse, which in turn, directly impacts its post-industrial use.

                Background: It is of utmost importance for the elements that influence public compliance with vaccination against COVID-19 to be assessed, including misconceptions, rumors, and conspiracy theories. Hence, in this study, we aimed to estimate the distribution of the most common misconceptions regarding COVID-19 vaccines and their predictors in Saudi Arabia.   Methods: We distributed an online questionnaire to participants aged 18 years or older. The survey included two sections. The first section comprised questions related to participants’ demographic characteristics, level of education, and their sources of information about COVID-19. The second section assessed participants' perceptions regarding 11 of the most common misconceptions regarding COVID-19 vaccines, rated using a 5-point Likert scale. Using ordinal logistic regression, we conducted an evaluation of the relationships among different predictors including age, sex, educational level, and sources of information, as well as acceptance of misconceptions about vaccination.   Results: The most widely accepted misconception was that the COVID-19 vaccine had severe side effects, with 34.8% of participants believing this misinformation. Factors that were significantly associated with acceptance or non- acceptance of misconceptions were: 1) sex, with female respondents in this survey accepting rumors significantly more often than male respondents (p<0.001); 2) educational level, especially secondary school, was associated with a significantly lower acceptance of misconceptions (p=0.001). In total, 60.5% of participants used social media as their primary source of information, which was also a significant positive predictor of acceptance of misconceptions (p=0.034).   Conclusion: It is of critical importance to increase assurance regarding the safety of COVID-19 vaccines, the issue most likely to involve misconceptions, and to address the elements that affect belief in rumors among the population.

                Background: The simultaneous measurement of cellular proteins and transcriptomes of single cell data has become an exciting new possibility with the advent of highly multiplexed multi-omics methodologies. However, mass cytometry (CyTOF) is a well-established, affordable technique for the analysis of proteomic data, which is well suited for the discovery and characterisation of very rare subpopulations of cells with a wealth of publicly available datasets. Methods: We present and evaluate the multimodal integration of single cell RNA-Seq and CyTOF datasets coming from both matched and unmatched samples, using two publicly available datasets. Results: We demonstrate that the integration of well annotated CyTOF data with single cell RNA sequencing can aid in the identification and annotation of cell populations with high accuracy. Furthermore, we show that the integration can provide imputed measurements of protein markers which are comparable to the current gold standard of antibody derived tags (ADT) from CITE-Seq for both matched and unmatched datasets. Using this methodology, we identify and transcriptionally characterise a rare subpopulation of CD11c positive B cells in high resolution using publicly available data and we unravel its heterogeneity in a single cell setting without the need to sort the cells in advance, in a manner which had not been previously possible. Conclusions: This approach provides the framework for using available proteomic and transcriptomic datasets in a unified and unbiased fashion to assist ongoing and future studies of cellular characterisation and biomarker identification.

                Background: This study aims to examine public sector auditors' tendency to use somputer assisted audit techniques (CAATs) in managing their audit works. Methods: A total of 400 questionnaires were distributed to auditors working in the public sectors in Central Java, West Java, and East Java. From the total, 225 questionnaires were returned and completed.  The Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) and Partial Least Square (PLS) were used to analyze the data. Results: The empirical findings reveal that performance expectation and facilitating conditions have encouraged auditors to use CAATs in their works. Further, there is a positive influence between the intention to use and CAATs audit. This implies that auditors with an intention will be more open to using the CAATs optimally in achieving effective and efficient work. The utilization of CAATs in public services needs to have strong support from the government and positive attitudes from the auditors as the users of the system. Conclusion: This study covers broad areas of Central Java, West Java, and East Java. Further, the findings add to the literature on emerging markets specifically for Indonesian government auditors' intention and appropriateness of using CAATs. The use of CAATs help to provide auditors information on the highest number of auditees involved in corruption.

                Background: The extended embryo culture using single-step medium gained popularity in clinical in vitro fertilisation (IVF). However, there are concerns about the degradation of unstable medium components and their negative effects on the developing embryos. Further, dry-incubation can increase osmolality, which can in-turn enhance the concentration of constituents of the media and their stability. Hence, this study was conducted to understand the immediate changes in the culture media metabolites in relation to clinically comparable situations such as single-step extended embryo culture and use of dry and humidified-incubation in two-different gaseous conditions. Methods: Commercially available single-step medium was sham-cultured in droplets under oil in two different conditions viz. dry (37°C; 6%CO2; 5%O2) and humidified (37°C; 6% CO2; atmospheric O2) for 0h, 72h, and 120h intervals. Droplets were subjected to the sensitivity-enhanced nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based profiling using 800 MHz NMR equipped with a cryogenically cooled micro-coil (1.7mm) probe. Metabolomic signatures between the two groups were comprehensively assessed. Results: A total of ten amino acids and four energy substrates were identified from the culture medium. Metabolite levels showed a non-significant increase in the dry-incubation group at 72h and then declined at 120h. Humidified incubation had no effects on the level of the metabolite until 120h. No significant differences in the levels of metabolites were observed between the dry and humidified-groups at various time-points tested. Conclusions: A non-significant variation in the levels of metabolites observed in the dry-incubation of single-step medium most unlikely to influence a clinical outcome. However, the impact of these subtle changes on the (epi)genetic integrity of the embryos in a clinical set-up to be addressed.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">IL1B gene variants, but not TNF, CXCL8, IL6 and IL10, modify the course of cystic fibrosis in Polish patients. [version 2; peer review: 1 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The main aim of this study was to evaluate whether selected polymorphic variants in genes from the inflammatory pathway can be predictors of pulmonary or digestive manifestation of cystic fibrosis, as well as of severity of lung disease. Materials and methods: Using pyrosequencing and sequencing we have genotyped 12 variants in TNF (rs361525, rs1800629), CXCL8 (rs4073, rs2227306, rs2227307, rs188378669), IL1B (rs16944, rs1143634, rs1142639, rs1143627), IL6 (rs1800795) and IL10 (rs1800896) genes in a cohort of 55 Polish patients with diagnosed cystic fibrosis and controls. In our study group, a pulmonary manifestation of disease revealed 44 of subjects (80%), and digestive symptoms dominated in 11 (20%) of analyzed individuals. Severe lung dysfunction has occurred in 20 (36.4%) of patients. Results: We proved, that two promoter variants of IL1B, rs1143627 (c.-118G > A) and rs16944 (c.-598T > C) are presented significantly more often  in patients with severe character of lung disease compared to mild (82.5% vs. 62.8%, p-value 0.030, and 87.5% vs. 64.3%, p-value 0.008, respectively) in cystic fibrosis course. Haplotype AC formed by both changes had also a higher frequency (80%) in patients with severe course compared to the mild character (61.4%) of disease. However, the frequency of promoter variant TNF c.-308C > T (rs1800629) was presented at a significantly lower level in the patient’s group compared to healthy controls (2.7% vs. 15%, p-value 0.001). Furthermore, the presence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus significantly correlated with the lower FEV1% in patients (p-value 0.01). Conclusions: Genetic variants, rs1143627 and rs16944, of IL1B are promising candidates as predictors of the severe character of lung disease in Polish patients with cystic fibrosis.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">An empirical examination of customer advocacy influenced by engagement behaviour and predispositions of FinTech customers in India [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The extensive adoption and usage of emerging technologies furthered by the global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, has reduced direct face to face communications. New FinTech (financial technology) apps and technologies are flooding the Indian digital payments market and competitors are striving hard to attract and retain their customers. Especially when customer engagement behaviours (CEBs) are digital in nature, it is essential to gauge the intrinsically driven customer motivations which drive a positive CEB. The objective of this paper was to empirically test the influence of customer-based antecedents such as emotions, moral identity, self-concept, communal focus, perceived cost and perceived benefits on non-transactional experiential customer engagement behaviours (CEBs) and CEB’s effect on customer advocacy in the FinTech industry. Methods: Data from 380 financial app users in south India were gathered by administering a survey that captured customer predispositions, CEBs, and customer advocacy. Structural equation modelling (SEM) using smart PLS (partial least squares) 3.0 was applied to test the theoretical model. Results: Results indicate that CEB fully mediates the relationship between self-concept and customer advocacy. The positive CEBs get formed through customer predispositions leading to referral/advocacy behaviours. Conclusions: This paper provides directions for FinTech practitioners, marketers, technologists, and academicians to devise marketing strategies customized to customer needs and factors. This is one of the first research studies to demonstrate and empirically validate the CEB model for the FinTech industry during the COVID-19 pandemic.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A Machine Learning Approach to Predictive Modelling of Student Performance [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background - Many factors affect student performance such as the individual’s background, habits, absenteeism and social activities. Using these factors, corrective actions can be determined to improve their performance. This study looks into the effects of these factors in predicting student performance from a data mining approach. This study presents a data mining approach in identify significant factors and predict student performance, based on two datasets collected from two secondary schools in Portugal. Methods – In this study, two datasets  are augmented to increase the sample size by merging them.  Following that, data pre-processing is performed and the features are normalized with linear scaling to avoid bias on heavy weighted attributes.  The selected features are then assigned into four groups comprising of student background, lifestyle, history of grades and all features. Next, Boruta feature selection is performed to remove irrelevant features. Finally, the classification models of Support Vector Machine (SVM) , Naïve Bayes (NB) , and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)  origins are designed and their performances evaluated. Results - The models were trained and evaluated on an integrated dataset comprising 1044 student records with 33 features, after feature selection. The classification was performed with SVM, NB and MLP with 60-40 and 50-50 train-test splits and 10-fold cross validation. GridSearchCV was applied to perform hyperparameter tuning. The performance metrics were accuracy, precision, recall and F1-Score. SVM obtained the highest accuracy with scores of 77%, 80%, 91% and 90% on background, lifestyle, history of grades and all features respectively in 50-50 train-test splits for binary levels classification . SVM also obtained highest accuracy for five levels  classification  with 39%, 38%, 73% and 71% for the four categories respectively. The results show that the history of grades form significant influence on the student performance.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">ACE2 expression in saliva of patients with COVID-19 and its association with Candida albicans and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: A relationship between oral microbiota and susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection has been extensively studied. However, the relationship between oral commensal flora and expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) remains to be established. In this observational study, we collected saliva from patients with COVID-19 and evaluated the relationship between ACE2 expression and Candida albicans as well as with selected gram-negative bacteria (Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Veillonella parvula). We investigated how this may be directly or indirectly involved in oral dysbiosis in patients with COVID-19. Methods: We included 23 hospitalized patients admitted to Universitas Indonesia Hospital with PCR-confirmed COVID-19, with six healthy participants serving as controls. Saliva and tongue surface swabs were collected from patients with diabetes (DG) and without diabetes (NDG) and subject controls. Using quantitative PCR (qPCR) we assessed the mRNA expression of ACE2, the abundance of C. albicans, and the transcription levels of its biofilm-associated genes, agglutinin-like protein 3 (ALS3), hyphal wall protein 1 (HWP1), and yeast-form wall protein 1 (YWP1). We also counted the relative proportion of the three selected gram-negative oral bacteria in saliva. All analyses were performed to determine the relationship between ACE2 expression and C. albicans and gram-negative bacteria. Results: ACE2 mRNA expression was significantly higher in tongue swab samples than in saliva. However, no significant difference was observed between the patient groups. Conversely, DG patients had a significantly higher abundance of C. albicans in saliva compared to NDG patients and control group patients. The correlation and sensitivity/specificity relationship between ACE2 expression and C. albicans or the selected oral bacteria were also observed. Conclusions: The data show that ACE2 expression can be detected in saliva of patients with COVID-19 and its association with C. albicans and gram-negative oral bacteria might contribute toward developing an oral dysbiosis based predictor for prognosis of COVID-19 severity.

                Background Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a global problem and it is encountered both in community and in-hospital patients. AKI has caused very significant damage to the health sector with high morbidity and mortality rates as well as a financial burden to the family. AKI contributes to a 3% incidence of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Sepsis and hypovolemia-associated ischemia is the most common cause of AKI.  AKI has various risk factors, modes of presentation and outcomes. Also, the prevalence varies across the different populations. There is a paucity of data about the clinical profile of AKI in the eastern part of Nepal. This study aims to assess the age, comorbid conditions, the severity of AKI, mode of treatment, and outcome of patients with AKI admitted to the Nobel Medical College and Teaching Hospital, Biratnagar, Nepal. Methods This is a cross-sectional analytical study conducted at a Nobel Medical College Teaching Hospital, Biratnagar, Nepal from July 2018 to June 2019 AD. Results In this study, 192 patients diagnosed with AKI were included. Male patients accounted for 52.7%. The mean age was 48.6±18.73 years. Most of the patients (74.5%) were below <60 years of age.  The average duration of hospital stay was 8 days. The common cause of AKI was sepsis in 71.9%. Diabetes mellitus (DM) was seen in 52.6% of patients. Most of the patients (41%) were at stage III AKI at the time of admission. Hemodialysis was done in 14.6% and 85.4% were managed conservatively. Average sessions of hemodialysis were 3.61. Complete recovery was seen in 69.8% of the patients. Conclusions We observed that early diagnosis, avoidance of nephrotoxic agents, and early, aggressive, and appropriate interventions result in improved patient outcomes. However late presentations of AKI have a higher hospital mortality rate.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Genome of the lepidopleurid chiton Hanleya hanleyi (Mollusca, Polyplacophora) [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Mollusca is the second most species-rich phylum and includes animals as disparate as octopuses, clams, and chitons. Dozens of molluscan genomes are available, but only one representative of the subphylum Aculifera, the sister taxon to all other molluscs, has been sequenced to date, hindering comparative and evolutionary studies. To facilitate evolutionary studies across Mollusca, we sequenced the genome of a second aculiferan mollusc, the lepidopleurid chiton Hanleya hanleyi (Bean 1844), using a hybrid approach combining Oxford Nanopore and Illumina reads. After purging redundant haplotigs and removing contamination from this 1.3% heterozygous genome, we produced a 2.5 Gbp haploid assembly (>4X the size of the other chiton genome sequenced to date) with an N50 of 65.0 Kbp. Despite a fragmented assembly, the genome is rather complete (92.0% of BUSCOs detected; 79.4% complete plus 12.6% fragmented). Remarkably, the genome has the highest repeat content of any molluscan genome reported to date (>66%). Our gene annotation pipeline predicted 69,284 gene models (92.9% of BUSCOs detected; 81.8% complete plus 11.1% fragmented) of which 35,362 were supported by transcriptome and/or protein evidence. Phylogenomic analysis recovered Polyplacophora sister to all other sampled molluscs with maximal support. The Hanleya genome will be a valuable resource for studies of molluscan biology with diverse potential applications ranging from evolutionary and comparative genomics to molecular ecology.

     alt="Interspecific variation in sex-specific gustatory organs in Drosophila"/><p><i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> is a popular model for investigating how sex-specific sensory information is translated into sex-specific behavior. To provide an evolutionary context for these studies, this report shows that different <i>Drosophila</i> species vary extensively in the presence, number, locations, and morphology of sex-specific gustatory bristles on their legs.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p><i>Drosophila</i> males use leg gustatory bristles to discriminate between male and female cuticular pheromones as an important part of courtship behavior. In <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, several male-specific gustatory bristles are present on the anterior surface of the first tarsal segment of the prothoracic leg, in addition to a larger set of gustatory bristles found in both sexes. These bristles are thought to be specialized for pheromone detection. Here, we report the number and location of sex-specific gustatory bristles in 27 other <i>Drosophila</i> species. Although some species have a pattern similar to <i>D. melanogaster</i>, others lack anterior male-specific bristles but have many dorsal male-specific gustatory bristles instead. Some species have both anterior and dorsal male-specific bristles, while others lack sexual dimorphism entirely. In several distantly related species, the number of gustatory bristles is much greater in males than in females due to a male-specific transformation of ancestrally mechanosensory bristles to a chemosensory identity. This variation in the extent and pattern of sexual dimorphism may affect the formation and function of neuronal circuits that control <i>Drosophila</i> courtship and contribute to the evolution of mating behavior.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Little is known about the development of the human entorhinal cortex (EC), a major hub in a widespread network for learning and memory, spatial navigation, high-order processing of object information, multimodal integration, attention and awareness, emotion, motivation, and perception of time. We analyzed a series of 20 fetal and two adult human brains using Nissl stain, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) histochemistry, and immunocytochemistry for myelin basic protein (MBP), neuronal nuclei antigen (NeuN), a pan-axonal neurofilament marker, and synaptophysin, as well as postmortem 3T MRI. In comparison with other parts of the cerebral cortex, the cytoarchitectural differentiation of the EC begins remarkably early, in the 10th week of gestation (w.g.). The differentiation occurs in a superficial magnocellular layer in the deep part of the marginal zone, accompanied by cortical plate (CP) condensation and multilayering of the deep part of CP. These processes last until the 13–14th w.g. At 14 w.g., the superficial lamina dissecans (LD) is visible, which divides the CP into the lamina principalis externa (LPE) and interna (LPI). Simultaneously, the rostral LPE separates into vertical cell-dense islands, whereas in the LPI, the deep LD emerges as a clear acellular layer. In the 16th w.g., the LPE remodels into vertical cell-dense and cell-sparse zones with a caudorostral gradient. At 20 w.g., NeuN immunoreactivity is most pronounced in the islands of layer II cells, whereas migration and differentiation inside-out gradients are seen simultaneously in both the upper (LPE) and the lower (LPI) pyramidal layers. At this stage, the EC adopts for the first time an adult-like cytoarchitectural organization, the superficial LD becomes discernible by 3T MRI, MBP-expressing oligodendrocytes first appear in the fimbria and the perforant path (PP) penetrates the subiculum to reach its molecular layer and travels along through the Cornu Ammonis fields to reach the suprapyramidal blade of the dentate gyrus, whereas the entorhinal-dentate branch perforates the hippocampal sulcus about 2–3 weeks later. The first AChE reactivity appears as longitudinal stripes at 23 w.g. in layers I and II of the rostrolateral EC and then also as AChE-positive in-growing fibers in islands of superficial layer III and layer II neurons. At 40 w.g., myelination of the PP starts as patchy MBP-immunoreactive oligodendrocytes and their processes. Our results refute the possibility of an inside-out pattern of the EC development and support the key role of layer II prospective stellate cells in the EC lamination. As the early cytoarchitectural differentiation of the EC is paralleled by the neurochemical development, these developmental milestones in EC structure and connectivity have implications for understanding its normal function, including its puzzling modular organization and potential contribution to consciousness content (awareness), as well as for its insufficiently explored deficits in developmental, psychiatric, and degenerative brain disorders.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Thrombectomy vs Medical Management in Mild Strokes due to Large Vessel Occlusion: Exploratory Analysis from the EXTEND‐IA Trials and a Pooled International Cohort</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To evaluate functional and safety outcomes for endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) versus medical management (MM) in patients with large vessel occlusion (LVO) and mild neurological deficits, stratified by perfusion imaging mismatch.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Pooled cohort of patients with NIHSS&lt;6 and ICA, M1, M2 occlusions from EXTEND-IA, EXTEND-IA-TNK I/II RCTs and prospective data from 15 EVT centers from 10/2010 to 4/2020. RAPID software estimated ischemic core and mismatch. Patients receiving primary endovascular thrombectomy (EVT<sub>pri</sub>) were compared to those who received primary MM (MM<sub>pri</sub>), including those who deteriorated and received rescue EVT, in overall and PS matched cohorts. Patients were stratified by target mismatch (mismatch-ratio≥1.8 and mismatch-volume≥15cc). Primary outcome was functional independence (90-day mRS:0-2); Secondary outcomes included safety (sICH, neurological worsening, and mortality).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Of 540 patients, 286/540(53%) received EVT<sub>pri</sub> and demonstrated larger critically hypoperfused tissue (Tmax&gt;6s) volumes of (64[26-96]mL vs MM<sub>pri</sub>:40[14-76]mL, p&lt;0·001) and higher presentation NIHSS (4(2-5) vs MM<sub>pri</sub>:3(2-4), p&lt;0·001). Functional independence was similar (EVT<sub>pri</sub>:77·4% vs MM<sub>pri</sub>:75.6%, aOR:1.29,95%CI:0.82-2.03,p=0.27). EVT had worse safety: sICH (EVT<sub>pri</sub>:8.8% vs MM<sub>pri</sub>:1.3%, p&lt;0.001) and neurological worsening (EVT<sub>pri</sub>:19.6% vs MM<sub>pri</sub>:6.7%, p&lt;0.001). In 414(76.7%) with target mismatch, EVT was associated with improved functional independence (EVT<sub>pri</sub>:77·4% vs MM<sub>pri</sub>:72.7%, aOR:1.68, 95%CI:1.01-2.81,p=0.048), whereas, there was a trend toward less favorable outcomes with primary EVT (EVT<sub>pri</sub>:77·4% vs MM<sub>pri</sub>:83.3%, aOR:0.39,95%CI:0.12-1.34,p=0.13) without target mismatch, (p<sub>interaction</sub>=0.06). Similar findings were observed in a PS matched subpopulation.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Overall, EVT was not associated with improved clinical outcomes in mild strokes due to LVO, and sICH was increased. However, in patients with target mismatch profile, EVT was associated with increased functional independence. Perfusion imaging may be helpful to select mild stroke patients for EVT.</p>

<p>Age-related hearing loss (ARHL, formerly presbycusis) is one of the most common chronic diseases in the elderly. Our cross-sectional study examined pathophysiology of ARHL and provided evidence for impaired performance of all parts of the auditory system including central auditory processing.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Age-related hearing loss (ARHL, formerly presbycusis) is due to a variety of lifetime damages to the auditory system and is characterized by bilateral sensorineural hearing loss, impaired speech understanding in noise and central sound processing deficits. Despite its commonness, the pathogenesis has not been completely clarified yet; especially the existence of an independent central ARHL component still remains controversial. We present the results of a cross-sectional topodiagnostic test battery study which aimed at separating aging- and hearing loss-related effects on all parts of the auditory system by current test procedures. Three groups of 30 participants each underwent extensive topodiagnostic test procedures (otoscopy, tympanometry, questionnaires, pure-tone audiometry, DPOAE threshold measurements, auditory brainstem response, central auditory discrimination tests, and speech-in-noise test). By comparing the results of the normally hearing young (18–26 years) and healthy control group, the normally hearing elderly group (60–80 years) and the hearing-impaired elderly group (60–80 years), we deduced aging and hearing loss-related effects on auditory performance. All measurements indicated a significant deterioration of auditory performance in the elderly, partly associated with aging and partly with age-related hearing loss. Our study thereby contributes to a multifocal concept of ARHL. All parts of the auditory system are impaired by aging, age-related hearing loss, or a combination of both. Further evidence for an independent central ARHL component, not attributable to peripheral hearing loss, is provided by the results of the central auditory discrimination test.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To examine rates of intravenous thrombolysis (IVT), mechanical thrombectomy (MT), door-to-needle (DTN) time, door-to-puncture(DTP) time, and functional outcome between patients with admission MRI versus CT.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Observational cohort study of consecutive patients using a target trial design within the nationwide Swiss-Stroke-Registry from 01/2014 to 08/2020. Exclusion criteria included MRI contraindications, transferred patients, and unstable or frail patients. Multilevel mixed-effects logistic regression with multiple imputation was used to calculate adjusted odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals for IVT, MT, DTN, DTP, and good functional outcome (mRS 0–2) at 90 days.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Of the 11049 patients included (mean [SD] age, 71 [15] years; 4811 [44%] females; 69% ischemic stroke, 16% transient ischemic attack, 8% stroke mimics, 6% intracranial hemorrhage), 3741 (34%) received MRI and 7308 (66%) CT. Patients undergoing MRI had lower NIHSS (median [IQR] 2 [0–6] versus 4 [1–11]), and presented later after symptom onset (150 versus 123 min, <i>P</i>&lt;.001). Admission MRI was associated with: lower adjusted odds of IVT (aOR 0.83, 0.73–0.96), but not with MT (aOR 1.11, 0.93–1.34); longer adjusted DTN (+22 min [13–30]), but not with longer DTP times; and higher adjusted odds of favorable outcome (aOR 1.54, 1.30–1.81).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We found an association of MRI with lower rates of IVT and a significant delay in DTN, but not in DTP and rates of MT. Given the delays in workflow metrics, prospective trials are needed to show that tissue-based benefits of baseline MRI compensate for the temporal benefits of CT.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The avian homologue of oxytocin (OT), formerly called mesotocin, influences social behaviors in songbirds and potentially song production. We sought to characterize the distribution of OT peptide in the brain of two songbird species: canaries (<i>Serinus canaria</i>) and zebra finches (<i>Taeniopygia guttata</i>). To visualize OT, we performed immunocytochemistry using an antibody previously shown to identify OT in avian species. In both canaries and zebra finches, dense OT-ir perikarya were located in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN), preoptic area (POA), supraoptic nucleus (SON), and medial bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNSTm). We also observed morphologically distinct OT-ir cells scattered throughout the mesopallium. OT-ir fibers were observed in the PVN, ventral medial hypothalamus (VMH), periaqueductal gray (PAG), intercollicular nucleus (ICo), and ventral tegmental area (VTA). We also observed punctate OT-ir fibers in the song control nucleus HVC. In both male and female canaries, OT-ir fibers were present in the lateral septum (LS), but innervation was greater in males. We did not observe this sex difference in zebra finches. Much of the OT staining observed is consistent with general distributions within the vertebrate hypothalamus, indicating a possible conserved function. However, some extra-hypothalamic distributions, such as perikarya in the mesopallium, may be specific to songbirds and play a role in song perception and production. The presence of OT-ir fibers in HVC and song control nuclei projecting dopaminergic regions provides anatomical evidence in support of the idea that OT can influence singing behavior—either directly via HVC or indirectly via the PAG, VTA, or POA.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Polygenic resilience modulates the penetrance of Parkinson's disease genetic risk factors</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The aim of the current study is to understand why some individuals avoid developing Parkinson's disease (PD) in spite of being at relatively high genetic risk, using the largest datasets of individual-level genetic data available.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We calculated polygenic risk score to identify controls and matched PD cases with the highest burden of genetic risk for PD in the discovery cohort (IPDGC, 7,204 PD cases and 9,412 controls) and validation cohorts (COURAGE-PD, 8,968 cases and 7,598 controls; UKBB, 2,639 PD cases and 14,301 controls; AMP-PD, 2,248 cases and 2,817 controls). A genome-wide association study meta-analysis was performed on these individuals to understand genetic variation associated with resistance to disease. We further constructed a polygenic resilience score, performed MAGMA gene-based analyses and functional enrichment analyses.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A higher polygenic resilience score was associated with a lower risk for PD (Beta= -0.054, SE = 0.022; <i>P</i> = 0.013). Although no single locus reached genome-wide significance, MAGMA gene-based analyses nominated <i>TBCA</i> as a putative gene. Furthermore, we estimated the narrow-sense heritability associated with resilience to PD (h<sup>2</sup> = 0.081, SE = 0.035, <i>P</i> = 0.0003). Subsequent functional enrichment analysis highlighted histone methylation as potential pathway harboring resilience alleles that could mitigate the effects of PD risk loci.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The present study represents a novel and comprehensive assessment of heritable genetic variation contributing to PD resistance. We show that a genetic resilience score can modify the penetrance of PD genetic risk factors and therefore protect individuals carrying a high-risk genetic burden from developing PD.</p>

                Schneider et al. develop a marker-free movement-tracking system for holistic 3D reconstruction. They combine this approach with virtual head fixation, which enables the removal of disturbing effects of movements on rat neuronal activity. This reveals a much larger fraction of paw-tuned neurons, which were previously masked by body posture tuning.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Chondroitin Sulfate Proteoglycan 4,6 sulfation regulates sympathetic nerve regeneration after myocardial infarction</a></h4>

              
                Sympathetic denervation of the heart following ischemia/reperfusion induced myocardial infarction (MI) is sustained by chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) in the cardiac scar. Denervation predicts risk of sudden cardiac death in humans. Blocking CSPG signaling restores sympathetic axon outgrowth into the cardiac scar, decreasing arrhythmia susceptibility. Axon growth inhibition by CSPGs is thought to depend on the sulfation status of the glycosaminoglycans (CS-GAGs) attached to the core protein. Tandem sulfation of CS-GAGs at the 4<sup>th</sup> (4S) and 6<sup>th</sup> (6S) positions of n-acetyl-galactosamine inhibits outgrowth in several types of neurons within the central nervous system, but it is not known if sulfation is similarly critical during peripheral nerve regeneration. We asked if CSPG sulfation prevented sympathetic axon outgrowth. Neurite outgrowth of dissociated rat sympathetic neurons across purified CSPGs is restored <i>in vitro</i> by reducing 4S with the 4-sulfatase enzyme Arylsulfatase-B (ARSB). Additionally, we co-cultured mouse cardiac scar tissue with mouse sympathetic ganglia <i>ex vivo</i> and found that reducing 4S with ARSB restored axon outgrowth to control levels. We examined levels of the enzymes responsible for adding and removing sulfation to CS-GAGs by western blot to determine if they were altered in the left ventricle after MI. We found that CHST15 (4S dependent 6-sulfotransferase) was upregulated, and ARSB was downregulated after MI. Increased CHST15 combined with decreased ARSB suggests a mechanism for production and maintenance of sulfated CSPGs in the cardiac scar. We altered tandem sulfated 4S,6S CS-GAGs <i>in vivo</i> by transient siRNA knockdown of <i>Chst15</i> and found that reducing 4S,6S restored Tyrosine Hydroxylase (TH) positive sympathetic nerve fibers in the cardiac scar and reduced arrhythmias using a mouse model of MI. Overall, our results suggest that modulating CSPG-sulfation after MI may be a therapeutic target to promote sympathetic nerve regeneration in the cardiac scar and reduce post-MI cardiac arrhythmias.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Dcp2 C-terminal cis-binding elements control selective targeting of the decapping enzyme by forming distinct decapping complexes</a></h4>

              
                A single Dcp1-Dcp2 decapping enzyme targets diverse classes of yeast mRNAs for decapping-dependent 5' to 3' decay, but the molecular mechanisms controlling mRNA selectivity by the enzyme remain elusive. Through extensive genetic analyses we reveal that Dcp2 C-terminal domain <i>cis</i>-regulatory elements control decapping enzyme target specificity by orchestrating formation of distinct decapping complexes. Two Upf1-binding motifs direct the decapping enzyme to NMD substrates, a single Edc3-binding motif targets both Edc3 and Dhh1 substrates, and Pat1-binding leucine-rich motifs target Edc3 and Dhh1 substrates under selective conditions. Although it functions as a unique targeting component of specific complexes, Edc3 is a common component of multiple complexes. Scd6 and Xrn1 also have specific binding sites on Dcp2, allowing them to be directly recruited to decapping complexes. Collectively, our results demonstrate that Upf1, Edc3, Scd6, and Pat1 function as regulatory subunits of the holo-decapping enzyme, controlling both its substrate specificity and enzymatic activation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Contractile force assessment methods for in vitro skeletal muscle tissues</a></h4>

              
                Over the last few years, there has been growing interest in measuring the contractile force (CF) of engineered muscle tissues to evaluate their functionality. However, there are still no standards available for selecting the most suitable experimental platform, measuring system, culture protocol, or stimulation patterns. Consequently, the high variability of published data hinders any comparison between different studies. We have identified that cantilever deflection, post deflection, and force transducers are the most commonly used configurations for CF assessment in 2D and 3D models. Additionally, we have discussed the most relevant emerging technologies that would greatly complement CF evaluation with intracellular and localized analysis. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the most significant advances in CF evaluation and its critical parameters. In order to compare contractile performance across experimental platforms, we have used the specific force (sF, kN/m<sup>2</sup>), CF normalized to the calculated cross-sectional area (CSA). However, this parameter presents a high variability throughout the different studies, which indicates the need to identify additional parameters and complementary analysis suitable for proper comparison. We propose that future contractility studies in skeletal muscle constructs report detailed information about construct size, contractile area, maturity level, sarcomere length, and, ideally, the tetanus-to-twitch ratio. These studies will hopefully shed light on the relative impact of these variables on muscle force performance of engineered muscle constructs. Prospective advances in muscle tissue engineering, particularly in muscle disease models, will require a joint effort to develop standardized methodologies for assessing CF of engineered muscle tissues.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Dnmt3a knockout in excitatory neurons impairs postnatal synapse maturation and increases the repressive histone modification H3K27me3</a></h4>

              
                Two epigenetic pathways of transcriptional repression, DNA methylation and Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) are known to regulate neuronal development and function. However, their respective contributions to brain maturation are unknown. We found that conditional loss of the <i>de novo</i> DNA methyltransferase <i>Dnmt3a</i> in mouse excitatory neurons altered expression of synapse-related genes, stunted synapse maturation, and impaired working memory and social interest. At the genomic level, loss of <i>Dnmt3a</i> abolished postnatal accumulation of CG and non-CG DNA methylation, leaving adult neurons with an unmethylated, fetal-like epigenomic pattern at ~222,000 genomic regions. The PRC2-associated histone modification, H3K27me3, increased at many of these sites. Our data support a dynamic interaction between two fundamental modes of epigenetic repression during postnatal maturation of excitatory neurons, which together confer robustness on neuronal regulation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Osteogenic growth peptide is a potent anti-inflammatory and bone preserving hormone via cannabinoid receptor type 2</a></h4>

              
                The endocannabinoid system consists mainly of 2-arachidonoylglycerol and anandamide, as well as cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1) and type 2 (CB2). Based on previous studies, we hypothesized that a circulating peptide previously identified as Osteogenic Growth Peptide (OGP) maintains a bone-protective CB2 tone. We tested OGP activity in mouse models and cells, and in human osteoblasts. We show that the OGP effects on osteoblast proliferation, osteoclastogenesis, and macrophage inflammation <i>in vitro</i>, as well as rescue of ovariectomy-induced bone loss and prevention of ear edema <i>in vivo</i> are all abrogated by genetic or pharmacological ablation of CB2. We also demonstrate that OGP binds at CB2 and may act as both an agonist and positive allosteric modulator in the presence of other lipophilic agonists. In premenopausal women, OGP circulating levels significantly decline with age. In adult mice, exogenous administration of OGP completely prevented age-related bone loss. Our findings suggest that OGP attenuates age-related bone loss by maintaining a skeletal CB2 tone. Importantly, they also indicate the occurrence of an endogenous peptide that signals via CB2 receptor in health and disease.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Modified viral-genetic mapping reveals local and global connectivity relationships of ventral tegmental area dopamine cells</a></h4>

              
                Dopamine cells in the ventral tegmental area (VTA<sup>DA</sup>) are critical for a variety of motivated behaviors. These cells receive synaptic inputs from over 100 anatomically-defined brain regions, which enables control from a distributed set of inputs across the brain. Extensive efforts have been made to map inputs to VTA cells based on neurochemical phenotype and output site. However, all of these studies have the same fundamental limitation that inputs local to the VTA cannot be properly assessed due to non-Cre-dependent uptake of EnvA-pseudotyped virus. Therefore, the quantitative contribution of local inputs to the VTA, including GABAergic, DAergic, and serotonergic, is not known. Here, I used a modified viral-genetic strategy that enables examination of both local as well as long-range inputs to VTA<sup>DA</sup> cells in mice. I found that nearly half of the total inputs to VTA<sup>DA</sup> cells are located locally, revealing a substantial portion of inputs that have been missed by previous analyses. The majority of inhibition to VTA<sup>DA</sup> cells arises from the substantia nigra pars reticulata, with large contributions from the VTA and the substantia nigra pars compacta. In addition to receiving inputs from VTA<sup>GABA</sup> neurons, DA neurons are connected with other DA neurons within the VTA as well as the nearby retrorubal field. Lastly, I show that VTA<sup>DA</sup> neurons receive inputs from distributed serotonergic neurons throughout the midbrain and hindbrain, with the majority arising from the dorsal raphe. My study highlights the importance of using the appropriate combination of viral-genetic reagents to unmask the complexity of connectivity relationships to defined cells in the brain.

                Controlling neuronal activity with high spatial resolution using multifunctional and minimally invasive neural interfaces constitutes an important step towards developments in neuroscience and novel treatments for brain diseases. While infrared neuromodulation is an emerging technology for controlling the neuronal circuitry, it lacks soft implantable monolithic interfaces capable of simultaneously delivering light and recording electrical signals from the brain while being mechanically brain-compatible. Here, we have developed a soft fibre-based device based on high-performance thermoplastics which are >100-fold softer than silica glass. The presented fibre-implant is capable of safely neuromodulating the brain activity in localized cortical domains by delivering infrared laser pulses in the 2 m spectral region while recording electrophysiological signals. Action and local field potentials were recorded in vivo in adult rats while immunohistochemical analysis of the tissue indicated limited microglia and monocytes response introduced by the fibre and the infrared pulses. We expect our devices to further enhance infrared neuromodulation as a versatile approach for fundamental research and clinically translatable therapeutic interventions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neuroanatomical and Functional Consequences of Oxytocin Treatment at Birth</a></h4>

              
                Birth is a critical period for the developing brain, a time when surging hormone levels help prepare the fetal brain for the tremendous physiological changes it must accomplish upon entry into the  extrauterine world. A number of obstetrical conditions warrant manipulations of these hormones at the time of birth, but we know little of their possible consequences on the developing brain. One of the most notable birth signaling hormones is oxytocin, which is administered to roughly 50% of laboring women in the United States prior to / during delivery. Previously, we found evidence for behavioral, epigenetic, and neuroendocrine consequences in adult prairie vole offspring following maternal oxytocin treatment immediately prior to birth. Here, we examined the neurodevelopmental consequences in adult prairie vole offspring following maternal oxytocin treatment immediately. Control prairie voles and those exposed to 0.25 mg/kg oxytocin were scanned as adults using anatomical and functional MRI, with neuroanatomy and brain function analyzed as voxel-based morphometry and resting state functional connectivity, respectively. Overall, anatomical differences brought on by oxytocin treatment, while widespread, were generally small, while differences in functional connectivity, particularly among oxytocin-exposed males, were larger. Analyses of functional connectivity based in graph theory revealed that oxytocin-exposed males in particular showed markedly increased connectivity throughout the brain and across several parameters, including closeness and degree. These results are interpreted in the context of the organizational effects of oxytocin exposure in early life and these findings add to a growing literature on how the perinatal brain is sensitive to hormonal manipulations at birth.

                Oxytocin plays an important role in modulating social recognition memory. However, the direct implication of oxytocin neurons of the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVH) and their downstream hypothalamic targets in regulating the short- and long-term forms of social recognition memory is not fully understood. In this study, we employed a chemogenetic approach to specifically target the activity of PVH oxytocin neurons in rats and found that silencing these neurons impaired both long and short-term social recognition memory. We combined viral mediated fluorescent labeling of oxytocin neurons with immunohistochemical techniques and identified the supramammillary nucleus (SuM) of the hypothalamus, as a novel target of PVH oxytocinergic axonal projections. Furthermore, we used multiplex fluorescence in-situ hybridization and found that oxytocin receptors in the SuM are predominantly in excitatory neurons. Finally, we examined the role of the SuM in social recognition memory, by using a highly selective antagonist to block oxytocin receptors in the SuM. We found that oxytocin activity in the SuM is necessary for the formation of long- and short-term social recognition memory. This study discovered a previously undescribed role for the SuM in regulating social recognition memory via oxytocin signaling and reinforces the specific role of PVH oxytocin neurons in regulating social recognition memory.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Lasting consequences on physiology and social behavior following cesarean delivery in prairie voles</a></h4>

              
                Cesarean delivery is associated with diminished plasma levels of several  birth-signaling hormones, such as oxytocin and vasopressin. These same hormones have been previously shown to exert organizational effects when acting in early life. For example, our previous work found a broadly gregarious phenotype in prairie voles exposed to oxytocin at birth. Meanwhile, cesarean delivery has been previously associated with changes in social behavior and metabolic processes related to oxytocin and vasopressin. In the present study, we investigated the long-term neurodevelopmental consequences of cesarean delivery in prairie voles. After cross-fostering, vole pups delivered either via cesarean or vaginal delivery were studied throughout development. Cesarean-delivered pups responded to isolation differently in terms of their vocalizations, huddled in less cohesive groups under warmed conditions, and shed less heat. As young adults, we observed no differences in anxiety-like or alloparental behavior. However, in adulthood, cesarean-delivered voles of both sexes failed to form partner preferences with opposite sex conspecifics. In a follow-up study, we replicated this deficit in partner-preference formation among cesarean-delivered voles and were able to normalize pair-bonding behavior by treating cesarean-delivered vole pups with oxytocin (0.25 mg/kg) at delivery. We have thus far detected minor differences in regional oxytocin receptor expression within the brains of cesarean-delivered voles. These results speak to the possibility of unintended developmental consequences of a birth mode which currently accounts for 32.9% of deliveries in the U.S. and suggest that further research should be directed at whether hormone replacement at delivery could avert such effects.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A critical role for touch neurons in a skin-brain pathway for stress resilience</a></h4>

              
                Social touch can act as a stress buffer, reducing behavioral and physiological responses to stressful scenarios. However, skin-brain touch pathways that promote stress resilience remain unknown. Here, we show that mice with an early life genetic ablation of Mrgprb4-lineage touch neurons display stress vulnerability behaviors in adulthood. Chemogenetic activation of these touch neurons reduced corticosterone levels under mild acute stress conditions. In addition, whole-brain c-Fos activity mapping while chemogenetically turning on these neurons uncovered differential neural activity patterns in brain areas relevant to somatosensation, reward, and affect. To gain mechanistic insight into this skin-brain touch pathway for stress susceptibility, we used multi-circuit neurophysiological recordings across seven brain regions at baseline and after stress in mice that had Mrgprb4-lineage touch neurons ablated in early life. Interestingly, the Mrgprb4-lineage neuron-ablated mice have alterations in local field potential phase directionality and power in the theta frequencies in mesolimbic reward regions, which may underlie our observed stress susceptibility phenotype. Together, these studies revealed that sensory neurons in the skin engage networks across the brain to promote stress resilience.

                Functional and effective connectivity methods are essential to study the complex information flow in brain networks underlying human cognition. Only recently have connectivity methods begun to emerge that make use of the full multidimensional information contained in patterns of brain activation, rather than univariate summary measures of these patterns. To date, these methods have mostly been applied to fMRI data, and no method allows vertex-vertex transformation with the temporal specificity of EEG/MEG data. Here, we introduce time-lagged multidimensional pattern connectivity (TL-MDPC) as a novel bivariate functional connectivity metric for EEG/MEG research. TL-MDPC estimates the vertex-to-vertex transformations among multiple brain regions and across different latency ranges. It determines how well patterns in ROI X at time point t_x can linearly predict patterns of ROI Y at time point t_y. In the present study, we use simulations to demonstrate TL-MDPC increased sensitivity to multidimensional effects compared to a univariate approach across realistic choices of number of trials and signal-to-noise ratio. We applied TL-MDPC, as well as its univariate counterpart, to an existing dataset varying the depth of semantic processing of visually presented words by contrasting a semantic decision and a lexical decision task. TL-MDPC detected significant effects beginning very early on, and showed stronger task modulations than the univariate approach, suggesting that it is capable of capturing more information. With TL-MDPC only, we observed rich connectivity between core semantic representation (left and right anterior temporal lobes) and semantic control (inferior frontal gyrus and posterior temporal cortex) areas with greater semantic demands. TL-MDPC is a promising approach to identify multidimensional connectivity patterns, typically missed by univariate approaches.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Lactate supply overtakes glucose when neural computational and cognitive loads scale up</a></h4>

              
                The neural computational power is determined by neuroenergetics, but how and which energy substrates are allocated to various forms of memory engram is unclear. To solve this question, we asked whether neuronal fueling by glucose or lactate scales differently upon increasing neural computation and cognitive loads. Here, using electrophysiology, two-photon imaging, cognitive tasks and mathematical modeling, we show that both glucose and lactate are involved in engram formation, with lactate supporting long-term synaptic plasticity evoked by high stimulation load activity patterns and high attentional load in cognitive tasks, and glucose being sufficient for less demanding neural computation and learning tasks. Overall, these results demonstrate that glucose and lactate metabolisms are differentially engaged in neuronal fueling depending on the complexity of the activity-dependent plasticity and behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Involvement of nucleus accumbens D2-MSN projections to the ventral pallidum in anxious-like behavior</a></h4>

              
                The nucleus accumbens (NAc) is a crucial brain region for emotionally-relevant behaviors. The NAc is mainly composed of medium spiny neurons (MSN) expressing either dopamine receptor D1 (D1-MSNs) or D2 (D2-MSNs). D1-MSNs project to the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and ventral pallidum (VP), while D2-MSNs project only to the VP. In this work, we selectively manipulated D1-MSN projections to the VP and VTA, and D2-MSN projections to the VP during classical anxiety behavioral paradigms in naive mice.

We found that optogenetic activation of D1-MSN to VP or VTA did not trigger significant anxious-like behaviors. Interestingly, optical activation of D2-MSN-VP projections significantly increased anxious-like behavior in all of the tests performed. This phenotype was associated with a decrease in the activity of VP putative GABAergic neurons. Importantly, pre-treating D2-MSN-VP animals with the GABA modulator diazepam prevented the optically-triggered anxious-like behavior.

Overall, our results suggest that D2-MSN-VP projections contribute for the development of anxious-like behavior, through modulation of GABAergic activity in the VP.

                Familial Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (fCJD) caused by the E200K mutation of the prion protein (PrP) is the most common subtype of genetic prion disease. We have generated a library of human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from a family with the E200K mutation, comprised of 11 carriers and 11 non-carriers. A comparison of neurons derived from E200K iPSCs to those from non-carriers revealed the presence of several disease-relevant phenotypes. Although traditional proteinase K resistant, detergent-insoluble, and seed-competent PrP was not observed, neurons derived from E200K carriers were found to contain thioflavin S positive PrP puncta. At the postsynaptic site, the co-localization of N-Methyl-D-aspartic acid receptors and post synaptic density 95 colocalization was disrupted in neurons expressing E200K PrP. Our study shows that iPSC-derived neurons, which express endogenous levels of mutant PrP in a human neuronal context, can model certain aspects of human prion disease, offering a powerful platform for investigating pathological mechanisms and testing potential therapeutics.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Tle4 controls both developmental acquisition and postnatal maintenance of corticothalamic projection neuron identity</a></h4>

              
                Identities, circuitry, and function of distinct neuron subtypes are specified during embryonic development, then maintained during postnatal maturation and potential plasticity. Mechanisms that control early acquisition of neuron subtype identities, encompassing circuitry and function, in the cerebral cortex have become increasingly understood. However, mechanisms controlling maintenance of identity, and accompanying regulation of plasticity, are largely unexplored and unknown.

Here, we identify two novel functions of the co-repressor Tle4 in both acquisition and maintenance of neuron subtype identity of corticothalamic projection neurons. Embryonically, Tle4 promotes acquisition of corticothalamic molecular and cellular identity, and blocks emergence of core characteristics of subcerebral / corticospinal projection neuron identity, including morphology, gene expression, axonal connectivity, and circuitry. Postnatally, Tle4 is required to maintain corticothalamic molecular and projection identity during circuit maturation, avoiding potentially disruptive plasticity, but also limiting potentially beneficial plasticity.

We identify an epigenetic mechanism by which TLE4 controls the activation state of loci regulating the level of Fezf2 expression by corticothalamic neurons during embryonic and postnatal development. This mechanism contributes importantly to distinction of cortical output (corticofugal) subtypes, and ensures appropriate maturation and maintenance of CThPN.

	<p>Social distancing norms have been promoted after the COVID-19 pandemic. In this work, we tested interpersonal space (IPS) in 107 subjects through a reaching-comfort distance estimation task. In the main experiment, subjects had to estimate the comfort and reach space between an avatar wearing or not wearing a face mask. We found that IPS was greater between avatars not wearing a mask with respect to stimuli with the mask on, while reaching space was not modulated. IPS increment in the NoMask condition with respect to the Mask condition correlated with anxiety traits, as shown with the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, rather than with transient aspects related to the pandemic situation. In the control experiment, the avatars with a mask were removed to further explore the conditioning effect provided by the presence of the facial protection in the main experiment. We found a significant difference comparing this condition with the same condition of the main experiment, namely, the distances kept between avatars not wearing a mask in the main experiment were greater than those between the same stimuli in the control experiment. This showed a contextual adaptation of IPS when elements related to the actual pandemic situation were relevant. Additionally, no significant differences were found between the control experiment and the Mask condition of the main experiment, suggesting that participants had internalized social distancing norms and wearing a mask has become the new normal. Our results highlight the tendency of people in underestimating the risk of contagion when in the presence of someone wearing a mask.</p>

	<p>This article presents DIANA, a new, process-oriented model of human auditory word recognition, which takes as its input the acoustic signal and can produce as its output word identifications and lexicality decisions, as well as reaction times. This makes it possible to compare its output with human listeners&amp;amp;rsquo; behavior in psycholinguistic experiments. DIANA differs from existing models in that it takes more available neuro-physiological evidence on speech processing into account. For instance, DIANA accounts for the effect of ambiguity in the acoustic signal on reaction times following the Hick&amp;amp;ndash;Hyman law and it interprets the acoustic signal in the form of spectro-temporal receptive fields, which are attested in the human superior temporal gyrus, instead of in the form of abstract phonological units. The model consists of three components: activation, decision and execution. The activation and decision components are described in detail, both at the conceptual level (in the running text) and at the computational level (in the Appendices). While the activation component is independent of the listener&amp;amp;rsquo;s task, the functioning of the decision component depends on this task. The article also describes how DIANA could be improved in the future in order to even better resemble the behavior of human listeners.</p>

	<p>Adiponectin exhibits pleiotropic effects, including anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, anti-oxidant, and neuroprotective ones. Although some studies have documented brain expression in different rodent models of its receptors, AdipoR1 and AdipoR2, their global distribution remains incomplete. Here, we demonstrated that both AdipoR are widely distributed in the brains of adult mice. Furthermore, by double immunostaining studies, we showed that AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 are mainly expressed in neurons and blood vessels. Then, considering the wide distribution of both receptors and the neuroprotective effects of adiponectin, we tested the therapeutic effect of a single injection of the adiponectin receptor agonist, AdipoRON (5 mg.kg&amp;amp;minus;1), 24 h after stroke in a model of middle cerebral artery occlusion technique (MCAO). Under our experimental conditions, we demonstrated that AdipoRON did not modulate the infarct volume, cell death, neuroinflammatory parameters including microglia activation and oxidative stress. This study suggests that a protocol based on multiple injections of AdipoRON at a higher dose after MCAO could be considered to promote the therapeutic properties of AdipoRON on the brain repair mechanism and recovery.</p>

	<p>Chronic low-level blast exposure has been linked with neurological alterations and traumatic brain injury (TBI) biomarkers. Impaired smooth-pursuit eye movements (SPEM) are often associated with TBI. The purpose of this study was to determine whether long-term operators of low-level blast exposure or high-caliber weapons use displayed oculomotor behaviors that differed from controls. Twenty-six members of an elite military unit performed a computerized oculomotor testing task using an eye tracker and completed a concussion assessment questionnaire. The participants were split into a blast exposure group and control group. The blast exposure group had a history of exposure to low-level blasts or high-caliber weapon use. The results revealed significant differences in SPEM, saccades, and fixations between the blast exposure group and control group. The blast exposure group&amp;amp;rsquo;s eye movements were slower, stopped at more frequent points when following a target, traveled further from the target in terms of both speed and direction, and showed higher rates of variation and inefficiency. Poor oculomotor behavior correlated with a higher symptom severity on the concussion assessment questionnaire. Military special operators exposed to long-term low-level blasts or high-caliber weapons usage displayed an impaired oculomotor behavior in comparison to controls. These findings further our understanding of the impact of long-term low-level blast exposure on the oculomotor behavior of military special operators and may inform practical implications for military training.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Spider brain and central nervous system (CNS) have remained unexplored, due in part to the difficulty of observing these organs, usually only possible through histological preparations. Recently, internal anatomy studies have been supplemented by the inclusion of X- ray micro-CT. Unmineralized tissue such as the body of invertebrates requires a staining process to enhance tissue X-ray absorption and improve contrast during observation. Many current protocols are based on iodine staining requiring critical point drying (CPD) of the sample for optimal contrast. This process induces shrinking of the soft tissue generating artifacts in the morphology, volume, and even position of internal structures. Phosphotungstic acid (PTA) is an alternative staining agent recently used in marine invertebrate and plant studies. Here, we used several specimens of the common spider <i>Araneus diadematus</i> to visualize the spider brain and compare both contrast-enhancing ethanol-based solutions. We assessed a gradient of staining times, observed and tested the repercussions of CPD, and examined the use of vacuum to accelerate PTA diffusion. We show that PTA provides the best contrast on micro-CT scans in ethanol eliminating the need for CPD, and offering more realistic in situ visualizations of the internal organs. In combination with different scanning settings, PTA allowed observation of internal organs like the CNS, digestive system, muscles, and finer structures like the retina, visual nerves, and optic neuropiles. This fast and less invasive method could facilitate the proper documentation of the internal anatomy in the context of evolutionary, developmental and functional studies.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Evidence on associations of lifestyle factors with Alzheimer's pathology and cognition are ambiguous, potentially because they rarely addressed interrelationships of factors and sex effects. While considering these aspects, we examined the relationships of lifestyle factors with brain amyloid burden and cognition.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We studied 178 cognitively normal individuals (women, 49%; 65.0 [7.6] years) and 54 individuals with mild cognitive impairment (women, 35%; 71.3 [8.3] years) enrolled in a prospective study of volunteers who completed <sup>18</sup>F-Flutemetamol amyloid positron emission tomography. Using structural equation modeling, we examined associations between latent constructs representing metabolic/vascular risk, physical activity, and cognitive activity with global amyloid burden and cognitive performance. Furthermore, we investigated the influence of sex in this model.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Overall, higher cognitive activity was associated with better cognitive performance and higher physical activity was associated with lower amyloid burden. The latter association was weakened to a non-significant level after excluding multivariate outliers. Examination of the moderating effect of sex in the model revealed an inverse association of metabolic/vascular risk with cognition in men whereas in women metabolic/vascular risk trended towards increased amyloid burden. Furthermore, a significant inverse association between physical activity and amyloid burden was found only in men. Inheritance of an APOE4 allele was associated with higher amyloid burden only in women.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Sex modifies effects of certain lifestyle-related factors on amyloid burden and cognition. Notably, our results suggest that the negative impact of metabolic/vascular risk influences the risk of cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease through distinct paths in women and men.</p>

                In order to explore the mechanism of general anesthesia emergence,based on the common clinical phenomenon--delayed emergency, we explore the role of 5-HT neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus in promoting sevoflurane arousal in mice model of general anesthesia. In this study, C57BL/6J male mice were selected to specifically activate or inhibit DR 5-HT neurons and different 5-HT receptors by intraperitoneal, lateral ventricle or intranuclear injection and optogenetics during the sevoflurane anesthesia, record and observe the anesthesia induction and emergence time of mice. Through intraventricular infusion and intranuclear microinjection of serotonin and 5-HT receptor agonists or antagonists, study shows that serotonin and 5-HT 1A and 2A/C receptor, especially 5-HT 1A receptor, are involved in the regulation of awakening delay mediated by DRN 5-HT neurons. This can provides a reliable theoretical basis and intervention target for clinical prevention of delayed emergency. Key words: general anesthesia, sevoflurane, delayed emergency, dorsal raphe, 5-Hydroxytryptamine

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Targeting acetyl-CoA metabolism attenuates the formation of fear memories through reduced activity-dependent histone acetylation</a></h4>

              
                Histone acetylation is a key component in the consolidation of long-term fear memories. Epigenetic enzymes involved in histone acetylation, including histone acetyltransferases and deacetylases, have been put forward as potential pharmacological targets in the treatment of pathological fear memories, such as those that underlie post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, these enzymes typically play a ubiquitous role in gene regulation, which precludes the clinical use of systemic manipulations. Recently, we have found that a nuclear-localized metabolic enzyme, Acetyl-coA synthetase 2 (Acss2), modulates histone acetylation during learning and memory. Loss of Acss2 is well-tolerated in mice, with no impact on general health or baseline behavior. Here, we show that an Acss2 null mouse model shows reduced acquisition of long-term fear memories in assays of contextual and cued fear conditioning. We find that loss of Acss2 leads to consolidation-specific reductions in both histone acetylation and the expression of critical learning and memory-related genes in the dorsal hippocampus. Further, we show that systemic administration of blood-brain-barrier (BBB)-permeable Acss2 inhibitors during the consolidation window reduces fear memory formation in mice and rats, and also reduces anxiety in a predator-scent-stress (PSS) paradigm. Our findings suggest that Acss2 plays a critical role in the formation of fear memories, and represents a potential pharmacological target in the treatment of PTSD.

	<p>Linguistic deficits are frequent symptoms among stroke survivors. The neural mechanism of post-stroke aphasia (PSA) was incompletely understood. Recently, resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) was widely used among several neuropsychological disorders. However, previous rs-fMRI studies of PSA were limited to very small sample size and the absence of reproducibility with different neuroimaging indexes. The present study performed comparisons with static and dynamic amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) and functional connectivity (FC) based on modest sample size (40 PSA and 37 healthy controls). Compared with controls, PSA showed significantly increased static ALFF predominantly in the bilateral supplementary motor area (SMA) and right hippocampus-parahippocampus (R HIP-ParaHip) and decreased static ALFF in right cerebellum. The increased dynamic ALFF in SMA and decreased dynamic ALFF in right cerebellum were also found in PSA. The static and dynamic ALFF in right cerebellum was positively correlated with spontaneous speech. The FC between the SMA and R HIP-ParaHip was significantly stronger in patients than controls and positively correlated with ALFF in bilateral SMA. In addition, the FC between the R HIP-ParaHip and the right temporal was also enhanced in patients and negatively correlated with repetition, naming, and comprehension score. These findings revealed consistently abnormal intrinsic neural activity in SMA and cerebellum, which may underlie linguistic deficits in PSA.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Parkinson's disease derived exosomes aggravate neuropathology in SNCA*A53T mice</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Accumulation of α-synuclein (α-syn) in neurons is a prominent feature of Parkinson's disease (PD). Recently, researchers have considered that extracellular vesicles (EVs) may play an important role in protein exportation and propagation, and α-syn-containing EVs derived from the central nervous system (CNS) have been detected in peripheral blood. However, mechanistic insights into CNS-derived EVs have not been well-described.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Likely neurogenic EVs were purified from the plasma of PD patients and healthy controls using a well-established immunoprecipitation assay with anti-L1CAM-coated beads. A <i>Prnp-SNCA</i>
<sup>A53T</sup> transgenic PD mouse model was used to evaluate the neuronal pathology induced by PD-derived L1CAM-purified EVs. EV-associated microRNA (miRNA) profiling was used to screen for altered miRNAs in PD-derived L1CAM-purified EVs.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>PD patient-derived L1CAM-purified (likely neurogenic) EVs facilitated α-syn pathology and neuron loss in <i>Prnp-SNCA</i>
<sup>A53T</sup> transgenic PD mice. The novel miRNA, novel_miR_44438, was significantly increased in the PD group, which promoted α-syn accumulation and neuronal degeneration in a dose-dependent manner. Novel _miR_44438 directly targets NDST1 mRNA and inhibits the function of heparan sulfate, thus preventing exosome biogenesis and α-syn release from exosomes.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Novel_miR_44438 in PD-derived L1CAM-purified EVs inhibits the α-syn efflux from neurons thereby promoting the pathological accumulation and aggregation of α-syn.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We performed a population-based study on inclusion body myositis with the primary aims to define the prevalence, survival rate and incidence and to investigate the symptom profiles associated with disease duration and sex over a 33-year period.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Patients diagnosed between 1985 and 2017 in Region Västra Götaland, Sweden were identified according to the European Neuromuscular Centre diagnostic criteria from 2011.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We identified 128 patients, 89 men and 39 women with the strict clinico-pathologically definition of inclusion body myositis. The prevalence was 32 per million inhabitants, 19 per million women and 45 per million men December 31st 2017. Mean incidence was 2.5 per million inhabitants and year. Mean age at symptom onset was 64.4 years with quadriceps weakness being the most common presenting symptom followed by finger flexor weakness. Dysphagia was a common presenting symptom being more frequent in women (23%) than men (10%) and was during the disease course reported in 74% of men and 84% of women. Seventy-three patients were deceased, with mean survival of 14 years from symptom onset. Survival rate from both diagnosis date and symptom onset was decreased compared to the matched population.</p>
<p>Twenty-one percent of the patients had an additional autoimmune disease. A cross-sectional analysis of autoantibodies in 50 patients and 28 matched controls showed autoantibodies to cytosolic 5′-nucleotidase 1A in 40% of the patients and 3.6% of controls.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Inclusion body myositis is an autoimmune disease with decreased survival rate and with marked sex differences in both prevalence and clinical manifestations.</p>

<p>We have determined cuprizone demyelination and remyelination is correlated with a loss and restoration of bladder continence. Interestingly, while cuprizone-induced CNS demyelination severely affected conscious (cortical) urinary behavior, the brainstem and spinal cord reflex remained unchanged.

<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, progressively debilitating demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS). Nearly 80% of MS patients experience lower urinary tract dysfunction early in their diagnosis. This significantly affects the quality of life, and in latter stages of disease is a leading cause of hospitalization. Previously, animal models have shown that inflammatory demyelination in the CNS causes profound bladder dysfunction, but the confounding influence of systemic inflammation limits the potential interpretation of the contribution of CNS demyelination to bladder dysfunction. Since the micturition circuit has myelinated neuronal connections in the cortex, brainstem, and spinal cord, we examined alterations in bladder function in the cuprizone model characterized by demyelinating lesions in the cortex and corpus callosum that are independent of T-cell–mediated autoimmunity. Herein, we report that a 4-week dietary cuprizone treatment in C57Bl/6J mice induced alterations in voiding behavior with increased micturition frequency and reduced volume voided, similar to human MS bladder dysfunction. Subsequently, recovery from cuprizone treatment restored normal bladder function. Demyelination and remyelination were confirmed by Luxol Fast Blue staining of the corpus callosum. Additionally, we also determined that an 8-week cuprizone treatment, resulting in chronic demyelination lacking spontaneous remyelination potential, is associated with an exacerbated voiding phenotype. Interestingly, while cuprizone-induced CNS demyelination severely affected conscious (cortical) urinary behavior, the brainstem and spinal cord reflex remained unchanged, as confirmed by urethane-anesthetized cystometry. This is the first study to show that cortical demyelination independent of inflammation can negatively impact urinary function.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Inhibitory interneurons within the deep dorsal horn integrate convergent sensory input to regulate motor performance</a></h4>

              
                To achieve smooth motor performance in a rich and changing sensory environment, motor output must be constantly updated in response to sensory feedback. Although proprioception and cutaneous information are known to modulate motor output, it is unclear whether they work together in the spinal cord to shape complex motor actions such as locomotion. Here we identify the medial deep dorsal horn (mDDH) as a hot zone of convergent proprioception and cutaneous input for locomotion. Due to increased responsiveness to sensory input, inhibitory interneurons in the mDDH area are preferentially recruited in locomotion. To study inhibitory interneurons in this area, we utilize an intersectional genetic strategy to isolate and ablate a population of parvalbumin-expressing glycinergic interneurons in the mDDH (dPVs). Using histological and electrophysiological methods we find that dPVs integrate proprioceptive and cutaneous inputs while targeting ventral horn motor networks, suggesting a role in multimodal sensory processing for locomotion. Consistent with this, dPVs ablation alters step cycle parameters and kinematics in a speed and phase dependent manner. Finally, we use EMG muscle recordings to directly show that dPVs are part of a cutaneous-motor pathway. Our results indicate that dPVs form a critical node in the spinal sensorimotor circuitry.

                CRISPR gene editing holds promise to cure or arrest genetic disease, if we can find and implement curative edits reliably, safely and effectively. Expansion of a hexanucleotide repeat in C9orf72 is the leading known genetic cause of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We evaluated three approaches to editing the mutant C9orf72 gene for their ability to correct pathology in neurons derived from patient iPSCs: excision of the repeat region, excision of the mutant allele, and excision of regulatory region exon 1A. All three approaches normalized RNA abnormalities and TDP-43 pathology, but only repeat excision and mutant allele excision completely eliminated pathologic dipeptide repeats. Our work sheds light on the complex regulation of the C9orf72 gene and suggests that because of sense and anti-sense transcription, silencing a single regulatory region may not reverse all pathology. Our work also provides a roadmap for evaluating CRISPR gene correction using patient iPSCs.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Increased GABA transmission to GnRH neurons after intrahippocampal kainic acid injection in mice is sex-specific and associated with estrous cycle disruption</a></h4>

              
                Patients with epilepsy develop reproductive endocrine comorbidities at a rate higher than that of the general population. Clinical studies have identified disrupted luteinizing hormone (LH) release patterns in patients of both sexes, suggesting potential epilepsy-associated changes in hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neuron function. In previous work, we found that GnRH neuron firing is increased in diestrous females and males in the intrahippocampal kainic acid (IHKA) mouse model of temporal lobe epilepsy. Notably, GABAA receptor activation is depolarizing in adult GnRH neurons. Therefore, here we tested the hypothesis that increased GnRH neuron firing in IHKA mice is associated with increased GABAergic drive to GnRH neurons. When ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs) were blocked to isolate GABAergic postsynaptic currents (PSCs), no differences in PSC frequency were seen between GnRH neurons from control and IHKA diestrous females. In the absence of iGluR blockade, however, GABA PSC frequency was increased in GnRH neurons from IHKA females with disrupted estrous cycles, but not saline-injected controls nor IHKA females without estrous cycle disruption. GABA PSC amplitude was also increased in IHKA females with disrupted estrous cycles. These findings suggest the presence of an iGluR-dependent increase in feed-forward GABAergic transmission to GnRH neurons specific to IHKA females with comorbid cycle disruption. In males, GABA PSC frequency and amplitude were unchanged but PSC duration was reduced. Together, these findings suggest that increased GABA transmission helps drive elevated firing in IHKA females on diestrus and indicate the presence of a sex-specific hypothalamic mechanism underlying reproductive endocrine dysfunction in IHKA mice.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cerebellum Directly Modulates the Substantia Nigra Dopaminergic Activity</a></h4>

              
                Evidence of direct reciprocal connections between the cerebellum and basal ganglia has challenged the long-held notion that these structures function independently. While anatomical studies have suggested the presence of cerebellar projections to the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc), the nature and function of these connections (Cb-SNc) is unknown. Here we show that the Cb-SNc form monosynaptic glutamatergic synapses with both dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic neurons in the SNc. Optogenetic activation Cb-SNc axons in the SNc rapidly increases SNc activity, elevates striatal dopamine levels, and increases the probability of locomotion. During ongoing behavior, Cb-SNc axons are bilaterally activated prior to ambulation and unilateral lever manipulation. The Cb-SNc axons show prominent activation to water reward, and higher activation for sweet water, suggesting that the pathway also encodes reward value. Thus, the cerebellum directly, rapidly, and effectively modulates basal ganglia dopamine levels and conveys information related to movement initiation, vigor, and possibly reward processing.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cortical circuits modulate mouse social vocalizations</a></h4>

              
                Vocalizations provide a means of communication with high fidelity and information rate for many species. Male mice emit ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) during female courtship. Diencephalon and brainstem neural circuits have been shown to control the production of USVs, however, the role of cortical circuits in this process is debatable. We show that male mice produced USVs following intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) in a specific location of their anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Moreover, ACC Ca2+-imaging showed an increase in Ca2+ dynamics preceding USV initiation. Optogenetically suppressing ACC activity caused mice to emit fewer USVs during courtship. Neuropixel electrophysiological recordings in head-restrained male mice indicated a differential increase in neural activity in response to female social exposure (SE). The firing rate in SE trials where USVs were emitted was significantly higher when compared to SE leading to silence. Taken together, these results indicate that the ACC is a key node in the neuronal circuits controlling USV production.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Divergent projections from Locus Coeruleus to the cortico-basal ganglia system and ventral tegmental area of the zebra finch.</a></h4>

              
                The locus coeruleus (LC) is a small brainstem nucleus that is the primary source of noradrenaline (NA) throughout the vertebrate brain. Understanding the anatomical organization of the LC is important because NA plays a central role in regulating arousal, attention, and performance. In the mammalian brain, individual LC neurons make highly divergent axonal projections to different brain regions, which are distinguished in part by which NA receptor subtypes they express. Here we sought to determine whether similar organizational features - divergent LC projections acting regionally through different receptor subtypes - characterize cortico-basal ganglia (CBG) circuitry important to birdsong learning and performance. Single and dual retrograde tracer injections reveal that single LC-NA neurons make divergent projections to both cortical and basal ganglia components of this circuit, as well as to dopaminergic nuclei that innervate this circuit. Moreover, in situ hybridization revealed that differential expression of the 2A and 2C adrenoreceptor distinguish LC-recipient song nuclei. Therefore, LC - NA signaling in the songbird CBG circuit could employ a similar strategy as in mammals, which allows a relatively small number of LC neurons to exert widespread yet distinct effects across multiple brain regions.

Key PointsO_LIThe locus coeruleus projects to most of the song system (HVC, RA, LMAN, Area X, DLM).
C_LIO_LINoradrenergic receptors are regionally specialized in BG despite divergent connectivity of LC neurons.
C_LIO_LINoradrenergic projections to dopaminergic nuclei could influence vocal variability and learning.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Local synaptic inhibition mediates cerebellar pattern separation necessary for learned sensorimotor associations</a></h4>

              
                The cerebellar cortex plays a key role in generating predictive sensorimotor associations. To do so, the granule cell layer is thought to establish unique sensorimotor representations for learning. However, how this is achieved, and how granule cell population responses contribute to behavior, has remained unclear. To address these questions, we have used in vivo calcium imaging and granule cell specific pharmacological manipulation of synaptic inhibition in awake, behaving mice. We find that inhibition sparsens and thresholds sensory responses, limiting overlap between sensory ensembles, and preventing spiking in many granule cells that receive excitatory input. Moreover, we find that inhibition can be recruited in a stimulus-specific manner to powerfully decorrelate multisensory ensembles. Consistent with these results, we find that granule cell inhibition is required for sensory discrimination in a cerebellum-dependent behavior. These data thus reveal new mechanisms for granule cell layer pattern separation beyond those envisioned by classical models.

	<p>Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) is a chronic progressive neurodegenerative disease that is increasingly becoming a global threat to the health and life of the elderly worldwide. Although there are some drugs clinically available for treating PD, these treatments can only alleviate the symptoms of PD patients but cannot completely cure the disease. Therefore, exploring other potential mechanisms to develop more effective treatments that can modify the course of PD is still highly desirable. Over the last two decades, histone deacetylases, as an important group of epigenetic targets, have attracted much attention in drug discovery. This review focused on the current knowledge about histone deacetylases involved in PD pathophysiology and their inhibitors used in PD studies. Further perspectives related to small molecules that can inhibit or degrade histone deacetylases to treat PD were also discussed.</p>

	<p>Background: Inflammation, particularly cytokine release, contributes to epileptogenesis by influencing the cerebral tissue remodeling and neuronal excitability that occurs after a precipitating epileptogenic insult. While several cytokines have been explored in this process, release kinetics are less well investigated. Determining the time course of cytokine release in the epileptogenic zone is necessary for precisely timed preventive or therapeutic anti-inflammatory interventions. Methods: Hippocampal extracellular levels of six cytokines and chemokines (IL-1&amp;amp;beta;, IL-6, IL-10, CCL2, CCL3, and CCL5) were quantified at various time points during epileptogenesis in a rat model of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis (mTLE-HS) using microdialysis (MD). Results: The analysis of microdialysates demonstrated consistent elevation at all time points during epileptogenesis for IL-1&amp;amp;beta; and IL-10. IL-10 release was maximal on day 1, IL-1&amp;amp;beta; release peaked at day 8. No correlation between local hippocampal IL-1&amp;amp;beta; concentrations and IL-1&amp;amp;beta; blood levels was found. Conclusion: The release kinetics of IL-1&amp;amp;beta; are consistent with its established pro-epileptogenic properties, while the kinetics of IL-10 suggest a counter-regulatory effect. This proof-of-concept study demonstrates the feasibility of intraindividual longitudinal monitoring of hippocampal molecular inflammatory processes via repetitive MD over several weeks and sheds light on the kinetics of hippocampal cytokine release during epileptogenesis.</p>

	<p>Pain is a minor problem compared with other Huntington Disease (HD) symptoms. Nevertheless, in HD it is poorly recognized and underestimated. So far, no study evaluated the presence of chronic pain in HD. The aim of this pilot study was to evaluate the presence and features of chronic pain in a cohort of HD gene carriers. An observational cross-sectional study was conducted in a cohort of HD gene carriers compared to not gene carriers (n.134 HD subjects, n.74 not gene mutation carriers). A specific pain interview, alongside a neurological, cognitive and behavioural examination, was performed in order to classify the type of pain, subjective intensity. A significant prevalence of &amp;amp;ldquo;no Pain&amp;amp;rdquo; in HD was found, which tended to increase with HD progression and a reduced frequency of pain in the last 3 months. A clear difference was found between manifest and premanifest HD in terms of intensity of pain, which did not change significantly with HD progression; however, a tendency emerges to a progressive reduction. No significant group difference was present in analgesic use, type and the site of pain. These findings could support a lower prevalence of chronic pain in manifest HD. Prevalence and intensity of chronic pain seem directly influenced by the process of neurodegeneration rather than by an incorrect cognitive and emotional functioning.</p>

	<p>Objective: Although some meta-analyses have shown a correlation between a high neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and low survival in patients with gliomas, their conclusions are controversial, and no study has specifically explored the relationship between a high pre-treatment and pre-operative NLR and low survival in patients with glioblastoma (GBM). Therefore, we further investigated this correlation through meta-analysis. Methods: We searched the PubMed, Metstr, and Cochrane databases in March 2022 for published literature related to high pre-treatment and pre-operative NLR and low survival in patients with GBM. The literature was rigorously searched according to inclusion and exclusion criteria to calculate the overall hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) corresponding to a high NLR using a random effects model. Results: The total HR for the pre-treatment and pre-operative NLR was 1.46 (95% CI: 1.17&amp;amp;ndash;1.75, p = 0.000, I2 = 76.5%), indicating a significant association between a high pre-treatment and pre-operative NLR, and low overall survival in patients with GBM. Sub-group analysis was performed because of the high heterogeneity. The results for the sub-group with a cut-off value of 4 showed an HR of 1.39 (95% CI: 1.12&amp;amp;ndash;1.65, p = 0.000, I2 = 22.2%), with significantly low heterogeneity, whereas those for the sub-group without a cut-off value of 4 showed an HR of 1.45 (95% CI: 1.01&amp;amp;ndash;1.89, p = 0.000, I2 = 83.3%). Conclusions: The results of this study demonstrate that a high pre-treatment and pre-operative NLR suggests low survival in patients with GBM based on data from a large sample. Furthermore, the meta-regression analysis results indicate that underlying data, such as age and extent of surgical resection, lead to a high degree of heterogeneity, providing a theoretical basis for further research.</p>

	<p>Motor coordination abilities are related to cognitive abilities and academic achievement in children with neurodevelopmental disorders. However, the similarities and differences of these relationships in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (AD/HD) have not been explored. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between motor coordination abilities, cognitive abilities, and academic achievement in Japanese children with ASD and AD/HD. Participants included 20 children with ASD, 20 children with AD/HD, and 20 typically developing children, matched for age and gender. Their motor coordination abilities were assessed with the Movement Assessment Battery for Children-2 (MABC-2). Furthermore, cognitive ability and academic achievement were assessed with the Kauffman Assessment Battery for Children-II (K-ABCII). Results demonstrated that the MABC-2 Total score significantly correlated with the K-ABCII Simultaneous processing, Planning, Total cognitive ability, Writing and Arithmetic scores in children with ASD. However, in children with AD/HD, there was no significant correlation between MABC-2 and K-ABCII subscale scores. The results of this study indicated that the relationship between motor coordination ability, cognitive ability, and academic achievement differs between ASD and AD/HD. This difference might indicate the non-similarity of neurological characteristics and encourage consideration for an approach that accommodates the features of neurodevelopmental disorders in children.</p>

                Hydroxyurea (HU) alone has the potential to prevent one out of every three deaths due to sickle cell disease (SCD) and almost all forms of disabilities caused by SCD. However, in Tanzania, only one out of every six registered SCD patients in the SPARCO-Tanzania Sickle Cell Cohort use HU. We conducted studies to understand factors influencing utilization of HU in Tanzania and discovered that among the reason for low utilization of HU include HU is classified as anticancer medication, only hematologists are supposed to prescribe HU, limited HU prescription to only National and Specialized hospitals, a special permit is required to access HU using National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF) scheme and limited importation and absence of local manufacturing of HU limit availability of this important drug in Tanzania. Therefore, with this brief, the government should allow prescription of HU to the district hospitals level, should allow all clinicians with a minimum of a Bachelor of Medicine to prescribe HU, and accessibility of HU through NHIF should be friendly.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The role of endothelial microparticles in children with asthma: Does it promote atherosclerosis progress? [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Asthma is a chronic inflammatory airway disease that has been linked to enhanced risks for atherosclerosis. The impact of asthma on cardiovascular disease risk in children is less well established. Asthma is defined by a history of respiratory symptoms and accompanied by airflow limitation, with heterogeneous clinical manifestations, and variability in the intensity of airway inflammation and remodeling. Endothelial microparticles (EMP) are biomarkers of endothelial dysfunction in several chronic diseases. Endothelial microparticles initiate an event of atherosclerotic plaque formation. Our study aimed to evaluate the role of endothelial microparticles in children with asthma. Methods: A cross-sectional study was performed on a total of 50 children with asthma aged seven‒17 years. Children with asthma exacerbations, infections, and steroid use were excluded. Endothelial microparticles were measured with beads, and the fluorescence signal was measured using a flow cytometer. Pro-inflammatory cytokines were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method. Results: Based on the results from 50 asthmatic children, it was found that most children had a normal nutritional status, intermittent, and allergic asthma. The results of this study also showed that the circulation of asthmatic children found that the mean levels (µL) of CD31+/CD62E+, CD31+/CD62E-, and CD62E+/CD31- were 2,392.99 ± 7,787.94; 922.14 ± 1,554.03; 198.97 ± 387.68, with the average ratio of CD31+/CD62E+, which was ≤1.0 and identifies apoptosis. Path analysis results found that IL-6, TNF-α, and CD31+/CD62E- EMP played a role in peak expiratory flow rate (%PEFR, p = 0.02; p = 0.003; p = 0.04) in children with allergic asthma. Conclusions: Endothelial microparticles play a role on peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) in children with allergic asthma. Further study is needed to investigate the role of these biomarkers and their correlation with pro-inflammatory cytokines in the mechanism of atherosclerosis progression.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">A juxtamembrane basolateral targeting motif regulates signaling through a TGF-β pathway receptor in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Aidan J. Peterson, Stephen J. Murphy, Melinda G. Mundt, MaryJane Shimell, Edward B. Leof, Michael B. O’Connor</p>

In polarized epithelial cells, receptor–ligand interactions can be restricted by different spatial distributions of the 2 interacting components, giving rise to an underappreciated layer of regulatory complexity. We explored whether such regulation occurs in the <i>Drosophila</i> wing disc, an epithelial tissue featuring the TGF-β family member Decapentaplegic (Dpp) as a morphogen controlling growth and patterning. Dpp protein has been observed in an extracellular gradient within the columnar cell layer of the disc, but also uniformly in the disc lumen, leading to the question of how graded signaling is achieved in the face of 2 distinctly localized ligand pools. We find the Dpp Type II receptor Punt, but not the Type I receptor Tkv, is enriched at the basolateral membrane and depleted at the junctions and apical surface. Wit, a second Type II receptor, shows a markedly different behavior, with the protein detected on all membrane regions but enriched at the apical side. Mutational studies identified a short juxtamembrane sequence required for basolateral restriction of Punt in both wing discs and mammalian Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. This basolateral targeting (BLT) determinant can dominantly confer basolateral localization on an otherwise apical receptor. Rescue of <i>punt</i> mutants with transgenes altered in the targeting motif showed that flies expressing apicalized Punt due to the lack of a functional BLT displayed developmental defects, female sterility, and significant lethality. We also show that apicalized Punt does not produce an ectopic signal, indicating that the apical pool of Dpp is not a significant signaling source even when presented with Punt. Instead, we find that basolateral presentation of Punt is required for optimal signaling. Finally, we present evidence that the BLT acts through polarized sorting machinery that differs between types of epithelia. This suggests a code whereby each epithelial cell type may differentially traffic common receptors to enable distinctive responses to spatially localized pools of extracellular ligands.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Multiple molecular events underlie stochastic switching between 2 heritable cell states in fungi</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Naomi Ziv, Lucas R. Brenes, Alexander Johnson</p>

Eukaryotic transcriptional networks are often large and contain several levels of feedback regulation. Many of these networks have the ability to generate and maintain several distinct transcriptional states across multiple cell divisions and to switch between them. In certain instances, switching between cell states is stochastic, occurring in a small subset of cells of an isogenic population in a seemingly homogenous environment. Given the scarcity and unpredictability of switching in these cases, investigating the determining molecular events is challenging. White-opaque switching in the fungal species <i>Candida albicans</i> is an example of stably inherited cell states that are determined by a complex transcriptional network and can serve as an experimentally accessible model system to study characteristics important for stochastic cell fate switching in eukaryotes. In standard lab media, genetically identical cells maintain their cellular identity (either “white” or “opaque”) through thousands of cell divisions, and switching between the states is rare and stochastic. By isolating populations of white or opaque cells, previous studies have elucidated the many differences between the 2 stable cell states and identified a set of transcriptional regulators needed for cell type switching and maintenance of the 2 cell types. Yet, little is known about the molecular events that determine the rare, stochastic switching events that occur in single cells. We use microfluidics combined with fluorescent reporters to directly observe rare switching events between the white and opaque states. We investigate the stochastic nature of switching by beginning with white cells and monitoring the activation of Wor1, a master regulator and marker for the opaque state, in single cells and throughout cell pedigrees. Our results indicate that switching requires 2 stochastic steps; first an event occurs that predisposes a lineage of cells to switch. In the second step, some, but not all, of those predisposed cells rapidly express high levels of Wor1 and commit to the opaque state. To further understand the rapid rise in Wor1, we used a synthetic inducible system in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> into which a controllable <i>C</i>. <i>albicans</i> Wor1 and a reporter for its transcriptional control region have been introduced. We document that Wor1 positive autoregulation is highly cooperative (Hill coefficient > 3), leading to rapid activation and producing an “all or none” rather than a graded response. Taken together, our results suggest that reaching a threshold level of a master regulator is sufficient to drive cell type switching in single cells and that an earlier molecular event increases the probability of reaching that threshold in certain small lineages of cells. Quantitative molecular analysis of the white-opaque circuit can serve as a model for the general understanding of complex circuits.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Diet-responsive transcriptional regulation of insulin in a single neuron controls systemic metabolism</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Ava Handley, Qiuli Wu, Tessa Sherry, Rebecca Cornell, Roger Pocock</p>

Metabolic homeostasis is coordinated through a robust network of signaling pathways acting across all tissues. A key part of this network is insulin-like signaling, which is fundamental for surviving glucose stress. Here, we show that <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> fed excess dietary glucose reduce insulin-1 (INS-1) expression specifically in the BAG glutamatergic sensory neurons. We demonstrate that INS-1 expression in the BAG neurons is directly controlled by the transcription factor ETS-5, which is also down-regulated by glucose. We further find that INS-1 acts exclusively from the BAG neurons, and not other INS-1-expressing neurons, to systemically inhibit fat storage via the insulin-like receptor DAF-2. Together, these findings reveal an intertissue regulatory pathway where regulation of insulin expression in a specific neuron controls systemic metabolism in response to excess dietary glucose.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Unleashing frugal innovation in private higher education institutions via intellectual capital and Information technology capability: a systematic literature review [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Given the persistent challenges to the higher education business model, private higher education institutions (PHEIs) are exploring myriad ways to increase enrolment and income, while aggressively managing spending. Many PHEIs are facing financial distress and struggling because of decreasing budgets and declining revenue. Thus, carving unique strategies that direct the institution to focus on its core competencies, making additional budget cuts without compromising quality, developing new revenue streams, embracing new technology, and offering affordable programs, will ultimately lead to financial success. Frugal innovation (FI) can shed light on these challenges. Methods: This paper presents a systematic literature review to investigate and analyse prior research that focused on FI within the sphere of intellectual capital (IC) and information technology capabilities (ITC) research, and their relationships in PHEIs. Transfield’s five phases were employed to extract journal articles published over a thirty-year period (1990 to 2020) from major online databases using keyword searches. Although an initial search generated 76,025 papers, the search for IC and FI yielded 41 papers, and finally only two papers were selected as they clearly related IC with FI. Results: There was a research gap in the literature published from 1990 to 2020 regarding IC applications to achieve FI. This work revealed that IC and ITC research for FI in PHEI remain insufficiently explored.   Conclusions: Further research is required on the evaluation model of IC, ITC and FI, methodologies, empirical analysis, and the development of measurement metrics. A limitation to this study is the number of keywords selected.

                Background: Retinoic acid plays an essential role in testicular development and functions, especially spermatogenesis. We have reviewed the role of retinoic acid from basic (molecular) to clinical application. Methods: A search was conducted in the online database including PubMed, Google Scholar, and Scopus for English studies published in the last eight years about this issue. We used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines in assessing the studies we are going to investigate. Results: Studies indicated that retinoic acid plays an essential role during pluripotent stem cell migration and lineage commitment, cell differentiation, apoptosis, stem cell number regulation, and maturation arrest in spermatogenic cells. Retinoic acid can also affect related protein expression and signaling pathways at different stages of spermatogenesis. Four studies have applied retinoic acid to humans, all of them in the single-arm observational study. The results look promising but need further research with more controlled study methods, randomization, and large samples. Conclusions: This current systematic review emphasizes a novel retinoic acid mechanism that has not been well described in the literature previously on its functions during the first seven days of spermatogenesis, leading to new directions or explanations of male infertility cause and treatments as a part of reproductive health care.

     alt="Chemoarchitecture of area prostriata in adult and developing mice: Comparison with presubiculum and parasubiculum"/><p>The present study investigated the genoarchitecture of the mouse equivalent of area prostriata (Pro), which receives direct inputs from dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus and primary visual cortex (V1). In both adult and postnatal mice, many genes are expressed in layers 2–3 (e.g., Fstl1) or layer 5 (e.g., Lypd1) or both (not shown) of the prostriata, while some other genes are differentially expressed in the dorsal (e.g., Col5a1) and ventral (e.g., Cdh24) subdivisions of the prostriata. These gene expression patterns make the prostriata distinguishable from adjoining regions such as the postsubiculum and V1.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Retrosplenial area 29e, which was a cortical region described mostly in earlier rodent literature, is often included in the dorsal presubiculum (PrSd) or postsubiculum (PoS) in modern literature and commonly used brain atlases. Recent anatomical and molecular studies have revealed that retrosplenial area 29e belongs to the superficial layers of area prostriata, which in primates is found to be important in fast analysis of quickly moving objects in far peripheral visual field. As in primates, the prostriata in rodents adjoins area 29 (granular retrosplenial area), area 30 (agranular retrosplenial area), medial visual cortex, PrSd/PoS, parasubiculum (PaS), and postrhinal cortex (PoR). The present study aims to reveal the chemoarchitecture of the prostriata versus PrSd/PoS or PaS by means of a systematic survey of gene expression patterns in adult and developing mouse brains. First, we find many genes that display differential expression across the prostriata, PrSd/PoS, and PaS and that show obvious laminar expression patterns. Second, we reveal subsets of genes that selectively express in the dorsal or ventral parts of the prostriata, suggesting the existence of at least two subdivisions. Third, we detect some genes that shows differential expression in the prostriata of postnatal mouse brains from adjoining regions, thus enabling identification of the developing area prostriata. Fourth, gene expression difference of the prostriata from the medial primary visual cortex and PoR is also observed. Finally, molecular and connectional features of the prostriata in rodents and nonhuman primates are discussed and compared.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The central complex (CX) in the brain of insects is a highly conserved group of midline-spanning neuropils consisting of the upper and lower division of the central body, the protocerebral bridge, and the paired noduli. These neuropils are the substrate for a number of behaviors, most prominently goal-oriented locomotion. Honeybees have been a model organism for sky-compass orientation for more than 70 years, but there is still very limited knowledge about the structure and function of their CX. To advance and facilitate research on this brain area, we created a high-resolution three-dimensional atlas of the honeybee's CX and associated neuropils, including the posterior optic tubercles, the bulbs, and the anterior optic tubercles. To this end, we developed a modified version of the iterative shape averaging technique, which allowed us to achieve high volumetric accuracy of the neuropil models. For a finer definition of spatial locations within the central body, we defined layers based on immunostaining against the neuropeptides locustatachykinin, FMRFamide, gastrin/cholecystokinin, and allatostatin and included them into the atlas by elastic registration. Our honeybee CX atlas provides a platform for future neuroanatomical work.</p>

<p>NURR1 regulates the production of dopamine. Dopamine is present in dopaminergic neurons to regulate movement and emotion and in blood to control cardiac functions. Here, we demonstrated motor impairment, increased brain DA level and heart rate in old NURR1-deficient mice independently from sex, although sex affects their spontaneous locomotion.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The transcription factor NURR1 is essential to the generation and maintenance of midbrain dopaminergic (mDA) neurons and its deregulation is involved in the development of dopamine (DA)-associated brain disorders, such as Parkinson's disease (PD). The old male NURR1 heterozygous knockout (NURR1-KO) mouse has been proposed as a model of PD due to its altered motor performance that was, however, not confirmed in a subsequent study. Based on these controversial results, we explored the effects of the NURR1 deficiency on locomotor activity, motor coordination, brain and plasma DA levels, blood pressure and heart rate of old mice, also focusing on the potential effect of sex. As a probable consequence of the role of NURR1 in DA pathway, we observed that the old NURR1-KO mouse is characterized by motor impairment, and increased brain DA level and heart rate, independently from sex. However, we also observed an alteration in spontaneous locomotor activity that only affects males. In conclusion, NURR1 deficiency triggers sex- and age-specific alterations of behavioral responses, of DA levels and cardiovascular abnormalities. Further studies in simplified systems will be necessary to dissect the mechanism underlying these observations.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Plasma MIA, CRP, and albumin predict cognitive decline in Parkinson's Disease</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Using a multi-cohort, Discovery-Replication-Validation design, we sought new plasma biomarkers that predict which PD individuals will experience cognitive decline.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In 108 Discovery Cohort PD individuals and 83 Replication Cohort PD individuals, we measured 940 plasma proteins on an aptamer-based platform. Using proteins associating with subsequent cognitive decline in both cohorts, we trained a logistic regression model to predict which PD patients showed fast (&gt;=1 point drop/year on Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)) vs. slow (&lt;1 point drop/year on MoCA) cognitive decline in the Discovery Cohort, testing it in the Replication Cohort. We developed alternate assays for the top three proteins and confirmed their ability to predict cognitive decline – defined by change in MoCA or development of incident Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) or dementia – in a Validation Cohort of 118 PD individuals. We investigated the top plasma biomarker for causal influence by Mendelian randomization.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A model with only three proteins (Melanoma Inhibitory Activity Protein (MIA), C-Reactive Protein (CRP), albumin) separated Fast vs. Slow cognitive decline subgroups with an AUC of 0.80 in the Validation Cohort. Validation Cohort PD individuals in the top quartile of risk for cognitive decline based on this model were 4.4 times more likely to develop incident MCI or dementia than those in the lowest quartile. Genotypes at <i>MIA</i> SNP rs2233154 associated with MIA levels and cognitive decline, providing evidence for MIA's causal influence.</p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>An easily-obtained plasma-based predictor identifies PD individuals at risk for cognitive decline. MIA may participate causally in development of cognitive decline.</p>

     alt="Resveratrol inhibits the activity of acid-sensing ion channels in male rat dorsal root ganglion neurons"/>
<p>Acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) are expressed in nociceptive sensory neurons to detect changes in extracellular pH. Once ASICs are activated by H<sup>+</sup>, cation influx (largely Na<sup>+</sup>) will cause depolarization of membrane potentials and bursts of action potentials (APs), then resulting in pain. Resveratrol can inhibit ASICs, so that H<sup>+</sup> produces reduced responses in the amplitude of membrane currents and the number of APs, leading to a relief of acid-induced pain.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Resveratrol can relieve pain under various pain conditions. One of the mechanisms of resveratrol analgesia is the regulation of ion channels. Acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) are expressed predominantly in nociceptive sensory neurons to detect changes in extracellular pH. ASICs are important players in pain associated with tissue acidification. However, it is still unclear whether ASICs are resveratrol targets. Electrophysiological recordings showed that resveratrol decreased acid-induced and ASIC-mediated currents in male rat dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons in a concentration-dependent manner. Resveratrol downwardly shifted the concentration–response curve for protons, suggesting that it inhibited ASICs not by changing the pH<sub>0.5</sub>, but by suppressing the proton-induced maximum response. It also suppressed acid-triggered action potentials in the rat DRG neurons. Finally, intraplantar pretreatment with resveratrol relieved acid-induced nociceptive responses in male rats in a dose-dependent manner. These results indicated that resveratrol inhibited ASIC-mediated electrophysiological activity and nociception, suggesting a novel peripheral mechanism underlying its analgesic effect.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">MRI EVALUATION OF PERIVASCULAR SPACE ABNORMALITIES IN NEUROMYELITIS OPTICA</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Astrocytes outline the perivascular space (PVS) and regulate fluids exchange through the aquaporin-4 water channel. Since neuromyelitis optica is an autoimmune astrocytopathy targeting aquaporin-4, we hypothesize that it could be associatied with PVS abnormalities.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Thirty-four patients and 46 age- and sex-matched healthy controls from two independent cohorts (exploratory- and validation-dataset) underwent a standardized 3.0 T MRI protocol including conventional and diffusion-tensor imaging. Susceptibility-weighted imaging was also acquired in the exploratory-dataset. We evaluated macroscopic and microstructural abnormalities of PVS in terms of enlargement and water diffusivity (DTI-ALPS index). In the exploration-dataset, susceptibility-weighted sequence was used to draw the regions of interest for the DTI-ALPS index calculation in areas having veins perpendicular to lateral ventricles. Between-group comparisons, correlations and regression models were run to assess associations between PVS abnormalities, clinical and MRI variables.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Patients had higher frequency of severe PVS enlargement in the centrum semiovale (29.4% <i>vs</i>. 8.7%), which correlated with brain, deep grey matter atrophy and poorer cognitive performance (r values range: -0.44, -0.36; p values: 0.01-0.046).</p>
<p>In both datasets, patients had reduced DTI-ALPS index compared to controls (p values: 0.004-0.038). Lower DTI-ALPS index, deep grey matter volume and cortical volume could discriminate between patients and controls (R<sup>2</sup>=0.62), while lower DTI-ALPS index, higher number of myelitis, and higher T2-lesion volume associated with worse disability (R<sup>2</sup>=0.55).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Patients with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder are characterized by abnormal enlargement and impaired water diffusion along PVS, whose clinical implications suggest a direct correlation with disease pathogenesis and its severity.</p>
