                arXiv:2501.18770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) has emerged as a promising therapeutic intervention across various neurological and psychiatric conditions, including epilepsy, depression, and stroke rehabilitation; however, its mechanisms of action on neural circuits remain incompletely understood. Here, we present a novel theoretical framework based on predictive coding that conceptualizes VNS effects through differential modulation of feedforward and feedback neural circuits. Based on recent evidence, we propose that VNS shifts the balance between feedforward and feedback processing through multiple neuromodulatory systems, resulting in enhanced feedforward signal transmission. This framework integrates anatomical pathways, receptor distributions, and physiological responses to explain the influence of the VNS on neural dynamics across different spatial and temporal scales. VNS may facilitate neural plasticity and adaptive behavior through acetylcholine and noradrenaline (norepinephrine), which differentially modulate feedforward and feedback signaling. This mechanistic understanding serves as a basis for interpreting the cognitive and therapeutic outcomes across different clinical conditions. Our perspective provides a unified theoretical framework for understanding circuit-specific VNS effects and suggests new directions for investigating their therapeutic mechanisms.

                arXiv:2501.18772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dissociated neuronal cultures provide a simplified yet effective model system for investigating self-organized prediction and information processing in neural networks. This review consolidates current research demonstrating that these in vitro networks display fundamental computational capabilities, including predictive coding, adaptive learning, goal-directed behavior, and deviance detection. We examine how these cultures develop critical dynamics optimized for information processing, detail the mechanisms underlying learning and memory formation, and explore the relevance of the free energy principle within these systems. Building on these insights, we discuss how findings from dissociated neuronal cultures inform the design of neuromorphic and reservoir computing architectures, with the potential to enhance energy efficiency and adaptive functionality in artificial intelligence. The reduced complexity of neuronal cultures allows for precise manipulation and systematic investigation, bridging theoretical frameworks with practical implementations in bio-inspired computing. Finally, we highlight promising future directions, emphasizing advancements in three-dimensional culture techniques, multi-compartment models, and brain organoids that deepen our understanding of hierarchical and predictive processes in both biological and artificial systems. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of how dissociated neuronal cultures contribute to neuroscience and artificial intelligence, ultimately paving the way for biologically inspired computing solutions.

                arXiv:2501.19024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in network science, applied to \textit{in vivo} brain recordings, have paved the way for better understanding of the structure and function of the brain. However, despite its obvious usefulness in neuroscience, traditional network science lacks tools for -- so important -- simultaneous investigation of the inter-relationship between the two domains. In this chapter, I explore the increasing role of multilayer networks in building brain generative models and abilities of such models to uncover the full information about the brain complex spatiotemporal interactions that span across multiple scales and modalities. First, I begin with the theoretical foundation of brain networks accompanied by a brief overview of traditional networks and their role in constructing multilayer network models. Then, I delve into the applications of multilayer networks in neuroscience, particularly in deciphering structure-function relationship, modelling diseases, and integrating multi-scale and multi-modal data. Finally, I demonstrate how incorporating the multilayer framework into network neuroscience has brought to light previously hidden features of brain networks and, how multilayer networks can provide new insights and a description of the structure and function of the brain.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19106">Stiff-sloppy analysis of brain networks to reveal individual differences in task performance</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2501.19106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how brain networks recruit resources during cognitive tasks is key to explaining individual differences in task performance. Brain network parameters-including activity levels of regions and their connectivity-reflect the integration and segregation of functional subnetworks underlying task processing. However, the complexity and high dimensionality of these parameters pose a significant barrier to identifying functionally relevant individual differences. Here, we introduce stiff-sloppy analysis as a framework for uncovering the stiff parameter combinations that critically influence task-state brain dynamics, exemplified by working memory. Using the pairwise maximum entropy model (PMEM) calibrated to fMRI data and Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) analysis, we reveal that the stiff dimensions of the model parameters capture the most relevant integration and segregation processes of the default mode network and the working memory network. Individual differences along these stiff neural dimensions consistently correlate with working memory performance. Notably, stiff parameters robustly predicted working memory performance, even when the less sensitive ("sloppy") parameters were excluded. This study establishes stiff-sloppy analysis as a powerful approach to identify cognition-related brain networks, bridging neural dynamics and behavior and offering new avenues for personalized neuroscience including therapeutic innovation.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18716">Full-Head Segmentation of MRI with Abnormal Brain Anatomy: Model and Data Release</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2501.18716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The goal of this work was to develop a deep network for whole-head segmentation, including clinical MRIs with abnormal anatomy, and compile the first public benchmark dataset for this purpose. We collected 91 MRIs with volumetric segmentation labels for a diverse set of human subjects (4 normal, 32 traumatic brain injuries, and 57 strokes). These clinical cases are characterized by extended cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in regions normally containing the brain. Training labels were generated by manually correcting initial automated segmentations for skin/scalp, skull, CSF, gray matter, white matter, air cavity, and extracephalic air. We developed a MultiAxial network consisting of three 2D U-Net models that operate independently in sagittal, axial, and coronal planes and are then combined to produce a single 3D segmentation. The MultiAxial network achieved test-set Dice scores of 0.88 (median plus-minus 0.04). For brain tissue, it significantly outperforms existing brain segmentation methods (MultiAxial: 0.898 plus-minus 0.041, SynthSeg: 0.758 plus-minus 0.054, BrainChop: 0.757 plus-minus 0.125). The MultiAxial network gains in robustness by avoiding the need for coregistration with an atlas. It performed well in regions with abnormal anatomy and on images that have been de-identified. It enables more robust current flow modeling when incorporated into ROAST, a widely-used modeling toolbox for transcranial electric stimulation. We are releasing a state-of-the-art model for whole-head MRI segmentation, along with a dataset of 61 clinical MRIs and training labels, including non-brain structures. Together, the model and data may serve as a benchmark for future efforts.

                arXiv:2501.18945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the inverse problem of multi-armed bandits (IMAB) that are widely used in neuroscience and psychology research for behavior modelling. We first show that the IMAB problem is not convex in general, but can be relaxed to a convex problem via variable transformation. Based on this result, we propose a two-step sequential heuristic for (approximately) solving the IMAB problem. We discuss a condition where our method provides global solution to the IMAB problem with certificate, as well as approximations to further save computing time. Numerical experiments indicate that our heuristic method is more robust than directly solving the IMAB problem via repeated local optimization, and can achieve the performance of Monte Carlo methods within a significantly decreased running time. We provide the implementation of our method based on CVXPY, which allows straightforward application by users not well versed in convex optimization.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19262">The role of oscillations in grid cells' toroidal topology</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2501.19262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Persistent homology applied to the activity of grid cells in the Medial Entorhinal Cortex suggests that this activity lies on a toroidal manifold. By analyzing real data and a simple model, we show that neural oscillations play a key role in the appearance of this toroidal topology. To quantitatively monitor how changes in spike trains influence the topology of the data, we first define a robust measure for the degree of toroidality of a dataset. Using this measure, we find that small perturbations ($\sim$ 100 ms) of spike times have little influence on both the toroidality and the hexagonality of the ratemaps. Jittering spikes by $\sim$ 100-500 ms, however, destroys the toroidal topology, while still having little impact on grid scores. These critical jittering time scales fall in the range of the periods of oscillations between the theta and eta bands. We thus hypothesized that these oscillatory modulations of neuronal spiking play a key role in the appearance and robustness of toroidal topology and the hexagonal spatial selectivity is not sufficient. We confirmed this hypothesis using a simple model for the activity of grid cells, consisting of an ensemble of independent rate-modulated Poisson processes. When these rates were modulated by oscillations, the network behaved similarly to the real data in exhibiting toroidal topology, even when the position of the fields were perturbed. In the absence of oscillations, this similarity was substantially lower. Furthermore, we find that the experimentally recorded spike trains indeed exhibit temporal modulations at the eta and theta bands, and that the ratio of the power in the eta band to that of the theta band, $A_{\eta}/A_{\theta}$, correlates with the critical jittering time at which the toroidal topology disappears.

Abstract: Mammalian whole-brain connectomes are a foundational ingredient for holistic understanding of brains. Indeed, imaging connectomes at sufficient resolution to densely reconstruct cellular morphology and synapses represents a longstanding goal in neuroscience. Mouse connectomes could soon come within reach while human connectomes remain a more distant yet still worthy goal. Though the technologies needed to reconstruct whole-brain connectomes have not yet reached full maturity, they are advancing rapidly. Close examination of these technologies may help plan connectomics projects. Here, we quantitatively compare imaging technologies that have potential to enable whole-brain mammalian connectomics. We perform calculations on electron microscopy (EM) techniques and expansion light-sheet fluorescence microscopy (ExLSFM) methods. We consider techniques that have sufficient resolution to identify all synapses and sufficient speed to be relevant for whole mammalian brains. We offer this analysis as a resource for those considering how to organize efforts towards imaging whole-brain mammalian connectomes.

                arXiv:2405.19420v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Humans rely on effective representations to learn from few examples and abstract useful information from sensory data. Inducing such representations in machine learning models has been shown to improve their performance on various benchmarks such as few-shot learning and robustness. However, finding effective training procedures to achieve that goal can be challenging as psychologically rich training data such as human similarity judgments are expensive to scale, and Bayesian models of human inductive biases are often intractable for complex, realistic domains. Here, we address this challenge by leveraging a Bayesian notion of generative similarity whereby two data points are considered similar if they are likely to have been sampled from the same distribution. This measure can be applied to complex generative processes, including probabilistic programs. We incorporate generative similarity into a contrastive learning objective to enable learning of embeddings that express human cognitive representations. We demonstrate the utility of our approach by showing that it can be used to capture human-like representations of shape regularity, abstract Euclidean geometric concepts, and semantic hierarchies for natural images.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03710">Inverse decision-making using neural amortized Bayesian actors</a></h4>

Abstract: Bayesian observer and actor models have provided normative explanations for many behavioral phenomena in perception, sensorimotor control, and other areas of cognitive science and neuroscience. They attribute behavioral variability and biases to interpretable entities such as perceptual and motor uncertainty, prior beliefs, and behavioral costs. However, when extending these models to more naturalistic tasks with continuous actions, solving the Bayesian decision-making problem is often analytically intractable. Inverse decision-making, i.e. performing inference over the parameters of such models given behavioral data, is computationally even more difficult. Therefore, researchers typically constrain their models to easily tractable components, such as Gaussian distributions or quadratic cost functions, or resort to numerical approximations. To overcome these limitations, we amortize the Bayesian actor using a neural network trained on a wide range of parameter settings in an unsupervised fashion. Using the pre-trained neural network enables performing efficient gradient-based Bayesian inference of the Bayesian actor model's parameters. We show on synthetic data that the inferred posterior distributions are in close alignment with those obtained using analytical solutions where they exist. Where no analytical solution is available, we recover posterior distributions close to the ground truth. We then show how our method allows for principled model comparison and how it can be used to disentangle factors that may lead to unidentifiabilities between priors and costs. Finally, we apply our method to empirical data from three sensorimotor tasks and compare model fits with different cost functions to show that it can explain individuals' behavioral patterns.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13872">BLEND: Behavior-guided Neural Population Dynamics Modeling via Privileged Knowledge Distillation</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.13872v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modeling the nonlinear dynamics of neuronal populations represents a key pursuit in computational neuroscience. Recent research has increasingly focused on jointly modeling neural activity and behavior to unravel their interconnections. Despite significant efforts, these approaches often necessitate either intricate model designs or oversimplified assumptions. Given the frequent absence of perfectly paired neural-behavioral datasets in real-world scenarios when deploying these models, a critical yet understudied research question emerges: how to develop a model that performs well using only neural activity as input at inference, while benefiting from the insights gained from behavioral signals during training?
  To this end, we propose BLEND, the behavior-guided neural population dynamics modeling framework via privileged knowledge distillation. By considering behavior as privileged information, we train a teacher model that takes both behavior observations (privileged features) and neural activities (regular features) as inputs. A student model is then distilled using only neural activity. Unlike existing methods, our framework is model-agnostic and avoids making strong assumptions about the relationship between behavior and neural activity. This allows BLEND to enhance existing neural dynamics modeling architectures without developing specialized models from scratch. Extensive experiments across neural population activity modeling and transcriptomic neuron identity prediction tasks demonstrate strong capabilities of BLEND, reporting over 50% improvement in behavioral decoding and over 15% improvement in transcriptomic neuron identity prediction after behavior-guided distillation. Furthermore, we empirically explore various behavior-guided distillation strategies within the BLEND framework and present a comprehensive analysis of effectiveness and implications for model performance.

                arXiv:2501.18723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quality-Diversity optimization comprises a family of evolutionary algorithms aimed at generating a collection of diverse and high-performing solutions. MAP-Elites (ME), a notable example, is used effectively in fields like evolutionary robotics. However, the reliance of ME on random mutations from Genetic Algorithms limits its ability to evolve high-dimensional solutions. Methods proposed to overcome this include using gradient-based operators like policy gradients or natural evolution strategies. While successful at scaling ME for neuroevolution, these methods often suffer from slow training speeds, or difficulties in scaling with massive parallelization due to high computational demands or reliance on centralized actor-critic training. In this work, we introduce a fast, sample-efficient ME based algorithm capable of scaling up with massive parallelization, significantly reducing runtimes without compromising performance. Our method, ASCII-ME, unlike existing policy gradient quality-diversity methods, does not rely on centralized actor-critic training. It performs behavioral variations based on time step performance metrics and maps these variations to solutions using policy gradients. Our experiments show that ASCII-ME can generate a diverse collection of high-performing deep neural network policies in less than 250 seconds on a single GPU. Additionally, it operates on average, five times faster than state-of-the-art algorithms while still maintaining competitive sample efficiency.

Abstract: We introduce Genetic AI, a novel method for data analysis by evolutionary simulations. The method can be applied to data of any domain and allows for a data-less training of AI models. Without employing predefined rules or training data, Genetic AI first converts the input data into genes and organisms. In a simulation from first principles, these genes and organisms compete for fitness, where their behavior is governed by universal evolutionary strategies. Investigating evolutionary stable equilibriums, Genetic AI helps understanding correlations and symmetries in general input data. Several numerical experiments demonstrate the dynamics of exemplary systems.

                arXiv:2501.18666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study how a one-layer attention-only transformer develops relevant structures while learning to sort lists of numbers. At the end of training, the model organizes its attention heads in two main modes that we refer to as vocabulary-splitting and copy-suppression. Both represent simpler modes than having multiple heads handle overlapping ranges of numbers. Interestingly, vocabulary-splitting is present regardless of whether we use weight decay, a common regularization technique thought to drive simplification, supporting the thesis that neural networks naturally prefer simpler solutions. We relate copy-suppression to a mechanism in GPT-2 and investigate its functional role in our model. Guided by insights from a developmental analysis of the model, we identify features in the training data that drive the model's final acquired solution. This provides a concrete example of how the training data shape the internal organization of transformers, paving the way for future studies that could help us better understand how LLMs develop their internal structures.

                arXiv:2501.19259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of human-intuitive interactions into autonomous systems has been limited. Traditional Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems struggle with context and intent understanding, severely restricting human-robot interaction. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed this dynamic, allowing for intuitive and high-level communication through speech and text, and bridging the gap between human commands and robotic actions. Additionally, autonomous navigation has emerged as a central focus in robotics research, with artificial intelligence (AI) increasingly being leveraged to enhance these systems. However, existing AI-based navigation algorithms face significant challenges in latency-critical tasks where rapid decision-making is critical. Traditional frame-based vision systems, while effective for high-level decision-making, suffer from high energy consumption and latency, limiting their applicability in real-time scenarios. Neuromorphic vision systems, combining event-based cameras and spiking neural networks (SNNs), offer a promising alternative by enabling energy-efficient, low-latency navigation. Despite their potential, real-world implementations of these systems, particularly on physical platforms such as drones, remain scarce. In this work, we present Neuro-LIFT, a real-time neuromorphic navigation framework implemented on a Parrot Bebop2 quadrotor. Leveraging an LLM for natural language processing, Neuro-LIFT translates human speech into high-level planning commands which are then autonomously executed using event-based neuromorphic vision and physics-driven planning. Our framework demonstrates its capabilities in navigating in a dynamic environment, avoiding obstacles, and adapting to human instructions in real-time.

                arXiv:2212.01232v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Event-based machine learning promises more energy-efficient AI on future neuromorphic hardware. Here, we investigate how the recently discovered Eventprop algorithm for gradient descent on exact gradients in spiking neural networks can be scaled up to challenging keyword recognition benchmarks. We implemented Eventprop in the GPU-enhanced Neural Networks framework and used it for training recurrent spiking neural networks on the Spiking Heidelberg Digits and Spiking Speech Commands datasets. We found that learning depended strongly on the loss function and extended Eventprop to a wider class of loss functions to enable effective training. We then tested a large number of data augmentations and regularisations as well as exploring different network structures; and heterogeneous and trainable timescales. We found that when combined with two specific augmentations, the right regularisation and a delay line input, Eventprop networks with one recurrent layer achieved state-of-the-art performance on Spiking Heidelberg Digits and good accuracy on Spiking Speech Commands. In comparison to a leading surrogate-gradient-based SNN training method, our GeNN Eventprop implementation is 3X faster and uses 4X less memory. This work is a significant step towards a low-power neuromorphic alternative to current machine learning paradigms.

                arXiv:2409.06706v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Advances in Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) bridged the performance gap with Full Fine-Tuning (FFT) through sophisticated analysis of pre-trained parameter spaces. Starting from drawing insights from Neural Engrams (NE) in Biological Neural Networks (BNNs), we establish a connection between the low-rank property observed during PEFT's parameter space shifting and neurobiological mechanisms. This observation leads to our proposed method, Synapse and Neuron (SAN), which decomposes and propagates scaling components from anterior feature adjusting vectors towards posterior weight matrices. Our approach is theoretically grounded in Long-Term Potentiation/Depression (LTP/D) phenomena, which govern synapse development through neurotransmitter release modulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate its effectiveness: on \textbf{vision tasks} across VTAB, FGVC, and GIC (25 datasets) using ViT, SwinT and ConvNeXt, SAN outperforms FFT up to 8.7% and LoRA by 3.2%; on language tasks using Commonsense Reasoning (8 datasets) with LLaMA models (all generations), surpassing ChatGPT up to 8.5% and LoRA by 4.7%; on visual-language tasks using Mixed Visual Instruction (7 datasets) with LLaVA models, it exceeds FFT up to 2.4% and LoRA by 1.9%.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are attracting increased attention as a more energy-efficient alternative to traditional Artificial Neural Networks. Spiking neurons are stateful and intrinsically recurrent, making them well-suited for spatio-temporal tasks. However, this intrinsic memory is limited by synaptic and membrane time constants. A powerful additional mechanism are delays. In this paper, we propose a novel event-based training method for SNNs with delays, grounded in the EventProp formalism and enabling the calculation of exact gradients with respect to weights and delays. Our method supports multiple spikes per neuron and, to our best knowledge, is the first delay learning algorithm to be applied to recurrent SNNs. We evaluate our method on a simple sequence detection task, and the Yin-Yang, Spiking Heidelberg Digits and Spiking Speech Commands datasets, demonstrating that our algorithm can optimize delays from suboptimal initial conditions and enhance classification accuracy compared to architectures without delays. Finally, we show that our approach uses less than half the memory of the current state-of-the-art delay-learning method and is up to 26x faster.

Abstract: Military personnel and security agents often face significant physical risks during conflict and engagement situations, particularly in urban operations. Ensuring the rapid and accurate communication of incidents involving injuries is crucial for the timely execution of rescue operations. This article presents research conducted under the scope of the Brazilian Navy's ``Soldier of the Future'' project, focusing on the development of a Casualty Detection System to identify injuries that could incapacitate a soldier and lead to severe blood loss. The study specifically addresses the detection of soldier falls, which may indicate critical injuries such as hypovolemic hemorrhagic shock. To generate the publicly available dataset, we used smartwatches and smartphones as wearable devices to collect inertial data from soldiers during various activities, including simulated falls. The data were used to train 1D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN1D) with the objective of accurately classifying falls that could result from life-threatening injuries. We explored different sensor placements (on the wrists and near the center of mass) and various approaches to using inertial variables, including linear and angular accelerations. The neural network models were optimized using Bayesian techniques to enhance their performance. The best-performing model and its results, discussed in this article, contribute to the advancement of automated systems for monitoring soldier safety and improving response times in engagement scenarios.

">A Sensitive Soma-localized Red Fluorescent Calcium Indicator for Multi-Modality Imaging of Neuronal Populations In Vivo</a></h4>

              
                Recent advancements in genetically encoded calcium indicators, particularly those based on green fluorescent proteins, have optimized their performance for monitoring neuronal activities in a variety of model organisms. However, progress in developing red-shifted GECIs, despite their advantages over green indicators, has been slower, resulting in fewer options for end-users. In this study, we explored topological inversion and soma-targeting strategies, which are complementary to conventional mutagenesis, to re-engineer a red genetically encoded calcium indicator, FRCaMP, for enhanced in vivo performance. The resulting sensors, FRCaMPi and soma-targeted FRCaMPi (SomaFRCaMPi), exhibit up to 2-fold higher dynamic range and peak {Delta}F/F0 per single AP compared to widely used jRGECO1a in neurons in culture and in vivo. Compared to jRGECO1a and FRCaMPi, SomaFRCaMPi reduces erroneous correlation of neuronal activity in the brains of mice and zebrafish by two- to four-fold due to diminished neuropil contamination without compromising the signal-to-noise ratio. Under wide-field imaging in primary somatosensory and visual cortex in mice with high labeling density (80-90%), SomaFRCaMPi exhibits up to 40% higher SNR and decreased artifactual correlation across neurons. Altogether, SomaFRCaMPi improves the accuracy and scale of neuronal activity imaging at single-neuron resolution in densely labeled brain tissues due to a 2-3-fold enhanced automated neuronal segmentation, 50% higher fraction of responsive cells, up to 2-fold higher SNR compared to jRGECO1a. Our findings highlight the potential of SomaFRCaMPi, comparable to the most sensitive soma-targeted GCaMP, for precise spatial recording of neuronal populations using popular imaging modalities in model organisms such as zebrafish and mice.

">Neuronal endolysosomal acidification relies on interactions between transmembrane protein 184B (TMEM184B) and the vesicular proton pump</a></h4>

              
                Disruption of endolysosomal acidification is a hallmark of several neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. Impaired acidification causes accumulation of toxic protein aggregates and disrupts neuronal homeostasis, yet the molecular mechanisms regulating endolysosomal pH in neurons remain poorly understood. A critical regulator of lumenal acidification is the vacuolar ATPase (V- ATPase), a proton pump whose activity depends on dynamic assembly of its V0 and V1 subdomains. In this study, we identify transmembrane protein 184B (TMEM184B) as a novel regulator of endolysosomal acidification in neurons. TMEM184B is an evolutionarily conserved 7-pass transmembrane protein required for synaptic structure and function, and sequence variation in TMEM184B causes neurodevelopmental disorders, but the mechanism for this effect is unknown. We performed proteomic analysis of TMEM184B-interacting proteins and identified enrichment of components involved in endosomal trafficking and function, including the V-ATPase. TMEM184B localizes to early and late endosomes, further supporting a role in the endosomal system. Loss of TMEM184B results in significant reductions in endolysosomal acidification within cultured mouse cortical neurons. This alteration in pH is associated with impaired assembly of the V-ATPase V0 and V1 subcomplexes in the absence of TMEM184B, suggesting a mechanism by which TMEM184B promotes flux through the endosomal pathway. Overall, these findings identify a new contributor in maintaining endosomal function and provide a mechanistic basis for disrupted neuronal function in human TMEM184B-associated nervous system disorders.

">Dose Escalation in Pentylenetetrazol Kindling Detects Differences in Chronic Seizure Susceptibility</a></h4>

              
                Objective: Pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) kindling is a widely used model for inducing epileptogenesis and evaluating long-term seizure susceptibility differences among animals. This model is typically performed by chronic, repetitive exposures to a constant subconvulsive PTZ dose. However, the effectiveness of the commonly used subconvulsive dose (35mg/kg) varies among different animal groups and experimental conditions due to factors such as species, age, sex, and genetic background. The objective of this study was to characterize a novel model of kindling, the PTZ Dose Escalation (PTZ-DE) model, which assesses chronic seizure threshold with enhanced sensitivity by empirically determining the minimally effective dose to induce PTZ kindling for specific experimental conditions. Methods: This study investigated the efficacy and validity of the PTZ-DE model by comparing its performance to the standard PTZ kindling approach across a series of conditions. First, the ability of the PTZ-DE model to produce the gradual increase in chronic seizure severity response characteristic of PTZ kindling was compared to the standard model across multiple animal background characteristics (strain, sex). Next, the validity of this model was investigated by determining whether the PTZ-DE model could replicate similar changes in chronic seizure susceptibility previously published using the standard approach after traumatic brain injury (TBI). Lastly, the PTZ-DE model efficacy to detect seizure differences was measured in a condition (glyburide treatment) in which alterations to chronic seizure susceptibility were not detected with standard kindling. Results: This study found that the PTZ-DE model corrects for background differences in PTZ susceptibility, replicates known differences in chronic seizure thresholds after TBI, and identifies new alterations in seizure threshold not detected with traditional kindling methods. Significance: The PTZ-DE model may prove to be a superior tool to standard PTZ kindling for discovering new pathological mechanisms of epileptogenesis and for developing targeted therapies for chronic seizure management, as evidenced by its ability to detect subtle differences in seizure susceptibility across various experimental conditions.

">Multilingual Computational Models Reveal Shared Brain Responses to 21 Languages</a></h4>

              
                At the heart of language neuroscience lies a fundamental question: How does the human brain process the rich variety of languages? Recent developments in Natural Language Processing, particularly in multilingual neural network language models, offer a promising avenue to answer this question by providing a theory-agnostic way of representing linguistic content across languages. Our study leverages these advances to ask how the brains of native speakers of 21 languages respond to linguistic stimuli, and to what extent linguistic representations are similar across languages. We combined existing (12 languages across 4 language families; n=24 participants) and newly collected fMRI data (9 languages across 4 language families; n=27 participants) to evaluate a series of encoding models predicting brain activity in the language network based on representations from diverse multilingual language models (20 models across 8 model classes). We found evidence of cross-lingual robustness in the alignment between language representations in artificial and biological neural networks. Critically, we showed that the encoding models can be transferred zero-shot across languages, so that a model trained to predict brain activity in a set of languages can account for brain responses in a held-out language, even across language families. These results imply a shared component in the processing of different languages, plausibly related to a shared meaning space.

	<p>Background/Objectives Studies in rodents indicate that disruptions in both cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) signaling pathways are involved in the development of hyperactive behavior. We examined whether vinpocetine, a phosphodiesterase type 1 inhibitor that enhances brain cAMP and cGMP levels, could mitigate locomotor hyperactivity in mice exposed to lead during early development. Methods Swiss mice were exposed to 90 ppm of lead in their drinking water throughout gestation and the first ten postnatal days. At postnatal day 10 (PN10), blood lead levels (BLLs) were about 30 &amp;amp;micro;g/dL. At PN30, animals either received vinpocetine (20 mg/kg, i.p.) or a vehicle 4 h before the evaluation of locomotor activity in the open field. Results Lead-exposed males did not display differences in locomotor activity compared to controls, while lead-exposed females showed a significant increase in locomotion. Vinpocetine treatment significantly reversed the lead-induced hyperactivity in females. Conclusions These findings suggest that the cAMP and cGMP signaling pathways play a role in the hyperactivity induced by lead exposure.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The neurodegenerative processes driving the build-up of disability in progressive multiple sclerosis (P-MS) have not been fully elucidated. Recent data link cellular senescence (CS) to neurodegeneration. We investigated for evidence of CS in P-MS and sought to determine its pattern.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We used 53BP1, p16, and lipofuscin as markers of CS in white matter lesions (WMLs), normal appearing white matter (NAWM), normal appearing cortical gray matter (NAGM), control white matter (CWM), and control gray matter (CGM) on autopsy material from patient with P-MS and healthy controls. Senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) factors were quantified in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>P16<sup>+</sup> cell counts were significantly increased in WMLs and GMLs, compared with NAWM, CWM, NAGM, and CGM and lipofuscin<sup>+</sup> cells were significantly increased in WMLs, compared with NAWM and CWM, indicating more abundant CS in demyelinated lesions. The 53BP1<sup>+</sup> cells in WMLs were significantly increased compared with NAWM and CWM. The 53BP1<sup>+</sup> and p16<sup>+</sup> cells were found significantly more abundant in acute active WMLs and GMLs, compared with chronic inactive lesions. Co-localization studies showed evidence of CS in neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, microglia, and macrophages. Among the quantified CSF SASP factors, IL-6, MIF, and MIP1a levels correlated with 53BP1<sup>+</sup> cell counts in NAGM, whereas IL-10 levels correlated with p16<sup>+</sup> cell counts in NAWM. P16<sup>+</sup> cell counts in WMLs exhibited an inverse correlation with time to requiring a wheelchair and with age at death.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our data indicates that CS primarily affects actively demyelinating gray and WMLs. A higher senescent cell load in P-MS is associated with faster disability progression and death. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective is to evaluate cognitive and behavioral progression and identify early predictors of these changes in a cohort of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A total of 161 ALS patients were tested at diagnosis (T0), and 107 were re-tested after 1 year (T1) using cognitive/behavioral tests. All patients underwent whole-genome sequencing, and 46 patients (ALS-normal cognition [CN]) underwent [18F]Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Of the 161 patients, 107 were re-rested at T1; non-retested patients included 10 with frontotemporal dementia and 44 who were either non-testable or deceased. At T0, 67 patients (62.6%) were classified as ALS-CN, whereas 40 (38.4%) showed some degree of cognitive/behavioral impairment. Eighteen ALS-CN patients (26.9%) experienced cognitive decline at T1. Phenoconverters had lower baseline scores in letter fluency (Letter Fluency Test [FAS]) (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), Edinburgh Cognitive and Behavioral ALS Screen (ECAS) verbal fluency score (<i>p</i> = 0.017). Both tests were independently predictive of phenoconversion in binary logistic regression models, with optimal cut-off scores of 28.75 and 14.2, with good sensitivity and specificity. Other predictors included older age, lower education, and ALS-related genetic variants. Phenoconverters were hypometabolic in the left temporal lobe. Thirteen (32.5%) of the 40 patients with cognitive impairment at T0 worsened by T1, with FAS (<i>p</i> = 0.02) and the ECAS verbal fluency score (<i>p</i> = 0.023) predicting further decline.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Approximately 30% of ALS patients experienced cognitive/behavioral decline within the first year after diagnosis. FAS and ECAS verbal fluency were predictive of cognitive phenoconversion. Our findings highlight the importance of early detection of at-risk individuals and the need for longitudinal cognitive assessments to monitor disease progression. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Some individuals demonstrate greater cognitive resilience—the ability to maintain cognitive performance despite adverse brain-related changes—through as yet unknown mechanisms. We examined whether cortical thickness in several brain regions confers resilience against cognitive decline in amyloid-positive adults by moderating the effects of thinner cortex in Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related brain regions and of higher levels of tau.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Amyloid-positive participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative with relevant imaging data were included (n = 160, observations = 473). Risk factors included an AD brain signature and cerebrospinal fluid phosphorylated tau. Cognitive measures were episodic memory and executive function composites. Mixed effects models tested whether region-specific cortical thickness moderated relationships between markers of AD risk and memory or executive function.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Cross-sectionally, thicker cortex in 8 regions minimized the negative impact of thinner cortex/smaller volume in AD signature regions on executive function. Longitudinally, higher baseline thickness in a composite of these 8 regions predicted less memory decline (<i>p</i> = 0.007) and weakened negative effects of phosphorylated tau on memory decline (<i>p</i> = 0.014), independent of baseline cognition and risk markers.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We identified 8 cortical regions that appear to confer cognitive resilience cross-sectionally and longitudinally in the face of established indicators of AD pathology. Brain regions fostering executive function may enable compensation in later memory performance and confer cognitive resilience against effects of phosphorylated tau and AD-related cortical changes. These “resilience” regions suggest the value of focusing on brain regions beyond only those determined to be AD-related and may partially explain variability in AD-related cognitive trajectories.

                Several recent studies, enabled by advances in neuroimaging methods and large-scale datasets, have identified areas in human ventral visual cortex that respond more strongly to food images than to images of many other categories, adding to our knowledge about the broad network of regions that are responsive to food. This finding raises important questions about the evolutionary and developmental origins of a possible food-selective neural population, as well as larger questions about the origins of category-selective neural populations more generally. Here, we propose a framework for how visual properties of food (particularly color) and nonvisual signals associated with multimodal reward processing, social cognition, and physical interactions with food may, in combination, contribute to the emergence of food selectivity. We discuss recent research that sheds light on each of these factors, alongside a broader account of category selectivity that incorporates both visual feature statistics and behavioral relevance.

">VIP interneurons control hippocampal place cell remapping through transient disinhibition in novel environments.</a></h4>

              
                Hippocampal place cells dynamically reorganize their activity, or 'remap', to encode novel spatial environments, a process tightly regulated by inhibitory networks. Here, we identify vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-expressing interneurons as key regulators of this plasticity. Using all-optical methods in mice navigating virtual reality, we show that novel environments trigger a transient increase in VIP interneuron activity, which facilitates rapid place field formation and stable spatial map construction. Bidirectional optogenetic manipulation -suppressing or upregulating VIP interneuron activity- modulates the speed of spatial map formation and alters signatures of behavioral timescale plasticity (BTSP), a mechanism critical for place field induction. Both insufficient and excessive VIP interneuron activity impair reward-seeking behavior specifically in novel environments, revealing that a precise balance of VIP activity is essential for spatial learning. Our findings demonstrate that VIP interneurons gate a temporal window for place cell plasticity, mediating the impact of environmental novelty on hippocampal remapping and spatial memory.

">Grin2a Dysfunction Impairs Cognitive Flexibility by Disrupting LC Modulation of mPFC Circuits</a></h4>

              
                Cognitive flexibility, a key executive function, is impaired in psychiatric disorders involving prefrontal cortical dysfunction. The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) regulates cognitive flexibility and receives noradrenergic input from the locus coeruleus (LC). Mutations in GRIN2A, encoding GluN2A-containing NMDA receptors, impair cognitive flexibility and psychiatric resilience, yet the circuit mechanisms remain unclear. Optogenetic LC[-&gt;]mPFC activation improved reversal learning in wild-type and Grin2a heterozygous (HET) mice but not in knockouts (KO), indicating a loss of noradrenergic modulation. Grin2a mutants displayed disrupted gamma and high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) in the mPFC. Exogenous norepinephrine failed to restore oscillatory activity, implicating 2-adrenoceptors in NE-driven cortical dynamics. Increased LC innervation and norepinephrine transporter (NET) expression in Grin2a mutants suggest excessive noradrenergic input and impaired NE clearance. These findings identify GluN2A as essential for LC-driven prefrontal network synchronization and cognitive flexibility, offering insights into NE dysfunction in psychiatric disorders.

">Dicer loss in Muller glia leads to a defined sequence of pathological events beginning with cone dysfunction</a></h4>

              
                Purpose: The loss of Dicer in Muller glia (MG) results in severe photoreceptor degeneration as it occurs in retinitis pigmentosa or AMD. However, the sequence of events leading to this severe degenerative state is unknown. The aim of this study was to conduct a chronological functional and structural characterization of the pathological events in MG-specific Dicer-cKO mice in vivo and histologically. Methods: To delete Dicer and mature microRNAs (miRNAs) in MG, two conditional Dicer1 knock-out mouse strains namely RlbpCre:Dicer-cKOMG and GlastCre:Dicer-cKOMG, were created. Optical coherence tomography (OCT), electroretinograms (ERGs) as well as histological analyses were conducted to investigate structural and functional changes up to six months after Dicer deletion. Results: Dicer/miRNA loss in MG leads to 1) impairments of the external limiting membrane (ELM) / retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), 2) cone photoreceptor dysfunction and 3) retinal remodeling and functional loss of the inner retina, 1, 3 and 6 months after Dicer loss, respectively, in both strains. Furthermore, in the Rlbp:Dicer-cKOMG strain, rod photoreceptor impairment was found 4 months after Dicer depletion (4) accompanied by alteration of RPE integrity (5). Conclusions: MG Dicer loss in the adult mouse retina impacts cone function prior to any measurable changes in rod function, suggesting a pivotal role for MG Dicer and miRNAs in supporting cone health. A partially impaired RPE however seems to accelerate rod degeneration and overall degenerative events.

">A Bayesian decision-making model of implicit motor learning from internal and external errors</a></h4>

              
                A key challenge for the sensorimotor system is deciding which errors to learn from and which to ignore. Recent work has shown that humans are remarkably precise in parsing movement errors into internally- and externally-generated components for this purpose: Participants automatically ignore internally-generated reaching errors caused by motor noise, yet implicitly adapt to size-matched externally-generated errors caused by visuomotor rotations (Ranjan & Smith 2018, 2022). Following replication of these results with 16 neurotypical adults, we formalized our understanding of this behavior with a novel Bayesian decision-making model. The Parsing of Internal and External Causes of Error (PIECE) model frames adaptation as a process of causal inference regarding the source of error, with the magnitude of motor corrections reflecting a combination of state estimation and the observer's degree-of-belief that their movement was externally perturbed. Thus, PIECE presents a challenge to a class of computational models that frames adaptation as a process of re-aligning the perceived hand position with the movement goal. We show that only PIECE can capture the precise parsing of internal versus external errors observed. Combined, this work provides a normative explanation of how the nervous system discounts intrinsic motor noise and adapts to perturbations, keeping movements finely-calibrated.

">BlueBerry: Closed-loop wireless optogenetic manipulation in freely moving animals</a></h4>

              
                Optogenetics is a powerful tool for neuroscientists, enabling manipulations of neuronal activity to explore their effects on behavior. Recent advances in wireless technology enabled the development of novel remotely controlled optogenetic devices, thereby promising to facilitate the study of more complex behaviors, including social interactions. Yet, studying such behaviors in real time and automated manner in large scale naturalistic settings or with multiple animals remains challenging. In addition, many published devices can only be reproduced in labs having specific engineering skills and fabrication facilities and are thus not accessible for the larger neuroscience community. Here we introduce BlueBerry, an open-source, multi-channel optogenetic device that can be assembled with off the shelf components. The lightweight (1.4 g) design and robust long-range communication makes Blueberry an ideal tool for behavior-triggered optogenetic studies with multiple animals interacting freely in a large-scale setting. We show how BlueBerry can be used to guide decision making during spatial navigation and demonstrate for the first time that social dynamics can be rapidly altered in groups of mice by triggering specific social behavior with closed-loop optogenetics.

">The relationship between neural differentiation and exploratory eye movements in healthy young and older adults</a></h4>

              
                Age-related neural dedifferentiation, characterized by lower selectivity of neural responses in the high-level sensory cortex, is thought to be a major contributor to age-related cognitive decline. However, the mechanisms that underlie dedifferentiation are poorly understood. Building on prior evidence that exploratory eye movements differ with age, we investigated the role that eye movement might play in age-related declines in neural selectivity. Healthy young and older adults of both sexes underwent fMRI with simultaneous eye-tracking as they viewed words paired with images of scenes and objects prior to a memory test. Consistent with numerous prior reports, multivoxel pattern similarity analysis (PSA) of the fMRI data revealed age-related neural dedifferentiation in scene-selective, but not object-selective cortex. Eye movements, operationalized as the number of gaze fixations made during stimulus viewing, were elevated in older adults. Analyses examining the relationship between trial-wise estimates of neural selectivity and fixation count revealed an age-invariant positive relationship in the object-selective lateral occipital complex. However, this association was found to be age-dependent in scene-selective cortex, such that there was a robust positive relationship between scene selectivity and fixation count in young, but not older adults. Lastly, scene-related selectivity in the parahippocampal place area predicted subsequent memory performance independently of age group and fixation counts at encoding. These findings suggest that age-related neural dedifferentiation in scene-selective cortex may relate to declines in the functional specialization of exploratory eye movements during scene viewing.

">Metabolic reprogramming in the spinal cord drives the transition to pain chronicity</a></h4>

              
                Acute injuries can progress into painful states that endure long after healing. The mechanism underlying this transition remains unclear, but metabolic adaptations to the bioenergy demands imposed by injury are plausible contributors. Here we show that peripheral injury activates AKT/mTORC1 in afferent segments of the mouse spinal cord, redirecting local core metabolism toward biomass production while simultaneously suppressing autophagy-mediated biomass reclamation. This metabolic shift supports neuroplasticity, but creates a resource bottleneck that depletes critical spinal cord nutrients. Preventing this depletion with a modified diet normalizes biomass generation and autophagy and halts the transition to chronic pain. This effect, observed across multiple pain models, requires activation of the nutrient sensors, sirtuin-1 and AMPK, as well as restoration of autophagy. The findings identify metabolic reprogramming as a key driver of the progression to pain chronicity and point to nutritional and pharmacological interventions that could prevent this progression after surgery or other physical traumas.

">A Human Neuron Alzheimer's Disease Model Reveals Barriers to Senolytic Translatability</a></h4>

              
                Therapeutic successes in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) largely fail to translate into clinical trials, with experimental drugs rarely validated in human models before being administered to humans. To address this, we developed an accessible method for long-term culture of commercially available primary human neurons and astrocytes, along with an amyloid-beta 1-42 (A{beta})-based in vitro AD model. Using this system, we evaluated two senolytic regimens previously shown to be effective in AD mouse models-Navitoclax and Dasatinib plus Quercetin (DQ) -and the natural killer cell line NK92 for emerging immune-mediated senescent cell ablation therapies. NK92 cells preferentially-but not exclusively-targeted A{beta}-treated neurons and astrocytes with senescent-like phenotypes. DQ demonstrated a safe profile for human neurons, but Navitoclax exhibited non-selective neurotoxicity. These findings highlight risks of Navitoclax and NK-based interventions and underscore the critical need for human-relevant models in the AD drug-development pipeline to improve safety and clinical translatability.

">Gut-Brain Hydraulics: Brain motion and CSF circulation is driven by mechanical coupling with the abdomen</a></h4>

              
                The brain moves within the skull, but the drivers and function of this motion are not understood. We visualized brain motion relative to the skull in awake head-fixed mice using high-speed, multi-plane two-photon microscopy. Brain motion was primarily rostrally and laterally directed, and was tightly correlated with locomotion, but not with respiration or the cardiac cycle. Electromyography recordings in abdominal muscles and microCT reconstructions of the trunk and spinal vasculature showed that brain motion was driven by abdominal muscle contractions that activate a hydraulic-like vascular connection between the nervous system and the abdominal cavity. Externally-applied abdominal pressure generated brain motion similar to those seen during abdominal muscle contractions. Simulations showed that brain motion drives substantial volumes of interstitial fluid through and out of the brain (at volumetric rates several times higher than production) into the subarachnoid space, in the opposite direction of fluid flow seen during sleep. The brain is hydraulically linked to the abdominal compartment, and fluid flow in the brain is coupled to body movements, providing a mechanism by which the mechanics of the viscera directly impact brain health.

">FETCH enables fluorescent labeling of membrane proteins in vivo with spatiotemporal control in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Fluorescent labeling approaches are crucial for elucidating protein function and dynamics. While enhancer trapping in Drosophila has been useful for the characterization of gene transcription, protein-specific visualization in vivo has been more elusive. To overcome these limitations, we developed Fluorescent Endogenous Tagging with a Covalent Hook (FETCH) to label cell surface proteins (CSPs) in vivo through a stable covalent bond mediated by the DogTag-DogCatcher peptide partner system. FETCH leverages a spontaneous covalent isopeptide bond that forms between the 23-amino acid DogTag and the 15-kDa DogCatcher. Unlike most tags that work best at protein termini, DogTag is optimized for function in protein loops, expanding the range of sites that can be targeted in proteins. In FETCH, DogTag is introduced into extracellular loops of CSPs through genome engineering, enabling covalent bond formation with a genetically encoded DogCatcher-GFP fusion protein that can be secreted from a variety of cell types. We describe a flow cytometry-based platform for the identification of efficient DogTag insertion sites in vitro and demonstrate the ability to visualize both tagged DIP- and Dpr10 in vivo, two immunoglobulin superfamily proteins that facilitate neuronal target recognition at Drosophila neuromuscular junctions and brain synapses. The versatility of FETCH enables fluorescent labeling with precise temporal and spatial control in vivo, enabling applications previously unfeasible.

">Modelling the willingness to pay for honey: the role of sensory characteristics and EEG neurometrics</a></h4>

              
                It is currently unclear which honey attributes are most important for consumers and, more importantly, from an economic perspective, for which of them consumers are willing to pay for. The aim of this study was to examine the role of sensory attributes in consumers willingness to pay for honey. The study was performed in two steps. First, we ran a behavioural experiment in which 25 participants were asked to blindly taste and evaluate 21 sensory attributes of 7 different flower honey samples. Based on the obtained data, we conducted a factor analysis and aggregated all sensory attributes into 6 factors, which were used in the second part of the study during a neuromarketing experiment. The neuromarketing experiment involved another 25 respondents who also blindly tasted honey, evaluated its 6 sensory characteristics (corresponding to the 6 above-mentioned factors), as well as their willingness to pay, the perceived quality and taste of the samples. While the respondents were evaluating honey samples, their brain activity was recorded using an electroencephalograph (EEG). Based on the obtained data, the willingness to pay was modeled using a linear regression, which has demonstrated that consumers' willingness to pay for honey is significantly influenced by the taste of honey, the perceived quality indicated by various sensory characteristics, the male gender, and the brain activity in the frontal areas.

">Early neural responses to nonconscious fearful and neutral faces - an ERP study</a></h4>

              
                Prioritized processing of fearful compared to neutral faces is reflected in differential event-related potentials (ERPs). There is an ongoing debate about the extent to which faces in general and fearful faces, in particular, enhance specific ERPs if they are not consciously perceived. Specifically, the N170 has been suggested as the most likely candidate for enhanced processing of nonconscious fearful faces. In this pre-registered study, we tested in a large sample based on sequential Bayesian sampling (N = 64) whether early components of the ERP (P1, N170, and early posterior negativity; EPN) discriminate between fearful faces, neutral faces, and non-facial control stimuli. Consciousness was manipulated by presenting stimuli for 17 ms in a backward masking design, with the mask following immediately or after a delay of 200 ms. Participants rated their subjective perception on a perceptual awareness scale in each trial. Importantly, only trials in which nothing but the mask was perceived were considered for the analysis of nonconscious effects. The results showed strong evidence for an increased N170 in response to nonconscious fearful compared to neutral faces; however, this difference was significantly smaller than in the conscious condition. Furthermore, we obtained strong evidence for N170 differences between nonconscious faces and no-faces. For P1 and EPN amplitudes, no significant effects were observed in the nonconscious conditions, although exploratory analyses of the P1 peak interval suggest nonconscious face-no-face differentiation. These results support the notion that nonconscious emotion and face processing are detectable in early neural responses and show that these nonconscious effects are considerably weaker than the corresponding conscious effects.

">A Bioelectric Router for Adaptive Isochronous Neurostimulation</a></h4>

              
                Objective: Multipolar intracranial electrical brain stimulation (iEBS) is a method that has potential to improve clinical applications of mono- and bipolar iEBS. Current tools for researching multipolar iEBS are proprietary, can have high entry costs, lack flexibility in managing different stimulation parameters and electrodes, and can include clinical features unnecessary for the requisite exploratory research. This is a factor limiting the progress in understanding and applying multipolar iEBS effectively. To address these challenges, we developed the Bioelectric Router for Adaptive Isochronous Neuro stimulation (BRAINS) board. Approach: The BRAINS board is a cost-effective and customizable device designed to facilitate multipolar stimulation experiments across a 16-channel electrode array using common research electrode setups. The BRAINS board interfaces with a microcontroller, allowing users to configure each channel for cathodal or anodal input, establish a grounded connection, or maintain a floating state. The design prioritizes ease of integration by leveraging standard tools like a microcontroller and an analog signal isolators while providing options to customize setups according to experimental conditions. It also ensures output isolation, reduces noise, and supports remote configuration changes for rapid switching of electrode states. To test the efficacy of the board, we performed bench-top validation of monopolar, bipolar, and multipolar stimulation regimes. The same regimes were tested in vivo in mouse primary visual cortex and measured using Neuropixel recordings. Main Results: The BRAINS board demonstrates no meaningful differences in Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) noise or signal-to-noise ratio compared to the baseline performance of the isolated stimulator alone. The board supports configuration changes at a rate of up to 600 Hz without introducing residual noise, enabling high-frequency switching necessary for temporally multiplexed multipolar stimulation. Significance: The BRAINS board represents a significant advancement in exploratory brain stimulation research by providing a user-friendly, customizable, open source, and cost-effective tool capable of conducting sophisticated, reproducible, and finely controlled stimulation experiments. With a capacity for effectively real-time information processing and efficient parameter exploration the BRAINS board can enhance both exploratory research on iEBS and enable improved clinical use of multipolar and closed-loop iEBS.

                Deep molecular phenotyping of cells at transcriptomic and proteomic levels is an essential first step to understanding cellular contributions to development, aging, injury, and disease. Since proteome and transcriptome level abundances only modestly correlate with each other, complementary profiling of both is needed. We report a novel method called simultaneous protein and RNA -omics (SPARO) to capture the cell type-specific transcriptome and proteome simultaneously from both in vitro and in vivo experimental model systems. This method leverages the ability of biotin ligase, TurboID, to biotinylate cytosolic proteins including ribosomal and RNA-binding proteins, which allows enrichment of biotinylated proteins for proteomics as well as protein-associated RNA for transcriptomics. We validated this approach first using well-controlled in vitro systems to verify that the proteomes and transcriptomes obtained reflect the ground truth, bulk proteomes and transcriptomes. We also show that the effect of a biological stimulus (e.g., neuroinflammatory activation by lipopolysaccharide) can be faithfully captured. We also applied this approach to obtain native-state proteomes and transcriptomes from two key neural cell types, astrocytes and neurons, thereby validating the in vivo application of SPARO. Next, we used these data to interrogate protein-mRNA concordance and discordance across these cell types, providing insights into groups of molecular processes that exhibit uniform or cell type-specific patterns of mRNA-protein discordance.

">A brainstem-thalamic circuitry for affective-motivational responses to cold pain</a></h4>

              
                The medial thalamus is crucial for the sensory and affective-motivational responses to chronic pain. However, a mechanistic understanding of how the distinct subnuclei of the medial thalamus mediate behavioral responses to pain remains lacking. Taking advantage of intersectional viral genetics, chemogenetics, optogenetics, in-vivo imaging, and ex-vivo physiology, we reveal that the neurons in the parafascicular (PF) nuclei of the medial thalamus receive monosynaptic inputs from the lateral parabrachial nuclei (LPBN) in mice. LPBN is an essential nucleus in the ascending pain pathway, receiving projections from the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. The PF neurons downstream of LPBN (PFpost-LPBN) are nociceptive, sensitized by peripheral neuropathy, acutely aversive, and, when activated, drive both sensory and affective-motivational responses to cold pain. In contrast, the LPBN target neurons in the intralaminar centromedian thalamus (CMpost-LPBN), another nociceptive nucleus of the medial thalamus, are primarily involved in the affective-motivational aspects of pain. Together, we reveal that the LPBN, through two closely related thalamic nuclei, influences behavior in mice with cold hypersensitivity due to peripheral neuropathies.

">Efferent signaling along nociceptive peripheral terminals in vivo is enhanced during inflammation</a></h4>

              
                Primary nociceptors are essentially characterized as afferent neurons carrying noxious sensory information from the periphery to the CNS. However, the information flow on primary nociceptors is bidirectional. Nociceptor peripheral terminals release a variety of mediators to the target organ in the vicinity of the injured area. These mediators promote sensitization of adjacent sensory neurons, vasodilation, and edema and affect innate and adaptive immunity, leading to hyperalgesia and inflammation that often expands beyond the injured areas. Many theories associate these phenomena with the antidromic action potential propagation along nociceptor terminals; however, the antidromic efferent signaling at the single nociceptor terminals has never been demonstrated. Here, using in vivo calcium imaging from the individual nociceptive terminals innervating the mouse cornea together with a computational approach, we demonstrated that short-lasting activation of a single terminal in vivo was sufficient to activate the remote, non-activated terminal, which branches from the same nociceptor fiber. This increase was dependent on the activation of voltage-gated sodium and calcium channels. Moreover, we showed that the efferent signaling along nociceptive terminals increases under inflammatory conditions, culminating in enhanced calcium signaling in the remote non-activated terminals. This inflammation-induced increase in intra-terminal calcium could trigger the enhanced release of inflammatory mediators, spilling over wider areas and affecting terminals from adjacent unstimulated receptive fields, leading to the expansion of hyperalgesia and inflammation.

">Anxiety-like behavior during protracted morphine withdrawal is driven by gut microbial dysbiosis and attenuated with probiotic treatment</a></h4>

              
                The development of anxiety during protracted opioid withdrawal heightens the risk of relapse into the cycle of addiction. Understanding the mechanisms driving anxiety during opioid withdrawal could facilitate the development of therapeutics to prevent negative affect and promote continued abstinence. Our lab has previously established the gut microbiome as a driver of various side effects of opioid use, including analgesic tolerance and somatic withdrawal symptoms. We therefore hypothesized that the gut microbiome contributes to the development of anxiety-like behavior during protracted opioid withdrawal. In this study, we first established a mouse model of protracted morphine withdrawal, characterized by anxiety-like behavior and gut microbial dysbiosis. Next, we used fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) to show that gut dysbiosis alone is sufficient to induce anxiety-like behavior. We further demonstrate that probiotic therapy during morphine withdrawal attenuates the onset of anxiety-like behavior, highlighting its therapeutic potential. Lastly, we examined transcriptional changes in the amygdala of morphine-withdrawn mice treated with probiotics to explore mechanisms by which the gut-brain axis mediates anxiety-like behavior. Our results support the use of probiotics as a promising therapeutic strategy to prevent gut dysbiosis and associated anxiety during opioid withdrawal, with potential implications for improving treatment outcomes in opioid recovery programs.

">Evening blue light exposure during adolescence induces avoidance behaviors and rewires medial amygdala circuit.</a></h4>

              
                Adolescents are being increasingly exposed to artificial blue light from electronic devices, raising concerns about its effects on brain development and mental health. The medial amygdala (MeA), a brain region critical for emotional regulation, is light-sensitive, yet how evening blue light during puberty influences its circuitry and behavior remains unknown. Using a light cycle disruption paradigm, we found that adolescent mice exposed to evening blue light displayed increased avoidance behaviors compared to those exposed to darkness or reduced blue light conditions. Single-nuclei RNA sequencing revealed altered cell-type composition and disrupted synaptic communication pathways in the MeA. In vivo calcium imaging showed increased activity in MeA somatostatin neurons during avoidance behaviors, while chemogenetic inhibition of these neurons reduced these behaviors. Our findings identify the MeA as a key integrator of emotional responses to environmental blue light, suggesting evening blue light exposure during puberty as a potential risk factor for affective disorders.

">Boosting Motor Cortex Plasticity through Respiratory Phase-Triggered Paired Associative Stimulation</a></h4>

              
                Paired Associative Stimulation (PAS) has shown promise in promoting motor cortex plasticity by using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) paired with peripheral nerve stimulation. However, the effectiveness of PAS is often limited by its short-lived potentiation effects. Recent research indicates that respiratory rhythms can influence cortical excitability, suggesting a potential method to enhance PAS efficacy. This study investigated the impact of synchronizing PAS with respiratory phase transitions - specifically, the transition from inspiration to expiration (I-E) and expiration to inspiration (E-I) - on motor cortical plasticity. We conducted experiments with 18 healthy volunteers (13 females, 5 males) aged 21-45 years, assessing motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) elicited by TMS applied to the left motor cortex. Participants underwent PAS sessions where paired stimuli were delivered either at I-E or E-I transitions, or at random intervals. MEPs were recorded at baseline, immediately post-PAS, and at 10, 20, and 30 minutes post-stimulation. Results showed that PAS triggered at the I-E transition significantly increased MEP amplitudes, with significant differences in MEP amplitudes at 20 minutes post-PAS between the I-E and the other conditions. This highlights the benefit of timing PAS with the I-E transition for enhanced motor cortical plasticity. These findings underscore the potential of integrating respiratory rhythms into neuromodulation techniques to improve therapeutic outcomes. Synchronizing PAS with natural respiratory phases may enhance motor recovery strategies and offers a refined approach for therapeutic interventions. This approach could be particularly relevant for stroke rehabilitation, where enhancing motor cortical plasticity is crucial for recovery.

">Tsc1 Deletion in Purkinje Neurons Disrupts the Axon Initial Segment, Impairing Excitability and Cerebellar Function</a></h4>

              
                Loss-of-function mutations in tuberous sclerosis 1 (TSC1) are prevalent monogenic causes of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Selective deletion of Tsc1 from mouse cerebellar Purkinje neurons has been shown to cause several ASD-linked behavioral impairments, which are linked to reduced Purkinje neuron repetitive firing rates. We used electrophysiology methods to investigate why Purkinje neuron-specific Tsc1 deletion (Tsc1mut/mut) impairs Purkinje neuron firing. These studies revealed a depolarized shift in action potential threshold voltage, an effect that we link to reduced expression of the fast-transient voltage-gated sodium (Nav) current in Tsc1mut/mut Purkinje neurons. The reduced Nav currents in these cells was associated with diminished secondary immunofluorescence from anti-pan Nav channel labeling at Purkinje neuron axon initial segments (AIS). Interestingly, anti-ankyrinG immunofluorescence was also found to be significantly reduced at the AIS of Tsc1mut/mut Purkinje neurons, suggesting Tsc1 is necessary for the organization and functioning of the Purkinje neuron AIS. An analysis of the 1st and 2nd derivative of the action potential voltage-waveform supported this hypothesis, revealing spike initiation and propagation from the AIS of Tsc1mut/mut Purkinje neurons is impaired compared to age-matched control Purkinje neurons. Heterozygous Tsc1 deletion resulted in no significant changes in the firing properties of adult Purkinje neurons, and slight reductions in anti-pan Nav and anti-ankyrinG labeling at the Purkinje neuron AIS, revealing deficits in Purkinje neuron firing due to Tsc1 haploinsufficiency are delayed compared to age-matched Tsc1mut/mut Purkinje neurons. Together, these data reveal the loss of Tsc1 impairs Purkinje neuron firing and membrane excitability through the dysregulation of proteins necessary for AIS organization and function.

">Parallel hierarchical encoding of linguistic representations in the human auditory cortex and recurrent automatic speech recognition systems</a></h4>

              
                The human brain's ability to transform acoustic speech signals into rich linguistic representations has inspired advancements in automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. While ASR systems now achieve human-level performance under controlled conditions, prior research on their parallels with the brain has been limited by the use of biologically implausible models, narrow feature sets, and comparisons that primarily emphasize predictability of brain activity without fully exploring shared underlying representations. Additionally, studies comparing the brain to text-based language models overlook the acoustic stages of speech processing, an essential part in transforming sound to meaning. Leveraging high-resolution intracranial recordings and a recurrent ASR model, this study bridges these gaps by uncovering a striking correspondence in the hierarchical encoding of linguistic features, from low-level acoustic signals to high-level semantic processing. Specifically, we demonstrate that neural activity in distinct regions of the auditory cortex aligns with representations in corresponding layers of the ASR model and, crucially, that both systems encode similar features at each stage of processing - from acoustic to phonetic, lexical, and semantic information. These findings suggest that both systems, despite their distinct architectures, converge on similar strategies for language processing, providing insight in the optimal computational principles underlying linguistic representation and the shared constraints shaping human and artificial speech processing.

">Cellular mechanisms of early brain overgrowth in autistic children: elevated levels of GPX4 and resistance to ferroptosis</a></h4>

              
                Autistic individuals with disproportionate megalencephaly (ASD-DM), characterized by enlarged brains relative to body height, have higher rates of intellectual disability and face more severe cognitive challenges than autistic children with average brain sizes. The cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying this neurophenotype remain poorly understood. To investigate these mechanisms, we generated human induced pluripotent stem cells from non-autistic typically developing children and autistic children with and without disproportionate megalencephaly. We assessed these children longitudinally from ages two to twelve years using magnetic resonance imaging and comprehensive cognitive and medical evaluations. We show that neural progenitor cells (NPCs) derived from ASD-DM children exhibit increased rates of cell survival and suppressed cell death, accompanied by heightened oxidative stress and ferrous iron accumulation. Despite these stressors, ASD-DM NPCs actively suppress apoptosis and ferroptosis by regulating proteins such as caspase-3 (CASP3), poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1), and glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4). Cellular ferroptotic signatures are further supported by elevated expression of selenocysteine genes, including GPX4, in the blood of ASD-DM children and their mothers, suggesting potential hereditary or environmental influences. Furthermore, we show that peripheral expression of GPX4 and other selenocysteine genes correlate with cognitive outcomes (IQ). These findings underscore the role of ferroptosis in autism, pointing to potential diagnostic biomarkers and targets for intervention.

">Geometric influences on the regional organization of the mammalian brain</a></h4>

              
                The mammalian brain is comprised of anatomically and functionally distinct regions. Substantial work over the past century has pursued the generation of ever-more accurate maps of regional boundaries, using either expert judgement or data-driven clustering of functional, connectional, and/or architectonic properties. However, these approaches are often purely descriptive, have limited generalizability, and do not elucidate the underlying generative mechanisms that shape the regional organization of the brain. Here, we develop a novel approach that leverages a simple, hierarchical principle for generating a multiscale parcellation of any brain structure in any mammalian species using only its geometry. We show that this approach yields regions at any resolution scale that are more homogeneous than those defined in nearly all existing benchmark brain parcellations in use today across hundreds of anatomical, functional, cellular, and molecular brain properties measured in humans, macaques, marmosets, and mice. We additionally show how our method can be generalized to previously unstudied mammalian species for which no parcellations exist. Finally, we demonstrate how our approach captures the essence of a simple, hierarchical reaction-diffusion mechanism, in which the geometry of a brain structure shapes the spatial expression of putative patterning molecules linked to the formation of distinct regions through development. Our findings point to a highly conserved and universal influence of geometry on the regional organization of the mammalian brain.

">Whole-brain entrainment and anticipation in fMRI motor task data.</a></h4>

              
                Evidence that the brain adapts its intrinsic rhythms to a task paradigm (entrainment) and that it actively anticipates up-coming tasks has mostly come from analysis of neurophysiological data. Here we show that these phenomena are present in fMRI motor task data as well. We represent brain activity as a series (time resolved) of complex weighted networks and introduce a novel phase clustering algorithm that divides the matrices into functionally meaningful communities with comparable phase content across time and subjects. We find brain-wide patterns of cross-subject synchronizations timed to the task paradigm. This pattern of entrainment features systematic negative deflections prior to task paradigm across many different brain regions. We interpret this pattern as a fMRI-equivalent to the Contingent Negative Variation (CNV) seen in neurophysiological data in anticipation of an up-coming task. A more pronounce version of the CNV-like signal is seen in task specific motor and somatosensory cortex prior to movement, potentially the fMRI-equivalent of the readiness potential (RP). Finally, we show that fMRI data, when represented as complex weighted matrices, full-fills the criteria of structural balance.

">Action features dominate cortical representation during natural vision</a></h4>

              
                Cortical resources are allocated into systems specialized for processing ecologically relevant features of the world. These features are typically studied in isolation using controlled experimental stimuli, making it difficult to assess the relative importance of different kinds of features that tend to overlap during natural vision. In the current study, we evaluated the relative contributions of action, agent, and scene features in predicting cortical activity while participants viewed a 1-hour nature documentary. We tested four sets of model features: semantic vectors capturing the observed action, agent, and scene features derived from an annotation of the stimulus, as well as low-level visual motion-energy features. We used banded ridge regression to fit vertex-wise encoding models from the combination of all four sets of features. While each set of features predicted neural activity in the expected areas, the action features predicted more widespread activity. A variance partitioning analysis revealed that the action features captured the most unique variance in neural activity across ten times as many cortical vertices as the agent or scene features. Our findings suggest that cortical activity during dynamic, natural vision is dominated by features for understanding the actions of others.

                Background Primiparous mothers face diverse challenges during pregnancy and post-childbirth. There is limited data on the effectiveness of postnatal educational programs for new mothers (Subramanian et al., 2020). This study aimed to assess the efficacy of an educational program designed to improve primiparous mothers’ attitudes toward newborn communication, general health, feeding, and swallowing. The objectives were (1) to develop an attitude questionnaire (AQ), a parent education program [Newborn Communication, Health, Feeding and Swallowing Education Program (N-CHFSEP)], and a feedback questionnaire (FQ); and (2) to estimate the efficacy of N-CHFSEP pre- and post-delivery. The research, conducted between August 2023 and February 2024, involved 98 primiparous mothers who gave birth to healthy newborns through any delivery method. Participants were proficient in English or Kannada. The study excluded mothers delivering multiples, those with significant medical or psychological issues, and health professionals. Methods The study had two phases: Phase 1 developed and validated the AQ, N-CHFSEP, and FQ. N-CHFSEP covered key topics, including milestones in communication, feeding, and general health from birth to 6 months. Phase 2 administered these tools to participants. The data was analyzed using descriptive statistics, paired t-tests, and chi-square tests. Results 93% of mothers reported increased confidence in recognizing communication, feeding, and health-related signs in their infants after completing the program. This change was statistically significant (p < 0.05). Sociodemographic factors like maternal age, education, occupation, and family type significantly influenced confidence levels. Feedback from participants highlighted the program’s effectiveness in enhancing knowledge, with suggestions for improvements. Conclusions N-CHFSEP significantly boosted mothers’ confidence in newborn care, contributing to better maternal and infant health. However, the study lacked a control group, and the effectiveness was evaluated only immediately after the program. Future research could incorporate practical demonstrations and hands-on training to further enhance the program’s impact.

We develop a Bayesian approach, BayesIso, to identify differentially expressed isoforms from RNA-seq data. The approach features a novel joint model of the sample variability and the deferential state of isoforms. Specifically, the within-sample variability and the between-sample variability of each isoform are modeled by a Poisson-Lognormal model and a Gamma-Gamma model, respectively. Using a Bayesian framework, the differential state of each isoform and the model parameters are jointly estimated by a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. Extensive studies using simulation and real data demonstrate that BayesIso can effectively detect isoforms of less differentially expressed and differential transcripts for genes with multiple isoforms. We applied the approach to breast cancer RNA-seq data and uncovered a unique set of isoforms that form key pathways associated with breast cancer recurrence. First, PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling and PTEN signaling pathways are identified as being involved in breast cancer development. Further integrated with protein-protein interaction data, pathways of Jak-STAT, mTOR, MAPK and Wnt signaling are revealed in association with breast cancer recurrence. Finally, several pathways are activated in the early recurrence of breast cancer. In tumors that occur early, members of pathways of cellular metabolism and cell cycle (such as CD36 and TOP2A) are upregulated, while immune response genes such as NFATC1 are downregulated.

                <p>by Katrin Vogt</p>

Eating is a multisensory experience: food’s smell, look, and texture are as important as taste. A new study in PLOS Biology shows that fly larvae respond to food texture and integrate information from different modalities within a single gustatory neuron.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-915/v2?src=rss">Publisher preferences for a journal transparency tool: A modified three-round Delphi study [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background We propose the creation of a journal transparency tool (JTT), which will allow users to obtain information about a given scholarly journal’s operations and policies. We are obtaining preferences from different stakeholders to inform the development of this tool. This study aimed to identify the publishing community’s preferences for the JTT. Methods We conducted a modified three-round Delphi survey. Representatives from publishing houses and journal publishers were recruited through purposeful and snowball sampling. The first two Delphi rounds involved an online survey with items about JTT metrics and user features. During the third round, participants discussed and voted on JTT metric items that did not reach consensus after round 2 within a virtual consensus meeting. We defined consensus as 80% agreement to include or exclude an item in the JTT. Results Eighty-six participants completed the round 1 survey, and 43 participants (50% of round 1) completed the round 2 survey. In both rounds, respondents voted on JTT user feature and JTT metric item preferences and answered open-ended survey questions regarding the JTT. In round 3, a total of 21 participants discussed and voted on JTT metric items that did not reach consensus after round 2 during an online consensus group meeting. Fifteen out of 30 JTT metric items and none of the four JTT user feature items reached the 80% consensus threshold after all rounds of voting. Analysis of the round 3 online consensus group transcript resulted in two themes: ‘factors impacting support for JTT metrics’ and ‘suggestions for user clarity.’ Conclusions Participants suggested that the publishing community’s primary concerns for a JTT are to ensure that the tool is relevant, user-friendly, accessible, and equitable. The outcomes of this research will contribute to developing and refining the tool in accordance with publishing preferences.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104718">Synergistic effect of inhibiting CHK2 and DNA replication on cancer cell growth</a></h4>

              
                Cancer cells display high levels of oncogene-induced replication stress (RS) and rely on DNA damage checkpoint for viability. This feature is exploited by cancer therapies to either increase RS to unbearable levels or inhibit checkpoint kinases involved in the DNA damage response. Thus far, treatments that combine these two strategies have shown promise but also have severe adverse effects. To identify novel, better-tolerated anticancer combinations, we screened a collection of plant extracts and found two natural compounds from the plant, <i>Psoralea corylifolia</i>, that synergistically inhibit cancer cell proliferation. Bakuchiol inhibited DNA replication and activated the checkpoint kinase CHK1 by targeting DNA polymerases. Isobavachalcone interfered with DNA double-strand break repair by inhibiting the checkpoint kinase CHK2 and DNA end resection. The combination of bakuchiol and isobavachalcone synergistically inhibited cancer cell proliferation in vitro. Importantly, it also prevented tumor development in xenografted NOD/SCID mice. The synergistic effect of inhibiting DNA replication and CHK2 signaling identifies a vulnerability of cancer cells that might be exploited by using clinically approved inhibitors in novel combination therapies.

                Smads and their transcription factor partners mediate the transcriptional responses of target cells to secreted ligands of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) family, including those of the conserved bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) family, yet only a small number of direct target genes have been well characterized. In <i>C. elegans,</i> the BMP2/4 ortholog DBL-1 regulates multiple biological functions, including body size, via a canonical receptor-Smad signaling cascade. Here, we identify functional binding sites for SMA-3/Smad and its transcriptional partner SMA-9/Schnurri based on ChIP-seq peaks (identified by modEncode) and expression differences of nearby genes identified from RNA-seq analysis of corresponding mutants. We found that SMA-3 and SMA-9 have both overlapping and unique target genes. At a genome-wide scale, SMA-3/Smad acts as a transcriptional activator, whereas SMA-9/Schnurri direct targets include both activated and repressed genes. Mutations in <i>sma-9</i> partially suppress the small body size phenotype of <i>sma-3,</i> suggesting some level of antagonism between these factors and challenging the prevailing model for Schnurri function. Functional analysis of target genes revealed a novel role in body size for genes involved in one-carbon metabolism and in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) secretory pathway, including the disulfide reductase <i>dpy-11</i>. Our findings indicate that Smads and SMA-9/Schnurri have previously unappreciated complex genetic and genomic regulatory interactions that in turn regulate the secretion of extracellular components like collagen into the cuticle to mediate body size regulation.

                As a central hub for metabolism, the liver exhibits strong adaptability to maintain homeostasis in response to food fluctuations throughout evolution. However, the mechanisms governing this resilience remain incompletely understood. In this study, we identified Receptor interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) in hepatocytes as a critical regulator in preserving hepatic homeostasis during metabolic challenges, such as short-term fasting or high-fat dieting. Our results demonstrated that hepatocyte-specific deficiency of RIPK1 sensitized the liver to short-term fasting-induced liver injury and hepatocyte apoptosis in both male and female mice. Despite being a common physiological stressor that typically does not induce liver inflammation, short-term fasting triggered hepatic inflammation and compensatory proliferation in hepatocyte-specific RIPK1-deficient (<i>Ripk1</i>-hepKO) mice. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that short-term fasting oriented the hepatic microenvironment into an inflammatory state in <i>Ripk1</i>-hepKO mice, with up-regulated expression of inflammation and immune cell recruitment-associated genes. Single-cell RNA sequencing further confirmed the altered cellular composition in the liver of <i>Ripk1</i>-hepKO mice during fasting, highlighting the increased recruitment of macrophages to the liver. Mechanically, our results indicated that ER stress was involved in fasting-induced liver injury in <i>Ripk1</i>-hepKO mice. Overall, our findings revealed the role of RIPK1 in maintaining liver homeostasis during metabolic fluctuations and shed light on the intricate interplay between cell death, inflammation, and metabolism.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100268">Supralinear dendritic integration in murine dendrite-targeting interneurons</a></h4>

              
                Non-linear summation of synaptic inputs to the dendrites of pyramidal neurons has been proposed to increase the computation capacity of neurons through coincidence detection, signal amplification, and additional logic operations such as XOR. Supralinear dendritic integration has been documented extensively in principal neurons, mediated by several voltage-dependent conductances. It has also been reported in parvalbumin-positive hippocampal basket cells, in dendrites innervated by feedback excitatory synapses. Whether other interneurons, which support feed-forward or feedback inhibition of principal neuron dendrites, also exhibit local non-linear integration of synaptic excitation is not known. Here, we use patch-clamp electrophysiology, and two-photon calcium imaging and glutamate uncaging, to show that supralinear dendritic integration of near-synchronous spatially clustered glutamate-receptor mediated depolarization occurs in NDNF-positive neurogliaform cells and oriens-lacunosum moleculare interneurons in the mouse hippocampus. Supralinear summation was detected via recordings of somatic depolarizations elicited by uncaging of glutamate on dendritic fragments, and, in neurogliaform cells, by concurrent imaging of dendritic calcium transients. Supralinearity was abolished by blocking NMDA receptors (NMDARs) but resisted blockade of voltage-gated sodium channels. Blocking L-type calcium channels abolished supralinear calcium signalling but only had a minor effect on voltage supralinearity. Dendritic boosting of spatially clustered synaptic signals argues for previously unappreciated computational complexity in dendrite-projecting inhibitory cells of the hippocampus.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95125">Predicting individual traits from models of brain dynamics accurately and reliably using the Fisher kernel</a></h4>

              
                Predicting an individual’s cognitive traits or clinical condition using brain signals is a central goal in modern neuroscience. This is commonly done using either structural aspects, such as structural connectivity or cortical thickness, or aggregated measures of brain activity that average over time. But these approaches are missing a central aspect of brain function: the unique ways in which an individual’s brain activity unfolds over time. One reason why these dynamic patterns are not usually considered is that they have to be described by complex, high-dimensional models; and it is unclear how best to use these models for prediction. We here propose an approach that describes dynamic functional connectivity and amplitude patterns using a Hidden Markov model (HMM) and combines it with the Fisher kernel, which can be used to predict individual traits. The Fisher kernel is constructed from the HMM in a mathematically principled manner, thereby preserving the structure of the underlying model. We show here, in fMRI data, that the HMM-Fisher kernel approach is accurate and reliable. We compare the Fisher kernel to other prediction methods, both time-varying and time-averaged functional connectivity-based models. Our approach leverages information about an individual’s time-varying amplitude and functional connectivity for prediction and has broad applications in cognitive neuroscience and personalised medicine.

	<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease classified as neurodegenerative because it can be associated with the more or less progressive development of neurological symptoms and cognitive deficits. In recent years, various studies have started to investigate eye movements in relation to cognitive impairment in persons with MS by means of eye-tracking equipment. However, the high heterogeneity of the paradigms used in different studies, as well as the different methodologies included, makes it difficult to provide a complete and precise picture of this important research and clinical issue. The purpose of the present in-depth scoping review was to map the existing literature in this field to determine which metrics may be relevant when dealing with the neurocognitive profile of people with MS. From the analyses of the included studies, the anti-saccade latency and errors were the most frequently proposed metrics. Correlation analyses between these metrics and cognitive measures showed significant associations between them, calling for a deeper investigation of this promising research and clinical field. The results of the present scoping review strongly suggest that eye tracking may play a crucial role in clinical practice during the early detection of neurocognitive disorders. There is a great need for primary research that addresses the full complexity of MS in its different phenotypes and the disease-related variables from a multidisciplinary perspective. Future research should clarify whether oculomotor dysfunction in MS follows or precedes cognitive deficits.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Negative symptoms (NSs) significantly impair the outcome of schizophrenia, primarily due to their effect on quality of life and their resistance to pharmacological treatments. Several scales have been developed to assess the various dimensions of NSs, including avolition, anhedonia, alogia, social withdrawal, and blunted affect. While observer-rated scales are the most commonly used, self-assessment tools remain underutilized. However, self-assessments offer a promising approach for gaining insights into the personal experiences of individuals. The objective of this review was to identify and report the psychometric properties of self-assessment scales for NSs that are relevant for both research and clinical practice, with a focus on tools that assess multiple domains of NSs in order to support comprehensive evaluations and tailored therapeutic strategies. Methods: We conducted an exhaustive literature review following PRISMA guidelines to identify self-evaluation scales that evaluate several domains of NSs in the MEDLINE and Web of Science databases. The COSMIN checklist was used to assess the methodological quality of each tool. Results: Our review identified five self-assessment scales. Among these, two scales received a Grade A recommendation for use in clinical or research practice: the Self-evaluation Negative Symptom (SNS), which assesses the five domains of NSs, and the Motivation And Pleasure Scale Self-report (MAP-SR), which evaluates anhedonia, avolition, and social withdrawal. Conclusions: The SNS and the MAP-SR are the only tools with sufficient psychometric properties, making them reliable for use in both research and clinical practice. Despite the development of self-assessment tools for NSs, their integration into research and clinical settings remains limited, highlighting the need for increased utilization to enhance the understanding and management of these symptoms.</p>

	<p>Background: Treating psychiatric illnesses or influencing mental states with neurofeedback is challenging, likely due to the limited spatial specificity of EEG and the complications arising from the inadequate signal-to-noise ratio reduction of single-trial EEG. Objective: This pilot study aimed to investigate the feasibility of employing a binaural pulse mode-modulation (BPM) device to reduce anxiety by self-regulation. We desired to determine whether anxiety could be significantly reduced or regulated using BPM-type systems. Methods: Sixty adult participants were examined with self-reported anxiety tests (COVID Stress Scale, Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7, Beck Depression Inventory-II), which were completed before treatment, after four weeks, and after 12 weeks post-treatment. This BPM device produced two frequencies which combined to create a binaural pulse through differential auditory tone presentations. The participant calibrated the suitable target tone for optimal treatment efficacy. Each participant adjusted the binaural pulse to enhance the emotional intensity felt when envisioning an experience with comparable emotional significance or while performing a cognitive task while concurrently listening to music. The &amp;amp;ldquo;treatment&amp;amp;rdquo; relied on the individual&amp;amp;rsquo;s regulation of binaural pulses to obtain the desired state. The training concentrated on particular facets of their psychological challenges while listening to an auditory tone, adjusting a knob until the sound amplified the intended emotional state. Another knob was turned to intensify the emotional state associated with distress reduction. Results: On the self-reported measures, the BPM treatment group was significantly better than the sham treatment (control) groups (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01). These findings indicate that over the four-week intervention period, BPM was similarly effective. On the GAD-7, the significant difference over time was noted before treatment and at the end of treatment for the experimental group, with the average GAD-7 score at the end of treatment being significantly lower (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01). Conclusions: BPM seems to induce a short-term alteration in self-reported distress levels during therapy. This study&amp;amp;rsquo;s limitations are examined, and recommendations for future research are provided.</p>

	<p>Purpose: Early treatment response assessments are crucial, and the results are known to better correlate with prognosis and survival outcomes. The present study was conducted to differentiate true progression (TP) from pseudoprogression (PsP) in long-term-surviving glioblastoma patients using our previously established multiparametric MRI-based predictive model, as well as to identify clinical factors impacting survival outcomes in these patients. Methods: We report six patients with glioblastoma that had an overall survival longer than 5 years. When tumor specimens were available from second-stage surgery, histopathological analyses were used to classify between TP (&amp;amp;gt;25% characteristics of malignant neoplasms; n = 2) and PsP (&amp;amp;lt;25% characteristics of malignant neoplasms; n = 2). In the absence of histopathology, modified RANO criteria were assessed to determine the presence of TP (n = 1) or PsP (n = 1). The predictive probabilities (PPs) of tumor progression were measured from contrast-enhancing regions of neoplasms using a multiparametric MRI-based prediction model. Subsequently, these PP values were used to define each lesion as TP (PP &amp;amp;ge; 50%) or PsP (PP &amp;amp;lt; 50%). Additionally, detailed clinical information was collected. Results: Our predictive model correctly identified all patients with TP (n = 3) and PsP (n = 3) cases, reflecting a significant concordance between histopathology/modified RANO criteria and PP values. The overall survival varied from 5.1 to 12.3 years. Five of the six glioblastoma patients were MGMT promoter methylated. All patients were female, with a median age of 56 years. Moreover, all six patients had a good functional status (KPS &amp;amp;ge; 70), underwent near-total/complete resection, and received alternative therapies. Conclusions: Multiparametric MRI can aid in assessing treatment response in long-term-surviving glioblastoma patients.</p>

	<p>Purpose: Over the past decade, tele-neurorehabilitation (TNR) has emerged as a vital and effective tool for delivering continuous care to stroke patients, playing a key role in enhancing functional recovery and ensuring consistent access to rehabilitation services. In the field of TNR, various protocols are utilized to ensure effective cognitive stimulation at home. Recent preliminary studies highlight the employment of multidomain cognitive interventions, which would seem to induce more stable and relevant cognitive recovery in stroke patients. A randomized controlled trial (RCT) study was conducted to compare the effectiveness of a TNR multidomain cognitive approach to conventional face-to-face cognitive treatment. Methods: A total of 30 patients with stroke were equally enrolled and randomly assigned to the experimental and control groups. In the experimental group, patients received sessions of home-based cognitive virtual reality rehabilitation system (VRRS) training. The control group underwent traditional face-to-face cognitive multidomain treatment at the hospital. The therapy was given for one hour every day for four weeks in both groups. Specific cognitive domains, including memory, praxis skills, executive functions, and speech therapy, were stimulated in the procedure. Neuropsychological evaluations were performed at three timepoints: at baseline (T0), at the end of TNR (T1), and six months later (T2). Results: The TNR group demonstrated significant improvements in working memory and language abilities, as well as in depressive symptoms and caregiver burden, with an average decrease of 2.07. Most of this improvement persisted 6 months after treatment. The group that received face-to-face cognitive treatment showed improvements (not persisting at T2) after treatment in a task measuring constructive apraxia and alternating attention with the cognitive skill of set-shifting. Conclusions: According to our findings, multidomain cognitive TNR may be useful in enhancing cognitive outcomes in stroke populations (even six months after treatment concludes). TNR may also be a viable way to deliver these interventions since it boosts people&amp;amp;rsquo;s motivation to train and, consequently, their adherence to treatment while also having a positive effect on caregivers&amp;amp;rsquo; distress management.</p>

	<p>Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative condition in which degeneration mostly occurs in the dopamine (DA)-producing neurons within the substantia nigra in the midbrain. As a result, individuals with this condition suffer from progressively worsening motor impairment because of the resulting DA deficiency, along with an array of other symptoms that, over time, force them into a completely debilitating state. As an age-related disease, PD has only risen in prevalence over the years; thus, an emphasis has recently been placed on discovering a new treatment for this condition that is capable of attenuating its progression. The gut microbiota has become an area of intrigue among PD studies, as research into this topic has shown that imbalances in the gut microbiota (colloquially known as gut dysbiosis) seemingly promote the primary etiologic factors that have been found to be associated with PD and its pathologic progression. With this knowledge, research into PD treatment has begun to expand beyond synthetic pharmaceutical compounds, as a growing emphasis has been placed on studying plant-derived polyphenolic compounds, namely flavonoids, as a new potential therapeutic approach. Due to their capacity to promote a state of homeostasis in the gut microbiota and their long-standing history as powerful medicinal agents, flavonoids have begun to be looked at as promising therapeutic agents capable of attenuating several of the pathologic states seen amidst PD through indirect and direct means. This review article focuses on three flavonoids, specifically epigallocatechin-3-gallate, quercetin, and kaempferol, discussing the mechanisms through which these powerful flavonoids can potentially prevent gut dysbiosis, neuroinflammation, and other molecular mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis and progression of PD, while also exploring their real-world application and how issues of bioavailability and potential drug interactions can be circumvented or exploited.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: To examine if head injury (HI) is associated with age at ALS diagnosis in the United States. Methods: In this cross-sectional populationf-based analysis, we identified patients with ALS who were registered from 2015 to 2023 who completed the Registry&amp;amp;rsquo;s head trauma survey module. The association between HI and age at ALS diagnosis was assessed using multivariate analysis. Results: Of the 3424 respondents, 56.6% had experienced a HI. The adjusted odds ratio (aOR) for an ALS diagnosis before age 60 years for patients with a HI was 1.24 (95% CI, 1.07&amp;amp;ndash;1.45). One or two HIs had an aOR of 1.15 (95% CI, 0.97&amp;amp;ndash;1.36), and five or more HIs had an aOR of 1.58 (95% CI, 1.19&amp;amp;ndash;2.09). HI before age 18 years yielded an aOR of 2.03 (95% CI, 1.53&amp;amp;ndash;2.70) as well as HI between the ages of 18 and 30 years (aOR = 1.48, 95% CI: 1.06&amp;amp;ndash;2.06)). When narrowing the analysis to patients with HI before age 18 compared with patients with no HI, we found an association with HI that led to an emergency department or hospital visit (aOR = 1.50 (95% CI: 1.21&amp;amp;ndash;1.86)). Conclusions: In this cross-sectional analysis of ALS patients, HIs occurring in childhood and early adulthood and the number of HIs increased the odds of being diagnosed before age 60 years. These results suggest that HI continues to be a risk factor for ALS and could be associated with a younger age of diagnosis.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Many prison-sentenced individuals exhibit symptoms of mental dysfunctions, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The presence of co-occurring mental disorders further complicates their rehabilitation and social reintegration efforts. Given these challenges, understanding the role of specific disorders, such as ADHD, is critical for developing targeted interventions tailored to the needs of incarcerated individuals and improving their outcomes. This research aimed to clarify the relationships among hyperactivity, criminal behavior, and psychological functioning to inform preventative and therapeutic strategies. Methods: This study investigated the complex interplay among attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms, criminal behavior, and various psychological factors in a sample of 391 male inmates from low-security Polish prisons and a control group of non-offending men. Principal component analysis (PCA) and Spearman&amp;amp;rsquo;s rank correlation were used to analyze the relationships among ADHD severity, type of crime (no crime, property crime, crime involving aggression), family functioning, childhood trauma, early maladaptive schemas, and mental health disorders. Results: The results revealed that while traumatic experiences were present across all groups, stronger family cohesion and support were associated with the absence of ADHD symptoms and criminal behavior. As ADHD severity and criminal behavior escalated, particularly in cases involving aggression, family support diminished, and maladaptive schemas, including &amp;amp;ldquo;disconnection and rejection&amp;amp;rdquo; and &amp;amp;ldquo;excessive vigilance and inhibition&amp;amp;rdquo;, became more prominent, alongside increased correlations with mental health issues (anxiety and depression). Conclusions: The findings underscore the crucial role of family environment and early intervention in mitigating the risks associated with ADHD and criminal behavior, highlighting the need for comprehensive interventions targeting maladaptive schemas and providing support for both internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Limitations include the retrospective nature of data collection and the exclusive focus on male inmates in low-security facilities.</p>

                <p>The anterior hypothalamic area (AHA) is a key brain region for orchestrating defensive behaviors. Using in vivo calcium imaging in mice, we observed that AHA neuronal activity increases during footshock delivery and footshock-associated auditory cues. We found that following shock-induced increases in AHA activity, a decrease in activity coincides with the onset of grooming behavior. Next, we optogenetically activated the projections from the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) to the AHA and observed that photoactivation of the VMH-&gt;AHA pathway drives avoidance. Interestingly, repetitive grooming behavior occurs following cessation of stimulation. To identify changes in brain-wide activity patterns that occur due to optogenetic VMH-&gt;AHA stimulation, we combined optogenetic stimulation with positron emission tomography (PET)-based metabolic mapping. This approach revealed the amygdala as a downstream area activated by the stimulation of this pathway. Our findings show that the rise and fall of AHA neuronal activity triggers repetitive grooming behavior following learned fear and optogenetic stimulation. In addition, activation of the VMH-&gt;AHA pathway triggers changes in the activity patterns of downstream brain regions that are reported to be associated with displacement grooming.</p>

                Introduction Calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2) is the material of choice for pulp therapy. However, Ca(OH)2 has drawbacks such as toxicity, poor sealing, and tunnel defect formation. Alternative materials have been developed to provide more biocompatible materials with better dentin formation ability. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of composites containing gelatin (G), chitosan (CH), tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS), and Ca(OH)2, namely G-CH-TEOS-Ca (OH)2 (Extended data) on inflammation of the dental pulp (expression of COX-2, PGP 9.5, TNF-α, and neutrophil number). Materials and methods A total of 16 Wistar rat models of acute pulp injury were prepared and divided into two groups, treatment and control, 8 with each. In the treatment group, we applied a pulp-capping material using G-CH-TEOS-Ca (OH)2 and Ca(OH)2. On the 1st and 3rd days, rats were sacrificed. Tissue samples from 4 rats in each group were processed for histological preparation. COX-2, PGP 9.5, and TNF-α were observed using immunohistochemical (IHC) staining, and neutrophil numbers were observed using hematoxylin-eosin staining. Image analysis of COX-2, PGP 9.5, and TNF-α expression was performed using ImageJ software. Results The results showed a decrease in COX-2 expression, but not significantly while PGP 9.5 and TNF-α expression were significantly higher than those in the control group. Neutrophil numbers were lower in the treatment group than in the control group, but the difference was not statistically significant. Conclusion The G-CH-TEOS-Ca (OH)2 composite material may have potential as an exposed pulp medicament by reducing inflammation (COX-2 expression and number of neutrophils) and increasing the regeneration factor (TNF-α expression) and nerve (PGP 9.5 expression).

                Background Pediatric myopia is a growing global public health concern, exacerbated by the increasing screen time among children, who spend more time on devices for both entertainment and education. Understanding the link between myopia and screen media use is crucial for promoting children’s long-term eye health and mitigating the burden of myopia. Methods The study was a retrospective study design that investigated 94 complete medical records of myopic patients who had attended pediatric ophthalmology clinic at King Fahad University Hospital (KFUH) in Saudi Arabia between November 2021 and November 2023. Data was cleaned, coded and analyzed using SPSS version 20 to obtain important insights. Results The results revealed a statistically significant difference in total screen time between age groups (4–6 years, 7–9 years, and 10–12 years), with a p-value of 0.021. The most commonly used screen media devices among myopic children were smartphones (98.9%) and laptops (87.2%). Regression analysis indicated that the differences in screen time based on the children’s age at first use of screen media devices (smartphones, tablets, and laptops) were not statistically significant (p =0.196). Additionally, the study found a statistically significant association between patients’ age, the age at which they were first diagnosed with myopia, and their myopia category (p = 0.030 and p = 0.005, respectively). Conclusion The study established a significant association between myopia and screen use in pediatric patients, with total screen time increasing significantly with age. Smartphones and laptops were the most commonly used devices among myopic children. These findings highlight the need to understand the relationship between myopia and screen time in order to develop evidence-based guidelines for managing screen time, protecting children from the adverse effects of screen media exposure, and promoting their eye health and overall well-being.

                Objective To evaluate the effect of local application of Sodium Alendronate incorporated in Carbapol gel together with LLLT on peri-implant tissue healing in Wistar rat femurs. Methods Twenty-four male Wistar rats were randomly divided into 4 groups: Group 1 (the control group), Group 2 (the Sodium Alendronate group), Group 3 (the Sodium Alendronate and LLLT group), and Group 4 (the LLLT group). Mini implants were placed in right and left femur bones in all the four groups. Implants of groups 2 and 3 were coated in 1mg Carbapol gel incorporated with 1 mg Sodium alendronate. Groups 3 and 4 were exposed to LLLT (CO2 laser, wavelength 830nm; 2.1J/cm2) on 1st, 7th, 14th and 21st day. Animals were sacrificed on the 28th day, following which the femurs were dissected out and stored in 10% buffered formaldehyde for histopathological analysis. Results Groups 3 and 4 showed bony union and formation of reorganized spongiosa whereas Groups 1 and 2 showed fibrous union. The bone marrow from Group 3 had an adult-type fatty marrow, while that from Group 2 and 4 was occupied by red blood cells. Group 1 showed initial stages of bone healing in which the defect occupied more than half of the bone marrow. Conclusion LLLT given using CO2 laser therapy, together with a one-time application of Sodium Alendronate in Carbapol gel at the time of implant placement optimally enhances healing of peri-implant tissues.

                Group A Streptococcus (GAS) is a widely distributed bacterium that is Gram-positive and serves as the primary cause of acute rheumatic fever (ARF) episodes. Rheumatic heart disease (RHD) is a sequela resulting from repeated ARF attacks which are also caused by repeated GAS infections. ARF/RHD morbidity and mortality rates are incredibly high in low- and middle-income countries. This is closely related to poor levels of sanitation which causes the enhanced incidence of GAS infections. Management of carditis in RHD cases is quite challenging, particularly in developing countries, considering that medical treatment is only palliative, while definitive treatment often requires more invasive procedures with high costs. Preventive action through vaccination against GAS infection is one of the most effective steps as a solution in reducing RHD morbidity and mortality due to curative treatments are expensive. Various developments of M-protein-based GAS vaccines have been carried out over the last few decades and have recently begun to enter the clinical stage. Nevertheless, this vaccination generates cross-reactive antibodies that might trigger ARF assaults as a result of the resemblance between the M-protein structure and proteins found in many human tissues. Consequently, the development of a vaccine utilizing L-Rhamnose derived from the poly-rhamnose backbone of Group A Carbohydrate (GAC) commenced. The L-Rhamnose-based vaccine was chosen due to the absence of the Rhamnose biosynthesis pathway in mammalian cells including humans thus this molecule is not found in any body tissue. Recent pre-clinical studies reveal that L-Rhamnose-based vaccines provide a protective effect by increasing IgG antibody titers without causing cross-reactive antibodies in test animal tissue. These findings demonstrate that the L-Rhamnose-based vaccine possesses strong immunogenicity, which effectively protects against GAS infection while maintaining a significantly higher degree of safety.

                Background The growing incidence of chronic diseases such as cancer and the emergence of drug-resistant microorganisms constitute one of the greatest health challenges of the 21st century. Therefore, it is critical to search for new therapeutic alternatives. Moringa oleifera is a plant well known for the properties of its phytocomponents and its role has been analyzed in a variety of fields, from medicine to biotechnology. Methods In this work, the biological activity of Moringa oleifera in human health was explored through a review of 129 original articles published between 2010 and 2021 related to antitumor activity and its potential uses against chronic and infectious diseases. Results Moringa oleifera extracts showed antioxidant, hypoglycemic, antihypertensive and cytoprotective properties at neuronal, hepatic, renal and cardiac levels. Besides, cytotoxic effects, apoptotic and antiploriferative activity against several cancer cell lines has been demonstrated. On the other hand, the antimicrobial potential of M. oleifera was also evidenced, especially against multidrug-resistant strains. Conclusions Hence, it is supported that there is a wide range of clinical entities in which Moringa oleifera exhibits significant biological activity that could contribute to counteracting metabolic, infectious and chronic diseases in a similar or improved way to the drugs traditionally used.

                Background Dual-task assessments, including Walking While Talking (WWT) and Stops Walking While Talking (SWWT) tests, predict fall risk in stroke survivors. However, their effectiveness relative to established predictors, such as the Berg Balance Scale (BBS) and Falls Efficacy Scale (FES), remains unclear. This study evaluated the comparative predictive value of WWT and SWWT tests alongside BBS and FES among stroke survivors. Methods This cross-sectional study included 68 stroke survivors who completed WWT-Simple (WWT-S), WWT-Complex (WWT-C), and SWWT, as well as the BBS and FES. Spearman correlations assessed relationships between balance, fear of falling, and dual-task performance. Logistic regression identified fall risk predictors, and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis evaluated predictive accuracy. The study adhered to STROBE guidelines. Results BBS scores were strongly negatively correlated with WWT-S (r = -0.734, p < 0.0001) and WWT-C (r = -0.737, p < 0.0001), indicating poorer balance with slower dual-task completion. Positive correlations were found between WWT-S and FES (r = 0.668, p < 0.0001) and WWT-C and FES (r = 0.610, p < 0.0001), linking slower completion times with higher fear of falling. SWWT was significantly negatively correlated with BBS (r = -0.625, p < 0.0001). WWT tests had higher sensitivity (97.8%) and specificity (99%) than SWWT (sensitivity = 68.9%; specificity = 91.3%). Logistic regression identified SWWT (Positive) as a significant predictor of fall risk (p = 0.009), and ROC analysis showed an AUC of 0.911, indicating excellent predictive power. Conclusions Findings highlight the superior predictive value of WWT tests over SWWT in assessing fall risk among stroke survivors. Incorporating dual-task measures into clinical practice may enhance fall risk evaluation, supporting targeted stroke rehabilitation.

                Background The “all-on-four” concept represents a significant advancement in dental implantology. particularly beneficial in cases of extensive jaw bone loss where invasive bone regeneration procedures are typically required. However, the successful implementation of this technique necessitates meticulous planning concerning implant selection, materials, and prosthesis design. The recent introduction of PEEK (Polyetheretherketone) in dentistry, especially in all-on-four prosthetics, prompts questions regarding its clinical efficacy and comparative biomechanical and biological advantages over conventional materials such as titanium and zirconia. While some studies have compared PEEK with other materials, systematic reviews evaluating its efficacy are scarce. This systematic review protocol intends to assess the evidence regarding the viability of PEEK as a potential alternative within the all-on-four approach in dental implantology. Methods This systematic review protocol will adhere to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Review of Interventions and align with the Methodological Expectations of the Cochrane Intervention Reviews (MECIR) guidelines. Utilizing a comprehensive search strategy, multiple databases, including PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, EBSCO, Web of Science, Cochrane Central, and registries of clinical trials, will be explored. The search aims to identify randomized controlled trials and non-randomized studies investigating the application of PEEK in the all-on-four approach for dental procedures. Emphasizing clinically relevant outcomes such as implant survival, prosthesis success, peri-implant complications, and patient satisfaction, this review aims to provide insights into the effectiveness and potential benefits of using PEEK in all-on-four prosthetics. Non-randomized studies will be assessed for bias using ROBINS-I, while randomized controlled trials will undergo evaluation with the Cochrane Risk of Bias assessment tool, ROB II. Discussion The outcomes derived from this systematic review hold great significance for dental practitioners exploring the all-on-four concept. Understanding PEEK’s advantages and limitations compared to titanium and zirconia facilitates tailored treatment plans, enhancing success and satisfaction, ultimately improving dental care quality.

Personalized cancer drug treatment is emerging as a frontier issue in modern medical research. Considering the genomic differences among cancer patients, determining the most effective drug treatment plan is a complex and crucial task. In response to these challenges, this study introduces the Adaptive Sparse Graph Contrastive Learning Network (ASGCL), an innovative approach to unraveling latent interactions in the complex context of cancer cell lines and drugs. The core of ASGCL is the GraphMorpher module, an innovative component that enhances the input graph structure via strategic node attribute masking and topological pruning. By contrasting the augmented graph with the original input, the model delineates distinct positive and negative sample sets at both node and graph levels. This dual-level contrastive approach significantly amplifies the model’s discriminatory prowess in identifying nuanced drug responses. Leveraging a synergistic combination of supervised and contrastive loss, ASGCL accomplishes end-to-end learning of feature representations, substantially outperforming existing methodologies. Comprehensive ablation studies underscore the efficacy of each component, corroborating the model’s robustness. Experimental evaluations further illuminate ASGCL’s proficiency in predicting drug responses, offering a potent tool for guiding clinical decision-making in cancer therapy.

                <p>by Madison Little, Cristina M. Risi, Tania M. Larrinaga, Mason Summers, Tyler Nguyen, Garry E. Smith Jr, Jennifer Atherton, Carol C. Gregorio, Alla S. Kostyukova, Vitold E. Galkin</p>

Every heartbeat depends on cyclical contraction-relaxation produced by the interactions between myosin-containing thick and actin-based thin filaments (TFs) arranged into a crystalline-like lattice in the cardiac sarcomere. Therefore, the maintenance of thin filament length is crucial for myocardium function. The thin filament is comprised of an actin backbone, the regulatory troponin complex and tropomyosin that controls interactions between thick and thin filaments. Thin filament length is controlled by the tropomodulin family of proteins; tropomodulin caps pointed ends of thin filaments, and leiomodin (Lmod) promotes elongation of thin filaments by a “leaky-cap” mechanism. The broader distribution of Lmod on the thin filament implied to the possibility of its interaction with the sides of thin filaments. Here, we use biochemical and structural approaches to show that cardiac Lmod (Lmod2) binds to a specific region on the native cardiac thin filament in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner. We demonstrate that Lmod2’s unique C-terminal extension is required for binding to the thin filament actin backbone and suggest that interactions with the troponin complex assist Lmod2’s localization on the surface of thin filaments. We propose that Lmod2 regulates the length of cardiac thin filaments in a working myocardium by protecting newly formed thin filament units during systole and promoting actin polymerization at thin filament pointed ends during diastole.

                <p>by Isabelle Wielert, Sebastian Kraus-Römer, Thorsten E. Volkmann, Lisa Craig, Paul G. Higgins, Berenike Maier</p>

Type 4 pili (T4P) are multifunctional filaments involved in adhesion, surface motility, biofilm formation, and horizontal gene transfer. These extracellular polymers are surface-exposed and, therefore, act as antigens. The human pathogen <i>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</i> uses pilin antigenic variation to escape immune surveillance, yet it is unclear how antigenic variation impacts most other functions of T4P. Here, we addressed this question by replacing the major pilin of a laboratory strain with pilins from clinical isolates. We reveal that the resulting strains vary substantially in their attractive forces. Strongly interacting bacteria form microcolonies while weakly interacting bacteria retain a planktonic lifestyle. In mixed microcolonies, different variant strains segregate in agreement with the differential strength of adhesion hypothesis. By combining structural predictions and laser tweezers experiments, we show that the C-terminal region of the pilin is crucial for attraction. Lifestyle affects growth kinetics and antibiotic tolerance. In the presence of ceftriaxone or ciprofloxacin, the killing kinetics indicate strongly increased tolerance of aggregating strains. We propose that pilin antigenic variation produces a mixed population containing variants optimized for growth, colonization, or survivability under external stress. Different environments select different variants, ensuring the survival and reproduction of the population as a whole.

Retractions are becoming increasingly common but still account for a small minority of published papers. It would be useful to generate databases where the presence of retractions can be linked to impact metrics of each scientist. We have thus incorporated retraction data in an updated Scopus-based database of highly cited scientists (top 2% in each scientific subfield according to a composite citation indicator). Using data from the Retraction Watch database (RWDB), retraction records were linked to Scopus citation data. Of 55,237 items in RWDB as of August 15, 2024, we excluded non-retractions, retractions clearly not due to any author error, retractions where the paper had been republished, and items not linkable to Scopus records. Eventually, 39,468 eligible retractions were linked to Scopus. Among 217,097 top-cited scientists in career-long impact and 223,152 in single recent year (2023) impact, 7,083 (3.3%) and 8,747 (4.0%), respectively, had at least 1 retraction. Scientists with retracted publications had younger publication age, higher self-citation rates, and larger publication volume than those without any retracted publications. Retractions were more common in the life sciences and rare or nonexistent in several other disciplines. In several developing countries, very high proportions of top-cited scientists had retractions (highest in Senegal (66.7%), Ecuador (28.6%), and Pakistan (27.8%) in career-long citation impact lists). Variability in retraction rates across fields and countries suggests differences in research practices, scrutiny, and ease of retraction. Addition of retraction data enhances the granularity of top-cited scientists’ profiles, aiding in responsible research evaluation. However, caution is needed when interpreting retractions, as they do not always signify misconduct; further analysis on a case-by-case basis is essential. The database should hopefully provide a resource for meta-research and deeper insights into scientific practices.

                <p>by Whitney Wong, Pablo Bravo, Peter J. Yunker, William C. Ratcliff, Anthony J. Burnetti</p>

Oxygen availability is a key factor in the evolution of multicellularity, as larger and more sophisticated organisms often require mechanisms allowing efficient oxygen delivery to their tissues. One such mechanism is the presence of oxygen-binding proteins, such as globins and hemerythrins, which arose in the ancestor of bilaterian animals. Despite their importance, the precise mechanisms by which oxygen-binding proteins influenced the early stages of multicellular evolution under varying environmental oxygen levels are not yet clear. We address this knowledge gap by heterologously expressing the oxygen-binding proteins myoglobin and myohemerythrin in snowflake yeast, a model system of simple, undifferentiated multicellularity. These proteins increased the depth and rate of oxygen diffusion, increasing the fitness of snowflake yeast growing aerobically. Experiments show that, paradoxically, oxygen-binding proteins confer a greater fitness benefit for larger organisms when O<sub>2</sub> is least limiting. We show via biophysical modeling that this is because facilitated diffusion is more efficient when oxygen is abundant, transporting a greater quantity of O<sub>2</sub> which can be used for metabolism. By alleviating anatomical diffusion limitations to oxygen consumption, the evolution of oxygen-binding proteins in the oxygen-rich Neoproterozoic may have been a key breakthrough enabling the evolution of increasingly large, complex multicellular metazoan lineages.

Body size declines are a common response to warming via both plasticity and evolution, but variable size responses have been observed for terrestrial ectotherms. We investigate how temperature-dependent development and growth rates in ectothermic organisms induce variation in size responses. Leveraging long-term data for six montane grasshopper species spanning 1,768–3 901 m, we detect size shifts since ~1960 that depend on elevation and species’ seasonal timing. Size shifts have been concentrated at low elevations, with the early emerging species (those that overwinter as juveniles) increasing in size, while later season species are becoming smaller. Interannual temperature variation accounts for the size shifts. The earliest season species may be able to take advantage of warmer conditions accelerating growth during early spring development, whereas warm temperatures may adversely impact later season species via mechanisms such as increased rates of energy use or thermal stress. Grasshoppers tend to capitalize on warm conditions by both getting bigger and reaching adulthood earlier. Our analysis further reinforces the need to move beyond expectations of universal responses to climate change to consider how environmental exposure and sensitivity vary across elevations and life histories.

                <p>by Nikita Komarov, Cornelia Fritsch, G. Larisa Maier, Johannes Bues, Marjan Biočanin, Clarisse Brunet Avalos, Andrea Dodero, Jae Young Kwon, Bart Deplancke, Simon G. Sprecher</p>

Food presents a multisensory experience, with visual, taste, and olfactory cues being important in allowing an animal to determine the safety and nutritional value of a given substance. Texture, however, remains a surprisingly unexplored aspect, despite providing key information about the state of the food through properties such as hardness, liquidity, and granularity. Food perception is achieved by specialised sensory neurons, which themselves are defined by the receptor genes they express. While it was assumed that sensory neurons respond to one or few closely related stimuli, more recent findings challenge this notion and support evidence that certain sensory neurons are more broadly tuned. In the <i>Drosophila</i> taste system, gustatory neurons respond to cues of opposing hedonic valence or to olfactory cues. Here, we identified that larvae ingest and navigate towards specific food substrate hardnesses and probed the role of gustatory organs in this behaviour. By developing a genetic tool targeting specifically gustatory organs, we show that these organs are major contributors for evaluation of food hardness and ingestion decision-making. We find that ablation of gustatory organs not only results in loss of chemosensation, but also navigation and ingestion preference to varied substrate hardnesses. Furthermore, we show that certain neurons in the primary taste organ exhibit varied and concurrent physiological responses to mechanical and multimodal stimulation. We show that individual neurons house independent mechanisms for multiple sensory modalities, challenging assumptions about capabilities of sensory neurons. We propose that further investigations, across the animal kingdom, may reveal higher sensory complexity than currently anticipated.

                Introduction Asthma imposes a substantial economic burden on health systems. By understanding the economic burden and its projections, public health officials and governments can design more effective asthma management and prevention strategies. This study aimed to estimate the global economic burden of asthma. Methods We projected future year DALYs lost to Asthma based on DALYs and annual rate of change 1990-2021 from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation’s (IHME) Global Burden of Diseases (GBD) study. We applied the concept of value of a statistical life year (VSLY) to estimate the value of a year of life lost to asthma. Results Our study reveals a disparity between high-income countries (HICs) and low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The economic burden in low-income countries is expected to increase from 1,090 million dollars in 2023 to 1,265 million dollars in 2050, reflecting both population growth and increased prevalence of asthma. Meanwhile, high-income countries face a much higher burden, with costs rising from 130,290 million dollars in 2023 to 133,370 million dollars in 2050 Conclusion Our study reveal that the economic impact of asthma is projected to increase significantly globally, with a greater growth in low- and middle-income countries compared to high-income countries. Our results show a consistent rise in the economic burden of asthma from 2023 to 2050, both in absolute terms and per capita.

                Cities play a dominant and expanding role in human lives and civilization. As such, urban health is an increasingly important facet of public, global, and planetary health, and its profound links to other areas of sustainable development make it an important nexus issue. However, there is considerable variation in how urban health is conceived and understood, including different ideas about its scope and boundaries, proper remit, subjects, protagonists, locus and sources of authority, and relationships to other rubrics. These differences derive from the complexity of urban environments and the emergence and evolution of the field of urban health from actions and perspectives spanning multiple sectors, scales, and domains. Recognizing the value of diverse viewpoints and usages, we explore and clarify several conceptual issues and debates and propose a definition of urban health as a shared basis for strategic action.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27185?af=R">Spiking Patterns in the Globus Pallidus Highlight Convergent Neural Dynamics across Diverse Genetic Dystonia Syndromes</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Genetic dystonia is a complex movement disorder with diverse clinical manifestations resulting from pathogenic mutations in associated genes. A recent paradigm shift emphasizes the functional convergence among dystonia genes, hinting at a shared pathomechanism. However, the neural dynamics supporting this convergence remain largely unexplored.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Herein, we analyzed microelectrode recordings acquired during pallidal deep brain stimulation surgery from 31 dystonia patients with pathogenic mutations in the <i>AOPEP</i>, <i>GNAL</i>, <i>KMT2B</i>, <i>PANK2</i>, <i>PLA2G6</i>, <i>SGCE</i>, <i>THAP1</i>, <i>TOR1A</i>, and <i>VPS16</i> genes. We identified 1,694 single units whose activity was characterized by a broad set of neural features.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p><i>AOPEP</i>, <i>PANK2</i>, and <i>THAP1</i> displayed higher firing regularity, whereas <i>GNAL</i>, <i>PLA2G6</i>, <i>KMT2B</i>, and <i>SGCE</i> shared a large fraction of bursting neurons (&gt; 26.6%), significantly exceeding the rate in other genes. <i>TOR1A</i> and <i>VPS16</i> genes constituted an intermediate group, bridging these 2 groups, due to having the highest degree of spiking irregularity. Hierarchical clustering algorithms based on these dynamics confirmed the results obtained with first-order comparisons.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Despite lacking common molecular pathways, dystonia genes share largely overlapping structures of neural patterns, in particular the degree of pallidal spiking regularity and bursting activity. We propose that the degree of desynchronization facilitated by pallidal neural bursts may explain the variability in deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the globus pallidus internus (GPi) surgery outcomes across genetic dystonia syndromes. Lastly, investigating the effects of genetic mutations on low-frequency pallidal activity could optimize personalized adaptive DBS treatments in patients with genetic dystonia.

                The Neuroscientist, Ahead of Print. <br/>It is a widely held opinion that sleep is important for human brain health. Here we examine the evidence for this view, focusing on normal variations in sleep patterns. We discuss the functions of sleep and highlight the paradoxical implications of theories seeing sleep as an adaptive capacity versus the theory that sleep benefits clearance of metabolic waste from the brain. We also evaluate the proposition that sleep plays an active role in consolidation of memories. Finally, we review research on possible effects of chronic sleep deprivation on brain health. We find that the evidence for a causal role of sleep in human brain health is surprisingly weak relative to the amount of attention to sleep in science and society. While there are well-established associations between sleep parameters and aspects of brain health, results are generally not consistent across studies and measures, and it is not clear to what extent alterations in sleep patterns represent symptoms or causes. Especially, the proposition that long sleep (&gt;8 hours) in general is beneficial for long-term brain health in humans seems to lack empirical support. We suggest directions for future research to establish a solid foundation of knowledge about a role of sleep in brain health based on longitudinal studies with frequent sampling, attention to individual differences, and more ecologically valid intervention studies.

                Chen et al. show that Nrg4 is an exercise-induced adipokine via Pparγ-triggered transactivation and facilitates exercise-mediated alleviation of MASLD, in which Nrg4/Erbb4/AKT axis-mediated inhibition of hepatic cGAS-STING signaling by phosphorylating cGAS is involved. Adipose Nrg4 acts as a downstream effector of exercise to combat MASLD.

                Failor et al. show that apparently complex plasticity of orientation tuning after visuomotor learning can be explained by a simple mathematical transformation of population codes. This sparsens and orthogonalizes population activity, improving the performance of a suboptimal decoder model with inductive bias as might be found in downstream readout circuits.

                Ananth et al. demonstrate that loss of cholinergic innervation to the entorhinal cortex is an early feature related to cognitive decline. In a series of translational experiments in humans and mice, they establish the importance of cholinergic input in maintaining normal entorhinal cortical function.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/85998">Myristoylated Neuronal Calcium Sensor-1 captures the ciliary vesicle at distal appendages</a></h4>

              
                The primary cilium is a microtubule-based organelle that cycles through assembly and disassembly. In many cell types, formation of the cilium is initiated by recruitment of ciliary vesicles to the distal appendage of the mother centriole. However, the distal appendage mechanism that directly captures ciliary vesicles is yet to be identified. In an accompanying paper, we show that the distal appendage protein, CEP89, is important for the ciliary vesicle recruitment, but not for other steps of cilium formation (Tomoharu Kanie, Love, Fisher, Gustavsson, &amp; Jackson, 2023). The lack of a membrane binding motif in CEP89 suggests that it may indirectly recruit ciliary vesicles via another binding partner. Here, we identify Neuronal Calcium Sensor-1 (NCS1) as a stoichiometric interactor of CEP89. NCS1 localizes to the position between CEP89 and a ciliary vesicle marker, RAB34, at the distal appendage. This localization was completely abolished in <i>CEP89</i> knockouts, suggesting that CEP89 recruits NCS1 to the distal appendage. Similarly to <i>CEP89</i> knockouts, ciliary vesicle recruitment as well as subsequent cilium formation was perturbed in <i>NCS1</i> knockout cells. The ability of NCS1 to recruit the ciliary vesicle is dependent on its myristoylation motif and <i>NCS1</i> knockout cells expressing a myristoylation defective mutant failed to rescue the vesicle recruitment defect despite localizing properly to the centriole. In sum, our analysis reveals the first known mechanism for how the distal appendage recruits the ciliary vesicles.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98353">Cold induces brain region-selective cell activity-dependent lipid metabolism</a></h4>

              
                It has been well documented that cold is an enhancer of lipid metabolism in peripheral tissues, yet its effect on central nervous system lipid dynamics is underexplored. It is well recognized that cold acclimations enhance adipocyte functions, including white adipose tissue lipid lipolysis and beiging, and brown adipose tissue thermogenesis in mammals. However, it remains unclear whether and how lipid metabolism in the brain is also under the control of ambient temperature. Here, we show that cold exposure predominantly increases the expressions of the lipid lipolysis genes and proteins within the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVH) in male mice. Mechanistically, by using innovatively combined brain-region selective pharmacology and in vivo time-lapse photometry monitoring of lipid metabolism, we find that cold activates cells within the PVH and pharmacological inactivation of cells blunts cold-induced effects on lipid peroxidation, accumulation of lipid droplets, and lipid lipolysis in the PVH. Together, these findings suggest that PVH lipid metabolism is cold sensitive and integral to cold-induced broader regulatory responses.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100989">Glia control experience-dependent plasticity in an olfactory critical period</a></h4>

              
                Sensory experience during developmental critical periods has lifelong consequences for circuit function and behavior, but the molecular and cellular mechanisms through which experience causes these changes are not well understood. The <i>Drosophila</i> antennal lobe houses synapses between olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) and downstream projection neurons (PNs) in stereotyped glomeruli. Many glomeruli exhibit structural plasticity in response to early-life odor exposure, indicating a general sensitivity of the fly olfactory circuitry to early sensory experience. We recently found that glia shape antennal lobe development in young adults, leading us to ask if glia also drive experience-dependent plasticity during this period. Here, we define a critical period for structural and functional plasticity of OSN-PN synapses in the ethyl butyrate (EB)-sensitive glomerulus VM7. EB exposure for the first 2 days post-eclosion drives large-scale reductions in glomerular volume, presynapse number, and post- synaptic activity. Crucially, pruning during the critical period has long-term consequences for circuit function since both OSN-PN synapse number and spontaneous activity of PNs remain persistently decreased following early-life odor exposure. The highly conserved engulfment receptor Draper is required for this critical period plasticity as ensheathing glia upregulate Draper, invade the VM7 glomerulus, and phagocytose OSN presynaptic terminals in response to critical-period EB exposure. Loss of Draper fully suppresses the morphological and physiological consequences of critical period odor exposure, arguing that phagocytic glia engulf intact synaptic terminals. These data demonstrate experience-dependent pruning of synapses and argue that <i>Drosophila</i> olfactory circuitry is a powerful model for defining the function of glia in critical period plasticity.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96144">Volume electron microscopy reveals unique laminar synaptic characteristics in the human entorhinal cortex</a></h4>

              
                The entorhinal cortex (EC) plays a pivotal role in memory function and spatial navigation, connecting the hippocampus with the neocortex. The EC integrates a wide range of cortical and subcortical inputs, but its synaptic organization in the human brain is largely unknown. We used volume electron microscopy to perform a 3D analysis of the microanatomical features of synapses in all layers of the medial EC (MEC) from the human brain. Using this technology, 12,974 synapses were fully 3D reconstructed at the ultrastructural level. The MEC presented a distinct set of synaptic features, differentiating this region from other human cortical areas. Furthermore, ultrastructural synaptic characteristics within the MEC was predominantly similar, although layers I and VI exhibited several synaptic characteristics that were distinct from other layers. The present study constitutes an extensive description of the synaptic characteristics of the neuropil of all layers of the EC, a crucial step to better understand the connectivity of this cortical region, in both health and disease.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98358">Synaptic enrichment and dynamic regulation of the two opposing dopamine receptors within the same neurons</a></h4>

              
                Dopamine can play opposing physiological roles depending on the receptor subtype. In the fruit fly <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, <i>Dop1R1</i> and <i>Dop2R</i> encode the D<sub>1</sub>- and D<sub>2</sub>-like receptors, respectively, and are reported to oppositely regulate intracellular cAMP levels. Here, we profiled the expression and subcellular localization of endogenous Dop1R1 and Dop2R in specific cell types in the mushroom body circuit. For cell-type-specific visualization of endogenous proteins, we employed reconstitution of split-GFP tagged to the receptor proteins. We detected dopamine receptors at both presynaptic and postsynaptic sites in multiple cell types. Quantitative analysis revealed enrichment of both receptors at the presynaptic sites, with Dop2R showing a greater degree of localization than Dop1R1. The presynaptic localization of Dop1R1 and Dop2R in dopamine neurons suggests dual feedback regulation as autoreceptors. Furthermore, we discovered a starvation-dependent, bidirectional modulation of the presynaptic receptor expression in the protocerebral anterior medial (PAM) and posterior lateral 1 (PPL1) clusters, two distinct subsets of dopamine neurons, suggesting their roles in regulating appetitive behaviors. Our results highlight the significance of the co-expression of the two opposing dopamine receptors in the spatial and conditional regulation of dopamine responses in neurons.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/85999">A hierarchical pathway for assembly of the distal appendages that organize primary cilia</a></h4>

              
                Distal appendages are nine-fold symmetric blade-like structures attached to the distal end of the mother centriole. These structures are critical for formation of the primary cilium, by regulating at least four critical steps: ciliary vesicle recruitment, recruitment and initiation of intraflagellar transport (IFT), and removal of CP110. While specific proteins that localize to the distal appendages have been identified, how exactly each protein functions to achieve the multiple roles of the distal appendages is poorly understood. Here we comprehensively analyze known and newly discovered distal appendage proteins (CEP83, SCLT1, CEP164, TTBK2, FBF1, CEP89, KIZ, ANKRD26, PIDD1, LRRC45, NCS1, CEP15) for their precise localization, order of recruitment, and their roles in each step of cilia formation. Using CRISPR-Cas9 knockouts, we show that the order of the recruitment of the distal appendage proteins is highly interconnected and a more complex hierarchy. Our analysis highlights two protein modules, CEP83-SCLT1 and CEP164-TTBK2, as critical for structural assembly of distal appendages. Functional assays revealed that CEP89 selectively functions in RAB34<sup>+</sup> ciliary vesicle recruitment, while deletion of the integral components, CEP83-SCLT1-CEP164-TTBK2, severely compromised all four steps of cilium formation. Collectively, our analyses provide a more comprehensive view of the organization and the function of the distal appendage, paving the way for molecular understanding of ciliary assembly.

	<p>Background/Objectives: Body representations (BRs) are essential for guiding movements, maintaining spatial awareness, and achieving effective interactions with the environment. Several studies suggest that BRs are frequently impaired following unilateral brain damage, emphasising the need for tailored rehabilitation interventions; however, there is a lack of studies evaluating the effectiveness of training specifically designed to improve different kinds of functional BRs after stroke. Therefore, the present study aimed to present and implement a specific rehabilitation training program for BR alterations and evaluate its effectiveness in a sample of adults with unilateral brain damage. Methods: Nine adults with unilateral brain damage and seven age- and education-matched healthy controls were recruited. Both groups underwent a neuropsychological assessment to evaluate BR (action- and nonaction-oriented). Additionally, functional autonomy and motor functioning were assessed in the patient group. Following an initial assessment (T0), the patients participated in a BR-specific rehabilitation intervention. At the end of the rehabilitation program (T1), both groups were re-evaluated with the same tasks used at T0. Results: At T0, the patient group performed worse on BR tasks than the controls. At T1, a significant improvement in the nonaction-oriented BR and functional autonomy was observed in the patient group. Conclusions: This preliminary study suggests the effectiveness of a targeted rehabilitation intervention for BR in promoting enhanced body boundary awareness and greater accuracy in the perception of body part positions, possibly leading to increased functional autonomy. These findings highlight the importance of incorporating BR training in rehabilitation programs for adults with acquired brain damage, alongside motor rehabilitation.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Developmental language disorders (DLD) are often associated with co-occurring neurodevelopmental difficulties, including attentional or social&amp;amp;ndash;emotional problems. Another nonverbal domain, i.e., visual cognition and its relationship to DLD, is virtually unexplored. However, learning visuospatial regularities &amp;amp;ndash; a scene-grammar - is crucial for navigating our daily environment. These regularities show certain similarities to the structure of language and there is preliminary evidence for a relationship between scene processing and language competence in preschoolers with and without DLD. This study compared implicit and explicit visuospatial knowledge of everyday indoor scenes in older children, aged 6 to 10 years, of both groups. Methods: We measured &amp;amp;lsquo;dwell times&amp;amp;rsquo; on semantic and syntactic object &amp;amp;ndash; scene inconsistencies via eye-tracking and performance in an object-placement task, and their associations with children&amp;amp;rsquo;s language, visual, and cognitive skills. Results: Visual attention towards object-scene inconsistencies was highly comparable between groups, but children with DLD scored lower in a visual perception test and higher language skills were associated with higher visuo-cognitive performance in both tasks. In the explicit scene-grammar measurement, this relationship only existed for children with DLD and disappeared when nonverbal cognitive performance was controlled. Conclusions: Our study suggests the existence of mild problems in visuospatial processing co-occurring with DLD, which is partly influenced by age and nonverbal cognitive ability. The acquisition of visual cognition and linguistic knowledge is an interactive, multimodal process where the perception of objects in scenes might affect how the words for these objects are learned and vice versa. A better understanding of this interplay could eventually have impact on the diagnosis and treatment of DLD.</p>

	<p>The plantar surfaces of the feet are important for balance control during walking, specifically by allowing for the perception of pressure movements during stance. Background/Objectives: The current study aimed to perturb CoP movement perception in healthy individuals by applying vibrations to the soles of the feet in different stimulation sequences: a natural pattern that followed CoP movement (gait-like) and a perturbing pattern that did not follow the CoP (random) during walking. We hypothesized that the gait-like stimulation sequence would be similar to walking without any stimulation and therefore have no effect on balance measures and that the random sequence would negatively affect balance measures such as the anteroposterior (AP) and mediolateral (ML) margins of stability (MoSs) and foot placement area. Methods: Subjects walked at a level angle and 5.0 and 8.0 degrees of incline and with low visual conditions to increase reliance on tactile sensations from the feet. Results: No significant effect of the stimulation sequence was found at any incline, while there was a significant effect of incline. As the incline increased from level to 5 deg, subjects reduced their AP MoS measured at heel strikes from 4.36 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.56 cm to 1.95 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1.07 cm and increased their foot placement area from 24.04 &amp;amp;plusmn; 11.13 cm2 to 38.98 &amp;amp;plusmn; 17.47 cm2. However, the AP MoS measured at midstance did not significantly change as the incline increased. Conclusions: The stimulation sequence had no effect on the dependent measures, but the subjects could still feel the vibrations on the plantar surfaces during walking; this implies that similar stimulation techniques could be a useful method for applying directive biofeedback without negatively impacting gait. Overall, this study demonstrates the detailed control of our tactile system and the adaptability of healthy individuals while walking with a perturbing stimulation.</p>

	<p>Moyamoya disease (MMD) is a rare progressive cerebrovascular disorder characterized by the stenosis or occlusion of the terminal segments of the internal carotid arteries, leading to the development of abnormal collateral vascular networks. These networks are a compensatory mechanism for reduced blood flow to the brain. Despite extensive research, the exact etiology of MMD remains unknown, although recent studies suggest that immune system dysfunction plays a critical role in its pathogenesis. In particular, the involvement of immune cells such as T cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells has been increasingly recognized. These immune cells contribute to the inflammatory process and vascular remodeling observed in MMD patients, further complicating the disease&amp;amp;rsquo;s progression. Inflammation and immune-mediated damage to the vessel walls may accelerate the narrowing and occlusion of arteries, exacerbating ischemic events in the brain. Additionally, studies have revealed that certain genetic and environmental factors can influence immune system activation in MMD, linking these pathways to disease development. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the immune mechanisms at play in MMD, focusing on how immune cells participate in vascular injury and remodeling. Understanding these immunological processes may offer new therapeutic targets to halt or reverse disease progression, potentially leading to more effective treatment strategies for MMD.</p>

	<p>(1) Background/Objectives: Primary and secondary brain tumours often hold devastating prognoses and low survival rates despite the application of maximal neurosurgical resection, and state-of-the-art radiotherapy and chemotherapy. One limiting factor in their management is that several antineoplastic agents are unable to cross the blood&amp;amp;ndash;brain barrier (BBB) to reach the tumour microenvironment. Nanomedicine could hold the potential to become an effective means of drug delivery to overcome previous hurdles towards effective neuro-oncological treatments. (2) Methods: A scoping review following the PRISMA-ScR guidelines and checklist was conducted using key terms input into PubMed to find articles that reflect emerging trends in the utilisation of nanomedicine in drug delivery for primary and secondary brain tumours. (3) Results: The review highlights various strategies by which different nanoparticles can be exploited to bypass the BBB; we provide a synthesis of the literature on the ongoing contributions to therapeutic protocols based on chemotherapy, immunotherapy, focused ultrasound, radiotherapy/radiosurgery, and radio-immunotherapy. (4) Conclusions: The emerging trends summarised in this scoping review indicate encouraging advantageous properties of nanoparticles as potential effective drug delivery mechanisms; however, there are still nanotoxicity issues that largely remain to be addressed before the translation of these innovations from laboratory to clinical practice.</p>

	<p>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a terminal complex neurodegenerative disease, with 10&amp;amp;ndash;15% of cases being familial and the majority being sporadic with no known cause. There are no animal models for the 85&amp;amp;ndash;90% of sporadic ALS cases. More creative, sophisticated models of ALS disease are required to unravel the mysteries of this complicated disease. While ALS patients urgently require new medications and treatments, suitable preclinical in vitro models for drug screening are lacking. Therefore, human-derived induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) technology offers the opportunity to model diverse and unreachable cell types in a culture dish. In this review, we focus on recent hiPSC-derived ALS neuronal and non-neuronal models to examine the research progress of current ALS 2D monocultures, co-cultures, and more complex 3D-model organoids. Despite the challenges inherent to hiPSC-based models, their application to preclinical drug studies is enormous.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: When attempting to study neurocognitive mechanisms with electroencephalography (EEG) in applied ecologically valid settings, responses to stimuli may differ in time, which presents challenges to traditional EEG averaging methods. In this proof-of-concept paper, we present a method to normalize time over unequal trial lengths while preserving frequency content. Methods: Epochs are converted to time-frequency space where they are resampled to contain an equal number of timepoints representing the proportion of trial complete rather than true time. To validate this method, we used EEG data recorded from 8 novices and 4 experts in veterinary medicine while completing decision-making tasks using two question types: multiple-choice and script concordance questions used in veterinary school exams. Results: The resulting resampled time-frequency data were analyzed with partial least squares (PLS), a multivariate technique that extracts patterns of data that support a contrast between conditions and groups while controlling for Type I error. We found a significant latent variable representing a difference between question types for experts only. Conclusions: Despite within and between subject differences in timing, we found consistent differences between question types in experts in gamma and beta bands that are consistent with changes resulting from increased information load and decision-making. This novel analysis method may be a viable path forward to preserve ecological validity in EEG studies.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/12/1/ENEURO.0166-24.2025?rss=1">Failed Stopping Transiently Suppresses the Electromyogram in Task-Irrelevant Muscles</a></h4>

              
                <p>Selectively stopping individual parts of planned or ongoing movements is an everyday motor skill. For example, while walking in public, you may stop yourself from waving at a stranger who you mistook for a friend while continuing to walk. Despite its ubiquity, our ability to selectively stop actions is limited. Canceling one action can delay the execution of other simultaneous actions. This stopping-interference effect on continuing actions during selective stopping may be attributed to a global inhibitory mechanism with widespread effects on the motor system. Previous studies have characterized a transient global reduction in corticomotor excitability by combining brain stimulation with electromyography (EMG). Here, we examined whether global motor inhibition during selective stopping can be measured peripherally and with high temporal resolution using EMG alone. Eighteen participants performed a bimanual anticipatory response inhibition task with their index fingers while maintaining a tonic contraction of the task-irrelevant abductor digiti minimi (ADM) muscles. A time series analysis of the ADM EMG signal revealed transient inhibition during failed stopping compared with go response trials 150 to 203&nbsp;ms following the stop signal. The pattern was observed in both hands during bimanual stop-all trials as well as selective stop-left and stop-right trials of either hand. These results indicate that tonic muscle activity is sensitive to the effects of global motor suppression even when stopping fails. Therefore, EMG can provide a physiological marker of global motor inhibition to probe the time course and extent of stopping processes.</p>

                <p>Cannabinoid receptor-1 (CB1R) signaling in the dorsal striatum regulates the shift from flexible to habitual behavior in instrumental outcome devaluation. Based on prior work establishing individual-, sex-, and experience-dependent differences in pavlovian behaviors, we predicted a role for dorsomedial striatum (DMS) CB1R signaling in driving rigid responding in pavlovian autoshaping and outcome devaluation. We trained male and female Long Evans rats in pavlovian lever autoshaping (PLA). We gave intra-DMS infusions of the CB1R inverse agonist, rimonabant, before satiety-induced outcome devaluation test sessions, where we sated rats on training pellets or home cage chow and tested them in brief nonreinforced PLA sessions. Overall, inhibition of DMS CB1R signaling prevented pavlovian outcome devaluation but did not affect behavior in reinforced PLA sessions. Males were sensitive to devaluation while females were not, and DMS CB1R blockade impaired devaluation sensitivity in males. Because these results suggest DMS CB1R signaling supports flexible responding, we investigated how DMS CB1R signaling impacts local inhibitory synaptic transmission in male and female Long Evans rats. We recorded spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSC) from DMS neurons at baseline and after application of a CB1R agonist, WIN 55,212-2. We found that male rats showed decreased sIPSC frequency compared with females and that CB1R activation reduced DMS inhibitory transmission independent of sex. Altogether our results demonstrate that DMS CB1Rs regulate pavlovian devaluation sensitivity and DMS inhibitory synaptic transmission and suggest that basal sex differences in inhibitory synaptic transmission may underly sex differences in DMS function and behavioral flexibility.</p>

                <p>The study of the neural circuitry underlying complex mammalian decision-making, particularly cognitive flexibility, is critical for understanding psychiatric disorders. To test cognitive flexibility, as well as potentially other decision-making paradigms involving multimodal sensory perception, we developed FlexRig, an open-source, modular behavioral platform for use in head-fixed mice. FlexRig enables the administration of tasks relying upon olfactory, somatosensory, and/or auditory cues and employing left and right licking as a behavior readout and reward delivery mechanism. The platform includes hardware and software components that are customizable, scalable, and portable, supporting a variety of behavioral assays. Using FlexRig, we established a head-fixed task to model attentional set-shifting, offering a new tool for neuroscience research that enhances the capacity for investigation of cognitive processes and their neural substrates, with broad applications in translational neuroscience.</p>

                <p>When individuals make a movement that produces an unexpected outcome, they learn from the resulting error. This process, essential in both acquiring new motor skills and adapting to changing environments, critically relies on error sensitivity, which governs how much behavioral change results from a given error. Although behavioral and computational evidence suggests error sensitivity can change in response to task demands, neural evidence regarding the flexibility of error sensitivity in the human brain is lacking. Here, we tested whether the nervous system's sensitivity to errors, as measured by prediction-driven suppression of auditory cortical activity, can be modulated by altering participants&rsquo; (both males and females) perceived variability during speech. Our results showed that error sensitivity, as measured by this suppression, was increased after exposure to an auditory perturbation that increased speakers&rsquo; perceived variability. The current study establishes the validity of behaviorally modulating the nervous system's sensitivity to errors, which has significant potential to enhance motor learning and rehabilitation.</p>

                <p>The subiculum represents a crucial brain pivot in regulating seizure generalization in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), primarily through a synergy of local GABAergic and long-projecting glutamatergic signaling. However, little is known about how subicular GABAergic interneurons are involved in a cell-type&ndash;specific way. Here, employing Ca<sup>2+</sup> fiber photometry, retrograde monosynaptic viral tracing, and chemogenetics in epilepsy models of both male and female mice, we elucidate circuit reorganization patterns mediated by subicular cell-type&ndash;specific interneurons and delineate their functional disparities in seizure modulation in TLE. We reveal distinct functional dynamics of subicular parvalbumin+ and somatostatin+ interneurons during secondary generalized seizure. These interneuron subtypes have their biased circuit organizations in terms of both input and output patterns, which undergo distinct reorganization in chronic epileptic condition. Notably, somatostatin+ interneurons exert more effective feedforward inhibition onto pyramidal neurons compared with parvalbumin+ interneurons, which engenders consistent antiseizure effects in TLE. These findings provide an improved understanding of different subtypes of subicular interneurons in circuit reorganization in TLE and supplement compelling proofs for precise treatment of epilepsy by targeting subicular somatostatin+ interneurons.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/5/e0786242024?rss=1">Regulation of Sleep Amount by CRTC1 via Transcription of Crh in Mice</a></h4>

              
                <p>The cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) is required for regulation of daily sleep amount, whereas gain of function of CREB-regulated transcription coactivator 1 (CRTC1) causes severe insomnia in mice. However, the physiological functions of CRTCs and their downstream target genes in the regulation of sleep amount remain unclear. Here, we use an adult brain chimeric (ABC)-expression/knock-out platform for somatic genetic analysis of sleep in adult male mice. ABC expression of constitutively active mutant CRTC1/2<sup>CA</sup> in the mouse brain neurons significantly reduces the amount of non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREMS) and/or rapid eye movement sleep (REMS). Consistent with the fact that SIK3 phosphorylates and inhibits CRTCs, ABC expression of CRTC1/2/3<sup>CA</sup> rescues the hypersomnia phenotype of <I>Sleepy</I> (<I>Sik3<sup>Slp</sup></I>) mice. While ABC-<I>Crtc2<sup>KO</sup></I> or <I>Crtc3<sup>KO</sup></I> causes no sleep phenotype, ABC-<I>Crtc1<sup>KO</sup></I> or ABC expression of dominant-negative CRTC (dnCRTC) results in a modest reduction of NREMS amount accompanied with elevated NREMS delta power. Moreover, ABC expression of CRTC1<sup>CA</sup> or dnCRTC in the excitatory neurons causes bidirectional changes of NREMS/REMS amount and/or NREMS delta power. The ability of CRTC1<sup>CA</sup> to regulate sleep requires its transactivation domain and CREB-binding domain and is dependent on CREB. Furthermore, we showed that inducible ABC expression of corticotropin-releasing hormone (<I>Crh</I>) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (<I>Bdnf</I>)&mdash;two target genes of CRTCs&mdash;significantly reduces daily sleep amount. Notably, ABC-<I>Crh<sup>KO</sup></I>, but not <I>Bdnf<sup>KO</sup></I>, rescues the insomnia phenotype of ABC-CRTC1<sup>CA</sup> mice. Taken together, these results indicate that the CREB-CRTC1 complex regulates daily sleep amount by modulating the transcription of <I>Crh</I> in the mouse brain neurons.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/5/e0872242024?rss=1">The Anterior Insula Engages in Feature- and Context-Level Predictive Coding Processes for Recognition Judgments</a></h4>

              
                <p>Predictive coding mechanisms facilitate detection and perceptual recognition, thereby influencing recognition judgements, and, broadly, perceptual decision-making. The anterior insula (AI) has been shown to be involved in reaching a decision about discrimination and recognition, as well as to coordinate brain circuits related to reward-based learning. Yet, experimental studies in the context of recognition and decision-making, targeting this area and based on formal trial-by-trial predictive coding computational quantities, are sparse. The present study goes beyond previous investigations and provides a predictive coding computational account of the role of the AI in recognition-related decision-making, by leveraging <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B79">Zaragoza-Jimenez et al. (2023)</cross-ref> open fMRI dataset (17 female, 10 male participants) and computational modeling, characterized by a combination of view-independent familiarity learning and contextual learning. Using model-based fMRI, we show that, in the context a two-option forced&ndash;choice identity recognition task, the AI engages in feature-level (i.e., view-independent familiarity) updating and error signaling processes and context-level familiarity updating to reach a recognition judgment. Our findings highlight that an important functional property of the AI is to update the level of familiarity of a given stimulus while also adapting to task-relevant, contextual information. Ultimately, these expectations, combined with input visual signals through reciprocally interconnected feedback and feedforward processes, facilitate recognition judgments, thereby guiding perceptual decision-making.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/5/e1149242024?rss=1">Social Risk Coding by Amygdala Activity and Connectivity with the Dorsal Anterior Cingulate Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>Risk is a fundamental factor affecting individual and social economic decisions, but its neural correlates are largely unexplored in the social domain. The amygdala, together with the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), is thought to play a central role in risk-taking. Here, we investigated in human volunteers (<I>n</I> = 20; 11 females) how risk (defined as the variance of reward probability distributions) in a social situation affects decisions and concomitant neural activity as measured with fMRI. We found separate variance-risk signals for social and nonsocial outcomes in the amygdala. Specifically, amygdala activity increased parametrically with social reward variance of presented choice options and on separate trials with nonsocial reward variance. Behaviorally, 75% of participants were averse to social risk as estimated in a Becker&ndash;DeGroot&ndash;Marschak auction-like procedure. The stronger this aversion, the more negative the coupling between risk-related amygdala regions and dACC. This negative relation was significant for social risk attitude but not for the attitude toward variance-risk in juice outcomes. Our results indicate that the amygdala and its coupling with dACC process objective and subjectively evaluated social risk. Moreover, while social risk can be captured with a framework originally established by finance theory for nonsocial risk, the amygdala appears to process social risk largely separately from nonsocial risk.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/5/e1167242024?rss=1">Complementary Organization of Mouse Driver and Modulator Cortico-thalamo-cortical Circuits</a></h4>

              
                <p>Corticocortical (CC) projections in the visual system facilitate hierarchical processing of sensory information. In addition to direct CC connections, indirect cortico-thalamo-cortical (CTC) pathways through the pulvinar nucleus of the thalamus can relay sensory signals and mediate cortical interactions according to behavioral demands. While the pulvinar connects extensively to the entire visual cortex, it is unknown whether transthalamic pathways link all cortical areas or whether they follow systematic organizational rules. Because mouse pulvinar neurons projecting to different areas are spatially intermingled, their input/output relationships have been difficult to characterize using traditional anatomical methods. To determine the organization of CTC circuits, we mapped the higher visual areas (HVAs) of male and female mice with intrinsic signal imaging and targeted five pulvinar-&gt;HVA pathways for projection-specific rabies tracing. We aligned postmortem cortical tissue to in vivo maps for precise quantification of the areas and cell types projecting to each pulvinar-&gt;HVA population. Layer 5 corticothalamic (L5CT) "driver" inputs to the pulvinar originate predominantly from primary visual cortex (V1), consistent with the CC hierarchy. L5CT inputs from lateral HVAs specifically avoid driving reciprocal connections, consistent with the "no-strong-loops" hypothesis. Conversely, layer 6 corticothalamic (L6CT) "modulator" inputs are distributed across areas and are biased toward reciprocal connections. Unlike previous studies in primates, we find that every HVA receives disynaptic input from the superior colliculus. CTC circuits in the pulvinar thus depend on both target HVA and input cell type, such that driving and modulating higher-order pathways follow complementary connection rules similar to those governing first-order CT circuits.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/5/e1279242024?rss=1">Delayed Accumulation of Inhibitory Input Explains Gamma Frequency Variation with Changing Contrast in an Inhibition Stabilized Network</a></h4>

              
                <p>Gamma rhythm (30&ndash;70&nbsp;Hz), thought to represent the interactions between excitatory and inhibitory populations, can be induced by presenting achromatic gratings in the primary visual cortex (V1) and is sensitive to stimulus properties such as size and contrast. In addition, gamma occurs in short bursts and shows a "frequency falloff" effect where its peak frequency is high after stimulus onset and slowly decreases to a steady state. Recently, these size-contrast properties and temporal characteristics were replicated in a self-oscillating Wilson&ndash;Cowan (WC) model operating as an inhibition stabilized network (ISN), stimulated by Ornstein&ndash;Uhlenbeck (OU) type inputs. In particular, frequency falloff was explained by delayed and slowly accumulated inputs arriving at local inhibitory populations. We hypothesized that if the stimulus is preceded by another higher contrast stimulus, frequency falloff could be abolished or reversed, since the excessive inhibition will now take more time to dissipate. We presented gratings at different contrasts consecutively to two female monkeys while recording gamma using microelectrode arrays in V1 and confirmed this prediction. Further, this model also replicated a characteristic pattern of gamma frequency modulation to counter-phasing stimuli as reported previously. These phenomena were also replicated by an ISN model subject to slow adaptation in feedforward excitatory input. Thus, ISN model with delayed surround input or adapted feedforward input replicates gamma frequency responses to time-varying contrasts.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/5/e1404242024?rss=1">Diverse Frontoparietal Connectivity Supports Semantic Prediction and Integration in Sentence Comprehension</a></h4>

              
                <p>Predictive processing in the parietal, temporal, frontal, and sensory cortex allows us to anticipate future meanings to maximize the efficiency of language comprehension, with the temporoparietal junction (TPJ) and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) thought to be situated toward the top of a predictive hierarchy. Although the regions underpinning this fundamental brain function are well-documented, it remains unclear how they interact to achieve efficient comprehension. To this end, we recorded functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in 22 participants (11 males) while they comprehended sentences presented part by part, in which we manipulated the constraint provided by sentential contexts on upcoming semantic information. Using this paradigm, we examined the connectivity patterns of bilateral TPJ and IFG during anticipatory phases (i.e., before the onset of targets) and integration phases (i.e., after the onset of targets). When upcoming semantic content was highly predictable in strong constraint contexts, both the left TPJ and bilateral IFG showed stronger visual coupling, while the right TPJ showed stronger connectivity with regions within control, default mode, and visual networks, including the IFG, parahippocampal gyrus, posterior cingulate, and fusiform gyrus. These connectivity patterns were weaker when predicted semantic content appeared, in line with predictive coding theory. Conversely, for less-predictable content, these connectivity patterns were stronger during the integration phase. Overall, these results suggest that both top-down semantic prediction and bottom-up integration during predictive processing are supported by flexible coupling of frontoparietal regions with control, memory, and sensory systems.</p>
