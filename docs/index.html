              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-775/v2?src=rss">A Systematic Review of Technology-Enhanced Project-Based Language Learning: Theoretical Frameworks, Project Types, and Implications for Future Research and Practice [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background The integration of digital technologies into project-based language learning has attracted growing scholarly attention; however, research in this area remains conceptually fragmented. A systematic synthesis of theoretical foundations, projects typologies, language skills and knowledge addressed, and pedagogical implications of technology-enhanced project-based language learning (TEPBLL) is still limited. Methods Restricted to SSCI-indexed publications and guided by PRISMA 2020 protocols, this systematic review examined 31 empirical studies published between 2015 and 2024. The analysis focused on the nature of publications, underlying theoretical frameworks, types of technology-supported projects, reported language-learning outcomes, and implications for research and instructional practice. Results The reviewed studies indicate that TEPBLL research is predominantly grounded in five theoretical frameworks and encompasses seven diverse technology-supported projects types. Across studies, TEPBLL is frequently reported improvements in eight major skills and knowledge areas. The review also identifies recurring three dimensions of implications for instructional practice and future research. Conclusions This review systematically synthesizes prevailing patterns in the TEPBLL literature. The study offers a coherent and comprehensive overview that can guide future research design and support more theory-informed, methodologically rigorous, and context-sensitive application of TEPBLL.

                <p>Decoding algorithms provide a powerful tool for understanding the firing patterns that underlie cognitive processes such as motor control, learning, and recall. When implemented in the context of a real-time system, decoders also make it possible to deliver feedback based on the representational content of ongoing neural activity. That, in turn, allows experimenters to test hypotheses about the role of that content in driving downstream activity patterns and behaviors. While multiple real-time systems have been developed, they are typically implemented with a compiled programming language, making them more difficult for users to quickly adapt for new experiments. Here we present a software system written in the widely used Python programming language to facilitate rapid experimentation. Our solution implements the state space based clusterless decoding algorithm for an online, real-time environment. The parallelized application processes neural data with temporal resolution of 6 ms and median computational latency &lt;50 ms for medium- to large-scale (32+ tetrodes) rodent hippocampus recordings without the need for spike sorting. It also executes auxiliary functions such as detecting sharp wave ripples from local field potential data. Even with an interpreted language, the performance is similar to state-of-the-art solutions that use compiled programming languages. We demonstrate this real-time decoder in a rat behavior experiment in which the decoder allowed closed-loop neurofeedback based on decoded hippocampal spatial representations. Overall this system provides a powerful and easy-to-modify tool for real-time feedback experiments.</p>

                Background The study of bi-univalent functions has gained considerable attention due to its relevance in geometric function theory, particularly in determining bounds for the initial coefficients of analytic functions. Previous research has introduced several subclasses of bi-univalent functions using tools such as convolution, subordination, differential subordination, and various families of special polynomials. Methods Motivated by these developments, this work constructs new subclasses of bi-univalent functions by employing generalized Fibonacci polynomials. The analytic properties of these polynomials are used to define the classes and derive the corresponding functional relations needed for coefficient estimation. Results For the newly introduced subclasses, bounds for the initial coefficients are established. Furthermore, Fekete–Szegö inequalities are obtained for each subclass, extending previously known results and demonstrating the influence of the generalized Fibonacci structure on coefficient behavior. Conclusions The results contribute to the ongoing development of bi-univalent function theory by providing broader subclasses and sharper estimates. The use of generalized Fibonacci polynomials offers a flexible analytical framework that can be further applied to related classes in future studies.

                Alzheimer’s disease (AD) remains the most common cause of dementia worldwide and one of the greatest health challenges of the twenty-first century. Traditionally viewed as a neurodegenerative disorder defined by amyloid-β plaques and tau tangles, recent evidence implicates systemic metabolic dysfunction and endothelial injury as key drivers of the disease progression. Insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and chronic hyperglycemia impair neuronal glucose utilization and insulin signaling, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and tau hyperphosphorylation. Concurrently, abnormal lipid metabolism and the presence of the apolipoprotein E4 allele accelerate amyloidogenic processing, while advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) formed during hyperglycemia activate RAGE-mediated inflammatory pathways that amplify neuronal injury. Endothelial dysfunction further compounds these effects by reducing nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability, disrupting the blood–brain barrier, and diminishing cerebral perfusion inhibiting amyloid clearance and intensifying neuroinflammation. These interconnected metabolic and vascular abnormalities establish a “metabolic–vascular–neurodegenerative axis” that links systemic disease to progressive neuronal degeneration. Understanding this integrative framework shifts the perspective of AD from a purely brain-centered disorder to a systemic, multi-organ pathology. Emerging therapeutic strategies that combine metabolic regulation, endothelial protection, and anti-inflammatory approaches offer a more comprehensive path toward prevention and disease modification. future research and clinical interventions can achieve a sustained neuroprotection by addressing the metabolic and vascular roots of AD.

                <p>by John S. McAlister, Jesse L. Brunner, Danielle J. Galvin, Nina H. Fefferman</p>

Global trade of material goods involves the potential to create pathways for the spread of infectious pathogens. One trade sector in which this synergy is clearly critical is that of wildlife trade networks. This highly complex system involves important and understudied bidirectional coupling between the economic decision making of the stakeholders and the contagion dynamics on the emergent trade network. While each of these components are independently well studied, there is a meaningful gap in understanding the feedback dynamics that can arise between them. In the present study, we describe a general game theoretic model for trade networks of goods susceptible to contagion. The primary result relies on the acyclic nature of the trade network and shows that, through the course of trading with stochastic infections, the probability of infection converges to a directly computable fixed point. This allows us to compute best responses and thus identify equilibria in the game. We present ways to use this model to describe and evaluate trade networks in terms of global and individual risk of infection under a wide variety of structural or individual modifications to the trade network. In capturing the bidirectional coupling of the system, we provide critical insight into the global and individual drivers and consequences for risks of infection inherent in and arising from the global wildlife trade, and any economic trade network with associated contagion risks.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1013786">Interplay of structured and random interactions in complex ecosystems dynamics</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Juan Giral Martínez, Matthieu Barbier, Silvia De Monte</p>

Minimal models for complex ecosystems often assume random interactions, whose statistics suffice to predict dynamical and macroecological patterns. However, ecological networks commonly possess a variety of properties, such as hierarchies or functional groups, that structure species interactions. Here, we ask how conclusions from random interaction models are altered by the presence of such community-level network structures. We consider a Lotka-Volterra model where pairwise species interactions combine structure and randomness, and study macroscopic community-level observables, abundance distributions and dynamical regimes. Randomness and structure combine in a surprisingly yet deceptively straightforward way: contributions from each component to community patterns are largely independent. Yet, their interplay has non-trivial consequences, notably out of equilibrium. We conclude that whether interaction structure matters depends on the pattern: when breaking species equivalence, static patterns of species presence and abundance predicted from random interaction models are less robust than the qualitative nature of dynamical regimes.

Esophageal motility arises from the continuous coupling between enteric neural activity and the organ’s mechanical response, yet the structure of this coupling remains poorly understood. Esophageal motility disorders represent mechanical dysfunctions that originate from abnormalities in neural control, underscoring the need to understand how neural and mechanical processes interact to produce coordinated motion. We present an empirically guided neuromechanical model of the esophagus, comprising unidirectionally coupled relaxation oscillators activated by intrinsic enteric nervous system mechanoreceptors sensitive to wall distension. The model reveals complex behaviors emerging from interactions among its components, predicting various clinically observed normal and abnormal esophageal responses to distension. Specifically, repetitive antegrade contractions (RACs) are shown to arise from the coupled neuromechanical dynamics in response to sustained volumetric distension. Normal RACs are shown to have a robust balance between excitatory and inhibitory neural activities and mechanical input through these intrinsic distension-sensitive mechanoreceptors. When this balance is affected, contraction patterns resembling motility disorders emerge. For example, clinically observed repetitive retrograde contractions emerge due to hypersensitive mechanoreceptors in the esophageal wall. Such neuromechanical insights may ultimately guide the development of targeted pharmacological interventions.

                <p>by Joel Vanin, Michael Getz, Catherine Mahony, Thomas B. Knudsen, James A. Glazier</p>
Purpose <p>To develop a computational model that addresses limitations in current ocular irritation assessment methods, particularly regarding long-term effects, and recovery patterns following chemical exposure or trauma to the cornea.</p> Methods <p>V-Cornea is an agent-based computer simulation implemented in CompuCell3D that models corneal epithelial homeostasis and injury response. The model incorporates biologically-inspired rules governing cell behaviors (proliferation, differentiation, death) and key signaling pathways including Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF), translating cell-level behaviors to tissue-level outcomes (<i>in vitro</i> to <i>in vivo</i> extrapolation, IVIVE).</p> Results <p>V-Cornea successfully reproduces corneal epithelial architecture and maintains tissue homeostasis over extended simulated periods. Following simulated trauma or toxicant exposure, the model accurately predicts healing timeframes of 3–5 days for slight and mild injuries. For moderate injuries with basement membrane disruption, the model demonstrates longer recovery times and emergent dynamic structural disorganization that mimics recurrent corneal erosions, providing mechanistic insights into these pathological conditions.</p> Conclusions <p>V-Cornea’s modular CompuCell3D implementation is easily extensible to incorporate additional recovery and injury mechanisms. Future versions will include more realistic basement membrane dynamics and explicit representation of stromal tissue and immune response to improve predictivity for moderate injuries. This virtual-tissue approach shows potential not only for toxicological assessments but also for drug discovery and therapy optimization by providing a platform to test interventions and predict outcomes across various injury scenarios.</p>

                Abstract* Background Heavy metals such as cadmium, lead, and mercury are ubiquitous in the environment, accumulating in plants, animals, water and human food. Human exposure through the consumption of vegetable crops is a global concern because such metals may be toxic even in trace amounts. There are many factors influencing heavy metal concentrations in vegetables including, soil properties, growing practices and flooding events. This study aimed to investigate heavy metal concentrations in vegetable samples in Hawke’s Bay, New Zealand, one year post Severe Tropical Cyclone Gabrielle, which caused widespread flooding on the 14th of February 2023. Methods This cross-sectional study included organic and non-organic vegetables and sites impacted and not-impacted by cyclone flooding. In total, 736 vegetable samples were combined to form 153 representative samples collected from 14 markets grown at 10 growing sites. Samples were analysed by ICP-MS in an ISO-17025 accredited laboratory. Results Cadmium (p = 0.003) and nickel (p < 0.001) contamination were higher in non-organic vegetables. Growing vegetables on flood-affected land was independently associated with reduced cadmium (p = 0.030) and nickel (p = 0.024) contamination. Three samples exceeded Codex Alimentarius lead permissible levels (0.1 mg kg−1 fresh weight), and one sample exceeded cadmium permissible levels (0.05 mg kg−1 fresh weight in Brassica). Conclusions This study suggests that Hawke’s Bay vegetables by global standards, are generally low risk, for heavy metal toxicity and organic vegetables, carry the lowest risk. However, some vegetables do exceed maximum limits for lead and cadmium. We speculate that recent Severe Tropical Cyclone Gabrielle did not increase risk and may have reduced the risk of heavy metal toxicity from vegetable consumption.

                Background The non-coding RNAs, particularly microRNA-181a-5p target the expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced protein 3 (TNFAIP3) a key negative regulator of NF-κB signaling and affect the levels of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) and chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) in chronic myeloid leukamia (CML). Methods The study included 57 individuals with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and 33 healthy individuals. Hematological parameters (Hb, RBCs, WBCs and platelets) were assessed. The serum levels of MIF, TNFAIP3 and CXCR4 were measured using ELISA Technique. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed to assess miR-181a expression. The potential targets and immune associated pathways of miR-181a were predicted using bioinformatics tools including TargetScan, miRTarBase, STRING, DAVID, and Enrichr. Statistical analysis included ROC curve evaluation, Pearson correlation, and t-tests. Results Compared to controls, CML patients exhibited reduced platelets, Hb and RBC while elevated WBCs recorded. There were significantly elevated serum levels of MIF and CXCR4, and reduced levels of TNFAIP3 (p<0.01) in CML patients compared to control. Moreover, higher miR-181a expression (2.28 fold, p=0.0001) recorded in CML compared to control. Positive correlations were observed between miR-181a expression and both MIF and CXCR4 levels while TNFAIP3 exhibited a reverse correlation. ROC analysis showed that MIF (AUC = 0.873) and CXCR4 (AUC = 0.929) exhibited strong diagnostic performance while TNFAIP3 (AUC = 0.142) and miR-181a-5p (AUC = 0.201) demonstrated weak accuracy consistent with their opposite expression patterns between CML patients and healthy controls. Conclusion The inhibition of TNFAIP3 by miR-181a leads to enhanced NF-κB-mediated inflammatory and immune signaling suggesting a novel pathogenic mechanism in CML involving immune dysregulation. The identification of miR-181a, MIFpresent3, and CXCR4 as key players in immune modulation and inflammation presents promising therapeutic targets and diagnostic biomarkers in CML particularly within the Iraqi population.

                Background Local ecosystems and global agriculture are contingent upon the mutualistic relationship between pollinators and floral plants. In symbiosis, pollinators increase agricultural production by improving plant cross-pollination, genetic variety, crop quality, and yield. The potential impact on plant reproduction is particularly alarming due to the decline of pollinating insects. Habitat loss, diseases, climate change, pesticides, and predation have all contributed to the decline of pollinator species. High-speed wind is a significant factor that impacts the mutualistic relationship between plants and pollinators. Methods Studying the dynamics of interactions between blooming plants and honeybee populations is crucial for addressing honeybee decline and ensuring sustainable ecosystems. This work employs mathematical modeling to analyze the dynamics of a blooming plant, honeybee population, and honey production symbiosis, with a special emphasis on the effect of high-speed wind flow. Results The stability of various ecological equilibria has been investigated using dynamical system theory. Bifurcation phenomena, such as transcritical and Hopf bifurcations, have been discovered using bifurcation theory. Furthermore, the numerical results show that high wind flow can cause the extinction of the honeybee population and honey production. Conclusions Due to the rapid depletion of flowering plants and the high rate of wind speed, the populations of honeybees and blossoming plants are at risk of becoming unsustainable. However, the combination of reduced wind flow and increased symbiotic strengths can bolster the stability and sustainability of blooming plant-honeybee-honey production ecosystems. These findings inform conservation policies targeted toward protecting honeybees and increasing biodiversity.

                Abstract Background Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune condition characterized by symmetrical and chronic pain and inflammation, initially affecting the small joints of the hands and feet, and later the larger joints. RA also attacks other organs of the body, particularly the skin, eyes, heart, kidneys, and lungs. Aim The purpose of this research is to assess and characterize the hematological and immunological parameters that indicate the presence of inflammation and autoimmune conditions in persons with RA. Methods 90 male participants were recruited from several healthcare facilities, including Fallujah Teaching Hospital and Diagnostic Laboratories. The participants, RA patients (60) and healthy controls (30) were distributed into 2 groups for the comparative analysis of the hematological and immunological parameters. Results Significant elevations (P < 0.0001) in erythrocyte sedimentation rate and immunoglobulins G and M were observed in RA patients across three age groups: young adults (25–40 years), middle-aged (41–65 years), and older adults (66–90 years). Anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide, anti-mutated citrullinated vimentin, rheumatoid factor, and C-reactive protein showed significant increases (P < 0.0001) across all age categories. Conclusion The results reveal systemic inflammation and autoimmune dysregulation that are independent of patient age. Using immunological and hematological biomarkers in routine practice can improve diagnostic accuracy, guide personalized treatment, and help prevent joint damage while enhancing patients’ quality of life.

                Background Promotions in consumer packaged goods (CPG) markets are inherently transient. Each campaign, be it a temporary price reduction (TPR), feature advertisement, in-store display, or combined feature and display, produces an immediate surge in sales followed by an eventual decline once the event ends. Despite this, sales patterns during the active promotional phase often exhibit conditional stability. Methods We introduce a quasi-stationary promotion modeling framework that applies quasi-stationary distributions (QSDs) to characterize the conditional behavior of promotional sales prior to termination. By treating the end of a promotion as an absorbing state and the underlying mechanics (TPR, Feature, Display, and Feature + Display) as transient states, we model the system as a finite-state Markov process. The left eigenvector of the transition sub-matrix yields the conditional sales mix m , while the dominant eigenvalue provides the decay rate α governing promotional persistence. Using simulated 104 -week UPC-level data, we estimate transition probabilities, derive QSD parameters, and analyze promotion lifespans. Results The QSD-based framework quantifies both the effective duration of promotions (via α and 1 / α ) and the relative dominance of different promotional tactics during the active phase (via m ). In simulated CPG settings, the approach differentiates between long-lived and fast-decaying promotions and reveals how transitions among TPR, Feature, Display, and Feature + Display shape conditional sales composition while the promotion is still live. Conclusions Quasi-stationary promotion modeling provides a unified stochastic basis for understanding promotion dynamics, forecasting lift persistence, and optimizing campaign duration. By linking QSD theory with applied decision intelligence in CPG analytics, the framework offers interpretable parameters that can be embedded into promotion planning, portfolio management, and real-time decision systems.

                The psychosocial experiences of widows during the death cleansing rituals have significant implications for their mental health and well-being. These rituals include medicinal body baths, isolation, deprivation of specific foods or behaviour, wearing dark clothing and shaving hair, among others. Cleansing rituals are an important cultural practice that is believed to purify the widow and help her cope with her loss. However, the rituals may also create psychological stress for widows who may feel stigmatised in their communities. To shed light on this topic, the present scoping review aims to identify and map the literature on the psychosocial experiences of widows during the cleansing ritual in Southern African countries. This review will follow the PRISMA guidelines and involve a comprehensive search of relevant databases, such as PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, and PsycINFO, for peer-reviewed articles that focus on the experiences of widows in Africa during death cleansing rituals. The review’s findings are expected to have significant implications for policy and practice. Governments and support organisations should prioritise the development of culturally sensitive support services, including counselling and economic empowerment programs, to aid widows in Southern Africa. Furthermore, policies should be implemented to protect the rights of widows and prevent gender-based violence and discrimination.

                Background The COVID-19 pandemic has caused changes in respiratory infectious diseases. Examining the patterns of pathogens associated with acute respiratory infection (ARI) in children before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic would help to understand the impact of the pandemic on pathogen emergence or re-emergence. Methods We analyzed de-identified data from microbiology assays of nasopharyngeal and blood samples of children ≤15 years old with ARI who visited Vinmec Times City International Hospital in Hanoi, Vietnam from 01/01/2019 to 31/12/2023. The data were aggregated by month, and time-series analysis and visualization were performed. Results A Bacterial Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) panel was performed on 4,125 samples (67% positive), Mycoplasma pneumonia (MP) IgM was performed on 5,049 samples (39% positive), bacterial culture was performed on 10,280 samples (43% positive), and viral PCR or rapid test was performed on 42,300 samples (23% positive). After the COVID-19 pandemic from mid-2022, Haemophilus influenzae (HI) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (SP) have re-emerged as epidemic pathogens associated with lower respiratory tract infection (LRI). Influenza type A and type B have re-established regular cycles of peaks in winter-spring months after an early rebound together with an unprecedented new emergence of Human Adenovirus (HAdV) soon after the relief of COVID-19 restriction in mid-2022. Late after the COVID-19 pandemic, from mid-2023, atypical pneumonia pathogen Mycoplasma pneumonia (MP) has emerged remarkably and has become epidemic; there was also a small, brief emergence of Chlamydophila pneumoniae (CP) infection. Conclusion Our data characterize the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on the patterns of respiratory infection pathogens in children and is useful for disease surveillance and public health interventions.

                Abstract* Background The development of critical thinking remains a challenge in private universities (PTS) in Indonesia. Learning interactions in PTS are often influenced by interpersonal closeness, cultural norms, and communication patterns that do not always support the courage to express opinions. Although previous research has emphasized the roles of lecturer-student interactions and student collaboration, empirical studies explaining how the form and quality of these interactions influence critical thinking are limited. This study aims to describe the forms of interaction, the quality of pedagogical support, and the barriers that influence the development of students’ critical thinking. Methods This qualitative study involved 12 students from a private university in Bogor. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews and analyzed thematically to identify patterns of lecturer-student interactions, peer collaboration, and cultural factors that influence participation. Results The results indicate that supportive lecturer-student interactions—including constructive feedback, positive emotional responses, and warm communication—increase students’ confidence and engagement in critical thinking activities. Peer collaboration helps broaden perspectives and cultivate higher-order reasoning. However, obstacles persist, including uneven lecturer support, unequal group contributions, and students’ tendency to remain silent due to hierarchy, politeness norms, and fear of judgment. Conclusions Positive and culturally sensitive learning interactions play a crucial role in fostering critical thinking in private universities. Consistent pedagogical support and structured collaboration are necessary to foster an inclusive learning environment for critical thinking.

                Background Accurate estimation of the postmortem interval (PMI) remains one of the central challenges in forensic medicine. Traditional external markers are limited by environmental and individual variability. Bone marrow, owing to its protected anatomical location and slower decomposition rate, offers a potential histological substrate for PMI estimation. Aim This study aimed to evaluate cytoplasmic changes in sternal bone marrow cells and assess their correlation with Postmortem interval (PMI). Methods A descriptive cross-sectional study of 43 medico-legal autopsies with documented time of death. Sternal bone marrow aspirates were stained with Leishman stain and examined microscopically. Cytoplasmic changes were scored from 0 to 4 (intact morphology to complete dissolution) using a system adapted from Biradar G et al. Data were analyzed using ANOVA (p < 0.05). Results Mild cytoplasmic alterations (S1) were most frequent (51.1%), followed by moderate changes (S2, 25.6%) and severe dissolution (S4, 14%). Only 9.3% of cases showed no observable changes (S0). Mean PMI increased with the severity of cytoplasmic changes (S0: 8.5 h; S1: 14.1 h; S2: 10.5 h; S4: 15.0 h), although some overlap was seen, especially at S2, likely reflecting biological and environmental variability. The overall correlation was not statistically significant (p > 0.05). Conclusion Cytoplasmic autolysis in bone marrow appears to follow a progressive pattern, from early vacuolation to complete dissolution with increasing PMI. Although not statistically significant, observed trends suggest cytoplasmic scoring may aid early PMI estimation when combined with other markers.

                Abstract* This paper presents a Neutrosophic extension of the New odd Weibull inverse Weibull (NNOWIW) distribution, aiming to develop a statistical model capable of handling ambiguous or imprecise data. The mathematical formulation of the proposed distribution was derived by combining Neutrosophic logic with the T-X method, specifying the NCDF, the NPDF and the survival and hazard functions. The statistical probability of the distribution was analyzed. To achieve optimal estimation of the distribution parameters, the maximum likelihood (MLE), least square (LSE), and weighted least squares (WLSE) methods were used, and their performance was evaluated using Monte Carlo simulations. The models efficiency was also tested using real battery life data and compared to competing distributions. The results show that the proposed distribution shows competitive and flexible performance in terms of information criteria (AIC, CAIC, BIC, HQIC) and goodness-of-fit tests suggesting its potential usefulness for modeling complex data. However, further validation on larger and more diverse datasets is required to generalize these findings.

                Introduction The rapidly evolving nature of technology and globalization in recent times makes it imperative to remain at the forefront of innovation and creativity in order to effectuate changes in health practices. Objective To assess and compare knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) reforms among various academic ranks and grades of healthcare professionals in North India. Methods A self-designed validated questionnaire comprising 24 close-ended questions was administered to healthcare professionals working in various settings through online links. This cross-sectional study was conducted from August 2023 to September 2023. Prior to this study, a pilot study of 20 healthcare professionals was conducted with a sample size of 747. The reliability of the questionnaire was assessed using Cronbach’s α (0.84), and validity was assessed using the content validity ratio (0.76). The data were analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, version 28.0. Armonk, NY: IBM Corp. Results The average age of the participants was 36.31 ± 9.95 years, and their average experience was about 8.53 ± 5.70. The mean overall knowledge score for healthcare professionals was 9.65 ± 1.26 (faculty), and 7.73 ± 1.84 (Residents). The majority of participants 289 (38.7%) agreed that obtaining a patent was tedious process. Conclusion Healthcare professionals have scarce awareness of intellectual property rights and their reforms in research. The Ayurveda specialty participants and government institution participants were better aware of IPR reforms, but implementation was challenging for them. Hence, enforcing a robust IPR regime and its appropriate implementation is of utmost importance for an hour.

                Objective To analyze worldwide otorhinolaryngology publications from 2015–2024 and identify the top-performing countries, journals, funding agencies, organizations, and individual researchers. Methods A cross-sectional bibliometric analysis of the Web of Science Core Collection was conducted using Clarivate’s InCites, restricting results to the “Otorhinolaryngology” research area from 2015–2024 (data updated March 28, 2025). Primary metrics included publication counts, total citations, and category-normalized citation impact (CNCI). Secondary measures included the percentage of publications in the top 1% and 10% by citations, in first-quartile (Q1) journals, and with international co-authorship. Results A total of 95,435 otolaryngology publications were identified. The United States led in output (31,654 publications) and citations (342,724), with 1.57% in the top 1% by citations. Germany (7,036 publications) and China (6,447) were next largest. Italy achieved the highest citation impact among major countries (CNCI 1.77). The Laryngoscope was the most prolific journal (6,757 articles), whereas JAMA Otolaryngology–Head & Neck Surgery had the highest citation impact (CNCI 1.91). The US National Institutes of Health and the National Natural Science Foundation of China were the top funders, supporting 5,063 and 1,761 publications, respectively. Harvard University (including affiliates) produced over 7,000 publications, and Jerome R. Lechien was the most prolific author (387 publications, CNCI 3.64). International collaborations accounted for 13.5% of all publications. Conclusion Global otolaryngology research over the past decade has been dominated by a few countries and institutions, particularly in the United States. These findings highlight disparities in research output and can inform strategies to broaden international collaboration and strengthen emerging research centers.

">The combination of elevated neuronal activity and mitochondrial damage induces Pink1-dependent mitophagy in axons</a></h4>

              
                Mitochondria are critical for synaptic function. At the synapse, mitochondria produce ATP and buffer calcium, both of which are required for synapse function. Defects in mitochondrial maintenance are linked to neurodegenerative disease, yet we know little about what regulates the need for mitophagy at the synapse. We assessed the impact of neuron type, activity, and mitochondrial damage on mitophagy rate in axons of larval zebrafish. Using electron and confocal microscopy, we show that mitophagy occurs in the axon terminal of postsynaptic sensory neurons and presynaptic motor neurons at similar rates. Increasing neuronal activity or mitochondria damage does not impact the amount of mitophagy in axons. Only by combining neuronal activity and mitochondrial damage does the rate of mitophagy increase in the axon and this increase requires Pink1. Together, our data support a model in which increased mitophagic demand in axons is rare and uniquely sensitive to Pink1 disruption.

">Cortical spectral rebalancing underlies pregabalin's efficacy in restless legs syndrome</a></h4>

              
                Restless legs syndrome afflicts nearly half of all patients with end-stage renal disease, imposing profound burdens through relentless insomnia and functional decline. Dopaminergic agents--the established first-line therapy--trigger augmentation, a paradoxical intensification of symptoms that leaves patients worse than when they began treatment. The resultant therapeutic impasse has left a vulnerable population without effective recourse. Here we demonstrate that pregabalin, an alpha2delta; calcium channel ligand with established renal safety, provides robust and sustained symptom relief in a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of dialysis patients with uremic restless legs syndrome. Clinical benefits emerged rapidly and intensified over three months, with pregabalin-treated patients showing more than twofold greater likelihood of categorical improvement in disease severity. In complementary animal electrophysiology experiments, pregabalin distinctively suppressed cortical hyperarousal--a hallmark of restless legs syndrome--by rebalancing low- and high-frequency oscillatory activity patterns, particularly in motor regions. This neural signature closely resembled that of gabapentin, another therapeutically effective alpha2delta ligand, suggesting convergent mechanisms. Beyond establishing pregabalin as an urgently needed alternative to dopaminergic therapy, our results demonstrate that cortical oscillatory profiling can reveal mechanistic convergence among candidate therapeutics, offering a rational preclinical screening strategy for neurological disorders before exposure of high-risk patient populations to experimental interventions. This framework may accelerate therapeutic discovery while reducing clinical trial risks in vulnerable populations.

">Spatial and temporal contexts drive visual temporal integration via spatiotemporal normalisation</a></h4>

              
                The visual system is known to integrate sensory information across both space and time, but these dimensions are often studied separately. Here we provide novel behavioural evidence for an early integration over space and time, and propose a computational model of this integration that is biologically plausible. We designed a controlled task that forces human participants to integrate information over both space and time to perform well. Stimuli were temporally segmented rings of oriented elements and participants had to detect a missing element in the ring. We found that temporal integration was enhanced when successive visual events were temporally proximate, spatially aligned to form a continuous contour, but also, and more surprisingly, when they were brief. Notably, the spatial effects on integration are temporally asymmetric: integration is facilitated when more events are presented earlier in the sequence, and even more so when they form a collinear contour. These findings indicate that temporal integration is sensitive to both the spatial configuration and the number of visual events presented over time, supporting a continuous rather than discrete process at early visual stages. All of these results are well accounted for by a computational model in which temporal integration arises from the overlap of internal signals generated by individual visual events. These signals are shaped by a spatially and temporally tuned divisive normalisation mechanism and integrated via coincidence detection. Predictions from this model match human performance in seminal past work as well as novel stimulus displays, offering an account of how spatio temporal interactions determine what we perceive and when.

">Repetitive Hibernation-Like State Suppresses the Progression of Amyloid Pathology</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer's disease (AD) is known to exhibit amyloid pathology years before the onset of cognitive impairment. While early detection and pathological modification are considered essential for suppressing or preventing disease progression, effective strategies remain elusive. Here, we investigated whether inducing a hibernation-like state via Q neuron-induced hypometabolism/hypothermia state (QIH) suppresses the progression of early amyloid pathology in AD model mice. To maximize the total duration of QIH, we established and implemented a repetitive QIH (rQIH) protocol. Using 82E1 antibody immunostaining, we found that rQIH significantly reduced early amyloid plaque burden, and the magnitude of this suppression was positively correlated with rQIH duration. rQIH also decreased the formation of dystrophic neurites surrounding plaques. These findings demonstrate that a hibernation-like physiological state can attenuate early amyloid pathology, providing a potential foundation for future hibernation-based therapeutic strategies for AD.

">A shared ensemble in the prelimbic cortex links impulsivity and anxiety-like behavior.</a></h4>

              
                Mental health disorders often share overlapping behavioral and neural features, yet it remains unclear why these relationships emerge or whether they reflect common underlying neural processes. To explore this, we recorded prelimbic (PL) activity using endoscopic calcium imaging as rats completed a battery of tasks assessing impulsivity, distress tolerance, anxiety-like behavior, incentive salience (Pavlovian conditioned approach), and sensation-seeking in a novel environment (locomotor activity). By collecting neural and behavioral measures across all tasks within each animal, we were able to investigate whether PL activity tracked processes that were either unique to individual behaviors, shared across multiple behaviors, or both. We found that PL activity was significantly predictive of each of the behaviors except locomotor activity. Subsequent analyses revealed shared behavioral structure across tasks, with one latent dimension reflecting high impulsivity and low anxiety-like behavior. Individual variability across this particular dimension was strongly predicted by a neural structure comprising shared PL activity across four of the behaviors. Furthermore, this relationship was driven by a subset of PL neurons that shared patterns of activity across multiple tasks, forming a shared neural ensemble. Importantly, animals with a greater tendency to share neural ensembles exhibited a stronger link between high impulsivity and low anxiety-like behavior. These findings suggest that a small, shared ensemble of PL neurons tracked activity across multiple clinically-relevant behaviors to predict an approach/avoidance phenotype characterized by high impulsivity and low anxiety. This points toward a targetable neural population that may help explain why diverse psychiatric symptoms often co-occur within individuals.

">Capturing Rapid Behavioral Adaptation in an Updated Theory of the Hippocampal Cognitive Map and its Neural Implementation</a></h4>

              
                Animals rapidly and flexibly adapt their behavior by forming an internal cognitive map. The cognitive map has been studied at multiple levels, including normative, representational, and mechanistic accounts, often focused on the role of the hippocampus. Here, we propose a framework extending the normative successor representation (SR) theory and its link to hippocampal representations and processes, incorporating recent insights into the neural basis of rapid adaptation in hippocampal areas CA3 and CA1. In our model, CA3 uses temporally symmetric behavioral time scale plasticity (BTSP) to encode spatiotemporal proximity experienced during exploration, CA1 uses temporally asymmetric BTSP to encode a perceived salience-weighted SR, and downstream areas learn successor feature predictions that can guide behavior in accordance with a behaving animal's motivational state. Through simulations of a rodent exploring a maze, we show that the network rapidly learns this representation and further strengthens the map by generating spontaneous replay activity during subsequent offline phase. Behavioral simulations show how these processes give rise to motivational state-dependent choice, rapid behavioral adaptation to changes in the availability or reward, and one-trial avoidance learning.

">Breath as an internal context: Respiratory phase alignment between encoding and retrieval optimizes memory performance.</a></h4>

              
                Increasing evidence suggests that respiratory rhythms are crucial for cognitive functions. Although recent findings suggest that respiratory activity may serve as an internal contextual framework during memory processes, the contribution of specific respiratory phases to encoding and retrieval remains unclear. Here, we investigated the breathing-dependent performance of 30 healthy volunteers during a visual delayed matching-to-sample recognition memory task while their nasal respiration was monitored. Reaction times (RTs) decreased when visual cues were both encoded and retrieved during the late phase of exhalation. In contrast, longer RTs were observed during late exhalation at retrieval when encoding occurred either (i) during a period that encompassed inspiratory onset (i.e., exhalation-to-inhalation transition or EI transition) or (ii) during the early phase of inhalation. These contrasting outcomes under identical retrieval conditions highlight the phase-dependent effects of respiration, specifically the alignment of respiratory timing between encoding and retrieval. Importantly, we found that the late phase of exhalation during both encoding and retrieval may represent a favorable temporal window for shaping memory performance. These findings suggest that respiratory phase alignment modulates memory processes by providing an interoceptive, phase-dependent context for cognition.

">Modeling Individualized Adolescent Mental Health through a Multifactorial Causal Framework to Identify Potential Intervention Strategies</a></h4>

              
                Adolescence is a sensitive period for the emergence of psychopathology. During this time, physiological changes and environmental exposures jointly shape brain development and influence cognitive and personality maturation, collectively heightening vulnerability to mental disorders. However, the complexity of interactions between these factors has hindered a systems-level understanding of mental health and the causal roles of cognition and personality in psychopathology. In this study, we proposed a multifactorial causal framework integrating brain, pubertal, environmental, and behavioral factors to characterize heterogeneity in adolescent mental health trajectories at the individual level. We then investigated latent causal pathways linking cognition and personality to mental health outcomes and identified potential personalized intervention targets. Leveraging the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) dataset (N = 4,501), we analyzed 165 behavioral pairs connecting cognition and personality traits to mental health symptoms. Using cross-sectional multivariate mediation and longitudinal interaction-inclusive analyses, we identified 68 behavioral pairs showing significant causal relationships, with brain and environmental exposures contributing to most pathways, while pubertal factors exhibited limited involvement. Individualized interpretive analyses further revealed 23 pairs suggesting potential interventions with response rates exceeding 50%. Among these, behavioral inhibition, negative urgency, and processing speed emerged as the most common intervention targets, whereas psychosis symptoms and attention problems were the most likely issues to improve. Overall, our study advances a comprehensive framework capturing the multifactorial and heterogeneous nature of adolescent mental health, delineates specific causal pathways from cognitive and personality traits to psychopathology, and provides a principled basis for potential individualized intervention strategies.

">Profiling miRNAs involved in Human Oligodendrocyte Precursor Cell Differentiation and Maturation</a></h4>

              
                MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are evolutionarily conserved post-transcriptional regulators that play critical roles in cellular development and differentiation across species. Although the importance of miRNAs in oligodendrocyte lineage cell (OLLC) differentiation has been extensively studied in rodent models, their roles in human OL development remain less understood. To address this gap, we used a human embryonic stem cell (hESC) reporter system designed to study human OLs and OL progenitor cells (OPCs). Using an optimized differentiation protocol, we used the reporter hESCs to generate and isolate well-characterized OLLCs at specific developmental stages and performed next-generation sequencing-based miRNA profiling to identify stage-specific miRNAs enriched during OL lineage specification and maturation. In addition to canonical miRNAs known to be enriched at various stages of OL development, our study identified several lesser-known miRNAs with distinct stage-specific enrichment patterns that may serve as useful molecular markers for classifying human CNS cell types in future studies. Target analysis of OPC- and OL-enriched miRNAs revealed key genes, including transcription factors ZNF488 and DLX1, cytoskeletal regulator CSNK2B, and potassium channel gene KCNJ1, along with key signaling pathways such as AKT, SMAD2/3, estrogen receptor, and insulin signaling, which regulate OPC and OL lineage function. These findings advance our understanding of the OLLC-specific miRNAs, and miRNA-mediated regulatory networks governing human OL differentiation and maturation and provide promising therapeutic targets for future studies aimed at restoring myelin integrity and improving outcomes in demyelinating diseases.

">Did you see the sound? A Bayesian Perspective on Crossmodal Perception in Low Vision</a></h4>

              
                Multisensory integration is often assumed to increase when visual input is degraded, yet it remains unclear whether low vision enhances susceptibility to cross-modal illusions or whether such effects depend on local variations in visual reliability. We tested low vision and sighted control participants on the Double Flash Illusion across 24 visual-field locations while separately measuring flash-detection accuracy. Both groups showed the expected auditory-driven increase in perceived flash numerosity, but only sighted controls reliably experienced the classic "double-flash" percept. Illusion strength did not vary with eccentricity; instead, it was strongly predicted by local flash detection accuracy, indicating that sound-induced percepts depend on the availability of a reliable visual signal. Bayesian Causal Inference modeling revealed substantially weaker and more variable fits for low vision observers, with poorer fits associated with reduced visual sensitivity. Although model parameters did not differ significantly between groups, the similarity in estimated visual noise likely reflects model limitations rather than true equivalence in sensory precision. Together, these findings show that low vision does not globally amplify audiovisual interactions; rather, auditory enhancement depends on local visual reliability, and degraded vision leads to weaker alignment with Bayesian-optimal predictions.

">Activation of neurogenesis improves amyloid-β pathology and cognitive function through AMP kinase signaling in Alzheimer's disease model mice</a></h4>

              
                Adult hippocampal neurogenesis declines with aging and in neurological disorders, leading to cognitive impairment. We previously demonstrated that a treatment of inducing Plagl2, a zinc finger transcription factor gene, and antagonizing Dyrk1a, a gene associated with Down syndrome, referred to as iPaD, can functionally rejuvenate aged neural stem cells (NSCs), thereby enhancing neurogenesis and improving cognition in aged mice. Here, we found that NSC-specific iPaD treatment effectively activated neurogenesis, reduced amyloid-{beta} deposition, and improved cognitive function in Alzheimer's disease model mice. Transcriptomic analysis revealed widespread significant changes in gene expression in the hippocampus following iPaD treatment. The upregulated genes included those associated with the activation of astrocytes and microglia involved in amyloid-{beta} clearance, while the downregulated genes included several that are upregulated in Alzheimer's disease patients, but whose roles in disease progression remain unclear. Among the latter genes, knockdown of Prkag2, a gene encoding protein kinase AMP-activated non-catalytic subunit gamma 2, in the hippocampus most effectively enhanced neurogenesis and reduced amyloid-{beta} accumulation. Notably, both iPaD treatment and Prkag2 knockdown activated AMP-activated protein kinase signaling, thereby upregulating genes involved in autophagy and cellular homeostasis. These results suggest that Prkag2 may represent a promising therapeutic target for neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease.

">The impact of downsampling on data quality, univariate measurement and multivariate pattern analysis in event-related potential research</a></h4>

              
                The choice of sampling rate is a critical preprocessing step in event-related potential (ERP) research, yet its impact on different analytic approaches remains underexplored. In this study, we systematically evaluated how downsampling affects data quality measured via Standardized Measurement Error (SME), conventional univariate ERP metrics (mean amplitude, peak amplitude, peak latency, and 50% area latency), and multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA; decoding). We analyzed seven commonly studied ERP components: P3, N400, N170, N2pc, mismatch negativity, error-related negativity, and lateralized readiness potential collected from neurotypical young adults. Results showed that both amplitude- and latency-based scores were significantly affected by sampling rate changes, particularly for 50% area latency that presented increased SME (reduced data quality) at lower sampling rates. Amplitude-based measures and their corresponding effect sizes were more influenced by sampling rate variations, whereas latency-based measures were comparatively stable across different temporal resolutions. In contrast, multivariate decoding performance remained highly robust, with decoding accuracy and effect sizes showing minimal variation even at the lowest sampling rate (e.g., 64 Hz). Overall, these findings suggest that caution should be exercised when employing lower sampling rates for data quality and conventional univariate ERP analyses. Nevertheless, lower sampling rates (e.g., 64 Hz) may still be appropriate for decoding analyses, particularly in studies where precise temporal resolution is not critical. For researchers analyzing ERP data with similar components, noise levels, and participant populations as in this study, following these recommendations should yield robust statistical power.

">Chronic stress abnormalize microglial-vascular interaction via AT1R signaling and microglia activation to drive depression-like behaviors</a></h4>

              
                Depression entails a range of pathological processes in the brain, typically characterized by microglia activation, neural dysfunction, and vascular dysregulation. While it is well established that activated microglia inflict damage to neurons through direct and indirect microglia-neuron interactions, their interaction with vasculature and the associated regulation of vascular structure and function in depression remain poorly understood. Here, using a mouse model of depression induced by chronic unpredictable stress (CUS), we find that in stressed mice, activated microglia present reduced motility and decreased contact area with vasculature, which is accompanied by pathological vascular structure and function, marked by reduced vessel density, narrowed vascular diameters, and sluggish blood flow velocity. We observe that vascular structure in the stressed mice is rapidly modified by the vascular-contacted microglia. These vascular-contacted microglia show upregulated angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) expression, which is not present in the vascular-uncontacted microglia. Furthermore, we demonstrate that AT1R signaling together with microglia activation under chronic stress are critical mediators for the altered microglial-vascular contact situation, vascular dysregulation, as well as the depression-like behaviors. Together, our findings reveal that under CUS, the aberrant microglial-vascular interaction, including the dysregulated microglial vasoregulation arising from AT1R signaling and microglia activation, leads to depression, forging a new link between chronic stress and depression.

">Active zone remodeling by Bruchpilot couples synaptic architecture to Kv1/Shaker excitability control</a></h4>

              
                Presynaptic active zones are known to undergo state-dependent remodeling across sleep, circadian, and experience-dependent conditions, yet how such structural changes influence synaptic computation and excitability has remained unclear. Here, we address this gap by examining the functional consequences of physiological upscaling of the active zone scaffold Bruchpilot (BRP), within the range previously observed during natural state-dependent plasticity. We show that moderate BRP elevation expands the number of functional release sites while surprisingly reducing vesicle release probability, thereby establishing a presynaptic operating mode with selectively enhanced transmission at intermediate firing frequencies. This remodeled mode depends on Kv1/Shaker potassium channels, which normally constrain the increased structural capacity generated by BRP; accordingly, perturbation of Shaker abolishes BRP-dependent reductions in release probability and unmasks an enlarged synaptic output capacity. To test the functional relevance of this coupling, we examined sleepless mutants, in which Kv1/Shaker channels are destabilized and presynaptic remodeling is compromised. We show that direct, physiological-level BRP upscaling selectively restores the Shaker/Hyperkinetic channel complex from near-undetectable levels toward normal abundance without inducing global proteomic changes, and correspondingly rescues excitability balance, oxidative stress resistance, lifespan, and mid-term memory. Together, these findings identify a mechanistic coupling between active zone architecture and intrinsic excitability control and demonstrate how presynaptic structural plasticity shapes frequency-dependent transmission and functional robustness under stress.

">Organelle distribution and protein translation defects in radial glia cells with mutations in Eml1</a></h4>

              
                Cerebral cortical development is a finely regulated process, depending on neuronal progenitors, giving rise to post-mitotic neurons that migrate to superficial regions in the developing brain. Disruptions can give rise to cortical malformations, associated with intellectual disability and intractable epilepsy. Mutations in EML1/Eml1, coding for a microtubule-associated protein, lead to subcortical heterotopia in humans and mice. In developing mutant mouse brains, ectopic apical radial glia (aRG) progenitors were found outside the proliferative ventricular zone. The role of Eml1 in aRG is not precisely determined. Using proteomics and imaging approaches, we compared brain tissue from control and mutant mice and identified microtubule and organelle dysregulation. Eml1 influences the trafficking of organelles to different compartments of aRG, where they may be involved in local functions. Mitochondrial and polysome distribution are altered in mutant conditions. Indeed, Eml1 interacts with translational machinery, and downregulation of translation is observed in Eml1 mutant aRG translatome. Paradoxically, an upregulation of translation-related mRNAs is also observed. These data uncover an unprecedented function of Eml1 and associate novel subcellular mechanisms with severe heterotopia formation.

">Activation of the medial entorhinal cortex drives memory-guided navigation behavior</a></h4>

              
                The cognitive map in the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) is essential for spatial memory and exhibits experience-dependent changes. Yet, it remains unclear whether MEC activation is sufficient to drive memory-guided navigation, precluding a causal link between the MEC and spatial memory. To address this gap, we examined and optogenetically manipulated MEC activity as mice navigated a virtual track for a water reward based on memory. During learning, spatial activity in the pre-reward region showed the highest consistency along the track and closely paralleled improvements in reward-predictive behaviors. This elevated pre-reward consistency was widespread across MEC neurons, rather than confined to a particular cell type, indicating a network-level representation supporting reward prediction. Strikingly, optogenetic activation of MEC at non-reward locations biased reward-predictive behaviors toward stimulation sites, but only when stimulation patterns were spatially consistent. Consistent stimulation also induced anticipatory reward-seeking before stimulation onset and this behavior gradually developed with repeated stimulation, reflecting memory formation for stimulation locations. Moreover, in animals that failed to learn the track well, consistent pre-reward activation, alone or combined with landmark activation, significantly enhanced their reward prediction. Thus, spatially consistent MEC activation underlies memory-guided reward prediction, supporting a causal role for the MEC in spatial memory.

">Effects of different slow paced breathing regimes on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) oscillations</a></h4>

              
                Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) transport is crucial for waste clearance and the maintenance of healthy brain function. Various factors, including respiration, have been proposed to drive CSF pulsation. Despite the close relationship between CSF movement and respiration, the impact of different slow respiratory frequencies on CSF oscillations remains unclear. Utilizing a fast neuroimaging technique, we investigated the effects of four different paced respiratory conditions on CSF oscillations. Our findings indicate that all paced respiratory conditions resulted in increased CSF oscillatory power and BOLD global signal amplitude, factors previously associated with increased CSF pulsations. Additionally, we observed that, compared to rest, paced sighing at the 0.02-0.03 Hz frequency range significantly increased the coupling between CSF oscillations and the negative derivative of the BOLD signal. Our study provides a novel perspective on how the frequency of breathing can influence CSF oscillations during wakefulness.

">Chronic electroconvulsive shock disrupts hippocampal physiology and impairs associative memory in mice</a></h4>

              
                Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a highly effective treatment for depression but it has undesirable side effects on various aspects of cognition, including memory. Patients might display retrograde amnesia for autobiographical events and anterograde amnesia in tests of recall and recognition memory. These amnestic effects are likely to depend, at least in part, on changes in the hippocampus. ECT-induced volume increases in the hippocampus, and dentate gyrus subregion in particular, correlate with the cognitive deficits. However, the precise cellular and behavioral effects of ECT remain poorly understood. Here, we therefore subjected male and female mice to chronic electroconvulsive shock (ECS) and examined effects on hippocampal physiology and memory. Perforant path inputs onto dentate gyrus neurons were examined using whole cell patch clamp recordings in hippocampal slices. In the intact slice, perforant path stimulation did not result in any synaptic or spiking differences in mice given sham vs ECS treatments. However, GABAA blockade increased depolarization and spiking in sham, but not ECS-treated, mice. Voltage clamp recordings further revealed weaker perforant path excitation of dentate gyrus neurons in ECS-treated mice. Extrapolating these findings to the intact animal, we then used Fos expression as a proxy for neural activity, and found that ECS blunted exploration-induced hippocampal activation, which was most pronounced in the dentate gyrus. Finally, recognition memory tasks revealed that ECS impaired memory for object-context associations but not memory for objects or locations. Collectively, these experiments reveal that a clinically relevant schedule of ECS disrupts synaptic and circuit functions of the hippocampus and causes anterograde amnesia in a test of episodic-like associative memory.

Here we describe the establishment of UC Irvine Brain Procurement Program, a coordinated initiative to collect and process neurotypical donor brains for multiomic mapping studies within the NIH BRAIN Initiative Cell Atlas Network (BICAN) consortium. Through partnerships with the Orange County Coroner Office, the UC Irvine Willed Body Program, UCI Medical Center, and the Children Hospital of Orange County, we have developed standardized workflows encompassing donor identification, postmortem brain recovery and processing, region-of-interest dissection, neurotypical donor selection, and data management. Our experience demonstrates the feasibility of a community-based, multi-institutional procurement framework while highlighting challenges in recruiting neurotypical donors and ensuring demographic representation reflective of Southern California. We further identify opportunities to strengthen outreach and donation pathways. This program provides a scalable model for advancing population-reflective, high-quality human brain cell atlas efforts.

How this circuit assembles during development and how it degenerates under pathological conditions remains poorly understood in a human context and in vitro models capturing its long-range connectivity and spatial organization have been lacking. Here, we introduce the connectoid, a compartmentalized, human stem cell-based model of the nigrostriatal pathway that integrates vMB and striatal organoids within a custom-engineered microfluidic device, confining cell bodies while guiding axonal growth, mimicking the in vivo topography. Functional connectivity was confirmed by retrograde rabies tracing, and optogenetic and pharmacological stimulation, while 6-hydroxydopamine induced selective degeneration of dopamine neurons, recapitulating a key feature of PD. Additionally, single-cell transcriptomics revealed that interaction with striatal targets enhances dopaminergic neuron maturation and activates transcriptional programs linked to synaptic signaling. Thus, connectoids uniquely allow spatial segregation of regionalized organoids while preserving long-range communication, providing a scalable and physiologically relevant platform for studying human circuit assembly, selective vulnerability, and therapeutic interventions in PD.

">Dopamine drives a positive reward bias on human reinforcement learning</a></h4>

              
                Formal theories of reinforcement learning (RL) prescribe a clearly defined function for dopamine: modulating learning via reward prediction errors (RPEs). Yet, empirical evidence in humans remains scarce, and recent advances introducing noisy RL cast doubt on a simple one-to-one mapping be-tween neurotransmitters and computational mechanisms. Here, we conducted a double-blind, pla-cebo-controlled, randomised pharmacological study using the dopamine precursor L-DOPA, while healthy volunteers performed a volatile two-armed bandit task. Behaviourally, L-DOPA decreased switching following below-average rewards. Algorithmic RL modelling of human behaviour supports a dual effect of L-DOPA on the rate and precision of learning. By leveraging recurrent neural networks (RNNs) as implementational models of RL, we explain this dual RL function through a single infer-ence-time modulation, whereby L-DOPA triggers a positive reward bias at the input of the recurrent layer that implements RL. Our findings highlight a unifying mechanism at the implementation level to explain seemingly disparate algorithmic effects.

">Psilocybin decreases reward-seeking behavior accompanied by increased activity of parvalbumin neurons with perineuronal nets in the medial prefrontal cortex</a></h4>

              
                Clinical trials suggest that a single dose of psilocybin is an effective treatment for substance use disorders (SUDs). Choice impulsivity is a value-based decision-making bias that predicts drug-intake escalation and is commonly associated with SUDs. The dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) regulates choice impulsivity and is enriched with 5-HT2A receptors that mediate effects of psilocybin. We hypothesized that psilocybin has long-term ([&ge;]48 hours) effects on choice impulsivity in association with dmPFC inhibitory interneurons with perineuronal nets (PNNs). Male Long Evans rats were trained in a delay discounting task (DDT) where rats chose between delayed large rewards (LR) and immediate small rewards (SR). 48 hours after psilocybin or vehicle injections, DDT was assessed, and rats brains processed for microscopy analysis of extracellular matrix (PNNs) together with inhibitory parvalbumin (PV) interneurons and c-fos as a marker of neuronal activity. Psilocybin acutely increased head-twitch responses. Psilocybin decreased LR choices and increased the latency to LR choices 48 hours after administration. These effects were independent of delay and therefore not consistent with changes in impulsivity. Psilocybin also increased the density of PNN+PV+cFos triple-labeled neurons in the dmPFC. These results suggest that psilocybin decreases reward seeking through the increased activation of dmPFC PV interneurons with PNNs.

">A scaffold attachment factor PHM-2 regulates synaptic transmission through SLO-2 potassium channel in C. elegans</a></h4>

              
                Scaffold attachment factor B (SAFB) proteins are evolutionarily conserved DNA/RNA binding proteins that are involved in multiple processes of gene expression. These proteins are broadly expressed with particular high expression observed in the nervous system. However, their physiological roles in neurons are largely unclear. Here we show that PHM-2, the sole SAFB ortholog in C. elegans, regulates synaptic transmission at the neuromuscular junctions through an effect on SLO-2 potassium channel. We found that phm-2 knockout suppresses a sluggish phenotype of worms expressing a hyperactive SLO-2 channel, greatly reduces SLO-2-mediated neuronal whole-cell currents, and enhances neuromuscular synaptic transmission. In addition, we found that PHM-2 genetically interacts with another DNA/RNA binding protein, HRPU-2/hnRNP U, to control SLO-2 expression through a posttranscriptional mechanism. These results reveal a novel function of a SAFB protein in regulating neuronal activity, and may help understand the physiological roles of SAFB proteins in the nervous system of other species.

">SynTEF1 restores the functional disease phenotype of SCA27B in an hiPSC-derived neuronal disease model</a></h4>

              
                Spinocerebellar Ataxia 27B (SCA27B), caused by a deep-intronic GAA-TTC repeat expansion in FGF14, has recently been identified as one of the most frequent genetic ataxias. Yet its underlying disease mechanism remains largely unknown, and disease-modifying treatments targeting upstream disease mechanisms are lacking. Here we hypothesized that (i) SCA27B is caused by transcriptional repression of FGF14, leading to reduced neuronal excitability and synaptic transmission strength; (ii) which can be restored by a synthetic elongation transcription factor (Syn-TEF1). We assessed FGF14 mRNA levels by qPCR, and neuronal function by whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in network and autaptic cultures of SCA27B patient iPSC-derived NGN2-neurons. Change in all read-outs was then assessed also upon Syn-TEF1 treatment. FGF14 mRNA levels were significantly reduced in both heterozygous and biallelic SCA27B patient-derived neurons. This was associated with decreased neuronal excitability and decreased peak current density of voltage-gated sodium channels. Moreover, SCA27B neurons showed reduced synaptic transmission with decreased excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) amplitudes. Treatment with SynTEF1 restored FGF14 mRNA levels, thereby restoring neuronal excitability and synaptic transmission. These insights into SCA27B pathophysiology and its amelioration by SynTEF1 open new translational avenues for the development of disease-modifying gene-targeted therapies for SCA27B.

">A Theory of Thalamocortical Loops in Evidence Accumulation and Decision-Making</a></h4>

              
                A prominent property of the neocortex is that it forms reciprocal excitatory loops with the thalamus. Here, we propose a function for the loops between layer 5 pyramidal tract neurons in the cortex and matrix-type relay cells in the thalamus, which is based on known anatomy and biophysics. This pathway forms an amplifier circuit with a gain less than unity in the resting condition. However, descending cortical input to apical tufts of L5 neurons can raise the gain of these neurons, boosting the thalamocortical loop into either an integrating or an amplifying regime. Multiple thalamocortical loops compete via lateral inhibition in the thalamus, resulting in a winner-take-all global dynamic among the motor commands encoded by each loop. When L5 neurons are driven by sensory inputs, the integration regime closely resembles the drift-diffusion model of decision-making. We explore basic relationships among parameters of this model and compare broadly against neurophysiological data.

">MECP2 Duplication Uncouples Mitochondrial and Purine Metabolism During neuronal maturation</a></h4>

              
                Mitochondria and nucleotide metabolism are critical for cellular and developmental homeostasis, yet their potential interdependence and role in neurodevelopmental disease remain unclear. In MECP2 Duplication Syndrome (MDS), we identify a conserved correlation between mitochondrial function and purine metabolism that is disrupted across human, organoid, and mouse models. Multiomics integration reveals Complex III as the focal point of mitochondrial collapse, leading to redox stress, DNA damage, and hyperactivation of the de novo purine biosynthesis via purinosome assembly. The breakdown of mitochondria-purinosome coupling compromises genome stability, impairs radial glia proliferation, and delays neuronal maturation. By linking a defined genetic dosage imbalance to metabolic network failure, our study positions the mitochondria-purinosome coordination as a fundamental control axis for neurodevelopment and a therapeutic entry point across metabolic and neurodevelopmental disorders.

">Optimal parameters for measuring multiband auditory brainstem responses to continuous speech</a></h4>

              
                Accurate clinical hearing assessment depends on efficient, engaging measures designed to evaluate ecologically relevant stimuli. Often brief tones or narrowband noise stimuli are used, providing a useful but limited snapshot of hearing function. Including dynamic speech offers a means to capture how the hearing system encodes complex sounds critical for everyday communication. Here we describe the optimal parameters for using audiobook continuous speech with the multiband peaky speech paradigm to measure frequency-specific auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) to standard audiological octave bands from 500-8000 Hz in each ear simultaneously. Using computational modeling and direct human ABR testing in adults with normal hearing, we demonstrate that continuous speech signals with a chirp phase profile and fundamental frequency (f0) lowered to the range of 90-110 Hz evoke the largest ABR wave V amplitudes. This amplitude boost occurs when any narrator's f0 is lowered to this optimal range, but the largest responses occur for narrators with original f0s below 170 Hz. We also confirmed that different narrator speech stimuli with these optimized parameters can evoke similarly sized ABRs, but some minor differences remain for testing time. Ultimately, optimizing phase-f0 parameters substantially sped up the median testing time to obtain robust audiobook-based multiband ABRs to within 14 minutes, thereby making this paradigm more feasible for future research and clinical translation.

">Rhythmicity Revisited: Evidence from Robust Behavioral Oscillations</a></h4>

              
                Rhythmic fluctuations in neuronal excitability, called neural oscillations, pervade brain activity. If these oscillations have a functional role in behavior, they should also be expressed in a behavioral signature. However, identifying such a behavioral signature has remained controversial: evidence for behavioral oscillations is not yet firmly established, and aperiodic components can be misidentified as rhythmic. To test their existence while controlling for aperiodic dynamics, we applied a state-of-the-art autoregressive (AR) approach on two datasets: one published dataset, and a new dataset collected with a revised dense-sampling design. In both datasets, AR modeling recovered reliable behavioral oscillations in the theta band. Reanalyses of the published dataset also reproduced the reported theta shift with task demands, with more difficult tasks showing slower theta. In contrast, despite clear rhythmicity, the new dataset showed no consistent frequency shift across conditions. Overall, this study establishes rigorous and robust detection of behavioral oscillations. It also suggests that the frequency modulation of behavioral oscillations by task difficulty requires further study.

">Inferotemporal cortex encodes formation and termination of perceptual decisions</a></h4>

              
                Visually guided behavior requires transforming sensory inputs into decisions based on behavioral goals. Inferotemporal cortex (IT) is traditionally seen as a perceptual stage that provides object representations for downstream decision circuits. Here, we show that neurons in anterior IT (area TEa) reflect core elements of decision formation. Using a face categorization task with stochastic visual features, we disentangled momentary evidence, accumulated evidence, and choice commitment in the same neural population. TEa neurons integrated task-relevant features over time, suppressed responses after commitment, and dynamically filtered relevant from irrelevant inputs. These are hallmarks of bounded evidence accumulation, typically attributed to frontoparietal regions. Unlike frontoparietal regions, TEa encoded the decision variable in a novel format -as a running average- enabling signal-to-noise ratio improvements without ramping. These findings challenge the view of IT as a passive perceptual buffer, positioning TEa as a decision-aware hub that transforms visual inputs to support flexible, goal-directed behavior.

">Conditional-longitudinal brain growth charts detect MRI changes with birth weight and psychopathology</a></h4>

              
                Key Points: Question: How do differences in brain maturation trajectories, quantified by novel conditional-longitudinal models, relate to perinatal factors and mental health in adolescence? Findings: In this longitudinal analysis of neuroimaging data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study, conditional-longitudinal normative models revealed that trajectories of brain maturation in adolescence are associated with birth weight, and with longitudinal changes in mental health. Meaning: Conditional-longitudinal models detect inter-individual variability in brain maturation, which is related to both perinatal factors and concurrent changes in psychopathology. Importance: Brain maturation varies between individuals, particularly during dynamic developmental periods like adolescence. Directly assessing differences in longitudinal trajectories can reveal deviations from normative patterns. Objective: We present novel conditional-longitudinal normative models that characterize variability in brain maturation. We utilize these models to examine whether differences in longitudinal trajectories are associated with birth weight (BW), gestational age (GA), and longitudinal psychopathology scores derived from behavioral assessments. Design: Cross-sectional and conditional-longitudinal normative models were developed for brain volumes derived from the first two neuroimaging timepoints from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study. Conditional-longitudinal models index an individual's expected brain volume at follow-up, conditioned on their baseline measurement. Models were fit with split-half cross-validation on demographically matched samples. Setting: The ABCD Study(R) is a multi-site, population-based, longitudinal cohort study. Participants: Participants were excluded based on imaging quality flags and missing data, leaving 10,830 at baseline and 7,262 at follow-up. Exposures: BW and GA were derived from parent-report questionnaires. General psychopathology scores were calculated using a bifactor model. Main Outcomes and Measures: We calculated cross-sectional and conditional-longitudinal centiles, respectively quantifying individual deviations in size and change between timepoints. Sensitivity analyses included covariates for parental income and education as well as current weight and height. Results: The sample was 10,830 at baseline (48.2% F, age 9-10y) and 7,262 at follow-up (46.6% F, age 11-13y). Conditional-longitudinal centiles were sensitive to individual differences in brain change between timepoints. Lower BW was associated with lower conditional-longitudinal centiles, suggesting larger decreases in brain volumes over time (27 regions pfdr<0.05, {beta}max=0.08). Lower conditional-longitudinal centiles were associated with greater increases in psychopathology scores, suggesting with increased psychopathology brain volumes show greater decrease (37 regions pfdr<0.05, {beta}max=0.06). Notably, changes in psychopathology were not related to brain size at either timepoint, indexed by cross-sectional centiles. Conclusions and Relevance: Models that capture individual-level deviations from expected growth trajectories, rather than static positions on a growth curve, are particularly informative for assessing developmental change. Novel conditional-longitudinal models address this gap in lifespan brain imaging. Using this framework, we demonstrate robust associations between individual trajectory deviations, perinatal adversity, and longitudinally assessed mental health symptoms. Conditional-longitudinal models hold promise for applications across psychiatric neuroscience, from development to aging.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.78112?af=R">Age‐Related Differences in the Association between REM Sleep and the Polygenic Risk for Parkinson's Disease</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the rare diseases in which sleep alteration is a true marker of disease outcome. Yet, how the association between sleep and PD emerges over the healthy lifetime is not established. We examined the association between the polygenic risk score (PRS) for PD and the variability in the electrophysiology of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep in 433 younger (18–31 years) healthy individuals and 85 late-midlife (50–69 years) healthy individuals.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In this prospective cross-sectional study, in-lab electroencephalography recordings of sleep were recorded to extract REM sleep metrics. PRS was computed using SBayesR approach.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Generalized additive model for location, scale, and shape analysis showed significant association of REM duration (<i>p</i>
<sub>corrected</sub> = 0.03) and theta energy in REM (<i>p</i>
<sub>corrected</sub> = 0.004) with PRS for PD in interaction with the age group. In the younger subsample, REM duration and theta energy were positively associated with PD PRS. In contrast, in the late-midlife subsample, the same associations were negative (although only qualitatively for REM theta energy) and may differ between men and women.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>REM sleep is associated with the PRS for PD in early adulthood, 2 to 5 decades before typical symptoms onset. The association changes from positive in younger individuals, presumably free of alpha-synuclein, to negative in late-midlife individuals, possibly because of the progressive presence of alpha-synuclein aggregates or of the repeated increased oxidative metabolism imposed by REM sleep. Our findings may unravel core associations between PD and sleep and may contribute to novel intervention targets to prevent or delay PD. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.78114?af=R">Electronic Health Records to Test Multimorbidity Influences to Plasma Biomarker Interpretation for Alzheimer's Disease</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Plasma biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology are frequently tested in specialized research settings, which limits the generalizability of findings. Using electronic health records and banked plasma, we evaluated plasma biomarkers—phosphorylated tau 217 (p-tau<sub>217</sub>), β-amyloid 1–42/1–40 (Aβ<sub>42</sub>/Aβ<sub>40</sub>) and p-tau<sub>217</sub>/Aβ<sub>42</sub>—in a real-world, diverse clinical population with multimorbidities.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Participants (n = 617; 44% Black/African American; 41% female) were selected from the University of Pennsylvania Medicine BioBank with plasma assayed using Fujirebio Lumipulse. International Classification of Diseases (ICD) Ninth and Tenth Revision codes determined AD dementia (ADD) (n = 43), mild-cognitive impairment (MCI) (n = 140), unspecified/non-AD cognitive impairment (CI) (n = 106), and cognitively normal cases (n = 328), and other medical histories. APOE ε4, body mass index (BMI), metrics of kidney function (eg, estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR]), and liver disease were derived from electronic health records. Multivariable models identified factors related to plasma levels. Previously established cutpoints classified AD status (“AD+,” “AD−,” or “Intermediate”).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Plasma p-tau<sub>217</sub>/Aβ<sub>42</sub> had the strongest association with known AD-related factors—MCI, ADD, future progression to MCI/ADD, age, and APOE ε4—compared to p-tau<sub>217</sub> and Aβ<sub>42</sub>/Aβ<sub>40</sub>. Plasma p-tau<sub>217</sub>/Aβ<sub>42</sub> was also associated with eGFR, diabetes, and history of hearing loss. Importantly, AD-related factors were most frequent/severe for AD+ classification by p-tau<sub>217</sub>/Aβ<sub>42</sub>, whereas medical morbidities were most frequent/severe for Intermediate classification. Exploratory analyses test p-tau<sub>217</sub>/Aβ<sub>42</sub> adjusted for eGFR to eliminate its influence on plasma levels.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In this real-world dataset, we identified effects of multimorbidities on plasma biomarkers, especially kidney function. The p-tau<sub>217</sub>/Aβ<sub>42</sub> ratio had low rates of Intermediate classification and may help to account for multimorbidity effects on plasma levels. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                Background A severe sleep disorder called obstructive sleep apnea is typified by recurrent bouts of upper airway obstruction while you’re asleep. It is associated with a variety of complications such as cardiovascular problems, poor sleep quality, and daytime fatigue. Objectives This study aimed to assess knowledge of obstructive sleep apnea and the prevalence of healthy sleep habits among nursing students at the University of Basrah. Methods A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted among nursing students at the College of Nursing, University of Basrah. A non-probability (purposive sampling) method was employed to collect data from 150 students via self-reported questionnaires. The research period was prolonged from November 1, 2024, to April 1, 2025. The constructed self-administered questionnaire consisted of three sections: demographic characteristics, knowledge about obstructive sleep apnea, and sleep-related habits. Data were analyzed using SPSS, with results presented in frequencies and percentages. Results The results showed that 64% of participants had good knowledge about obstructive sleep apnea, 28% had moderate knowledge, and only 8% demonstrated poor knowledge. In terms of sleep habits, most of the students have good, healthy habits. Conclusion Most students have poor knowledge. These findings suggest a need for enhanced educational programs focusing on healthy habits and knowledge of obstructive sleep apnea among nursing students.

                Introduction Access to maternity care services from qualified health care professionals during pregnancy, labor, and the postnatal period is crucial for the survival and health of the mother and baby. This study aimed to assess the prevalence and factors associated with maternal continuum of care completion in Myanmar. Methods This study used secondary data from the 2015-2016 Myanmar Demographic and Health Survey. The study included 1455 women aged < 2 years. Bivariate analysis was conducted using one-way ANOVA and chi-square test of independence to explore the unadjusted association between the dependent variable and each independent variable. Multivariable analysis was conducted with ordinal logistic regression to explore the factors associated with the maternity continuum of care completion. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. Results The prevalence of complete maternity continuum of care was 55.2% (n = 803), partial maternity continuum of care was 31.9% (n = 464), and no maternity continuum of care was 12.9% (n = 188) respectively. After adjusting for covariates, maternal education, region, place of residence, total parity, husband’s education, husband’s occupation, money needed for treatment, timing of first antenatal check, tetanus injection, blood pressure, urine sample taken, blood sample taken, given or bought iron tablets/syrup, and drugs for intestinal parasites during pregnancy were significantly associated with maternal continuum of care. Conclusion The prevalence of a complete maternity continuum of care in Myanmar was suboptimal. Important factors include maternal education, urban residency, region, total parity, husbands’ education, and occupation. Improving outcomes in the area requires addressing obstacles such as financial limitations, access to quality health services, and distance. Improving access to maternal healthcare services should be the main goal of policy initiatives, especially for rural areas, lower education levels, and low-income families.

                Background This study examined biomarker signatures in men with alcohol use disorder (AUD) in Uzbekistan, with and without viral infections. Methods A cross-sectional study included 292 males with stage II AUD (virus-negative: n = 251; virus-positive: n = 41) and 49 alcohol-free controls. Clinical, hematological, and biochemical parameters were measured, and ROC analysis evaluated diagnostic performance. Results Virus-negative patients showed the clearest biomarker profile of alcohol dependence, with reduced glucose, creatinine, and urea, and elevated total protein, α-amylase, De Ritis ratio, and direct bilirubin. ROC analysis confirmed strong diagnostic value for AST (AUC = 0.951), FIB-4 (0.877), MAP (0.817), and creatinine (0.711). Leukocytes (AUC = 0.790) and lymphocytes (0.735) best differentiated viral status. Fibrosis risk in virus-positive patients was 1.5-fold higher, with splenomegaly in 7.3%. Mild thrombocytopenia, absence of granulocytopenia, and rare delirium (<5.5%) distinguished this cohort from European groups, resembling East Asian patterns. Conclusions Liver enzymes, α-amylase, bilirubin, MCV, FIB-4, and MAP provide strong diagnostic value for AUD. Multimarker panels including leukocyte, lymphocyte, and creatinine levels support viral status differentiation. Findings emphasize population-specific biomarker signatures in Central Asians and the utility of multimarker strategies for personalized AUD management.

                Background The theory of Observational Relativity (OR), a new theory, has generalized and unified Newtonian mechanics and Einstein relativity theory. The OR Serial Reports intend to interpret the theory of OR. The logical consistency and theoretical validity of OR, as well as, the empirical basis and experimental evidence of OR, have been clarified in OR Serial Report 1. The theory of OR has had significant discoveries: as reported in OR Serial Report 1, the speed of light is not really invariant and spacetime is not really curved; as reported in OR Serial Report 2, the rest mass of photons is not really zero. Now, OR Serial Report 3 reports to readers: Einstein mistakenly predicted gravitational waves; LIGO mistakenly detected gravitational waves. In 1916, Einstein derived a wave equation from his gravitational-field equation of general relativity, which has two characteristic physical quantities: the Newtonian gravitational potential χ; the light speed c. Accordingly, Einstein decided that his wave equation must represent gravitational waves and the speed of gravitational waves must be the speed of light. Methods From the GOR gravitational-field equation of the general observation agent OA(η) (0<η<∞; η→∞), the Gravitational theory of OR (GOR) has also derived a wave equation with two characteristic physical quantities: the Newtonian gravitational potential χ; the information-wave speed η of OA(η). Results The GOR wave equation suggests that the GOR wave must be the information wave of OA(η), and that the Newtonian gravitational potential χ must be the information about gravitational spacetime loaded or carried by the information wave of OA(η). Conclusions It is thus clear that Einstein’s wave equation does not represent gravitational waves, but the information wave of the optical observation agent OA(c) (η=c), that is, light or an electromagnetic wave transmitting observed information at the speed of light. So, what did LIGO detect?

                Background Clinical reasoning is a core competency in undergraduate medical education, yet many instructional approaches do not fully address its cognitive complexity in a structured or scalable way. Team-Based Analysis for Critical Thinking in Clinical Cases (TACTIC) is a stepwise novel method that mirrors real-world diagnostic reasoning through iterative, team-based engagement with authentic clinical scenarios. This study describes the development of TACTIC using formal consensus methods. Methods We employed a modified Delphi followed by a nominal group technique to reach consensus on the concrete steps for implementing TACTIC. Eight faculty implementers participated in three rounds. Participants rated the importance of proposed steps on a 5-point scale. We summarized central tendency and dispersion (mean, SD; median, IQR) and calculated item-level content validity indices (I-CVI) and the scale-level average (S-CVI/Ave) using a ≥4 (agree) threshold. Results Consensus produced five clearly defined steps for TACTIC. Agreement was high across raters, reflected by high means and medians with low SDs and IQRs. Content validity was excellent: I-CVI for all steps was 1.00 and S-CVI/Ave was 1.00, indicating unanimous endorsement of the finalized steps. Conclusion TACTIC offers a structured, consensus-derived approach to teaching clinical reasoning that is feasible and initially well-received. While resource-intensive, its fidelity and scalability can be enhanced through facilitator training, hybrid/digital delivery (e.g., breakout rooms, simulated-patient substitutes), and selective use of AI for feedback and case branching. TACTIC has the potential to bridge the gap between traditional instruction and the intricate cognitive demands of diagnostic reasoning.

                Generative artificial intelligence (AI) can augment educators’ capacity to design high-quality Key Feature Problems (KFPs) for valid assessment of clinical reasoning and decision-making. This practice-oriented guide presents ten evidence-informed tips for using AI to develop KFPs that are aligned with learning outcomes, cognitively demanding, and contextually authentic. Drawing on the KFP literature and contemporary validity frameworks (content, cognitive and response processes, internal structure, and consequences), we synthesize practical strategies for translating outcomes into key features, constructing realistic vignettes, creating parallel case variants, targeting higher-order thinking, ensuring curricular alignment and learner-level appropriateness, diversifying complementary item formats, validating AI-assisted items through a stepwise workflow, delivering decision-specific feedback, iterating from learner performance data, and safeguarding equity, ethics, and governance. We illustrate these recommendations with concise examples and an adapted validation workflow that supports both formative and summative applications. Although AI can accelerate scenario construction and feedback drafting, human expertise remains essential to verify clinical accuracy, prevent bias and hallucinations, calibrate difficulty, and preserve assessment security. With transparent processes and expert review, AI can serve as a collaborative assistant rather than a replacement, helping medical educators build rigorous KFPs that enhance the assessment of clinical decision-making.

Methods The methodology of this paper used the approach of derivation of implicit numerical method. However, the purpose of this study is to derive a direct implicit block and multi-step strategy for solving sixth-order ODEs. Results The main novelty of this work lies in the investigation of constructing a novel method for solving FDEs. This paper presents a general block two-point approach, known as GIBM2P, for solving sixth-order initial-value problems (IVPs) using Hermite-interpolating polynomials. Consequently, the FDE problem has been transformed into ODE using the α-fractional-derivative transform, and then, the sixth-order IVP is solved using the proposed GIBM2P method. Conclusions In this paper, we offered a method for solving sixth-order FDEs. The proposed method has been shown to be an accurate and efficient method; also, one can obtain the approximate efficient solutions of FDEs problems. The numerical implementations are used to show the high accuracy and efficacy of the proposed GIBM2P approach. However, the GIBM2P method is effective in terms of accuracy, processing time, and the number of function calls.

                Background Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a condition characterized by the dilation and dysfunction of the left ventricle, leading to heart failure. This study investigates the relationship between dilated cardiomyopathy and factors such as lipid levels, interleukin-12 (IL-12) levels, troponin levels, and coxsackievirus antibodies. Methods This study involved 60 patients diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy and 30 healthy controls. We used a BioSystems kit to measure lipid profiles and a fully automated c111 analyzer (Germany) to quantify troponin levels. We used ELISA to evaluate IL-12 levels and antibodies (IgG and IgM) to Coxsackievirus. We used SPSS for data analysis, with statistically significant defined as p≤0.05. Results Patients with dilated cardiomyopathy showed a significant difference in lipid levels compared to the control group, while HDL levels showed no statistically significant difference. In addition, troponin levels were significantly elevated in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. IL-12 levels were elevated by 1.27-fold in individuals with dilated cardiomyopathy suggests a reasonable diagnostic accuracy. Antibody levels for Coxsackievirus (IgG and IgM) were markedly elevated in dilated cardiomyopathy, with a positive test in both IgG t and IgM, while no positive controls were observed for either antibody.in addition This study evaluated the associations between IL-12, IgM, and IgG. The results showing nonsignificant correlation between IL-12 and IgM and IL-12 and IgG. Conclusion Elevated IL-12 levels and coxsackievirus-positive antibodies in dilated cardiomyopathy patients suggest a possible immune link. However, no statistically significant relationship has been found between IL-12 and coxsackie virus antibodies.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1442/v1?src=rss">Regarding the Novel IDNAII Distribution: Mathematical and Statistical Characteristics [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Over the last decade, there has been an increased range of probability distributions in statistical and reliability literature aimed at enhancing standard models. This trend reflects a greater understanding of empirical integrity, flexibility, and adaptability in modeling income distributions, reliability, and lifetime statistics. To provide greater flexibility and general distributions, this study employs a technique that generates the T−R{Y} family distributions. It might be employed to agree with particular forms of data distributions, including the significantly left, right, thin, or heavy-tailed distributions, or for creating new distributions that are very flexible and adaptive. These results in an individual belonging to a new sub-family called the IDNAII distribution, which is also referred to as the Lomax–Weibull {Exponential} distribution. The main statistical and mathematical aspects of the new family distribution are examined. A variety of estimation approaches, including the maximum likelihood method (MLE), method of moments (MOM), least squares method (LS), and shrinkage method (SH), will be introduced to estimate the parameters of the new class distribution. Simulation tools have been created to evaluate the effectiveness of estimation approaches. The study’s findings indicate that the shrinkage estimation approach exceeded the others regarding bias and mean squared error criterion. On the contrary, a real-world dataset application has been demonstrated and the examination of the real dataset showed that the new class distribution fit the data better than the particular classical and moderate distributions, as indicated by several types of information criteria.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1441/v1?src=rss">Gender Digital Divides: New Divides, Old Inequalities [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background The fourth industrial revolution has introduced new forms of inequality, particularly affecting women through gender-based digital divides. These divides manifest in unequal access, usage, and quality of interaction with information and communication technologies (ICTs). Understanding these disparities is essential for shaping equitable digital policies. Methods This study employed a qualitative and documentary approach based on a systematic literature review following the PRISMA protocol. Four academic databases (Scopus, Web of Science, EBSCO, and Sage Journals) were searched for peer-reviewed empirical studies published between 2010 and 2024. A total of 479 documents were initially identified, with 14 studies meeting all eligibility criteria. Three analytical categories guided the synthesis: manifestations of gender digital divides; their causes and consequences; and mitigation strategies. Results The reviewed literature reveals that women face multiple barriers to digital inclusion, including cultural constraints, economic inequality, lack of digital skills, and time poverty. The gender digital divide is particularly pronounced in developing countries, where gaps in access to the Internet and ICTs correlate with broader social and structural inequalities. Studies also highlight significant regional variation and intersectional challenges related to age, migration status, and educational background. While access has improved in some contexts, disparities in digital competencies and outcomes persist. Gender-based digital divides are rooted in both structural inequalities and cultural norms that restrict women’s digital participation. Conclusions Efforts to mitigate these divides must address the multilayered causes through inclusive policies, gender-sensitive infrastructure planning, and education programs that enhance women’s digital literacy and agency. Integrating a gender perspective into digital policy is essential for achieving equity in the digital age.

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Our everyday experiences share many overlapping features, as we often engage in repeated activities and routines. This leads to interference across our experiences, making it difficult to remember specific, unique events. Hippocampal pattern separation enables the discrimination of highly similar experiences to be stored orthogonally, especially in the face of interference. Mnemonic discrimination tasks have been designed to tax hippocampal pattern separation by including perceptually similar “lure” stimuli during memory retrieval. However, we experience vast interference beyond a single instance of overlap. Thus, a key feature of our memory system is to overcome this high interference. Furthermore, some experiences tend to be better remembered by most people than others, a feature known as memorability. However, it is unclear how memorability may impact the effect of interference on memory. To this end, we designed a mnemonic discrimination task with multiple forms of interference, such that target (repeated) and lure (similar) images of a baseline image were shown to participants during a memory test designed to increase interference during memory retrieval. We additionally varied image memorability by including memorable and forgettable images to examine interactions with interference conditions. We found that greater interference during retrieval enhanced lure discrimination for memorable images, but impaired lure discrimination for forgettable images. This suggests that interference does not uniformly impact memory, with greater interference in memory leading to exaggerated memorable and forgettable experiences.</p>

                Background The heavy metal contamination of water leads to major environmental and health problems throughout the Mantaro River basin area. The study assesses the adsorption capacity of surface-modified chak’o nano-clay for extracting lead (Pb2+) and arsenic (As5+). Methods Surface modifications of unmodified nano-clay were achieved using through Aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES), iron oxide (Fe3O4), and combined APTES + Fe3O4 modifications of unmodified nano-clay particles. Adsorption performance was assessed through batch experiments over 8 hours. BET and XPS analyses were conducted to determine surface area, pore volume, and functional group availability. Adsorption kinetics were modeled using a pseudo-second-order model, and equilibrium data were analyzed using the Langmuir isotherm. Results The dual surface modification produced maximum removal capacities which led to a 95–100% removal performance of Pb2+ and As5+ over 8 hours. The BET and XPS analysis demonstrated that surface area (300 m2/g to 375 m2/g) and pore volume (0.420 cm3/g to 0.600 cm3/g) as well as functional group availability increased substantially thus resulting in improved adsorption. The pseudo-second-order model fit well for adsorption kinetic data while equilibrium data fit Langmuir isotherm behavior to describe monolayer adsorption. The dual treatment of APTES in combination with iron oxide generated an adsorbent with better magnetic properties and electrical conductivity thus improving its recovery potential and structural stability. The dual-modified nano-clay showed high stability during three cycles through desorption tests because it maintained more than 90% of its original adsorption capacity throughout the process. Conclusion The research shows that specialized surface treatments deliver advanced heavy metal absorption abilities to chak’o nano-clay which positions it as a leading choice for sustainable water system heavy metal remediation.

However, the association between these two phenomena was unclear. This association should be revealed for a better understanding of names and naming practices. Therefore, this study investigated the relationship between the popularity and diversity of names. Methods I analyzed the data provided in a previous study in the U.K., which included complete records of all live births between 1996 and 2016 (N = 12,985,140). Results I found that the correlations between diversity and popularity indicators were highly negative, showing that they are conceptually strongly related. This means that when diversity is high, popularity is low. Conclusions Based on this study, we can predict one indicator from the other indicator. Because raw data on names are generally difficult to collect, this prediction is useful for understanding names and naming practices.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1127/v2?src=rss">Parents’ roles in young learners’ motivation and task engagement in Indonesian primary schools: Questionnaire development and validation [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Parental involvement in a child’s second language learning is important because it affects the process and outcomes. Limited research has been conducted in the Indonesian context on what roles parents play in their children’s motivation and task engagement. Therefore, the study aims to develop, pilot, and validate a questionnaire on the roles of parents in motivating and engaging young learners with English tasks assigned by teachers. Methods This study was quantitative in nature. Participants were 270 parents of fifth graders learning English at nine public and private schools in Padang. The instrument was developed by analysing the literature and existing tools and creating new items. After getting expert feedback and piloting the survey, we assessed its validity and reliability. Research questions examined factors affecting its effectiveness. Results The questionnaire was analysed through EFA and CFA via Jamovi. EFA identified five dimensions: (1) parental involvement, (2) expectations, (3) access to resources, (4) enrichment and (5) extracurricular activities. The CFA fit indices (CFI = .945, TLI = .934, SRMR = .045, RMSEA = .059) confirmed the model’s suitability. The questionnaire showed strong validity and reliability, with measures exceeding.70, making it effective for gathering data on parental roles in Indonesian children’s learning of English. Conclusions This validation study offers an effective diagnostic tool for teachers, administrators, and policymakers to pinpoint the particular dimensions of parental involvement that affect children’s motivation and task engagement as they learn English. The findings highlight the critical roles of recognising parents as active collaborators along the language learning journey. The study adds to the theoretical understanding of the impact of parental behaviour in educational psychology and motivation studies. The findings are consistent with self-determination theory, providing a more nuanced perspective to explore how different forms of parental participation influence student motivation and task engagement in learning English.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1440/v1?src=rss">Mapping Psychosocial Determinants of Loss to Follow-Up Among Drug-resistant Tuberculosis Patients in South Africa: A Scoping Review Protocol [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Drug-resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB) in South Africa continues to threaten TB control, with loss to follow-up (LTFU) at both pretreatment (diagnosed but not initiated) and on-treatment stages undermining program success. Psychosocial determinants such as stigma, depression and anxiety, alcohol and substance use, and social and family support are frequently implicated, yet evidence is scattered across disciplines, uses heterogeneous definitions and tools, and is seldom synthesized for policy and implementation. Materials and Method This scoping review aims to systematically map psychosocial determinants associated with pretreatment and on-treatment LTFU among people with DR-TB in South Africa, describe how these determinants and LTFU are defined and measured, identify contextual modifiers (e.g., HIV status, sex/age, province, urban–rural setting, decentralization, regimen era), and highlight evidence gaps and practical leverage points for intervention. The review will follow established scoping-review methodology and report per PRISMA-ScR following five steps: (1) defining the research question, (2) search strategy, (3) setting inclusion criteria, (4) extracting data, (5) assessing, summarizing, presenting findings and (6) Consultation. A comprehensive peer-reviewed literature search, including PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar, will be conducted by two independent reviewers. The review will span over eight weeks, focusing on studies in South Africa published in English language between 2010 and 2025. Article eligibility will be determined using a two-stage screening process with disagreements resolved through consensus and consultation of a third reviewer. The results of this review will be presented as tables, including a narrative synthesis of the findings. No meta-analysis is planned. Conclusion The review will deliver a policy-ready map of psychosocial risks and promising support for DR-TB retention in South Africa, informing the design and targeting of patient-support packages and outlining priorities for future evaluation and standardization of LTFU definitions and psychosocial measures.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1439/v1?src=rss">Evaluating the use of Getting It right first time GIRFT guidelines in suspected Cauda Equina Syndrome CES at a London District General Hospital DGH [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Cauda equina syndrome (CES) is a rare but serious condition caused by compression of the lower spinal cord. Early recognition and prompt intervention are essential to prevent irreversible neurological damage. Delays in diagnosis or treatment can lead to permanent disability and may result in significant medicolegal consequences. Aim The aim of this quality improvement project (QIP) was to identify areas for improvement in the diagnosis of CES and update local guidelines in line with the Get It Right First Time (GIRFT) recommendations. Methods and Results This retrospective study, conducted according to GIRFT guidelines, examined patients admitted to the District General Hospital Emergency Department with suspected CES. A total of 37 patients—8 males (21.6%) and 29 females (78.4%)—were assessed over a six-month period from January to June 2023. Patients without CES listed as a differential diagnosis were excluded. Data collected included documentation of neurological examinations, post-void residual scans, perianal sensation assessments, MRI request and completion times, and length of stay. Findings were presented at the Trauma and Orthopedics mortality and morbidity meeting. Overall, 89.19% of MRI scans were completed within 24 hours of request, while 10.81% exceeded this timeframe. Notably, 57% of patients did not undergo a comprehensive neurological examination on admission. Following these findings, a CES proforma was introduced to standardize the assessment process. In the subsequent cycle, documentation improved significantly, demonstrating the effectiveness of the intervention. Conclusion This QIP highlighted key areas requiring improvement, particularly the inconsistent completion of neurological examinations and delays in MRI access for suspected CES cases. Collaboration with the Emergency Department and radiology services led to the implementation of a CES assessment proforma, ensuring timely and consistent evaluation of patients. This structured approach supports earlier diagnosis, aligns with GIRFT standards, and enhances the quality and safety of CES management within our hospital.

                Aldosterone is a potent cholesterol-derived steroid hormone that plays a major role in controlling blood pressure via regulation of blood volume. The release of aldosterone is typically controlled by the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system, situated in the adrenal glands, kidneys, and lungs. Here, we reveal that the class A scavenger receptor MARCO, expressed on alveolar macrophages, negatively regulates aldosterone production and suppresses angiotensin-converting enzyme (Ace) expression in the lungs of male mice. Collectively, our findings suggest alveolar macrophages as additional players in the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system and introduce a novel example of interplay between the immune and endocrine systems.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104359">Phospholipid scramblase 1 (PLSCR1) regulates interferon-lambda receptor 1 (IFN-λR1) and IFN-λ signaling in influenza A virus (IAV) infection</a></h4>

              
                Phospholipid scramblase 1 (PLSCR1) is an interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) that has several known anti-influenza functions. However, the mechanisms in relation to its expression compartment and enzymatic activity have not been completely explored. Moreover, only limited animal models have been studied to delineate its role at the tissue level in influenza infections. Our results showed that influenza A virus (IAV)-infected <i>Plscr1<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice exhibited exacerbated body weight loss, decreased survival rates, heightened viral replication, and increased lung damage. Interestingly, transcriptomic analyses demonstrated that Plscr1 was required for the expression of type 3 interferon receptor (Ifn-λr1) upon IAV infection by binding to its promoter. In addition, PLSCR1 interacted with IFN-λR1 on the cell surface of pulmonary epithelial cells following IAV infection, suggesting it also modulated IFN-λ signaling via protein-protein interactions. The lipid scramblase activity of PLSCR1 was found to be dispensable for its anti-flu activity. Finally, single-cell RNA sequencing data indicated that <i>Plscr1</i> expression was significantly upregulated in ciliated airway epithelial cells in mice following IAV infection. Consistently, <i>Plscr1<sup>floxStop</sup>;Foxj1-Cre<sup>+</sup></i>mice with ciliated epithelial cell-specific Plscr1 overexpression showed reduced susceptibility to IAV infection, less inflammation, and enhanced Ifn-λr1 expression, suggesting that Plscr1 primarily regulates type 3 IFN signaling as a cell-intrinsic defense factor against IAV in ciliated airway epithelial cells. Our research will elucidate virus-host interactions and pave the way for the development of novel anti-influenza drugs that target human elements like PLSCR1, thereby mitigating the emergence of drug-resistant IAV strains.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98468">Nucleosome wrapping energy in CpG islands and the role of epigenetic base modifications</a></h4>

              
                The majority of vertebrate promoters have a distinct DNA composition, known as a CpG island. Cytosine methylation in promoter CpG islands is associated with a substantial reduction of transcription initiation. We hypothesise that both atypical sequence composition and epigenetic base modifications may affect the mechanical properties of DNA in CpG islands, influencing the ability of proteins to bind and initiate transcription. In this work, we model two scalar measures of the sequence-dependent propensity of DNA to wrap into nucleosomes: the energy of DNA required to assume a particular nucleosomal configuration and a measure related to the probability of linear DNA spontaneously reaching the nucleosomal configuration. We find that CpG density and modification state can alter DNA mechanics by creating states more or less compatible with nucleosome formation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92443">Projection-specific integration of convergent thalamic and retrosplenial signals in the presubicular head direction cortex</a></h4>

              
                Head direction (HD) signals function as the brain’s internal compass. They are organized as an attractor and anchor to the environment via visual landmarks. Here, we examine how thalamic HD signals and visual information from the retrosplenial cortex combine in the presubiculum. We find that monosynaptic excitatory connections from anterior thalamic nucleus and from retrosplenial cortex converge on single layer 3 pyramidal neurons in the dorsal portion of mouse presubiculum. Independent dual-wavelength photostimulation of these inputs in slices leads to action potential generation preferentially for near-coincident inputs, indicating that layer 3 neurons can transmit a visually matched HD signal to medial entorhinal cortex. Layer 4 neurons, which innervate the lateral mammillary nucleus, form a second step in the association of HD and landmark signals. They receive little direct input from thalamic and retrosplenial axons. We show that layer 4 cells are excited di-synaptically, transforming regular spiking activity into bursts of action potentials, and that their firing is enhanced by cholinergic agonists. Thus, a coherent sense of orientation involves projection-specific translaminar processing in the presubiculum, where neuromodulation facilitates landmark updating of HD signals in the lateral mammillary nucleus.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/52513">Structural characterisation of chromatin remodelling intermediates supports linker DNA dependent product inhibition as a mechanism for nucleosome spacing</a></h4>

              
                Previously we showed that <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> Chd1 chromatin remodelling enzyme associates with nucleosomes oriented towards the longer linker (Sundaramoorthy et al., 2018) (1). Here we report a series of structures of Chd1 bound to nucleosomes during ongoing ATP-dependent repositioning. Combining these with biochemical experiments and existing literature we propose a model in which Chd1 first associates oriented to sample putative entry DNA. In an ATP-dependent reaction, the enzyme then redistributes to the opposite side of the nucleosome, where it subsequently adopts a conformation productive for DNA translocation. Once this active complex extends nascent exit linker to approximately 15bp, it is sensed by the Chd1 DNA binding domain resulting in conversion to a product inhibited state. These observations provide a mechanistic basis for the action of a molecular ruler element in nucleosome spacing.

                What lies beneath is the “silent genocide” of deliberately using starvation to kill, its incidence so dire as it has become an emergency issue in contemporary international criminal law. This paper seeks to define starvation as a method of genocide, explore the various problems which arise from demonstrating the requisite criminal intent under the 1948 Genocide Convention. In many wars, hunger is used as a weapon to destroy targeted groups by depriving them of essential resources. Faced both with pivotal legal challenges which arise from the governing frameworks, from the evidentiary dilemma of establishing intent, and the liability limitations of the international courts, the study sets out key questions that we will address. The paper thus demonstrates major flaws in current mechanisms through a comparative analysis of court proceedings, from the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, and the International Criminal Court’s involvement in crises in Darfur, Gaza, and Yemen. This research calls for immediate legal changes and better-armed judges, allowing for the identification and prosecution of starvation as a form of genocide.

                Background Fractional calculus has gained significant attention due to its applications in modeling complex systems. This paper introduces several fundamental fractional operators, including the Riemann–Liouville, Caputo, and Hadamard operators. From these, a novel α-generalized fractional operator is derived, which plays a crucial role in solving fractional partial differential equations (FPDEs). Methods The α-generalized operator is analytically constructed and its properties are rigorously proven. It is then integrated with the Daftardar–Jafari iterative method (DJM) to solve both linear and nonlinear FPDEs. The convergence of the proposed method is established using the Lipschitz condition. Two benchmark equations—the linear fractional Burger’s equation and the nonlinear fractional Heat-type equation—are used to demonstrate the method’s applicability. MATLAB is employed to implement the numerical schemes and visualize the results. Results The DJM combined with the α-generalized operator yields superior numerical results compared to the Adomian decomposition method. This superiority is evident in both accuracy and convergence, especially for the nonlinear fractional Heat-type equation. Tabulated results and graphical comparisons confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach across different values of α. Conclusions The integration of the α-generalized operator with the Daftardar–Jafari method provides a powerful tool for solving FPDEs. Its numerical advantages make it a promising alternative to existing methods. The study recommends extending this framework to other fractional operators, iterative schemes, and potential transformation techniques, with applications in quantum physics, fluid dynamics, and beyond.

                Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are increasingly recognized as important regulators of cellular processes, including those implicated in autoimmune and endocrine disorders. However, their role in thyroid function, particularly hyperthyroidism, remains insufficiently defined. Growth Arrest-Specific 5 (GAS5) is a lncRNA with established functions in tumor suppression, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis, and may therefore influence thyroid cell regulation and hormone production. This study aimed to assess the expression of GAS5 in patients with hyperthyroidism and evaluate its potential utility as a biomarker. Thirty whole-blood samples from hyperthyroid patients and 20 samples from healthy controls were analyzed. Total RNA was extracted using Trizol, and complementary DNA (CDNA) was synthesized with oligo(dT) primers. GAS5 expression was quantified by qRT-PCR, and statistical analysis was performed using One-Way ANOVA, correlation testing, and visualization in R. GAS5 expression was significantly decreased in hyperthyroid patients compared with controls (mean 0.429 vs. 1.004, p < 0.0001), with non-overlapping confidence intervals. Approximately 77% of patient samples showed expression levels below one. Pairwise comparisons confirmed highly significant differences between groups (p = 0.0001). Spearman correlation revealed an inverse relationship between GAS5 and T3 (r = –0.454, p = 0.001) as well as T4 (r = –0.438, p = 0.001).These findings indicate that GAS5 downregulation is associated with increased thyroid hormone production, suggesting a potential regulatory role in hyperthyroidism. GAS5 expression could therefore represent a promising early biomarker for individuals at risk of thyroid dysfunction.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1435/v1?src=rss">Employing Fixed-Point Theory for Fuzzy Regression Analysis: Methodology and Empirical Application [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Traditional fuzzy regression approaches, such as Tanaka’s fuzzy minimum method and fuzzy least squares, often lack theoretical guarantees of existence, uniqueness, and numerical stability. These limitations are of paramount importance in engineering applications involving uncertainty, such as predicting the compressive strength of concrete. This study addresses these issues by presenting a mathematically rigorous fuzzy regression model, based on fixed-point theory, formulated within the full metric space of trapezoidal fuzzy numbers using the metric scale d ∞ . Methodology We define a shrinkage coefficient on the trapezoidal fuzzy coefficient vector space and prove, using Banach’s fixed-point theory, the existence and uniqueness of the regression solution. An iterative algorithm is constructed to estimate the coefficients, using alpha computation and Lipschitz continuity to ensure convergence. The University of California, Irvine concrete compressive strength dataset was amplified using ASTM and ACI-based uncertainty coefficients, and the proposed fixed-point model was evaluated against the Tanaka method and least-squares fuzzy regression. Performance was assessed by mean squared error (MSE), coefficient ambiguity, convergence behavior, and toughness under ±5% noise. Results The proposed method demonstrated consistent geometric convergence with an average of 12.3 iterations and zero divergence across all experiments. It also reduced the overall mean squared error by an average of 12.5%, and by up to 25.1% at best, compared to the comparator methods. Coefficient ambiguity—measured by ambiguity width—was reduced by 18.3% compared to the Tanaka method and by 13.3% compared to ambiguity squares. Under noise perturbation, the model exhibits a significantly smaller increase in the mean error (+6.2%) compared to the Tanaka approach (+24.7%) and the LS-based approach (+18.3%), indicating a substantial improvement in robustness. Conclusions Incorporating fuzzy regression within a fixed-point theoretical framework helps resolve the stability, existence, and singularity challenges that have long plagued classical fuzzy regression models. The proposed approach offers a mathematically consistent, computationally stable, uncertainty-aware regression tool suitable for engineering applications involving imprecise measurements. Future work includes extending the model to nonlinear fuzzy structures, Gaussian/LR fuzzy representations, and broader applications in data-driven prediction under uncertainty.

                Background This cross-sectional study assessed the impact of long-term use of skin-whitening products containing corticosteroids on the function of the adrenal glands. Objectives To assess the impact of extended use of corticosteroid-based whitening creams on serum cortisol levels and to examine the prevalence of adrenal suppression among habitual users. Methods This research, executed at the Hawija Technical Institute from January to April 2025, included 57 participants aged 20 to 40. Before enrolling, all participants gave their written consent. Individuals with chronic endocrine disorders or those receiving systemic corticosteroids were excluded. They were split into two groups: 38 regular (14 male and 24 female) users of skin-whitening creams (≥3 months) as the experimental group and 19 (7 male and 12 female) non-users as the control group. The Mindray CL-900i, a fully automated chemiluminescence immunoassay analyzer, was used to measure the levels of cortisol in the serum. Results In comparison to controls (7.85 ± 3.54 μg/dL; p = 0.0004), users had a significantly lower mean cortisol level (4.25 ± 2.23 μg/dL), with 42% of users exhibiting cortisol <5 μg/dL, indicating adrenal suppression. There were no discernible variations in BMI between the groups or between male and female users. These results show that extended exposure to corticosteroids suppresses the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Conclusions Using skin-whitening creams that contain corticosteroids too often can make the adrenal glands work less well. It is suggested that public health measures be used to inform users about endocrine risks and to control these products.

                Abstract* Background Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) represents the most prevalent form of thyroid malignancy worldwide, with increasing incidence rates observed across various populations. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) has been implicated in numerous malignancies, with its encoded nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) playing a crucial role in modulating host gene expression, particularly microRNAs. MicroRNA-155 (miR-155) has emerged as a significant oncogenic regulator in various cancers. Objectives This study was designed to investigate the involvement of EBNA1 in the regulation of miRNA-155 in PTC and to evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic values of miR-155 in Iraqi patients. Materials and Methods A case-control study was conducted involving 100 histologically confirmed PTC patients and 100 nodular goiter controls recruited from Baghdad, Iraq, between March 2024 and August 2024. Expression levels of EBNA1 and miR-155 were quantified using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Statistical analyses included correlation assessment, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Results EBNA1 positivity was higher in PTC cases (82%) compared to controls (41%) (p < 0.001), Both miR-155 and EBNA1 expression levels were significantly elevated in PTC cases, with mean values of 5.38 ± 2.50 and 24.3 ± 11.96, respectively, compared to controls (1.51 ± 1.25 and 15.9 ± 19.20, p < 0.0001). However, correlation analysis revealed a weak negative relationship between miR-155 and EBNA1 expression (r = -0.031, p = 0.758). ROC analysis demonstrated excellent diagnostic performance of miR-155 with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.927, sensitivity of 83%, and specificity of 87%. Conclusion EBNA1 appears to play a regulatory role in miR-155 expression in PTC, despite the absence of a direct linear correlation. MiR-155 demonstrates strong potential as a diagnostic biomarker for PTC in Iraqi patients, warranting further investigation into its therapeutic implications.

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>After fear conditioning, repeated presentation of the conditioned stimulus (CS) alone produces a context-dependent extinction of learned fear. The hippocampus has a critical role in this process, but the mechanism by which contextual information encoded by the hippocampus leads to fear suppression is unknown. We hypothesize that contextual information encoded by the dorsal hippocampus supports the recall of extinction memory by the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). To test this hypothesis, we evaluated the oscillatory coherence and directional coupling of the hippocampus and mPFC during context-dependent extinction retrieval in a previously published experiment. In this experiment, male and female rats were subjected to auditory fear conditioning followed by fear extinction and extinction retrieval procedures. Previous analyses focused on oscillatory coupling during the CS; here, we performed new analyses to assess hippocampal-prefrontal coupling in the context in which extinction occurred. We found that, after extinction, re-exposing the animals to the extinction context produces a marked increase in dorsal hippocampal theta (6–8 Hz) oscillations. This increase was associated with enhanced coherence between the dHPC and the prelimbic (PL), but not the infralimbic (IL), division of the mPFC. Moreover, Granger causality analyses revealed that hippocampal theta oscillations preceded theta in the PL throughout the extinction retrieval session. This effect emerged during exposure to the extinction context and persisted during the presentation of the CSs and the expression of freezing behavior. Interestingly, this pattern of coherence was not observed between the dHPC and the IL. These results suggest that oscillatory coupling between the dorsal hippocampus and PL facilitates the context-dependent retrieval of the extinguished fear memory.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-822/v2?src=rss">Women Entrepreneurs and Innovation Strategies: Driving Inclusive Fintech Business Growth in Sub-Saharan Africa [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                This review examines how women entrepreneurs can drive financial technology (fintech) business growth in Sub-Saharan Africa. While fintech is expanding rapidly across the region, the unique role of women-led ventures in promoting innovation and inclusive growth has been underexplored. A narrative literature review of studies from 2015 to 2025 was conducted, with qualitative findings analyzed thematically. Results show that women entrepreneurs leverage mobile technology, AI, blockchain, digital payments, and innovation hub collaborations to enhance market access, financial inclusion, and capacity building. Nonetheless, persistent challenges such as limited digital literacy, regulatory barriers, gender biases, and a lack of gender-disaggregated data constrain sustainable growth and adoption of women-led fintech ventures. These findings highlight the need for targeted policy measures to improve women’s access to finance, technology, and networks, strengthening inclusive fintech ecosystems across Sub-Saharan Africa. Overall, empowering women entrepreneurs is critical for fostering equitable and sustainable fintech innovation in the region.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102874">GPR30 in spinal cholecystokinin-positive neurons modulates neuropathic pain</a></h4>

              
                Neuropathic pain, a major health problem affecting 7–10% of the global population, lacks effective treatment due to its elusive mechanisms. Cholecystokinin-positive (CCK<sup>+</sup>) neurons in the spinal dorsal horn (SDH) are critical for neuropathic pain, yet the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we show that the membrane estrogen receptor G-protein coupled estrogen receptor (GPER/GPR30) in spinal neurons was significantly upregulated in chronic constriction injury (CCI) mice and that inhibition of GPR30 in CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons reversed CCI-induced neuropathic pain. Furthermore, GPR30 in spinal CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons was essential for the enhancement of AMPA-mediated excitatory synaptic transmission in CCI mice. Moreover, GPR30 was expressed in spinal CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons that received direct projection from the primary sensory cortex (S1-SDH). Chemogenetic inhibition of S1-SDH post-synaptic neurons alleviated CCI-induced neuropathic pain. Conversely, chemogenetic activation of these neurons mimicked neuropathic pain symptoms, which were attenuated by spinal inhibition of GPR30. Finally, we confirmed that GPR30 in S1-SDH post-synaptic neurons was required for CCI-induced neuropathic pain. Taken together, our findings suggest that GPR30 in spinal CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons and S1-SDH post-synaptic neurons is pivotal for neuropathic pain, thereby representing a promising therapeutic target for neuropathic pain.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/108748">Are peer reviewers influenced by their work being cited?</a></h4>

              
                Peer reviewers sometimes comment that their own journal articles should be cited by the journal article under review. Comments concerning relevant articles can be justified, but comments can also be unrelated coercive citations. Here, we used a matched observational study design to explore how citations influence the peer review process. We used a sample of more than 37,000 peer reviews from four journals that use open peer review and make all article versions available. We find that reviewers who were cited in versions after version 1 were more likely to make a favourable recommendation (odds ratio = 1.61; adjusted 99.4% CI: 1.16–2.23), whereas being cited in the first version did not improve their recommendation (odds ratio = 0.84; adjusted 99.4% CI: 0.69–1.03). For all versions of the articles, the reviewers who commented that their own articles should be cited were less likely to recommend approval compared to the reviewers who did not, with the strongest association after the first version (odds ratio = 0.15; adjusted 99.4% CI: 0.08–0.30). Reviewers who included a citation to their own articles were much more likely to approve a revised article that cited their articles compared to a revised article that did not (odds ratio = 3.5; 95% CI: 2.0–6.1). Some reviewers’ recommendations depend on whether they are cited or want to be cited. Reviewer citation requests can turn peer review into a transaction rather than an objective critique of the article.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99426">Functional genomics reveals strain-specific genetic requirements conferring hypoxic growth in Mycobacterium intracellulare</a></h4>

              
                <i>Mycobacterium intracellulare</i> is a major etiological agent of the recently expanding <i>Mycobacterium avium–intracellulare</i> complex pulmonary disease (MAC-PD). Therapeutic regimens that include a combination of macrolides and antituberculous drugs have been implemented with limited success. To identify novel targets for drug development that accommodate the genomic diversity of <i>M. avium–intracellulare</i>, we subjected eight clinical MAC-PD isolates and the type strain ATCC13950 to genome-wide profiling to comprehensively identify universally essential functions by transposon sequencing (TnSeq). Among these strains, we identified 131 shared essential or growth-defect-associated genes by TnSeq. Unlike the type strain, the clinical strains showed increased requirements for genes involved in gluconeogenesis and the type VII secretion system under standard growth conditions, the same genes required for hypoxic pellicle-type biofilm formation in ATCC13950. Consistent with the central role of hypoxia in the evolution of <i>M. intracellulare</i>, the clinical MAC-PD strains showed more rapid adaptation to hypoxic growth than the type strain. Importantly, the increased requirements of hypoxic fitness genes were confirmed in a mouse lung infection model. These findings confirm the concordant genetic requirements under hypoxic conditions in vitro and hypoxia-related conditions in vivo and highlight the importance of using clinical strains and host-relevant growth conditions to identify high-value targets for drug development.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/107018">Vascular endothelial-specific loss of TGF-beta signaling as a model for choroidal neovascularization and central nervous system vascular inflammation</a></h4>

              
                In mice, postnatal endothelial cell (EC)-specific knockout of the genes coding for transforming growth factor-beta receptor (TGFBR)1 and/or TGFBR2 eliminates TGF-beta signaling in vascular ECs and leads to distinctive central nervous system (CNS) vascular phenotypes. Knockout mice exhibit (1) reduced intraretinal vascularization, (2) choroidal neovascularization with occasional anastomoses connecting choroidal and intraretinal vasculatures, (3) infiltration of diverse immune cells into the retina, including macrophages, T-cells, B-cells, NK cells, and dendritic cells, (4) a close physical association between immune cells and retinal vasculature, (5) a pro-inflammatory transcriptional state in CNS ECs, with increased ICAM1 immunoreactivity, and (6) increased smooth muscle actin immunostaining in CNS pericytes. Comparisons of the retinal phenotype with two other genetic models of retinal hypovascularization – loss of Norrin/Fzd4 signaling and loss of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling – show that the immune cell infiltrate is greatest with loss of TGF-beta signaling, more modest with loss of Norrin/Fzd4 signaling, and undetectable with loss of VEGF signaling. The phenotypes caused by loss of TGF-beta signaling in ECs recapitulate some of the cardinal features of retinal and neurologic diseases associated with vascular inflammation. These observations suggest that therapies that promote TGF-beta-dependent anti-inflammatory responses in ECs could represent a promising strategy for disease modulation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104375">Computer prediction and genetic analysis identifies retinoic acid modulation as a driver of conserved longevity pathways in genetically diverse Caenorhabditis nematodes</a></h4>

              
                Discovery of new compounds that ameliorate the negative health impacts of aging promises to be of tremendous benefit across a number of age-based comorbidities. One method to prioritize a testable subset of the nearly infinite universe of potential compounds is to use computational prediction of their likely anti-aging capacity. Here, we present a survey of longevity effects for 16 compounds suggested by a previously published computational prediction set, capitalizing upon the comprehensive, multi-species approach utilized by the <i>Caenorhabditis</i> Intervention Testing Program. While 11 compounds (aldosterone, arecoline, bortezomib, dasatinib, decitabine, dexamethasone, erlotinib, everolimus, gefitinib, temsirolimus, and thalidomide) either had no effect on median lifespan or were toxic, 5 compounds (all-trans retinoic acid, berberine, fisetin, propranolol, and ritonavir) extended lifespan in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>. These computer predictions yield a remarkable positive hit rate of 30%. Deeper genetic characterization of the longevity effects of one of the most efficacious compounds, the endogenous signaling ligand all-trans retinoic acid (atRA, designated tretinoin in medical products), demonstrated a requirement for the regulatory kinases AKT-1 and AKT-2. While the canonical Akt-target FOXO/DAF-16 was largely dispensable, other conserved Akt-targets (Nrf2/SKN-1 and HSF1/HSF-1), as well as the conserved catalytic subunit of AMPK AAK-2, were all necessary for longevity extension by atRA. Our results highlight the potential of combining computational prediction of longevity interventions with the power of nematode functional genetics and underscore that the manipulation of a conserved metabolic regulatory circuit by co-opting endogenous signaling molecules is a powerful approach for discovering aging interventions.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/107021">Cryptovaranoides is not a squamate</a></h4>

              
                Accurate reconstruction of the timescale of organismal evolution requires placement of extinct representatives among living branches. In this way, the fossil record has the capacity to revise hypotheses of organismal evolution by producing representatives of clades that far pre-date the age of the clade inferred using phylogenies built from molecular data and previous fossil calibrations. Recently, one fossil with the potential to drastically change current understanding surrounding the timescale of reptile diversification was described from Triassic fissure-fill deposits in the United Kingdom. This taxon, †<i>Cryptovaranoides microlanius</i>, was originally placed deep within the squamate crown clade, suggesting that many lineages of living lizards and snakes must have appeared by the Triassic and implying long ghost lineages that paleontologists and molecular phylogeneticists have failed to detect using all other available data. Our team challenged this identification and instead suggested †<i>Cryptovaranoides</i> had unclear affinities to living reptiles, but a crown-squamate interpretation was later re-iterated by the team that originally described this species. Here, we again challenge the morphological character codings used to support a crown squamate affinity for †<i>Cryptovaranoides microlanius</i> and illustrate several empirical problems with analyses that find this taxon is a crown squamate. Our analyses emphasize the importance of stringency in constructing hypodigms of fossils, particularly when they may be key for proper time calibration of the Tree of Life.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/103324">DendroTweaks, an interactive approach for unraveling dendritic dynamics</a></h4>

              
                Neurons rely on the interplay between two critical components, dendritic morphology and ion channels, to transform synaptic inputs into a sequence of somatic spikes. Detailed biophysical models with active dendrites have been instrumental in exploring this interaction. However, such models can be challenging to understand and validate due to the large number of parameters involved. In this work, we introduce <i>DendroTweaks</i>, a toolbox designed to make detailed biophysical models with active dendrites more intuitive and more interactive. <i>DendroTweaks</i> features a web-based graphical interface, where users can explore single-cell neuronal models and adjust their morphological and biophysical parameters with real-time visual feedback. In particular, <i>DendroTweaks</i> focuses on subcellular properties, such as kinetics and distribution of ion channels, as well as the dynamics and placement of synaptic inputs. The toolbox supports various experimental protocols designed to illuminate how morpho-electric properties map to dendritic events and how these dendritic events shape neuronal output, thereby enhancing model validation. It helps users build high-level, modular model representations and includes a rich set of tools for parsing, generating, and standardizing commonly used neuronal data formats. Finally, it enables model simplification through a built-in morphology reduction algorithm, allowing users to export models for further use in faster, more interpretable networks. By combining extensive visualization capabilities and comprehensive data management functionality, <i>DendroTweaks</i> introduces a novel interactive approach for unraveling dendritic dynamics. This approach will accelerate research on dendritic computations, their underlying mechanisms, and their fundamental role in brain function.

                Trained Immunity is the nonspecific (pathogen agnostic) memory of innate immune cells, characterized by altered responses upon secondary stimulation. This review provides a RoadMap for the discovery and development of therapeutics targeting Trained Immunity, aimed at researchers with strong scientific backgrounds but limited drug development experience. The article outlines five drug development domains – epigenetic, metabolic, differentiation, inflammatory, and memory changes – that guide the identification of molecular targets, model selection, and biomarker development for the discovery and development of Trained Immunity-based therapeutics. It emphasizes the application of preclinical models and artificial intelligence in target discovery and compound screening. Additionally, the review addresses challenges in translating preclinical Trained Immunity findings to clinical trials and highlights relevant disease indications and ongoing clinical trials. This review integrates scientific findings with development strategy and thereby aims to bridge the gap between discovery and clinical application, advancing the field of Trained Immunity-based therapeutics.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106415">Regional heterogeneities of oligodendrocytes underlie biased Ranvier node spacing along single axons in sound localization circuit</a></h4>

              
                Spacing of Ranvier nodes along myelinated axons is a critical determinant of conduction velocity, influencing spike arrival timing and hence neural circuit function. In the chick brainstem auditory circuit, the pattern of nodal spacing varies regionally along single axons, enabling precise binaural integration for sound localization. Using this model, we investigated the potential factors underlying the biased nodal spacing pattern. 3D morphometry revealed that these axons were almost fully myelinated by oligodendrocytes exhibiting distinct morphologies and cell densities across regions after hearing onset. The structure of axons did not affect internodal length. Inhibiting vesicular release from the axons did not affect internodal length or oligodendrocyte morphology, but caused unmyelinated segments on the axons by suppressing oligodendrogenesis near the presynaptic terminals. These results suggest that the regional heterogeneity in the intrinsic properties of oligodendrocytes is a prominent determinant of the biased nodal spacing pattern in the sound localization circuit, while activity-dependent signaling supports the pattern by ensuring adequate oligodendrocyte density. Our findings highlight the importance of oligodendrocyte heterogeneity in fine-tuning neural circuit function.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105782">Predictive modeling of hematoma expansion from non-contrast computed tomography in spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage patients</a></h4>

              
                Hematoma expansion is a consistent predictor of poor neurological outcome and mortality after spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). An incomplete understanding of its biophysiology has limited early preventative intervention. Transport-based morphometry (TBM) is a mathematical modeling technique that uses a physically meaningful metric to quantify and visualize discriminating image features that are not readily perceptible to the human eye. We hypothesized that TBM could discover relationships between hematoma morphology on initial Non-Contrast Computed Tomography (NCCT) and hematoma expansion. 170 spontaneous ICH patients enrolled in the multi-center international Virtual International Trials of Stroke Archive (VISTA-ICH) with time-series NCCT data were used for model derivation. Its performance was assessed on a test dataset of 170 patients from the Ethnic/Racial Variations of Intracerebral Hemorrhage (ERICH) study. A unique transport-based representation was produced from each presentation NCCT hematoma image to identify morphological features of expansion. The principal hematoma features identified by TBM were larger size, density heterogeneity, shape irregularity, and peripheral density distribution. These were consistent with clinician-identified features of hematoma expansion, corroborating the hypothesis that morphological characteristics of the hematoma promote future growth. Incorporating these traits into a multivariable model comprising morphological, spatial, and clinical information achieved an AUROC of 0.71 for quantifying 24 hr hematoma expansion risk in the test dataset. This outperformed existing clinician protocols and alternate machine learning methods, suggesting that TBM detected features with improved precision than by visual inspection alone. This pre-clinical study presents a quantitative and interpretable method for discovery and visualization of NCCT biomarkers of hematoma expansion in ICH patients. Because TBM has a direct physical meaning, its modeling of NCCT hematoma features can inform hypotheses for hematoma expansion mechanisms. It has potential future application as a clinical risk stratification tool.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106184">Mac-/Lactosylceramide regulates intestinal homeostasis and secretory cell fate commitment by facilitating Notch signaling</a></h4>

              
                Cell-to-cell communication via Delta-Notch signaling is widely used in various tissues and organs to regulate development and patterning; however, the mechanisms regulating Notch signaling for precise cell fate decisions remain poorly understood. Similar to mammals, the intestinal stem cells in the adult <i>Drosophila</i> midgut generate both absorptive and secretory cell progeny, guided by differential levels of Notch activation. Here we performed a forward genetic screen in <i>Drosophila</i> and identified glucosylceramide synthase (GlcT), a rate-limiting enzyme for glycosphingolipid (GSL) production, whose mutation causes the development of secretory cell tumors. Genetic analysis of the GSL synthesis pathway, combined with metabolite rescue experiments, revealed that the tumor formation is linked to a deficiency in Mactosylceramide/Lactosylceramide. This deficiency impaired the endocytic recycling of the Delta, subsequently reducing Notch signaling activation. Conditional knockout of <i>Ugcg</i>, the mammalian ortholog of <i>GlcT</i>, in mouse small intestine caused an excessive differentiation of goblet cells, phenotypes similar to these caused by Notch inhibition. Our study suggests an evolutionarily conserved role for a specific GSL metabolite in modulating Notch signaling during stem cell fate decisions and provides a molecular connection between ceramide metabolism and Notch signaling in regulating tissue homeostasis and tumor formation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100396">A single-cell atlas of the testicular interstitium defines Leydig progenitor networks sustaining Leydig cell homeostasis across the lifespan</a></h4>

              
                Declining rates of male fertility pose a significant clinical challenge, while the mechanisms underlying testicular interstitial function remain incompletely understood. Here, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the single-cell transcriptomic landscape of the murine testicular interstitium across the postnatal lifespan. The investigation unveiled a previously unrecognized population of Cd34<sup>+</sup>/Sox4<sup>+</sup> mesenchymal cells nestled within the interstitium, hinting at their potential as Leydig cell progenitors. With the aging process of Cd34<sup>+</sup>/Sox4<sup>+</sup> mesenchymal cells, we observed a decline in glutathione levels within the testicular interstitium. Remarkably, these Cd34<sup>+</sup>/Sox4<sup>+</sup> mesenchymal cells exhibited clonogenic self-renewal capacity and a robust propensity to differentiate into Leydig cells. Intriguingly, when transplanted into Leydig cell-disrupted or failure models, Cd34<sup>+</sup>/Sox4<sup>+</sup> cells efficiently colonized the testicular interstitium, resulting in a notable increase in testosterone production. Exploring the epigenetic landscape, we identified critical transcription factors, most notably Sox4, governing the stem cell fate of Cd34<sup>+</sup>/Sox4<sup>+</sup> mesenchymal cells. Overall, this comprehensive lifespan-resolved single-cell atlas of testicular interstitial cells provides fundamental insights into Leydig cell progenitor biology and regenerative capacity during aging.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The pharmacological treatment of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), a disorder characterized by recurrent seizures and cognitive dysfunction, is limited to symptomatic control. Identifying novel targets to modify disease progression is of great clinical and translational interest. Cellular senescence has been recently implicated in the development and progression of other neurodegenerative diseases, but its role in TLE is unstudied.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We first investigated cellular senescence markers in resected hippocampi from patients with medically intractable TLE through multiplexed immunofluorescence. We next used a mouse model of TLE (pilocarpine induced status epilepticus [SE]) for a combination of immunohistochemistry, behavioral testing, and electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring. We implemented 2 strategies for removal of senescent cells (SCs), a genetic mouse model allowing for targeted senolysis, and a pharmacological approach using dasatinib and quercetin.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We found a 5-fold elevation of senescent glia in human TLE cases as compared with controls. In mice, we found increases in senescence markers at both the transcript and protein level and predominantly expressed in microglia, which developed within 2 weeks following SE. Senolytic treatment produced a 50% reduction in SCs, rescued long-term potentiation deficits, normalized spatial memory impairments, reduced seizures, and protected a third of animals from epilepsy.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our data demonstrate that SCs accumulate in both human TLE and in a mouse model of TLE and suggest that clearing SCs may be a viable strategy to reduce seizures and associated cognitive comorbidities. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                <p>Mice offer a wealth of opportunities for investigating brain circuits regulating multiple behaviors, largely due to their genetic tractability. Social behaviors are translationally relevant, considering both mice and humans are highly social mammals, and human social behavior disruptions are key symptoms of myriad neuropsychiatric disorders. Stresses related to social experiences are particularly influential in the severity and maintenance of neuropsychiatric disorders like anxiety disorders and trauma and stressor-related disorders. Yet, induction and study of social stress in mice has disproportionately focused on males, influenced heavily by their inherent territorial nature. Social target-instigated stress (i.e., defeat), while ethologically relevant, is quite variable and predominantly specific to males, making rigorous and sex-inclusive studies challenging. In pursuit of a controllable, consistent, high-throughput, and sex-inclusive method for social stress elicitation, we modified a paradigm to train male and female F1 129S1/SvlmJ <FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">x</FONT> C57BL/6J mice to associate (via classical conditioning) same or different sex C57BL/6J targets with a mild, aversive stimulus. While further paradigm optimization is required, social interaction testing 24&nbsp;h after conditioning indicates males socially conditioned better to male targets by exhibiting reduced social interaction, whereas females appeared not to form social stimulus associations. Serum corticosterone levels inversely corresponded to social avoidance after different sex, but not same sex, conditioning, suggesting corticosterone-mediated arousal influences cross-sex interactions. These rigorously controlled null outcomes align with past pursuits&rsquo; limited success in creating a sex-inclusive social stress paradigm.</p>

                Background Lipid deposits on rigid corneal lenses pose significant challenges, impacting visual clarity, lens comfort, and ocular health. Despite advancements in lens materials and cleaning systems, lipid deposition remains a persistent issue, influenced by individual physiological factors and external conditions. This case report explores the composition, influencing factors, and management strategies for lipid deposits through two distinct presentations. Methods Case 1 involved a jelly-like, white, deposits coating the lens surface, whereas, case 2 described localized, irregular, peripheral lipid clusters. Both cases underwent thorough evaluation, including slit-lamp microscopy and spectroscopic analysis, to characterize the deposits’ morphology and composition. These assessments, combined with detailed patient histories, revealed the multifactorial nature of lipid deposition. Results Management strategies were customized for each case, with both approaches successfully reduced lipid deposition, improved lens performance, and enhanced patient satisfaction. This report underscores the importance of a personalized, multifaceted approach to managing lipid deposits on rigid corneal lenses. Conclusions Identifying contributing factors such as tear film abnormalities, material properties, and patient behaviours is critical for effective management. The findings highlight the need for continued innovation in lens material technology and cleaning systems to address this common issue.

                This opinion article examines the convergence between artificial intelligence (AI) and gamification in learning environments, with an emphasis on deep gamification designs aimed at creating interactive and meaningful experiences that transcend extrinsic motivation. The introduction sets the context by presenting AI as a tool that must be critically analyzed within the framework of critical pedagogy, which underscores the importance of adopting technology reflectively, placing the student at the center, and responding to the real needs of the community. The body of the article develops this claim: the integration of artificial intelligence into deep gamification designs can contribute to genuine educational transformation, provided that such integration is guided by critical pedagogical principles and maintains a balance between the potential of technology and the formative power of teaching practices. Arguments related to this claim are provided, including the use of AI in gamified designs to create personalized learning experiences based on students’ needs, rhythms, and learning styles; to transform the way students learn; to offer new educational resources; to adapt elements such as difficulty levels, challenges, and feedback in real time; and to develop engaging learning systems that lead to better academic outcomes. The conclusion emphasizes the significance of instructors utilizing critical pedagogy to direct AI-optimized gamification designs by incorporating culture, creativity, and critical awareness as pillars of educational transformation. This approach enables the surmounting of the obstacles presented by this synergy.

                The fixed-point iteration method is a powerful tool in analysis and its extensions in other branches. It provides a unified structure for proving existence and uniqueness results for various nonlinear problems. This study, conducted within the scope of a real Banach space enriched by uniform convexity, presents an accelerated four-step iterative scheme designed to approximate elements of the fixed-point set corresponding to a mapping called a total asymptotically nonexpansive (briefly, TAN) mapping. The results of weak and strong convergence for the proposed method are established. The results relating to weak convergence require Opial’s condition of the normed space, while the results relating to strong convergence require the addition of the semi-compactness assumption of the mapping under consideration to the previous assumptions. Additionally, numerical simulations are conducted to evaluate the algorithm’s effectiveness and compare it with previously established approaches. These findings extend and refine several recent contributions available in the literature. Lastly, the work includes an application to 2- dimensional equations.

                Background Class III malocclusion presents unique challenges in both diagnosis and treatment. Bone-anchored maxillary protraction (BAMP) and facemask (FM) therapy are common approaches. Finite element analysis (FEA) helps evaluate their biomechanical effects. The study aims to evaluate and compare the stress distribution and displacement during maxillary protraction on the craniofacial complex using bone-anchored maxillary protraction and a facemask using finite element analysis. Methods A finite element model of the maxillofacial complex was developed using CT scans of a young human skull and analyzed using ANSYS (v18.1). The material properties for facemask therapy and miniplates used in bone-anchored maxillary protraction (BAMP), were gathered to create a 3D finite element analysis (FEA) model. Displacement and stress patterns were assessed in the maxilla, maxillary teeth, mandible, and surrounding structures for both BAMP and facemask therapy, applying a bilateral force of 300 grams. Results Displacement was mainly observed in the maxillary complex for both protocols, with BAMP showing more anterior displacement than the facemask. In contrast, the mandible experienced greater downward and backward displacement with the facemask protocol. Both methods revealed distinct displacement patterns in the dentoalveolar area. The facemask treatment resulted in more forward displacement of the maxillary anterior teeth, while BAMP primarily caused forward displacement in the first and second molar regions. Additionally, BAMP showed higher stress levels in the craniofacial area, particularly at the miniplate attachment site, whereas the Facemask approach had a more even distribution of stress across the craniofacial region. Conclusion This finite element analysis indicates that maxillary protraction can be achieved through both FM and BAMP methods. However, BAMP method showed greater skeletal displacement with fewer dental effects. This implies that skeletal anchorage might provide a better result for treating class III malocclusion.

                Background This socio-economic analysis studies the influence of jasmine production on the economic well-being of farmers in Huvina Hadagali, a region known for its high-quality jasmine flowers. The Vijaya Nagara district’s Havina Hadagali area is well known throughout the country for its jasmine flower farming. In addition to being referred to as Mallige Nadu, this location is also known as Malligeya Tavaru. The cultivation of the jasmine flower is protected by the Geographical Indication (GI) Tag, and this flower has been popular in this region for a substantial amount of time. Methods Data was collected from a sample of 364 jasmine growers using a structured questionnaire in Huvina Hadagali, Vijayanagar district. The data focused on different socio-economic factors such as income levels, employment, market access, and agricultural techniques. The study is analysed using IBM SPSS through frequency analysis and 2-step clustering. Result The results demonstrate that the cultivation of jasmine makes a substantial contribution to the local economy, serving as a main or additional source of income for numerous households. Jasmine farming often contributes 40% of the whole household income, and during peak seasons, it provides significant economic advantages. Nevertheless, the highlighted obstacles were volatile market pricing, pest infestations, and limited access to contemporary farming practices. Due to their decades of experience, it is felt by the farmers. Hadagali Jasmine comes under the GI Tag, hence they are authorised farmers. The study emphasises the crucial significance of cooperative societies and local marketplaces in stabilising income and offering essential resources and training to farmers. Conclusion The research highlights the necessity of governmental interventions focused on developing market infrastructure, offering financial assistance, and improving access to agricultural innovations to maintain and augment the economic advantages of jasmine cultivation in Huvina Hadagali which also lead to an overall development of floriculture in India.

                Background Continuous exposure to sunlight and pollution without adequate protection can damage skin, making it prone to premature aging. One of the natural ingredients for anti-aging is antioxidant. Malang green apple (Malus sylvestris Mill) contains bioactive compounds that can act as antioxidants, but its use is still limited to only as food ingredient. Furthermore, some studies show the potency of fruit fermentation to increase these bioactive compounds. Thus, this study is a preliminary study to examine the anti-aging potency of fermented Malang green apples. Methods Human foreskin fibroblasts were treated with fermented Malang green apple juice extract (FAJ) by Lactobacillus plantarum DAD-13 and Saccharomyces cerevisiae Fermipan and its unfermented (AJ) for 24, 48, and 72 hours. Cell viability was measured using the MTT assay and collagen deposition was measured using the Sirius red staining method. The expression of matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP-1) and collagen type 1 alpha 1 chain (COL1A1) was measured in fibroblasts after treatment with extracts. Results Cell viability and collagen deposition of fibroblasts tended to be higher after 48 h of extract exposure. Fibroblasts that received FAJ 62.5 μg/mL showed higher cell viability than negative control (p <0.05) and FAJ 31.25 μg/mL showed higher collagen deposition than negative control (p <0.05) at 48 hours of extract exposure. AJ and FAJ also decreased MMP-1 gene expression. They showed a significant decrease in MMP-1 levels (p <0.01) compared to the untreated group, whereas they showed increased expression of COL1A1 at low concentrations. There was no significant difference in the gene expression between FAJ and AJ. Conclusions Our results indicated that Malang green apple juice extract affected fibroblast cell viability, collagen deposition, MMP-1, and COL1A1 gene expression. Exposure of lower concentrations of FAJ to skin fibroblasts for 48 hours showed better results.

                <p>by Marika Constant, Elisa Filevich, Pascal Mamassian</p>

According to the Bayesian framework, both our perceptual decisions and confidence about those decisions are based on the precision-weighted integration of prior expectations and incoming sensory information. While it is generally assumed that priors influence both decisions and confidence in the same way, previous work has found priors to have a stronger impact at the confidence level, challenging this assumption. However, these patterns were found for high-level probabilistic expectations that are flexibly induced in the task context. It remains unclear whether this generalizes to low-level perceptual priors that are naturally formed through long term exposure. Here we investigated human participants’ confidence in decisions made under the influence of a long-term perceptual prior: the slow-motion prior. Participants viewed tilted moving-line stimuli for which the slow-motion prior biases the perceived motion direction. On each trial, they made two consecutive motion direction decisions followed by a confidence decision. We contrasted two conditions – one in which the prior impacted discrimination performance, and one in which it did not. We found a confidence bias favoring the condition in which the prior influenced discrimination decisions, even after accounting for performance differences. Computational modeling revealed this effect to be best explained by confidence using the prior-congruent evidence as an additional cue, beyond the posterior evidence used in the perceptual decision. This is in agreement with a confirmatory confidence bias favoring evidence congruent with low-level perceptual priors, revealing that, in line with high-level expectations, even long-term priors have a greater influence on the metacognitive level than on perceptual decisions.

                <p>by Nishant Joshi, Sven van Der Burg, Tansu Celikel, Fleur Zeldenrust</p>

Neuronal classification based on morphology, electrophysiology, and molecular markers is often considered static. Here, we challenge this view, showing that functional classification depends on input patterns. Using single-cell recordings from layer 2/3 barrel cortex neurons in mice, we compared responses to step-and-hold versus dynamic frozen noise inputs that mimic presynaptic activity. Action potential and waveform-based classifications varied significantly, highlighting the dynamic nature of neuronal identity. To assess the contribution of input versus neuronal attributes toward classification, we analyzed four attribute sets, namely action potential, passive biophysical, adaptation currents, and linear input filters derived via spike-triggered averages (STA). Our findings revealed that the STA, which captures a neuron’s selective responsiveness to presynaptic activity, explained the most variance within the population. This highlights input-driven dynamics as key to functional identity, emphasizing the need for physiologically relevant inputs in defining neuronal classes and shifting the focus from static properties to dynamic functional diversity.

                <p>by Romain Enjalbert, Jakub Köry, Timm Krüger, Miguel O. Bernabeu</p>

The tumour microvasculature is abnormal, and as a consequence oxygen and drug transport to the tumour tissue is impaired. The abnormal microvasculature contributes to tumour tissue hypoxia, as well as to varying drug penetration depth in the tumour. Many anti-cancer treatments require the presence of oxygen to be fully efficacious, however the question of how well oxygen concentration overlaps with drug concentration is not elucidated, which could compromise the therapeutic effect of these drugs. In this work we use a computational model of blood flow and oxygen transport, and develop a model for an oxygen-dependent drug, T-DM1, to study the overlap of oxygen and drug concentration in tumour tissue, where we model both compressed and uncompressed vessels in the tumour. Our results show that, due to the compressed vessels present in tumours, areas of sufficient oxygen concentration for a drug to function overlap poorly with areas of sufficient drug concentration, covering 28% of the tumour tissue, compared to 82% in healthy tissue. The reduction in drug and oxygen overlap is due to the altered red blood cell dynamics through the abnormal microvasculature, and indicates that drug transport to tumours should not be considered independently of oxygen transport in cases where the drug requires oxygen to function.

                Background Fluoride-releasing adhesives in orthodontics help protect enamel. The study compared the fluoride release, recharge, and re-release properties of three light-cure orthodontic bonding adhesives: Group A: TransbondTM Plus Color Change, Group B: Waldent Orthobond LC, and Group C: Koden EZ Bond. Methods The study conducted an in-vitro investigation using 24 maxillary first premolar teeth bonded with one of three fluoride-releasing adhesives after etching. Each sample was placed in artificial saliva, and fluoride release was measured over 60 days using a fluoride electrode. After initial release measurement, specimens were soaked in 1000 ppm fluoride solution for 5 minutes, rinsed, and placed in new containers with distilled water before re-release measurements. Statistical Analysis: One-way ANOVA and Repeated Measures ANOVA tests were used to determine significance, with the Bonferroni posthoc test for further analysis. Results The fluoride release rate decreased gradually over time for all three groups. The highest fluoride release occurred on Day 1 for all three bonding agents, with a significantly reduced fluoride release by Day 2. Group A exhibited consistent and highest overall fluoride release throughout the 60 days. Group B gradually declined to release fluoride until Day 7, releasing the least fluoride throughout the study. Group C had a higher fluoride release on Day 1 and Day 2 but slowly declined until Day 14. Group B and Group C sharply declined fluoride release by Day 30 and almost negligible amounts on Day 60. All three agents noted enhanced fluoride release post-recharge, with continuous release until day 14. Greater release on days 7 and 14 compared to the initial release in all three groups. Conclusion Transbond Plus Color Change: Consistent high fluoride was released initially and post-recharge. Waldent Orthobond LC: Lower release throughout the study. Koden EZ Bond: High initial release and post-recharge but continuing to decrease until Day 14.

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Memories are stored in a sparse population of neurons active at the time of an event, an engram ensemble, and reactivation of the engram ensemble drives memory recall. Although the amygdala is essential for fear memory encoding and recall, the precise spatial organization of engram neurons within amygdala nuclei remains an outstanding question. We hypothesized that the geometric architecture of an engram ensemble reflects its underlying function, thereby revealing novel organizational principles of memory coding. Using tissue clearing and light-sheet imaging, we mapped Arc-expressing neurons across the entire mouse amygdala in 3D to examine the spatial architecture of engram ensembles for aversive (shock) and valence-neutral (no shock) contextual memories during encoding and recall. At the meso-scale level, we identified distinct spatial “hotspots” of engram neuron density during that were differentially engaged during fear conditioning and fear memory retrieval across multiple amygdala nuclei. Notably, we also found shared spatial features during the retrieval of aversive and non-aversive contextual memories. At the micro-scale level, unsupervised clustering analyses showed that aversive learning and recall was associated with increased clustering of active neurons in the lateral (LA) and basal (BA) nuclei, and selectively in the central capsular nucleus (CeC) during aversive encoding. Network graphs derived from the spatial organization of active neurons revealed highly clustered and assortative local graph structures across conditions. Assortativity increased in the CeC during aversive learning, and hub nodes increased in the LA during aversive learning and recall, and in the CeC during aversive learning. Together, these results suggest that both meso- and micro-scale spatial signatures of neuronal activity differ across amygdala subregions and vary with memory valence and stage. Such structure may shape information flow through amygdala circuits, enhancing signal-to-noise and improving the fidelity of memory encoding and retrieval.</p>

                Background The development of social-cognitive skills is increasingly important in STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics) learning at the elementary school level. Immersive Metaverse Learning Environments (IMLEs) offer students the opportunity to learn in interactive virtual spaces, but research on their integration into STEAM learning remains limited, particularly in enhancing cognitive, social, and collaborative aspects. Purpose This study aims to test the effectiveness of using IMLE technology in improving social-cognitive skills in STEAM learning in elementary schools. Design/Methodology/Approach This study employed a mixed-methods design, combining quantitative and qualitative approaches. Quantitative data were used to assess the effectiveness of IMLE in improving social-cognitive skills, while qualitative data explored student and teacher experiences through observations, interviews, and analysis of classroom learning activities. The study subjects included 50 elementary school students in Surabaya, Indonesia. Results The study findings showed significant improvements in students’ social-cognitive skills, including collaboration, problem-solving, empathy, communication, and learning motivation. Furthermore, the use of IMLE contributed to improved STEAM learning outcomes and enriched learning interactions. Originality/Value Research on the integration of IMLE into STEAM learning in elementary schools is still rare, both in Indonesia and globally. This study demonstrates that IMLE effectively supports the development of social-cognitive skills while encouraging innovation in immersive technology-based learning practices. These findings provide valuable contributions to teachers in adopting interactive, student-centered learning media.

                Background Enterobacter cloacae is considered an important hospital-acquired pathogen associated with bloodstream, respiratory, and wound infections. Its increasing ability to acquire multidrug-resistant (MDR) traits poses a serious challenge for both infection control and therapeutic management. This study aimed to determine the antimicrobial resistance profiles, prevalence of MDR, and associated clinical risk factors of E. cloacae isolated from hospitalized patients. Methods Four hundred clinical specimens such as blood, pus, and sputum were collected between July 2024 and July 2025 from hospitalized patients suspected to have a bacterial infection. Risk-factor data were obtained through medical record review. Manual and automated identification with antimicrobial susceptibility testing were performed using the BD Phoenix™ automated microbiology system. Results Most infected patients with E. cloacae were male (64%) and aged 60 years or older (56%). Significant risk factors associated with MDR E. cloacae infections included prior antibiotic exposure (p = 0.008), hospitalization longer than 10 days (p = 0.021), and ICU admission (p = 0.034). All isolates (100%) were resistant to ampicillin, amoxicillin–clavulanate, cefazolin, and cefuroxime. Third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins (ceftazidime 70%, cefepime 70%, ceftriaxone 64%), along with ciprofloxacin (44%), levofloxacin (44%), and tigecycline (50%), showed high resistance rates, indicating reduced activity of major antibiotic classes. Imipenem resistance was detected in 34% of isolates, while amikacin (10%), meropenem (10%), and ertapenem (10%) retained good activity. Ceftolozane–tazobactam remained fully effective (100% susceptibility). The overall prevalence of MDR was 86%. Conclusion A high prevalence of MDR E. cloacae was identified among hospitalized patients, with strong associations to ICU stay, prolonged hospitalization, and prior antibiotic use. Despite widespread resistance to β-lactams and fluoroquinolones, ceftolozane–tazobactam, amikacin, meropenem, and ertapenem remain effective therapeutic options. The findings emphasize the importance of strengthening local antimicrobial stewardship programs and establishing region-specific surveillance data to guide empirical treatment and support infection-prevention strategies.

                Background One of the disadvantages of the multilayer perception (MLP), which is a machine learning (ML) algorithm used in various fields, includes the uncontrollable growth of the number of total parameters, which may make MLP redundant in such high dimensions, and the uncontrollable growing stack of layers that ignores spatial information. Optimization algorithms were developed to determine the optimum number of parameters for MLP. Methods In this paper, the performances of the Genetic Algorithm (GA), Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm (GOA), and Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) are compared. The study also sought to determine the impact of sample size variations on these optimization algorithms. A dataset on the direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution from the UCI Machine Learning Repository with a sample size of 4 521 was used. Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) was applied to balance the binary dependent variables for the training data across various sample sizes. Results Based on the classification accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, precision, F-score, and execution time, the MLP based on CMA-ES (CMA-ES-MLP) was identified as the best classifier overall, as it maintained high rates of these classification metrics and was the second fastest to train. CMA-ES-MLP with a training sample of 5 114 was our ideal classifier, and it competes well with the classifiers that have been built by previous studies that used the same dataset. Conclusions The study found no consistent increase or decrease in the classification performance of the algorithms as the sample size increased, and the metrics fluctuated rapidly across sample sizes. It is recommended that future studies be conducted to compare the best-performing classifiers identified in previous studies with the CMA-ES-MLP in this study under the same experimental conditions.

                Background The diagnosis of immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) relies on clinical manifestations, as no definitive gold standard exists. Serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is emerging as a potential biomarker for diagnosing severe ITP. We evaluated the diagnostic utility of LDH and its correlation with clinical severity in ITP patients. Methods This prospective observational study included 62 patients diagnosed with primary or secondary ITP. Baseline demographic and clinical data were collected, and serum LDH along with platelets were analyzed at recruitment. The diagnostic utility of serum LDH in distinguishing severe from non-severe ITP was evaluated. Results A total of 62 patients with ITP were studied, 64.5% had severe thrombocytopenia and 35.4% had non-severe thrombocytopenia. The median serum LDH level was significantly higher in severe ITP (276 [216–307]) compared to non-severe ITP (209 [184–275]), p=0.03. LDH showed a negative correlation with platelet count (ρ = -0.817, p = 0.01) and plateletcrit (p = -0.26, p = 0.03), while no correlation was observed with MPV. The cut-off value of LDH was 234U/L, with a specificity of 62.5% and sensitivity of 63.6%, respectively for diagnosing severe thrombocytopenia. Conclusion There was a significant elevation of serum LDH levels in patients with severe ITP compared to non-severe ITP.

The platform supports a wide range of data analysis as well as the ability to safely store and access data in compliance with NIH policies. The purpose of this study is to better understand the current user base of the AnVIL platform. Methods We conducted the AnVIL Community Poll to collect baseline information, identify development opportunities, guide the prioritization of user support strategies, and succinctly but comprehensively describe the current AnVIL Community. The poll was shared through social media and relevant mailing lists. Respondents were categorized as potential or returning users depending on their usage description. Results Our sample of the AnVIL community found opportunities for platform adoption beyond the current user base and identified areas where training should be enhanced, training preferences, and user computational needs. Specifically, while most respondents were involved in human genomics research, there may be potential for growth in adoption of the platform by prioritizing materials to support clinical researchers. All respondents felt availability of specific tools or datasets was a key feature of the platform. The broader community may also benefit from further development or showcasing of resources to facilitate cost management, finding and incorporating analysis tools, and data import. Our sample greatly preferred virtual training opportunities and returning users of the platform foresaw needing large amounts of storage. Conclusion This poll provided an insightful snapshot of the current state of the AnVIL and demonstrated areas where the AnVIL Team can take specific steps to address barriers related to platform adoption and further support the existing and varied AnVIL Community. This work can be built upon through user interviews, community discussion, and coordinating a recurring poll.

                Background A standby system is defined as a system consisting of several components, where only one component operates at a time while the others remain in standby mode. The system fails when the applied stress exceeds the strength of the active component, at which point one of the standby components is activated. It is assumed that the inactive components do not undergo any change in their properties while in standby mode, and the system is considered to have failed when all its components have failed. Methods In this study, a mathematical formula of the standby system was derived for more than one component. Y is subject to independent random variable Ψ with Distribution of stress, which is considered a combination of two exponentials and the stress. It follows the following distributions: one-parameter exponential, two-parameter exponential, one parameter Lindley, and two-parameter generalized exponential. Hence, the dependent functions of the standby system are found { R ( 1 ) , R ( 2 ) , R ( 3 ) , R ( 4 ) , R 4 } depending on the mathematical formulas derived for each of the four distributions mentioned above. Results In this section, we will obtain the stress-strength of standby Reliability system R 4 , based on four different distributions the above mentioned, the standby Reliability functions R ( 2 ) for distributions are given by adding Marginal Reliability R ( 1 ) and R ( 2 ) , R ( 3 ) given by adding R ( 1 ) , R ( 2 ) and R ( 3 ) . Also R 4 given by adding R ( 1 ) , R ( 2 ) , R ( 3 ) and R ( 4 ) , and parameters estimator by maximum likelihood. Conclusions a simulation study will be conducted to see the behavior of { R ( 1 ) , R ( 2 ) , R ( 3 ) , R ( 4 ) , R 4 } of a standby system for four different distributions, in this simulation study will be conducted to see the estimator for all distributions and compare the results by using one important statistical criteria mean square error (MSE). Then results will be discussed to see which one of the estimators is the best for each one of the distributions separately.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.78117?af=R">The Phenotypic Spectrum of Sporadic Creutzfeldt‐Jakob Disease Cortical Subtype</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective of this study was to characterize the phenotypic spectrum of the rare sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease cortical subtype (sCJDMM/MV2C) in a large multicentric autopsy cohort.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We evaluated clinical histories, biofluid markers, brain diffusion-weighted (DW)-magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and electroencephalogram (EEG) findings in 56 patients. The histomolecular assessment included misfolded prion protein (PrP) typing by immunoblotting, histopathology, and PrP immunohistochemistry in several brain areas.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Misfolded PrP typing showed a dominant 19 kDa unglycosylated PrP fragment (type 2) in all brains, focally associated with a 21 kDa (type 1) fragment in 53% of participants (MM/MV2C + 1). Immunohistochemistry revealed coarse/perivacuolar PrP deposits in the neocortices and a patchy/coarse pattern in the cerebellar molecular layer. The mean disease duration was 16.0 months. At onset and early stages, most patients manifested only progressive cognitive decline, consistent with the predominant distribution and relative severity of spongiform change in the cerebral cortex. Brain DW-MRI showed cortical hyperintensities in 94% of cases. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) real-time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC) assay was positive in 70% of cases. Compared with pure MM/MV2C, the mixed MM/MV2C + 1 phenotype showed a shorter disease duration (14 vs 19 months), and a higher frequency of striatal DW-MRI hyperintensity (56% vs 19%), EEG periodic sharp-waves complexes (41% vs 6%), and CSF RT-QuIC positivity (86% vs 53%).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The clinicopathologic phenotype of sCJDMM/MV2C diverges from that of typical sCJDMM/MV1. Moreover, the histomolecular heterogeneity within MM/MV2C influences clinical features and results of diagnostic investigations, challenging its identification in vivo. Nonetheless, results suggest that DW-MRI and CSF RT-QuIC allow an accurate clinical diagnosis of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in most patients. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                The rapid evolution of bioinformatics and data-driven life sciences necessitates widespread, effective training solutions capable of transcending geographical and institutional boundaries. ELIXIR, as a pan-European bioinformatics research infrastructure, has strategically embraced e-learning methodologies to meet this challenge. This white paper systematically reviews the current landscape of e-learning initiatives across various ELIXIR Nodes and Communities, detailing both historical developments and contemporary practices. It identifies core attributes and desirable features of effective e-learning, presenting an analysis of diverse educational platforms and the deployment of Learning Management Systems (LMS) within ELIXIR’s framework. Emphasis is placed on the interactive, open-access, and sustainable nature of these resources, exemplified by platforms such as the Training e-Support System (TeSS) and the ELIXIR-SI eLearning Platform (EeLP). The paper highlights critical advancements toward standardization and interoperability through initiatives such as the adoption of SCORM protocols, facilitating resource reuse across Nodes. Additionally, the integration of e-learning into broader educational strategies—such as hybrid learning environments and structured learning paths—is examined. Finally, future directions are discussed, including strategies for integrating e-learning with traditional training methods, enhancing trainer expertise, and further expanding the availability and FAIRification of bioinformatics training resources.

                Abstract* Background Fresh produce is a vital vehicle for the transmission of foodborne pathogens, yet data from low- and middle-income countries on contamination levels and associated health risks remain scarce. Methods This study provided an analysis of Listeria species contamination in 208 fruit and vegetable samples from major geopolitical regions in Nigeria. Conventional microbiological techniques and molecular methods were used for the analysis. Results We reported a high prevalence (38.5%) and substantial bacterial loads (up to 8.33×102 CFU/25g) among the organically grown crops, with produce from Northern states exhibiting the highest contamination. Genetic characterisation revealed significant diversity, including novel strains and others closely related to global clones, confirming a resilient environmental presence. Importantly, antibiotic susceptibility testing uncovered alarming resistance rates to vancomycin (83.1%) and oxacillin (88.1%), with hierarchical clustering identifying distinct multidrug-resistant clusters. The presence of resistance genes (vanA, vanB, tetL, tetM) and the virulence gene hly was confirmed. A quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA), incorporating this empirical data, estimated the annual probability of illness, highlighting high-risk produce-region combinations. Conclusions These findings demonstrate that fresh produce in Nigeria is a significant reservoir of pathogenic, antimicrobial-resistant L. monocytogenes, posing a serious public health threat. This study highlights the urgent need for targeted interventions, including enhanced agricultural water safety and strengthened surveillance of antimicrobial resistance, to mitigate risks and support evidence-based food safety policies in Nigeria and similar regions.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1420/v1?src=rss">Effect of Corruption, Inequality, and Unemployment on Poverty in South African Perspective: Evidence from Quantile Regression Model. [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background introduction Corruption has emerged to the point where it is underreported but in reality, it haunts many people daily, especially in public offices. In South Africa the corruption take place in most government institutions, government administration at top level, middle and lower level of government. Corruption benefits the few and harm the majority of people living as lower income households. The economic literature has little evidence of the connection between corruption and poverty. Many studies have concentrated on the causal effect of poverty on corruption, not vice versa. Method This study extends the literature on corruption to investigate the impact of corruption on poverty from a South African perspective. Other control variables such as the Gini coefficient and unemployment were considered equally. Secondary data stretching from 2000 to 2021 were selected based on data availability it was then converted to quarterly data (poverty and corruption). The study used the quantile regression model, descriptive statistics table and data trends of the selected variables. Results The results of the quantile regression model indicate that corruption has a positive and significant effect on poverty at all quantiles (25th, 50th, and 75th). Moreover, income inequality has a positive, dominant, and significant effect on poverty at all quantiles, and unemployment equally causes poverty at all quantiles. This imply that socio-economic issues are a threat that exacerbate poverty in South Africa. Conclusion The study argues that policymakers should invest in youth development programs concerning entrepreneurship, education and support women cooperatives and small businesses to reduce the high dependency ratio of people on state services and to reduce high inequality and unemployment rates. The study was limited to investigate the causal effect that run from corruption to poverty only and not on the other way around.

                Background High-dose intravenous vitamin C (HDIVC) has gained interest as an adjunctive therapy in cancer care due to its pro-oxidative antioxidative and cytotoxic effects. Despite growing research, a comprehensive synthesis of the evidence on the efficacy and safety of HDIVC in advanced solid tumors remains limited. Materials and Methods This review will follow the six steps of the Arksey and O’Malley framework, as adapted by Levac et al, namely: identifying the research question, identifying relevant studies, study selection eligibility, charting the data, collating, summarizing and reporting the results, and consultation. PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar databases will be used for the search of articles from 2000 – 2025. Grey literature will also be conducted. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and the Meta-Analysis for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) will be used as a guide for this scoping review protocol. A two-stage screening process will be used to determine the eligibility of articles with two independent reviewers. Discrepancies will be handled by consensus or by consulting an expert in cancer care. The selection of studies for the review is anticipated to be completed within 12 weeks, from 01 October to 31 December 2025. The extracted data will be analyzed and presented in a report. Conclusion This scoping review will consolidate evidence on HDIVC for advanced solid tumors, identifying efficacy outcomes, safety profiles, and patient experiences limited to African adult populations and other global studies applicable to African settings in African populations that will inform clinical practice and guide policy making. Ethics and Dissemination Ethical approval is not required for this scoping review. However, the results of this search will be disseminated through academic presentations and publications in peer-reviewed journals.

                Ethnomedicine and ethnobotany constitute key fields for understanding how different cultures document, use, and transmit knowledge related to medicinal plants and their therapeutic applications. In recent decades, growing scientific interest has highlighted their potential contributions to healthcare systems, biodiversity conservation, and the preservation of cultural heritage. However, the integration of ethnomedicinal knowledge into modern medicine faces persistent challenges, particularly the lack of standardized documentation protocols and rigorous scientific validation. In this context, the present systematic review aims to assess the documentation, evaluation, and conservation of medicinal plants and their therapeutic applications across diverse cultural settings. A systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted following PRISMA guidelines, using Scopus, EBSCO, and Web of Science databases to identify peer-reviewed studies published between 2007 and 2024. Seventy studies met the inclusion criteria and were analyzed thematically to identify trends, methodological approaches, and research gaps. The findings reveal a wide diversity of medicinal plants and ethnomedicinal practices, with a strong emphasis on the documentation and conservation of traditional knowledge. Nevertheless, significant gaps persist in terms of phytochemical, pharmacological, and clinical validation, as well as in the integration of ethnomedicinal knowledge into conservation and public health policies. The thematic analysis underscores the need for standardized methodological frameworks and multidisciplinary approaches to strengthen the scientific validation, conservation, and intergenerational transmission of ethnomedicinal knowledge, ensuring its relevance for modern medicine and sustainable development.

                Background The aim of this study was to investigate the knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) among scuba divers in Saudi Arabia towards equipment infection control measures, protective guidelines measures and potential post COVID-19 infection complications. Methods A cross-sectional study using a pre-validated questionnaire was conducted. The questionnaire consisted of 35 close-ended questions, which covered the scuba divers’ profile and experience, the KAP of COVID-19 precautionary measures during diving activities as well as the demographic data and background of the scuba divers. KAP scores were subjected to non-parametric tests of statistical significance (Mann Whitney and Kruskal Wallis test). Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. Results Most of the 461 participants’ answers were in agreeance on the proper KAP of infection control during the COVID-19 pandemic. There was a statistically significant difference in attitude between all the demographic and professional variables (p<0.05) except for gender and region of residence (p>0.05). In addition, there was a statistically significant practice difference among age groups, education levels, and employee status in the diving center (p<0.05). Conclusions Our findings showed that scuba divers presented a good level of KAP of infection control measures against the spread of the coronavirus disease. Local officials and diving organizations need to continue their efforts in combating and control the spread of this pandemic.

<p>(A) Macroscopic connectome gradients were constructed for AD patients. (B) Gradient metrics, including gradient eccentricity and network median distance, were computed. The association between gradient values and rich-club organization was also investigated. Ultimately, we observed that the compression of cortical hierarchies in AD patients impacts cognitive function, potentially serving as a neuroimaging biomarker.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>This investigation centered on Alzheimer's disease (AD), a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by memory impairment and cognitive decline. Functional connectome gradient analysis was utilized to investigate alterations in the hierarchical architecture of brain networks in AD. The study cohort consisted of 222 subjects, encompassing 111 AD patients and 111 normal controls (NC). Connectome gradients were computed via a dimensionality reduction technique based on diffusion map embedding and analyzed at both the region of interest (ROI) and network levels. Additional connectome gradient metrics, including network median distance and gradient eccentricity, were calculated, and the relationship between connectome gradients and rich-club organization was assessed. These connectome gradient values were subsequently correlated with clinical cognitive scores. The results demonstrated a significant reduction in the principal gradient range in AD patients. At the network level, gradient values exhibited an increase in the somatomotor (SMN) and visual networks (VIS), while decreasing in the default mode (DMN) and frontoparietal networks (FPN) relative to controls. Analyzes of network mean distance and gradient eccentricity further revealed compression of the brain cortical hierarchy in AD patients. Furthermore, rich-club analyzes indicated a reduction in the gradient value difference between hub and peripheral nodes in AD patients. Finally, clinical correlation analysis revealed a positive correlation between the degree of cognitive impairment and the degree of compression of the brain cortical hierarchy. These findings provide a novel perspective on the study of brain network organization in AD patients, contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying Alzheimer's disease.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98117">Human EEG and artificial neural networks reveal disentangled representations and processing timelines of object real-world size and depth in natural images</a></h4>

              
                Remarkably, human brains have the ability to accurately perceive and process the real-world size of objects, despite vast differences in distance and perspective. While previous studies have delved into this phenomenon, distinguishing the processing of real-world size from other visual properties, like depth, has been challenging. Using the THINGS EEG2 dataset with human EEG recordings and more ecologically valid naturalistic stimuli, our study combines human EEG and representational similarity analysis to disentangle neural representations of object real-world size from retinal size and perceived depth, leveraging recent datasets and modeling approaches to address challenges not fully resolved in previous work. We report a representational timeline of visual object processing: object real-world depth processed first, then retinal size, and finally, real-world size. Additionally, we input both these naturalistic images and object-only images without natural background into artificial neural networks. Consistent with the human EEG findings, we also successfully disentangled representation of object real-world size from retinal size and real-world depth in all three types of artificial neural networks (visual-only ResNet, visual-language CLIP, and language-only Word2Vec). Moreover, our multi-modal representational comparison framework across human EEG and artificial neural networks reveals real-world size as a stable and higher-level dimension in object space incorporating both visual and semantic information. Our research provides a temporally resolved characterization of how certain key object properties – such as object real-world size, depth, and retinal size – are represented in the brain, which offers further advances and insights into our understanding of object space and the construction of more brain-like visual models.
