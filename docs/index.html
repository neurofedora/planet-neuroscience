              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19128">The Fragility of the Reverse Facilitation Effect in the Stroop Task: A Dynamic Neurocognitive Model</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2503.19128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In typical Stroop experiments, participants perform better when the colors and words are congruent compared to when they are incongruent or neutral. Paradoxically, in some experimental conditions, neutral trials are faster than congruent trials. This phenomenon is known as Reverse Facilitation Effect (RFE). However, RFE has not been consistently replicated, leading to the so-called fragile results. There are some models that capture this effect, but they are not parsimonious. Here we employed our previous model of priming effect, without its conflict monitoring module, to demonstrate that RFE, including its fragility, is mainly due to attentional dynamics with limited resources. The simulations of the RFE resulted from weak attentional activation for neutral stimuli (e.g., non-color or nonword strings) that causes less attentional refraction for the target stimuli (e.g., font colors). The refractory period or attenuation of attention usually happens when meaningful stimuli (color name primes) are used along font color targets. This simpler model provides a straightforward understanding of the underlying processes.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19823">GyralNet Subnetwork Partitioning via Differentiable Spectral Modularity Optimization</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2503.19823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the structural and functional organization of the human brain requires a detailed examination of cortical folding patterns, among which the three-hinge gyrus (3HG) has been identified as a key structural landmark. GyralNet, a network representation of cortical folding, models 3HGs as nodes and gyral crests as edges, highlighting their role as critical hubs in cortico-cortical connectivity. However, existing methods for analyzing 3HGs face significant challenges, including the sub-voxel scale of 3HGs at typical neuroimaging resolutions, the computational complexity of establishing cross-subject correspondences, and the oversimplification of treating 3HGs as independent nodes without considering their community-level relationships. To address these limitations, we propose a fully differentiable subnetwork partitioning framework that employs a spectral modularity maximization optimization strategy to modularize the organization of 3HGs within GyralNet. By incorporating topological structural similarity and DTI-derived connectivity patterns as attribute features, our approach provides a biologically meaningful representation of cortical organization. Extensive experiments on the Human Connectome Project (HCP) dataset demonstrate that our method effectively partitions GyralNet at the individual level while preserving the community-level consistency of 3HGs across subjects, offering a robust foundation for understanding brain connectivity.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19107">Information-Seeking Decision Strategies Mitigate Risk in Dynamic, Uncertain Environments</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2503.19107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To survive in dynamic and uncertain environments, individuals must develop effective decision strategies that balance information gathering and decision commitment. Models of such strategies often prioritize either optimizing tangible payoffs, like reward rate, or gathering information to support a diversity of (possibly unknown) objectives. However, our understanding of the relative merits of these two approaches remains incomplete, in part because direct comparisons have been limited to idealized, static environments that lack the dynamic complexity of the real world. Here we compared the performance of normative reward- and information-seeking strategies in a dynamic foraging task. Both strategies show similar transitions between exploratory and exploitative behaviors as environmental uncertainty changes. However, we find subtle disparities in the actions they take, resulting in meaningful performance differences: whereas reward-seeking strategies generate slightly more reward on average, information-seeking strategies provide more consistent and predictable outcomes. Our findings support the adaptive value of information-seeking behaviors that can mitigate risk with minimal reward loss.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19586">Distinct social-linguistic processing between humans and large audio-language models: Evidence from model-brain alignment</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2503.19586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Voice-based AI development faces unique challenges in processing both linguistic and paralinguistic information. This study compares how large audio-language models (LALMs) and humans integrate speaker characteristics during speech comprehension, asking whether LALMs process speaker-contextualized language in ways that parallel human cognitive mechanisms. We compared two LALMs' (Qwen2-Audio and Ultravox 0.5) processing patterns with human EEG responses. Using surprisal and entropy metrics from the models, we analyzed their sensitivity to speaker-content incongruency across social stereotype violations (e.g., a man claiming to regularly get manicures) and biological knowledge violations (e.g., a man claiming to be pregnant). Results revealed that Qwen2-Audio exhibited increased surprisal for speaker-incongruent content and its surprisal values significantly predicted human N400 responses, while Ultravox 0.5 showed limited sensitivity to speaker characteristics. Importantly, neither model replicated the human-like processing distinction between social violations (eliciting N400 effects) and biological violations (eliciting P600 effects). These findings reveal both the potential and limitations of current LALMs in processing speaker-contextualized language, and suggest differences in social-linguistic processing mechanisms between humans and LALMs.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02659">Reanimating Images using Neural Representations of Dynamic Stimuli</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2406.02659v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While computer vision models have made incredible strides in static image recognition, they still do not match human performance in tasks that require the understanding of complex, dynamic motion. This is notably true for real-world scenarios where embodied agents face complex and motion-rich environments. Our approach, BrainNRDS (Brain-Neural Representations of Dynamic Stimuli), leverages state-of-the-art video diffusion models to decouple static image representation from motion generation, enabling us to utilize fMRI brain activity for a deeper understanding of human responses to dynamic visual stimuli. Conversely, we also demonstrate that information about the brain's representation of motion can enhance the prediction of optical flow in artificial systems. Our novel approach leads to four main findings: (1) Visual motion, represented as fine-grained, object-level resolution optical flow, can be decoded from brain activity generated by participants viewing video stimuli; (2) Video encoders outperform image-based models in predicting video-driven brain activity; (3) Brain-decoded motion signals enable realistic video reanimation based only on the initial frame of the video; and (4) We extend prior work to achieve full video decoding from video-driven brain activity. BrainNRDS advances our understanding of how the brain represents spatial and temporal information in dynamic visual scenes. Our findings demonstrate the potential of combining brain imaging with video diffusion models for developing more robust and biologically-inspired computer vision systems. We show additional decoding and encoding examples on this site: https://brain-nrds.github.io/.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05493">Multi-Site rs-fMRI Domain Alignment for Autism Spectrum Disorder Auxiliary Diagnosis Based on Hyperbolic Space</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.05493v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Increasing the volume of training data can enable the auxiliary diagnostic algorithms for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) to learn more accurate and stable models. However, due to the significant heterogeneity and domain shift in rs-fMRI data across different sites, the accuracy of auxiliary diagnosis remains unsatisfactory. Moreover, there has been limited exploration of multi-source domain adaptation models on ASD recognition, and the interpretability of models is often poor. To address these challenges, we proposed a domain-adaptive algorithm based on hyperbolic space embedding. Hyperbolic space is naturally suited for representing the topology of complex networks such as brain functional networks. Therefore, we embedded the brain functional network into hyperbolic space and constructed the corresponding hyperbolic space community network to effectively extract latent representations. To address the heterogeneity of data across different sites and the issue of domain shift, we introduce a constraint loss function, Hyperbolic Maximum Mean Discrepancy (HMMD), to align the marginal distributions in the hyperbolic space. Additionally, we employ class prototype alignment to to mitigate discrepancies in conditional distributions across domains. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed algorithm shows superior classification performance for ASD compared with baseline models, and is more robust to multi-site heterogeneity.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17546">Communities in the Kuramoto Model: Dynamics and Detection via Path Signatures</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2503.17546v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The behavior of multivariate dynamical processes is often governed by underlying structural connections that relate the components of the system. For example, brain activity which is often measured via time series is determined by an underlying structural graph, where nodes represent neurons or brain regions and edges represent cortical connectivity. Existing methods for inferring structural connections from observed dynamics, such as correlation-based or spectral techniques, may fail to fully capture complex relationships in high-dimensional time series in an interpretable way. Here, we propose the use of path signatures a mathematical framework that encodes geometric and temporal properties of continuous paths to address this problem. Path signatures provide a reparametrization-invariant characterization of dynamical data and, in particular, can be used to compute the lead matrix which reveals lead-lag phenomena. We showcase our approach on time series from coupled oscillators in the Kuramoto model defined on a stochastic block model graph, termed the Kuramoto stochastic block model (KSBM). Using mean-field theory and Gaussian approximations, we analytically derive reduced models of KSBM dynamics in different temporal regimes and theoretically characterize the lead matrix in these settings. Leveraging these insights, we propose a novel signature-based community detection algorithm, achieving exact recovery of structural communities from observed time series in multiple KSBM instances. Our results demonstrate that path signatures provide a novel perspective on analyzing complex neural data and other high-dimensional systems, explicitly exploiting temporal functional relationships to infer underlying structure.

Abstract: We present an approach to identify and track the evolution of niches in XCS that can be applied to any XCS model and any problem. It exploits the underlying principles of the evolutionary component of XCS, and therefore, it is independent of the representation used. It also employs information already available in XCS and thus requires minimal modifications to an existing XCS implementation. We present experiments on binary single-step and multi-step problems involving non-overlapping and highly overlapping solutions. We show that our approach can identify and evaluate the number of niches in the population; it also show that it can be used to identify the composition of active niches to as to track their evolution over time, allowing for a more in-depth analysis of XCS behavior.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19043">Enhancing Symbolic Regression with Quality-Diversity and Physics-Inspired Constraints</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2503.19043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents QDSR, an advanced symbolic Regression (SR) system that integrates genetic programming (GP), a quality-diversity (QD) algorithm, and a dimensional analysis (DA) engine. Our method focuses on exact symbolic recovery of known expressions from datasets, with a particular emphasis on the Feynman-AI benchmark. On this widely used collection of 117 physics equations, QDSR achieves an exact recovery rate of 91.6~$\%$, surpassing all previous SR methods by over 20 percentage points. Our method also exhibits strong robustness to noise. Beyond QD and DA, this high success rate results from a profitable trade-off between vocabulary expressiveness and search space size: we show that significantly expanding the vocabulary with precomputed meaningful variables (e.g., dimensionless combinations and well-chosen scalar products) often reduces equation complexity, ultimately leading to better performance. Ablation studies will also show that QD alone already outperforms the state-of-the-art. This suggests that a simple integration of QD, by projecting individuals onto a QD grid, can significantly boost performance in existing algorithms, without requiring major system overhauls.

                arXiv:2503.19166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, there has been growing interest within the theoretical community in analytically studying multi-objective evolutionary algorithms. This runtime analysis-focused research can help formally understand algorithm behaviour, explain empirical observations, and provide theoretical insights to support algorithm development and exploration. However, the test problems commonly used in the theoretical analysis are predominantly limited to problems with heavy ``artificial'' characteristics (e.g., symmetric objectives and linear Pareto fronts), which may not be able to well represent realistic scenarios. In this paper, we survey commonly used multi-objective functions in the theory domain and systematically review their features, limitations and implications to practical use. Moreover, we present several new functions with more realistic features, such as local optimality and nonlinearity of the Pareto front, through simply mixing and matching classical single-objective functions in the area (e.g., LeadingOnes, Jump and RoyalRoad). We hope these functions can enrich the existing test problem suites, and strengthen the connection between theoretic and practical research.

                arXiv:2503.19585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The phenomenon of emergence of swarm intelligence exists widely in nature and human society. People have been exploring the root cause of emergence of swarm intelligence and trying to establish general theories and models for emergence of swarm intelligence. However, the existing theories or models do not grasp the essence of swarm intelligence, so they lack generality and are difficult to explain various phenomena of emergence of swarm intelligence. In this paper, a contradiction-centered model for the emergence of swarm intelligence is proposed, in which the internal contradictions of individuals determine their behavior and properties, individuals are related and interact within the swarm because of competing and occupying environmental resources, interactions and swarm potential affect the internal contradictions of individuals and their distribution in the swarm, and the swarm intelligence is manifested as the specific distribution of individual contradictions. This model completely explains the conditions, dynamics, pathways, formations and processes of the emergence of swarm intelligence. In order to verify the validity of this model, several swarm intelligence systems are implemented and analyzed in this paper. The experimental results show that the model has good generality and can be used to describe the emergence of various swarm intelligence.

                arXiv:2503.19742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study how large language models can be used in combination with evolutionary computation techniques to automatically discover optimization algorithms for the design of photonic structures. Building on the Large Language Model Evolutionary Algorithm (LLaMEA) framework, we introduce structured prompt engineering tailored to multilayer photonic problems such as Bragg mirror, ellipsometry inverse analysis, and solar cell antireflection coatings. We systematically explore multiple evolutionary strategies, including (1+1), (1+5), (2+10), and others, to balance exploration and exploitation. Our experiments show that LLM-generated algorithms, generated using small-scale problem instances, can match or surpass established methods like quasi-oppositional differential evolution on large-scale realistic real-world problem instances. Notably, LLaMEA's self-debugging mutation loop, augmented by automatically extracted problem-specific insights, achieves strong anytime performance and reliable convergence across diverse problem scales. This work demonstrates the feasibility of domain-focused LLM prompts and evolutionary approaches in solving optical design tasks, paving the way for rapid, automated photonic inverse design.

                arXiv:2503.19885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the dynamics of structured complex-valued Hopfield neural networks (CvHNNs), which arise when the synaptic weight matrix possesses specific structural properties. We begin by analyzing CvHNNs with a Hermitian synaptic weight matrix and establish the existence of four-cycle dynamics in CvHNNs with skew-Hermitian weight matrices operating synchronously. Furthermore, we introduce two new classes of complex-valued matrices: braided Hermitian and braided skew-Hermitian matrices. We demonstrate that CvHNNs utilizing these matrix types exhibit cycles of length eight when operating in full parallel update mode. Finally, we conduct extensive computational experiments on synchronous CvHNNs, exploring other synaptic weight matrix structures. The findings provide a comprehensive overview of the dynamics of structured CvHNNs, offering insights that may contribute to developing improved associative memory models when integrated with suitable learning rules.

Abstract: Can machine learning algorithms be implemented using chemical reaction networks? We demonstrate that this is possible in the case of support vector machines (SVMs). SVMs are powerful tools for data classification, leveraging VC theory to handle high-dimensional data and small datasets effectively. In this work, we propose a reaction network scheme for implementing SVMs, utilizing the steady-state behavior of reaction network dynamics to model key computational aspects of SVMs. This approach introduces a novel biochemical framework for implementing machine learning algorithms in non-traditional computational environments.

Abstract: The study of sound propagation in a uniform duct having a mean flow has many applications, such as in the design of gas turbines, heating, ventilation and air conditioning ducts, automotive intake and exhaust systems, and in the modeling of speech. In this paper, the convective effects of the mean flow on the plane wave acoustic field inside a uniform duct were studied using artificial neural networks. The governing differential equation and the associated boundary conditions form a constrained optimization problem. It is converted to an unconstrained optimization problem and solved by approximating the acoustic field variable to a neural network. The complex-valued acoustic pressure and particle velocity were predicted at different frequencies, and validated against the analytical solution and the finite element models. The effect of the mean flow is studied in terms of the acoustic impedance. A closed-form expression that describes the influence of various factors on the acoustic field is derived.

                arXiv:2503.19815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intelligent organisms can solve truly novel problems which they have never encountered before, either in their lifetime or their evolution. An important component of this capacity is the ability to ``think'', that is, to mentally manipulate objects, concepts and behaviors in order to plan and evaluate possible solutions to novel problems, even without environment interaction. To generate problems that are truly qualitatively novel, while still solvable zero-shot (by mental simulation), we use the combinatorial nature of environments: we train the agent while withholding a specific combination of the environment's elements. The novel test task, based on this combination, is thus guaranteed to be truly novel, while still mentally simulable since the agent has been exposed to each individual element (and their pairwise interactions) during training. We propose a method to train agents endowed with world models to make use their mental simulation abilities, by selecting tasks based on the difference between the agent's pre-thinking and post-thinking performance. When tested on the novel, withheld problem, the resulting agent successfully simulated alternative scenarios and used the resulting information to guide its behavior in the actual environment, solving the novel task in a single real-environment trial (zero-shot).

                arXiv:2210.01892v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Individual neurons in neural networks often represent a mixture of unrelated features. This phenomenon, called polysemanticity, can make interpreting neural networks more difficult and so we aim to understand its causes. We propose doing so through the lens of feature \emph{capacity}, which is the fractional dimension each feature consumes in the embedding space. We show that in a toy model the optimal capacity allocation tends to monosemantically represent the most important features, polysemantically represent less important features (in proportion to their impact on the loss), and entirely ignore the least important features. Polysemanticity is more prevalent when the inputs have higher kurtosis or sparsity and more prevalent in some architectures than others. Given an optimal allocation of capacity, we go on to study the geometry of the embedding space. We find a block-semi-orthogonal structure, with differing block sizes in different models, highlighting the impact of model architecture on the interpretability of its neurons.

Abstract: This paper introduces an innovative approach to boost the efficiency and scalability of Evolutionary Rule-based machine Learning (ERL), a key technique in explainable AI. While traditional ERL systems can distribute processes across multiple CPUs, fitness evaluation of candidate rules is a bottleneck, especially with large datasets. The method proposed in this paper, AERL (Accelerated ERL) solves this problem in two ways. First, by adopting GPU-optimized rule sets through a tensorized representation within the PyTorch framework, AERL mitigates the bottleneck and accelerates fitness evaluation significantly. Second, AERL takes further advantage of the GPUs by fine-tuning the rule coefficients via back-propagation, thereby improving search space exploration. Experimental evidence confirms that AERL search is faster and more effective, thus empowering explainable artificial intelligence.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) deliver impressive performance but require large amounts of energy. In this work, we present a MatMul-free LLM architecture adapted for Intel's neuromorphic processor, Loihi 2. Our approach leverages Loihi 2's support for low-precision, event-driven computation and stateful processing. Our hardware-aware quantized model on GPU demonstrates that a 370M parameter MatMul-free model can be quantized with no accuracy loss. Based on preliminary results, we report up to 3x higher throughput with 2x less energy, compared to transformer-based LLMs on an edge GPU, with significantly better scaling. Further hardware optimizations will increase throughput and decrease energy consumption. These results show the potential of neuromorphic hardware for efficient inference and pave the way for efficient reasoning models capable of generating complex, long-form text rapidly and cost-effectively.

Abstract: Understanding the mechanisms underlying deep neural networks in computer vision remains a fundamental challenge. While many previous approaches have focused on visualizing intermediate representations within deep neural networks, particularly convolutional neural networks, these techniques have yet to be thoroughly explored in transformer-based vision models. In this study, we apply a modular approach of training inverse models to reconstruct input images from intermediate layers within a Detection Transformer and a Vision Transformer, showing that this approach is efficient and feasible. Through qualitative and quantitative evaluations of reconstructed images, we generate insights into the underlying mechanisms of these architectures, highlighting their similarities and differences in terms of contextual shape and preservation of image details, inter-layer correlation, and robustness to color perturbations. Our analysis illustrates how these properties emerge within the models, contributing to a deeper understanding of transformer-based vision models. The code for reproducing our experiments is available at github.com/wiskott-lab/inverse-tvm.

This study aimed to identify shared and distinct social cognition–related functional alterations across clinical high-risk, genetic high-risk, and first episode of psychosis groups, shedding light on varying risk levels for first episode of psychosis development. Meta-analyses were performed on 38 whole-brain task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging studies (12 clinical high risk, 15 genetic high risk, 11 first episode of psychosis) using Seed-based d Mapping. Function abnormalities were assessed within each patient group, with quantitative comparisons made against controls. Clinical high-risk and genetic high-risk individuals showed neither shared nor distinct abnormal brain activation during social cognition tasks. A shared cluster of increased activation in the right anterior cingulate cortex was observed between genetic high-risk and first episode of psychosis groups. However, no conjunction or disjunction results were found between clinical high-risk and first episode of psychosis groups. Meta-regression analyses revealed accelerated age-related greater activation decline in the left insula in individuals with clinical high risk. In conclusion, the absence of shared social cognition–related brain activation between clinical high risk and genetic high risk may signify differences in neural correlates underlying social cognition deficits between these groups and they follow distinct neural pathways toward first episode of psychosis. The shared abnormal anterior cingulate cortex activation in genetic high risk and first episode of psychosis may represent an endophenotype of schizophrenia.</span>

                Introduction Meningioma is the most common brain tumor in adults. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the preferred imaging modality for assessing tumor outcomes. Radiomics, an advanced imaging technique, assesses tumor heterogeneity and identifies predictive markers, offering a non-invasive alternative to biopsies. Machine learning (ML) based radiomics models enhances diagnostic and prognostic accuracy of tumors. Comprehensive review on ML-based radiomics models for predicting meningioma recurrence and survival are lacking. Hence, the aim of the study is to summarize the performance measures of ML based radiomics models in the prediction of outcomes such as progression/recurrence (P/R) and overall survival analysis of meningioma. Methods Data bases such as Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, and Embase were used to conduct a literature search in order to find pertinent original articles that concentrated on meningioma outcome prediction. PRISMA (Preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis) recommendations were used to extract data from selected studies. Results Eight articles were included in the study. MRI Radiomics-based models combined with clinical and pathological data showed strong predictive performance for meningioma recurrence. A decision tree model achieved 90% accuracy, outperforming an apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) based model (83%). A support vector machine (SVM) model reached an area under curve (AUC) of 0.80 with radiomic features, improving to 0.88 with ADC integration. A combined clinico-pathological radiomics model (CPRM) achieved an AUC of 0.88 in testing. Key predictors of recurrence include ADC values, radiomic scores, ki-67 index, and Simpson grading. For predicting overall survival analysis of meningioma, the combined clinicopathological and radiomic features achieved an AUC of 0.78. Conclusion Integrating radiomics with clinical and pathological data through ML models greatly improved the outcome prediction for meningioma. These ML models surpass conventional MRI in predicting meningioma recurrence and aggressiveness, providing crucial insights for personalized treatment and surgical planning.

                Background Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors have shown cardiorenal benefits in the general population; however, evidence regarding their efficacy and safety in kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) remains sparse. This meta-analysis seeks to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy and safety profile of SGLT-2 inhibitors specifically in the diabetes KTR population. Methods We conducted a systemic review and meta-analysis following a registered protocol in the PROSPERO (CRD42023404886). A comprehensive literature search was performed using PubMed, Cochrane, and Scopus databases up to October 23th, 2024. We included observational and clinical trials which compared SGLT-2 inhibitors with control groups in KTRs. Risk of bias was evaluated by funnel plot. We reported differences in treatment effects as risk ratios (RRs) or weighted mean difference (WMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results A total of seven studies comprising 2,713 patients were included in this analysis. SGLT-2 inhibitors were associated with a significant reduction in HbA1c levels (WMD -0.37%; 95% CI -0.73 to -0.01; p = 0.04) and BMI (WMD -0.89 kg/m2; 95% CI -1.27 to -0.50; p < 0.001). Additionally, SGLT-2 inhibitors demonstrated a beneficial effect in reducing mortality (RR 0.25; 95% CI 0.06 to 0.98; p = 0.05) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) (RR 0.41; 95% CI 0.17 to 0.98; p = 0.04). However, SGLT-2 inhibitors did not demonstrate benefit in kidney-related outcomes. Importantly, there was no significant increase in adverse events, including urinary tract infections, genital mycotic infections, urosepsis, or allograft rejection. Conclusions SGLT-2 inhibitors effectively reduced mortality, cardiovascular disease, HbA1c levels and BMI in KTRs without increasing the risk of infections or allograft rejection. However, they did not demonstrate a significant benefit in kidney-related outcomes.

                <p>Zebrafish have gained prominence as a model organism in neuroscience over the past several decades, generating key insight into the development and functioning of the vertebrate brain. However, techniques for whole-brain mapping in adult stage zebrafish are lacking. Here, we describe a pipeline built using open-source tools for whole-brain activity mapping in adult zebrafish. Our pipeline combines advances in histology, microscopy, and machine learning to capture <I>c-fos</I> activity across the entirety of the brain. Following tissue clearing, whole-brain images are captured using light-sheet microscopy and registered to the recently created adult zebrafish brain atlas (AZBA) for automated segmentation. By way of example, we used our pipeline to measure brain activity after zebrafish were subject to the novel tank test, one of the most widely used behaviors in adult zebrafish. <I>c-fos</I> levels peaked 15&nbsp;min following behavior and several regions, including those containing serotoninergic and dopaminergic neurons, were active during exploration. Finally, we generated a novel tank test functional brain network. This revealed that several regions of the subpallium form a cohesive subnetwork during exploration. Functional interconnections between the subpallium and other regions appear to be mediated primarily by ventral nucleus of the ventral telencephalon (Vv), the olfactory bulb, and the anterior part of the parvocellular preoptic nucleus (PPa). Taken together, our pipeline enables whole-brain activity mapping in adult zebrafish while providing insight into neural basis for the novel tank test.</p>

                <p>Alexander disease (AxD) is a rare neurological disorder caused by dominant gain-of-function mutations in the gene for glial fibrillary acidic protein. Expression of mutant protein results in astrocyte dysfunction that ultimately leads to developmental delay, failure to thrive, and intellectual and motor impairment. The disease is typically fatal, and at present there are no preventative or effective treatments. To gain a better understanding of the link between astrocyte dysfunction and behavioral deficits in AxD, we have recently developed a rat model that recapitulates many of the clinical features of the disease, including failure to thrive, motor impairment, and white matter deficits. In the present study, we show that both male and female AxD model rats exhibit a neurodegenerative profile with a progressive neuroinflammatory response combined with reduced expression of synaptic and mitochondrial proteins. Consistent with these results, AxD rats show reduced hippocampal long-term potentiation and are cognitively impaired, as demonstrated by poor performance in the Barnes maze and novel object recognition tests. The AxD rat provides a novel model in which to investigate the impact of astrocyte pathology on central nervous system function and provides an essential platform for further development of effective treatments for AxD and potentially other neurodegenerative diseases with astrocyte pathology.</p>

                Background Heat polymerized acrylic (HPA) resins are known to have high porosity that contributes to increased surface roughness and microcrack formation in stress areas. This facilitates the attachment and growth of polymicrobial biofilms contributing to increased antimicrobial resistance. This research aims to study avocado seeds effect on denture-plaque microorganism mono-species and polymicrobial biofilm on HPA resin. Methods This study uses 144 samples (n=144), namely HPA resin discs covered with mono-species and polymicrobial biofilms. The discs are soaked for 8 hours in the 5%, 10%, 15%, 20% avocado seed extract, positive control (alkaline peroxide), and negative control (aquadest). Each disc is shaken with a vortex mixer for 1 minute, and 100 μL is added into 96-well microplates with three times repetition and incubated for 24 hours. A microtiter plate biofilm formation assay is then conducted. The inhibition values are determined from the percentage inhibition value formula which requires absorption values from a microplate reader (595 nm). The research data are analyzed using a univariant test, and a one-way ANOVA test, accompanied by Welch ANOVA on non-homogenous data. Results In this research, it is found that the MBIC50 of avocado seed extract against the mono-species of C. albicans (5%), C. glabrata (5%), A. odontolyticus (15%), S. gordonii (15%), S. aureus (10%), while against polymicrobial was 20%. There is a significant effect of soaking HPA resin in avocado seed extract on the inhibition of mono-species and polymicrobial biofilms with a value of p<0.001 (p<0.05). Conclusion The MBIC50 of avocado seed extract in polymicrobial biofilm group is higher than that in the mono-species biofilm groups. Hence, 20% avocado seed extract is concluded as the effective concentration to inhibit denture-plaque microorganism biofilm.

                Background Platelets play a crucial role in haemostasis and have emerging functions in inflammation, particularly in respiratory infections like pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) and pneumonia. The objective of this study was to investigate alterations in platelet parameters and their relationship with erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) in PTB and pneumonia patients, comparing them to healthy controls, to evaluate their diagnostic and prognostic potential. Methods This retrospective case-control study was conducted at a tertiary care center, involving 450 participants: 158 PTB patients, 142 pneumonia patients, and 150 healthy controls. Laboratory data including platelet count, mean platelet volume (MPV), plateletcrit (PCT), platelet distribution width (PDW), and ESR were obtained from the hospital’s Laboratory Information System. Statistical analyses, including Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, were performed to determine the diagnostic efficacy of the tests. Results PTB and pneumonia patients exhibited significantly higher platelet counts and PCT, along with lower MPV compared to controls (p<0.001). In PTB patients, platelet count showed a positive correlation with PCT and ESR, and a negative correlation with MPV and PDW (p<0.001). Similar patterns were noted in pneumonia patients. ROC curve analysis identified cutoff values for platelet count (312,500/μl) and PCT (0.21%), which showed moderate sensitivity and specificity for differentiating PTB from pneumonia. ESR with a cutoff of 66.5 mm/h demonstrated comparable diagnostic performance. Conclusions Altered platelet counts and indices in PTB and pneumonia patients correlate significantly with ESR levels, suggesting their potential as non-invasive diagnostic and prognostic markers in respiratory infections. Further prospective studies are needed to validate these findings and integrate platelet indices into clinical diagnostics

                Ramadan is a month-long religious festival and observed globally by Muslims, characterised by intermittent fasting, prayer, reflection and a focus on community. Fasting is one of the five pillars of Islam and has well documented positive impacts on physical health. An article by Bandarian et al., (2021) highlighted the research gaps in Ramadan fasting studies relating to health and disease. The article called for more research studies on different health and disease conditions other than nutrition and metabolic disorders. The authors on this correspondence article continue this call and respectfully articulate the wider societal impact and benefits of Ramadan through its positive impact, through embracing multicultural, multinational and multifaith communities within the United Arab Emirates.

                Background Wrist-worn activity monitors may provide a novel cost-effective method to risk stratify patients before surgery as well as instigate and monitor both prehabilitation and rehabilitation to improve patient fitness and therefore perioperative outcomes. This may address a number of key issues facing the health of the expanding perioperative population. However, a baseline dataset using smartwatches is urgently required before interventional strategies can be robustly developed. Aims To pilot the use of wrist-worn consumer smartwatches in participants undergoing major surgery. To assess feasibility of their use and direct methodology for a future large cohort study. This will be used to assess the clinical utility of these watches in future research. Methods A UK university hospital-based, 50 participant pilot study, using Garmin Vivofit 4 smartwatches. Participants undergoing major abdominal surgery will wear watches 2 weeks prior, and 4 weeks following, their surgery. Primary outcomes will assess feasibility including; proportion of eligible patients recruited, watch wear compliance and secondary outcome data collection. Secondary outcomes will include the smartwatch data itself and assessments of postoperative outcome. Conclusion The data generated will underpin future funding applications with the aim to provide the key observational dataset required for robust integration of smartwatches into perioperative care.

                Introduction Amyloidosis is a systemic disease caused by amyloid chain deposition. The thyroid is a very uncommon location. The prevalence of amyloid goiter is estimated to be 0.17. Cases presentation We report three cases of amyloid goiter (AG). Three men, aged between 30 and 42 years, were hospitalized in the medical department. Compressive signs were present in one patient. All the patients had normal thyroid hormone levels. Fine Needle Aspiration (FNA) revealed amyloid deposition in one case. All the patients underwent total thyroidectomy. All patients underwent surgery without complications and were treated with L thyroxine replacement therapy. A pathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of AG. A literature review was conducted using PubMed from 2019 to 2024. Conclusion Amyloid deposition is rarely associated with thyroid dysfunction. The discovery circumstance is generally thyroid enlargement and may be associated with compressive signs. Compressive and rapid enlargement of the thyroid may be an indication for surgery. FNA is generally less informative than core biopsy and surgery . Thyroidectomy is a therapeutic and diagnostic procedure. Clinicians should consider amyloid deposition in front of a growing goiter, particularly when systemic amyloidosis is known.

                Background The upper airways are at potential risk for injury during thyroid surgery because of close abutment with the gland. This study aims to quantify the immediate effects of thyroid surgery on the upper airway by comparing preoperative spirometry and flow-volume loop (FVL) metrics with postoperative measurements. Methods A cohort of forty adult patients who underwent thyroid surgery at the Department of Otolaryngology, Khyber Teaching Hospital, Peshawar, Pakistan from April 2023 to April 2024, was included in this study. Pulmonary function tests, including Flow volume loop (FVL) and spirometry, were performed preoperatively and after 24 hours postoperatively. The key parameters measured included forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), the FEV1/FVC ratio, and the peak expiratory flow (PEF), along with the FVL curve. Results Preoperative FVC and FEV1 decreased in the immediate post-operative period (2.98 ± 0.75 vs 2.54 ± 0.74, p=0.001; 2.36 ± 0.63 vs 2.01 ± 0.63, p=0.003), but their ratio FEV1/FVC, showed no significant change (p= 0.089). Preoperative PEF reduced, in a similar way, post-operatively (5.14 ± 1.44 vs 3.23 ± 1.27, p=<0.01). While, Empey’s and Expiratory Disproportionate Indices (EDI) increased significantly (7.65 ± 2.16 vs 10.58 ± 2.45, p=<0.01; 49.08 ± 13.23 vs 60.93 ± 16.46, p=0.001). Regarding the FVL, a significantly higher number of patients exhibited fixed upper airway obstruction patterns in the postoperative period (19 vs 26, p=<0.01). Conclusion Thyroid surgery significantly affects pulmonary dynamics of the upper airway causing obstruction in the immediate postoperative period. Thus, postoperatively, careful respiratory monitoring is needed. Further research is required to determine the role of rehabilitative measures in mitigating these effects in post-thyroidectomy patients.

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Different tasks of episodic memory (EM) are only moderately correlated with each other. Furthermore, various EM tasks exhibit disproportional relationships with the hippocampus. This study examined the covariance structure of EM tasks and assessed whether this structure relates differently to hippocampal volume (HV) in a sample of 648 cognitively unimpaired older adults (mean age = 69.88). A confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and linear regression models were used to test the associations between the observed factors of EM and HV. A model with three first-order subfactors (immediate verbal recall, delayed verbal recall, and visuospatial) derived from a second-order EM domain factor satisfied model fit (<i>χ</i>
<sup>2</sup>
<i>p</i> value ≥ 0.05, CFI &gt; 0.90, RMSEA &lt; 0.08, SRMR &lt; 0.08). Total, left, and right HV explained a similar amount of variance in all EM subfactors. CA1, CA3, subiculum, and entorhinal cortex volume were associated with all subfactors, while CA2 and dentate gyrus volume were not associated with EM. These results suggest that EM tasks are measuring the same construct, but different complex processes contribute to EM. Furthermore, HV accounted for a small portion of the variance in EM, suggesting that HV might not be a useful marker of EM in cognitively unimpaired older adults.

     alt="Timing Matters: Lessons From Perinatal Neurogenesis in the Olfactory Bulb"/>
<p>The timing of neurogenesis influences the location of olfactory bulb interneurons. Early born granule cells populate predominately the superficial granule cell layer and external plexiform layer, whereas later born granule cells are predominately in the deeper sublayers. These different locations likely establish a foundation for differential interactions with subpopulations of olfactory bulb projection neurons.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>In the olfactory bulb (OB), odorant receptor-specific input converges into glomeruli. Subsequently, the coding of odor information is fine-tuned by local synaptic circuits within the glomeruli and the deeper external plexiform layer (EPL) in the OB. Deciphering the organization of inhibitory granule cells (GCs) in the EPL relative to the secondary dendrites of projection neurons is pivotal for understanding odor processing. We conducted a detailed investigation of GCs, focusing on the timing of neurogenesis, laminar distribution, and synaptogenesis between GCs and projection neurons. In summary, GCs develop following a developmental continuum with an outside-in maturation pattern from embryogenesis to adulthood. GCs born 1 week after birth display a unique sublayer-specific distribution pattern, marking a transition between embryonic or neonatal and adult stages. Integration into reciprocal synaptic circuits occurred 10 days post-neurogenesis. We conclude that the timing of neurogenesis dictates the anatomical configuration of GCs within the OB, which, in turn, regulates preferential synaptic integration with either mitral cell or tufted cell secondary dendrites.</p>

                Neurobehavioural disturbances such as loss of motivation have profound effects on the lives of many people living with Parkinson’s disease (PD), as well as other brain disorders. The field of decision-making neuroscience, underpinned by a plethora of work across species, provides an important framework within which to investigate apathy in clinical populations. Here we review how changes in a number of different processes underlying value-based decision making may lead to the common phenotype of apathy in PD. The application of computational models to probe both behaviour and neurophysiology show promise in elucidating these cognitive processes crucial for motivated behaviour. However, observations from the clinical management of PD demand an expanded view of this relationship, which we aim to delineate. Ultimately, effective treatment of apathy may depend on identifying the pattern in which decision making and related mechanisms have been disrupted in individuals living with PD.

                Chang et al. report that the acquisition of a mesenchymal phenotype in MITF-low melanoma cells is driven by TFE3. Melanocytic cells inhibit mesenchymal states through MITF-mediated activation of non-canonical mTORC1 signaling, leading to TFE3 degradation. Deletion of TFE3 in MITF-low melanoma cells significantly impairs cell invasion and distal lung colonization.

                Inoue et al. found that the two pre-fusion stages of mammalian fertilization, oocyte tentacle and SEAL, are regulated differently by three gamete recognition molecules and six subsequent molecules, respectively. Utilizing noncanonical phagocytosis-like SEAL, spermatozoa are engulfed by oocytes, and gamete fusion occurs, leading to the completion of fertilization.

                Mukhi et al. identify WHAMM as a kidney disease risk gene by multi-omics annotation of an eGFR GWAS locus on chromosome 15. WHAMM regulates actin dynamics and cell death pathways in kidney injury. Deletion of WHAMM or pharmacological inhibition of actin dynamics ameliorates kidney damage, highlighting WHAMM’s role in kidney disease.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92069">Aβ-driven nuclear pore complex dysfunction alters activation of necroptosis proteins in a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease</a></h4>

              
                The emergence of Aβ pathology is one of the hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), but the mechanisms and impact of Aβ in progression of the disease is unclear. The nuclear pore complex (NPC) is a multi-protein assembly in mammalian cells that regulates movement of macromolecules across the nuclear envelope; its function is shown to undergo age-dependent decline during normal aging and is also impaired in multiple neurodegenerative disorders. Yet not much is known about the impact of Aβ on NPC function in neurons. Here, we examined NPC and nucleoporin (NUP) distribution and nucleocytoplasmic transport using a mouse model of AD (<i>App<sup>NL-G-F/NL-G-F</sup></i>) that expresses Aβ in young animals. Our studies revealed that a time-dependent accumulation of intracellular Aβ corresponded with a reduction of NPCs and NUPs in the nuclear envelope which resulted in the degradation of the permeability barrier and inefficient segregation of nucleocytoplasmic proteins, and active transport. As a result of the NPC dysfunction <i>App</i> KI neurons become more vulnerable to inflammation-induced necroptosis – a programmed cell death pathway where the core components are activated via phosphorylation through nucleocytoplasmic shutting. Collectively, our data implicates Aβ in progressive impairment of nuclear pore function and further confirms that the protein complex is vulnerable to disruption in various neurodegenerative diseases and is a potential therapeutic target.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/103492">Genomic and structural insights into Jyvaskylavirus, the first giant virus isolated from Finland</a></h4>

              
                Giant viruses of protists are a diverse and likely ubiquitous group of organisms. Here, we describe Jyvaskylavirus, the first giant virus isolated from Finland. This clade B marseillevirus was found in <i>Acanthamoeba castellanii</i> from a composting soil sample in Jyväskylä, Central Finland. Its genome shares similarities with other marseilleviruses. Helium ion microscopy and electron microscopy of infected cells unraveled stages of the Jyvaskylavirus life cycle. We reconstructed the Jyvaskylavirus particle to 6.3 Å resolution using cryo-electron microscopy. The ~2500 Å diameter virion displays structural similarities to other Marseilleviridae giant viruses. The capsid comprises of 9240 copies of the major capsid protein, encoded by open reading frame (ORF) 184, which possesses a double jellyroll fold arranged in trimers forming pseudo-hexameric capsomers. Below the capsid shell, the internal membrane vesicle encloses the genome. Through cross-structural and -sequence comparisons with other Marseilleviridae using AI-based software in model building and prediction, we elucidated ORF142 as the penton protein, which plugs the 12 vertices of the capsid. Five additional ORFs were identified, with models predicted and fitted into densities that either cap the capsomers externally or stabilize them internally. The isolation of Jyvaskylavirus suggests that these viruses may be widespread in the boreal environment and provide structural insights extendable to other marseilleviruses.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97650">In vivo targeted and deterministic single-cell malignant transformation</a></h4>

              
                Why does a normal cell possibly harboring genetic mutations in oncogene or tumor suppressor genes becomes malignant and develops a tumor is a subject of intense debate. Various theories have been proposed but their experimental test has been hampered by the unpredictable and improbable malignant transformation of single cells. Here, using an optogenetic approach we permanently turn on an oncogene (KRASG12V) in a single cell of a zebrafish brain that, only in synergy with the transient co-activation of a reprogramming factor (VENTX/NANOG/OCT4), undergoes a deterministic malignant transition and robustly and reproducibly develops within 6 days into a full-blown tumor. The controlled way in which a single cell can thus be manipulated to give rise to cancer lends support to the ‘ground state theory of cancer initiation’ through ‘short-range dispersal’ of the first malignant cells preceding tumor growth.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98766">Oxidized low-density lipoprotein potentiates angiotensin II-induced Gq activation through the AT1-LOX1 receptor complex</a></h4>

              
                Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and atherosclerotic heart disease, frequently associated with dyslipidemia and hypertension, represent significant health concerns. We investigated the interplay among these conditions, focusing on the role of oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) and angiotensin II (Ang II) in renal injury via G protein αq subunit (Gq) signaling. We hypothesized that oxLDL enhances Ang II-induced Gq signaling via the AT1 (Ang II type 1 receptor)-LOX1 (lectin-like oxLDL receptor) complex. Based on CHO and renal cell model experiments, oxLDL alone did not activate Gq signaling. However, when combined with Ang II, it significantly potentiated Gq-mediated inositol phosphate 1 production and calcium influx in cells expressing both LOX-1 and AT1 but not in AT1-expressing cells. This suggests a critical synergistic interaction between oxLDL and Ang II in the AT1-LOX1 complex. Conformational studies using AT1 biosensors have indicated a unique receptor conformational change due to the oxLDL-Ang II combination. In vivo, wild-type mice fed a high-fat diet with Ang II infusion presented exacerbated renal dysfunction, whereas LOX-1 knockout mice did not, underscoring the pathophysiological relevance of the AT1-LOX1 interaction in renal damage. These findings highlight a novel mechanism of renal dysfunction in CKD driven by dyslipidemia and hypertension and suggest the therapeutic potential of AT1-LOX1 receptor complex in patients with these comorbidities.

">The Distribution of Nitric Oxide-Synthesizing Neurons and Soluble Guanylate Cyclase in the Pigeon Brain</a></h4>

              
                Nitric oxide (NO) is a diffusible neuromodulator with roles in synaptic plasticity and memory flexibility, exerting its primary effects via the enzyme soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC). Despite its well-documented functions in mammals and insects, little is known about the neuroanatomical distribution and functional relevance of NO in birds, particularly in relation to dopaminergic systems. This study used histochemical and immunohistochemical techniques to map the distribution of NO-synthesizing neurons - identified by NADPH-diaphorase (NADPH-d) and nNOS activity - and their relation to sGC and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive dopaminergic pathways in the pigeon brain. We found extensive NADPH-d labeling throughout forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain regions. Among TH-positive midbrain structures, the locus coeruleus exhibited high colocalization with nNOS, while moderate colocalization was seen in the ventral tegmental area substantia grisea centralis and substantia nigra. Notably, a significant proportion of sGC-positive neurons was targeted by TH and NADPH-d positive fibres in the pigeon NCL. Our findings support the potential for NO-dopamine interactions in avian species, reminiscent of memory-related mechanisms in Drosophila melanogaster, and contribute to an understanding of conserved pathways that may underlie flexible learning and memory processing during navigation or related tasks across vertebrates. This work also offers insight into comparative NADPH-d distribution among avian species, with implications for aging, spatial learning, and memory formation.

">Right-hemisphere frontoparietal oscillations precede conscious report of visual targets.</a></h4>

              
                What neural events precede conscious reports? Hemisphere-asymmetric frontoparietal networks are causally related to conscious perception (Bartolomeo et al., 2025; Kaufmann et al., 2024), but their spectrotemporal dynamics remain unclear. Here, we examined frontoparietal gamma oscillations occurring before a near-threshold target during the understudied pre-target period. In 67% of trials, a supra-threshold visual cue appeared near the target placeholder box (cued condition), indicating a higher probability that the target would appear at that location. In the remaining 33% of trials (uncued condition), the target appeared at the opposite location. We measured whole-brain activity using magnetoencephalography and analyzed gamma-band oscillations, coherence, and amplitude coupling with theta-phase in 16 regions of interest involved in attentional and perceptual processes (Martin-Signes et al., 2024). Results revealed that: (1) Report of cued targets was preceded by gamma-band oscillations in the right-hemisphere (RH) superior frontal gyrus, and by theta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling in the RH superior parietal region, suggesting preparatory attention. (2) Report of uncued targets was preceded by RH inferior parietal gamma oscillations and by coherence between RH superior and middle frontal regions, supporting an anticipatory lookout mechanism involved in monitoring for unexpected stimuli and rapidly redirecting attention to them. (3) Unreported targets were preceded by gamma-band oscillations in the left-hemisphere superior parietal lobe and by higher coherence in the left-hemisphere frontoparietal networks, suggesting a pre-target bias contributing to omission errors (Bartolomeo et al., 2025). These spectrotemporal signatures of attention in hemisphere-asymmetric frontoparietal networks shape predictive processing and perceptual bias, and predict conscious reports or their absence.

">Qualitative and Quantitative Comparative Analysis of Common Normal Variants and Physiological Artifacts in MEG and EEG</a></h4>

              
                Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) provide complementary insights into brain activity, yet their distinct biophysical principles influence how normal neurophysiological patterns and artifacts are represented. This study presents a comprehensive qualitative and quantitative analysis of common physiological variants and artifacts in simultaneously recorded MEG and EEG data. We systematically examined patterns such as alpha spindles, sensorimotor rhythms, sleep-related waveforms (vertex waves, K-complexes, sleep spindles, and posterior slow waves of youth), as well as common artifacts including eye blinks, chewing, and movement-related interferences. By applying time-domain, time-frequency, and source-space analyses, we identified modality-specific differences in signal representation, source localization, and artifact susceptibility. Our results demonstrate that MEG provides a more spatially focal representation of physiological patterns, whereas EEG captures broader, radially oriented cortical activity. Mutual information analysis indicated that MEG-derived independent components exhibited greater topographical variability and higher information content for neurophysiological activity, while EEG components were more homogeneous. Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) analysis confirmed that MEG gradiometers capture the highest total information, followed by magnetometers and then EEG. Notably, physiological signals such as vertex waves and K-complexes exhibited significantly higher total information in MEG, whereas EEG was more sensitive to high-amplitude artifacts, including swallowing and muscle activity. These findings highlight the distinct strengths and limitations of MEG and EEG, reinforcing the necessity of multimodal approaches in clinical and research applications to improve the accuracy of neurophysiological assessments.

">Parkinson's Paradox: Alpha-synuclein's Selective Strike on SNc Dopamine Neurons over VTA</a></h4>

              
                In synucleinopathies, including Parkinson's disease (PD), dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) exhibit greater vulnerability to degeneration than those in the ventral tegmental area (VTA). While -synuclein (Syn) pathology is implicated in nigral dopamine neuron loss, the mechanisms by which Syn affects neuronal activity and midbrain dopamine network connectivity prior to cell death remain unclear. This study tested the hypothesis that elevated Syn expression induces pathophysiological changes in firing activity and disrupts network connectivity dynamics of dopamine neurons before neuronal loss. We employed two mouse models of synucleinopathy: preformed Syn fibril (PFF) injection and AAV-mediated expression of human Syn (hSyn) under the control of the tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) promoter, both targeting the VTA and SNc. Four weeks post-injection, brain sections underwent histological, electrophysiological, and network analyses. Immunohistochemistry for TH, hSyn, and phospho-Ser129 Syn assessed Syn expression and dopaminergic neuron alterations. Neuronal viability was evaluated using two complementary approaches: quantification of TH+ or FOX3+ and TUNEL labeling. Importantly, these analyses revealed no significant changes in neuronal counts or TUNEL+ cells at this time point, confirming that subsequent functional assessments captured pre-neurodegenerative, Syn-induced alterations rather than late-stage neurodegeneration. Electrophysiological recordings revealed a differential effect of hSyn expression. SNc dopamine neurons exhibited significantly increased baseline firing rates, whereas VTA dopamine neurons remained unchanged. These findings indicate a region-specific vulnerability to Syn-induced hyperactivity of dopamine neurons. Further analysis revealed impaired homeostatic firing rate regulation in SNc, but not VTA, dopamine neurons, demonstrated by a reduced capacity to recover baseline firing following hyperpolarization. Collectively, our results demonstrate that, prior to neurodegeneration, elevated Syn expression differentially disrupts both basal firing activity and network stability of SNc dopamine neurons, while sparing VTA dopamine neurons. By identifying neurophysiological changes preceding dopaminergic neuron loss, these findings provide critical insights into the pathophysiological mechanisms predisposing SNc neurons to degeneration in Parkinson's disease.

">Dual targeting of transferrin receptor and CD98hc enhances brain exposure of large molecules</a></h4>

              
                Targeting proteins highly expressed at the blood-brain barrier, including transferrin receptor (TfR) and CD98hc, is a transformative approach enabling more effective brain delivery of biotherapeutics for treatment of neurological diseases. TfR-mediated delivery promotes rapid, high brain uptake, while CD98hc-mediated delivery is slower with more prolonged exposure. Here, we engineer a huIgG Fc domain to bind both TfR and CD98hc to create a dual transport vehicle (TV) platform that drives distinct brain delivery properties. Dual TVs achieve significantly higher brain concentrations than TVs targeting either TfR or CD98hc alone. Modulation of TfR and CD98hc affinities shifts dual TV brain exposure kinetics and biodistribution. Stronger TfR affinity drives faster brain uptake and clearance, while stronger CD98hc affinity yields higher, more sustained concentrations, likely due to CD98hc affinity-dependent reduction in TfR-mediated neuronal internalization. This dual targeting strategy leverages the complementary properties of TfR and CD98hc-mediated brain exposure to increase optionality for brain delivery of biotherapeutics.

">NeuroCarta: An Automated and Quantitative Approach to Mapping Cellular Networks in the Mouse Brain</a></h4>

              
                Understanding the structural organization of the brain is essential for deciphering how complex functions emerge from neural circuits. The Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas (AMBCA) has revolutionized our ability to quantify anatomical connectivity at a mesoscale resolution, bridging the gap between microscopic cellular interactions and macroscopic network organization. To leverage AMBCA for automated network construction and analysis, here we introduce NeuroCarta, an open-source MATLAB toolbox designed to extract, process, and analyze brain-wide connectivity networks. NeuroCarta generates directed and weighted connectivity graphs, computes key network metrics, and visualizes topological features of brain circuits. As an application example, using NeuroCarta on viral tracer data from the AMBCA, we demonstrate that the mouse brain exhibits a densely connected architecture, with a degree of separation of approximately four synapses, suggesting an optimized balance between local specialization and global integration. We identify attractor nodes that may serve as key convergence points in brain-wide neural computations and show that NeuroCarta facilitates comparative network analyses, revealing regional variations in projection patterns. While the toolbox is currently constrained by the resolution and coverage of the AMBCA dataset, it provides a scalable and customizable framework for investigating brain network topology, interregional communication, and anatomical constraints on mesoscale circuit organization.

">Slow wave sleep supports the reorganisation of episodic memory networks</a></h4>

              
                Models of memory consolidation propose that newly acquired memory traces undergo reorganisation during sleep. To test this idea, we recorded high-density electroencephalography (EEG) during an evening session of word-image learning followed by immediate (pre-sleep) and delayed (post-sleep) recall. Polysomnography was employed throughout the intervening night, capturing time spent in different sleep stages. Using source-reconstructed time-frequency analysis, we first replicated the effect of alpha power decreases for successful relative to unsuccessful recall, emerging between 700 and 1500 ms after cue onset and spanning medial and lateral temporal lobe regions as well as posterior parietal cortex. Directly contrasting successful post-sleep vs. pre-sleep recall revealed a shift of alpha power decrease from parietal towards anterior temporal lobe (ATL) after sleep. Critically, time spent in slow wave sleep (SWS) during the intervening night not only predicted the extent of memory retention, but also correlated with the shift to ATL recall effects. Finally, brain-wide functional connectivity profiles during successful recall pointed to a marked overnight reorganisation of memory networks, with the extent of reorganisation again predicted by time spent in SWS. Together, these findings link SWS to the consolidation and functional reorganisation of episodic memory networks.

">Breakthrough Percepts of Familiar Faces</a></h4>

              
                In Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP), the vast majority of stimuli are not consciously perceived, but the salient ones breakthrough into awareness and can be reported. In addition, these breakthrough events are observable with EEG, since they generate a P3 or other distinguishing components. The Fringe-P3 method is based upon these characteristics. Concealed knowledge studies have successfully employed this Fringe-P3 method using own-name and own email-address, with the method being shown to be less vulnerable to counter-measures than other approaches. It has also been shown that famous faces presented in RSVP differentially break into awareness and generate a distinct evoked response component. In this paper, we further enhance the applicability of the Fringe-P3 concealed knowledge test by demonstrating the effectiveness of the method on personally-familiar faces. While salient, such stimuli do not have the exquisite salience of famous faces, being a better match to the level of salience that might be found in forensic applications. Our findings suggest that the Fringe-P3 method could be used to detect intrinsic salience of familiar faces, even when there was no task associated with these faces. We investigated the sensitivity of the ERP-based RSVP paradigm to infer recognition of familiar faces, and performed statistical inference in the Time and Frequency domains, to differentiate between known and unknown faces, at group and participant levels.

">Combined MEG and EEG suggest a limbic source network of the P3 in retrosplenial cortex, insula, and hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                Intracranial P3 activity in the hippocampus is a robust phenomenon, but it remains debated if this activity contributes to the extracranial P3. A second limbic P3 source was recently suggested in the retro-splenial cortex based on source analysis and fMRI. The present study tested if these sources could be confirmed by source modeling of a new data set. Combined magneto- and electroencephalography signals were recorded during a visual oddball paradigm. Observers were instructed to respond to rare targets of a deviant shape and ignore rare non-targets of a deviant color. Source analysis was based on noise-normalized minimum norm estimates in an individual, MRI-based cortical source space. Source analysis showed a strong P3 source in retrosplenial cortex. Further sources were observed in insular cortex and medial temporal lobe. The source configuration was similar for rare target and non-target stimuli. Simulations and further analyses show that the source in retrosplenial cortex is strongly attenuated in magnetoencephalography, whereas the source in medial temporal lobe and insula contribute to both recording modalities. These data further support a P3 generator in retrosplenial cortex. Moreover, previously suggested generators in insula and medial temporal lobe, most likely in the hippocampus, are confirmed. In summary, the source configuration presented here suggests that the P3 is confined to limbic circuits.

">Reaching vigor tracks learned prediction error</a></h4>

              
                Movement vigor across multiple modalities increases with reward, suggesting that the neural circuits that represent value influence the control of movement. Dopaminergic neuron (DAN) activity in the basal ganglia has been suggested as the potential mediator of this response. If DAN activity is the bridge between value and vigor, then vigor should track canonical mediators of this activity, namely reward expectation and reward prediction error. Here we ask if a similar time-locked response is present in vigor of reaching movements. We explore this link by leveraging the known phasic dopaminergic response to stochastic rewards, where activity is modulated by both reward expectation at cue and the prediction error at feedback. We used probabilistic rewards to create a reaching task rich in reward expectation, reward prediction error, and learning. In one experiment, target reward probabilities were explicitly stated, and in the other, were left unknown and to be learned by the participants. We included two stochastic rewards (probabilities 33% and 66%) and two deterministic ones (probabilities 100% and 0%). Outgoing peak velocity in both experiments increased with increasing reward expectation. Furthermore, we observed a short-latency response in the vigor of the ongoing movement, that tracked reward prediction error: either invigorating or enervating velocity consistent with the sign and magnitude of the error. Reaching kinematics also revealed the value-update process in a trial-to-trial fashion, similar to the effect of prediction error signals typical in dopamine-mediated striatal phasic activity. Lastly, reach vigor increased with reward history over trials, mirroring the motivational effects often linked to fluctuating dopamine levels. Taken together, our results demonstrate and exquisite link between known short-latency reward signals and the invigoration of both discrete and ongoing movements.

">Evolution of sensory systems underlies the emergence of predatory feeding behaviours in nematodes</a></h4>

              
                Sensory systems are the primary interface between an organism and its environment with changes in selectivity or sensitivity representing key events in behavioural evolution. Here, we explored the molecular modifications influencing sensory perception across the nematode phyla. Pristionchus pacificus is a predatory species and has evolved contact-dependent sensing and teeth-like structures to attack prey. Using mutants defective for mechanosensory neuron function, we found an expanded role for this sensory modality in efficient predation alongside its canonical function in sensing aversive touch. To identify the precise mechanism involved in this tactile divergence we generated mutations in 26 canonical mechanosensory genes and tested their function using a combination of behavioural assays, automated behavioural tracking and machine learning. While mechanosensory defects were observed in several mutants, Ppa-mec-6 mutants specifically also induced predation deficiencies. Previously, a similar phenotype was observed in a chemosensory defective mutant and we found a synergistic influence on predation in mutants lacking both sensory inputs. Importantly, both chemosensory and mechanosensory receptor expression converge on the same environmentally exposed IL2 neurons revealing these as the primary mechanism for sensing prey. Thus, predation evolved through the co-option of both mechanosensory and chemosensory systems which act synergistically to shape the evolution of complex behavioural traits.

">MiR-7a-Klf4 axis as a regulator and therapeutic target of neuroinflammation and ferroptosis in Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                Neuroinflammation and ferroptosis significantly contribute to neuronal death in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative disorders. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are crucial regulators of these pathological processes. We employed transcriptomic analysis in an APP/PSEN1 Tg AD mouse model to identify dysregulated miRNAs and construct a miRNA-mRNA-pathway network. We discovered increased miR7a expression in the AD brain, targeting Kruppel-like factor 4 (Klf4), a transcriptional factor implicated in A{beta} oligomer-induced neuroinflammation and RSL3-induced neuronal ferroptosis. Elevated Klf4 levels in AD mice brains suggest its involvement in AD pathology. The miR-7a mediated silencing of Klf4 alleviates neuroinflammation by modulating NF-{kappa}B, iNOS, and NLRP3 pathways, and inhibition of ferroptosis by targeting labile iron levels, GPX4, Nrf2 pathway, and mitochondrial damage. These findings highlight the neuroprotective role of miR-7a and its potential as RNA therapeutic. Pharmacological targeting of the miR-7a-Klf4 axis with blood-brain-barrier (BBB)-permeable compound effectively mitigates neuroinflammation and ferroptosis, suggesting the miR-7a-Klf4 axis as a novel therapeutic target for AD.

">Revisiting Color Efficient Coding through Material Perception</a></h4>

              
                An essential objective of early visual processing is to handle the redundant inputs from natural environments efficiently. For instance, cone signals from natural environments are highly correlated across cone types, indicating channel redundancy. Early visual processing transforms the signals into color and luminance information, such as principle component analysis, and thus achieves efficient and decorrelated representations of natural scenes. Building on these findings, previous research has investigated the effect of color on visual tasks such as object recognition using grayscale conversion, which separates luminance from color. However, recent work suggests that when focusing on object materials, color and luminance remain highly redundant due to complex optical properties. Although this finding indicates that there may be a more efficient decomposition of signals, the specific algorithms remain unknown. This study derives that a classic computer graphics algorithm, the median cut, offers a novel approach to enhance visual processing efficiency while capturing diagnostic features to separate material from object geometry information. Human behavioral experiments show that color reduction based on the algorithm disturbs material classification while preserving object recognition. These findings suggest that object geometric structures are available only from low-bit information. Finally, considering material information can be estimated from summary statistics of image sub-spaces, this study suggests an efficient decomposition of input color images.

">A comparative transcriptomic analysis of mouse demyelination models and Multiple Sclerosis lesions</a></h4>

              
                Demyelinating diseases, such as Multiple Sclerosis (MS), are debilitating conditions characterized by loss of the myelin sheaths, ultimately leading to neurodegeneration. Toxicity models are among the most commonly used mouse models to induce demyelination; however, it remains unclear whether different demyelination models elicit distinct glial responses, and how comparable these changes are to MS. To address this gap, we integrated new and published single cell transcriptomic data of the subcortical white matter from lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) and cuprizone toxicity models, and compared them to an existing human MS dataset. We find that LPC and cuprizone treatments induce distinct oligodendrocyte (OL) states, but a highly conserved microglial response upon demyelination. Interestingly, remyelinating OLs converge on an altered maturation state in both LPC and cuprizone models, potentially due to persistent activation of microglia at remyelination stages. Comparison of the mouse models with MS tissue reveals that key OL gene signatures specific to LPC and cuprizone demyelination are observed in MS patients, while microglia appear more heterogeneous across the different types of MS lesions. Finally, cross-species analysis highlights a conserved phenotype shared between cuprizone and actively demyelinating MS lesions, with downregulation of genes required for stable myelin production and increased cellular stress pathways. Overall, this comparative analysis uncovers specific gene expression differences between mouse demyelination models and human MS lesions, providing a foundation for using the animal models effectively to advance remyelination therapies.

">Aligned representation of visual and tactile motion directions in hMT+/V5 and fronto- parietal regions</a></h4>

              
                Moving events on the skin can be perceived through vision and touch. How does the brain create a unified multisensory representation of motion directions initially acquired in different coordinate systems? We show that the middle occipito-temporal region (hMT+/V5), along with a fronto-parietal network, encodes visual and tactile directions using a common external frame of reference independent of body posture. We characterized brain activity using fMRI in participants exposed to directional visual and tactile motion stimuli across different hand postures. We demonstrate that individually and functionally defined hMT+/V5 shows univariate preference for both visual and tactile motion and encodes motion directions in distributed activity patterns. Unlike somatosensory regions, information about tactile directions was enhanced in right hMT+/V5 when mapped using an external as compared to a somatotopic frame of reference. Crossmodal decoding showed that tactile directions defined using an externally centered coordinate system, but not a somatotopic one, align with the representation of visual directions in rhMT+/V5 (both MT and MST). A whole brain searchlight group analysis confirmed these individually defined regions-of-interest results and extended the presence of an aligned visuo-tactile code for directional motion in external space to the parietal and dorsal prefrontal cortex. Our findings reveal a brain network involving hMT+/V5 that encodes motion directions in vision and touch using a common external frame of reference.

">Intellectual ability and cortical homotopy development in children and adolescents</a></h4>

              
                Functional homotopy, defined as the similarity between the corresponding regions of the two hemispheres, is a critical feature of interhemispheric communication and cognitive integration. Throughout development, the brain transitions from broadly connected networks in early childhood to more specialized configurations in adolescence, accompanied by increased hemispheric differentiation and integration. Using longitudinal data and a novel metric of functional homotopy, homotopic functional affinity (HFA), we investigated the developmental patterns of functional homotopy and its relationship with intelligence. Our findings indicate a significant decrease in HFA with age, particularly in higher-order association networks. In addition, adolescents demonstrate stronger, predominantly negative correlations between HFA and intelligence, in contrast to younger children. In particular, individuals with superior intellectual ability experience accelerated decreases in HFA, indicating greater neural efficiency based on advanced hemispheric specialization and differentiation. These findings provide evidence of the neural mechanisms that underlie cognitive development, emphasizing the dynamic interaction between hemispheric organization and intelligence. Our work may have implications for the design of customized educational/clinical interventions to optimize individual developmental strategies.

">Head before heart: cognitive empathy emerges before affective empathy in the developing brain</a></h4>

              
                Empathy is crucial for social interactions across all cultures, and is foundational to establishing social cooperation and group ties in human societies. Challenging the current predominant view, we recently proposed that understanding others' emotions (cognitive empathy) might emerge earlier than actually sharing those emotions (affective empathy) (Bulgarelli & Jones, 2023). Here we test this hypothesis by measuring which empathic component matures first during toddlerhood, a critical period for the development of broader social networks. Addressing this question is critical to understand the mechanisms through which caregivers scaffold empathy development. Traditional approaches are inadequate, as they rely on children's verbal skills or unfamiliar scenarios that lack ecological validity. In this preregistered study, we employed a novel toddler-appropriate task to dissociate neural and physiological correlates of cognitive and affective empathy in N=90 3-to-5-year-olds using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and simultaneous heart rate monitoring to identify internal markers of empathy. We found that brain regions supporting affective and cognitive empathy in young children resemble those observed in adults. Importantly, we showed an effect of age on network specialisation with brain activations of cognitive empathy stronger in younger compared to older preschoolers, and brain activations of affective empathy stronger in older compared to younger preschoolers. These results provide the first evidence that cognitive empathy develops earlier than affective empathy in preschoolers, challenging existing models and suggesting a new framework for understanding the development of empathy.

                Oscillations in the high gamma and ripple frequency ranges are known to coordinate local hippocampal and neocortical neuronal assemblies during memory encoding and recall. Here, we explored spatiotemporal dynamics and the role of global coordination of these fast oscillatory discharges across the sensory and associational cortical areas in distinct phases of memory processing. Individual bursts of high frequency oscillations were detected in intracranial recordings from epilepsy patients remembering word lists for immediate free recall. We found constant coincident bursting across visual and higher order processing areas, peaking before recall and elevated during encoding of words. This global co-bursting was modulated by memory processing, engaged approximately half of the recorded electrode sites, and clustered into a sequence of multiple consecutive bursting discharges. Our results suggest a general role of global coincident high frequency oscillations in organizing large-scale information processing across the brain necessary especially, but not exclusively, for memory functions.

">The representation and valuation of subgoals in the human brain during model-based hierarchical behavior</a></h4>

              
                The human capacity to plan and perform long, complex sequences of behavior to achieve distant goals depends in part on a hierarchical organization that divides behavior into structured segments. Such a mechanism requires the internal designation of certain states as subgoals to mark the successful implementation of a behavioral segment. How the brain represents subgoals over time and computes decision values as a function of subgoals is unknown. While most characterizations of hierarchical behavior lack knowledge of the environment, human decision-making also relies on planning with an internal model of the world. Consequently, it remains to be determined how the brain computes values of subgoals using model-based planning in order to drive hierarchical, model-based decisions. Using a sequential-subgoal decision-making task designed to evoke hierarchical, model-based behavior in combination with fMRI, we decoded a representation of the current subgoal in insula and ventromedial prefrontal cortex during decision-making that persisted over time--a critical, latent representation for computing values and orienting behavior in the correct sequence. Using a model-based, hierarchical reinforcement learning model, we also found key decision signals based on values from the model in several regions of frontal cortex. These findings thereby shed light on the neural correlates of subgoal representation and illustrate how value signals can be computed on the basis of these subgoals and knowledge of the environment structure.

Our goal is to quantify individual deviations from the normative range of brain morphometric variation in children with Self-limited epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes and to assess their associations with clinical manifestations and cognitive functions. We have developed sex-specific normative models on regional subcortical volume, cortical thickness, and surface area data from 457 healthy children sourced from two datasets. These models were then utilized to map the brain morphometric deviations of children with Self-limited epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (<span style="font-style:italic;">n</span> = 187) and sex- and age-matched healthy controls (<span style="font-style:italic;">n</span> = 108) from another dataset. In the Self-limited epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes group, children exhibited a higher proportion of regions with infra-normal deviations in subcortical volumes, the number of regions with normative deviations correlated with disease duration, seizure frequency, and Raven’s total score. Our findings suggest that a few extreme distributions of heterogeneous brain morphometric deviations are present in a minority of individuals, emphasizing the need to monitor brain abnormalities throughout the course of the disease.</span>

Moreover, a strategic mindset selectively responds to positive social feedback, supported by its positive correlations with the amplitude of the late positive potential in response to desirable feedback. Our behavioral study (<span style="font-style:italic;">n</span> = 45) further demonstrated that individuals with a higher level of strategic mindset were more likely to update their self-concept based on conflicting opinions presented by others.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-322/v1?src=rss">An extensive review of SAR remote sensing in mode transportation studies: Major findings and future recommendations [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background The availability of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) remote sensing technology and platform has been widely used in the study of transportation. It includes all three modes of air, water, and land. This review aims to determine the importance of SAR remote sensing technology in a specific mode of transportation focus area. Methods For this reason, an extensive literature review was conducted. This review used the Web of Science, the IEEEXplore, and the ScienceDirect database. The systematic search strategy was developed for query-related research papers. The rules were then proposed to filter more related research papers. Then the selected papers were classified into five classes (mode, container, infrastructure, geographic distribution, and pattern of publication). Finally, a descriptive statistical analysis was conducted. Results Many studies have been done in the last three decades for mode transportation. Based on the mode of transportation and its container, the water mode of transportation and ship were the most studied. It is due to the contrast differences between the ship as the detected object and the sea as the background. While based on the infrastructure the airport was the most studied object, followed by the railway and harbour. Most of the studies on using SAR as the mode of transportation were conducted in the northern part of the equator. Currently, neural networks and deep learning algorithms are introduced to detect the mode of transportation using SAR remote sensing datasets. Conclusion Future research is expected to detect ships in a more heterogeneous background. More studies in moving object detection using SAR are also expected in the future.

                Background Chintamani village, Chikkaballapura district, Karnataka, India was found to possess high aquifer uranium concentrations. Ge- ologically, Chintamani village is located on bedrock that is rich in elements like potassium (K) that naturally contain high levels of radioactive elements, such as uranium and thorium, due to the presence of alkali-feldspar granites and gneisses. Aquifer de- pletion has caused the concentration of these elements in groundwater to increase over time, posing a potential health hazard to the residents of Chintamani village. Methods Here, we report the sampling of groundwater from 12 borewells located in Chintamani village in between the period of August 2024 to December 2024. We observed groundwater uranium concentrations of 0.02 ppm to 8.64 ppm. Data for borewell depth, the quantity of total dissolved solids (TDS), and the elemental composition of TDS is also reported. We observed a statistically significant spatial distribution of uranium concentrations in Chintamani village. Borewells possessing the highest observed concentrations of uranium were clustered towards the northwestern region of the village. Conclusions This dataset is expected to serve as a resource for guiding potential remediation efforts in these locations.

                Background This study examines the influence of political preferences on historians’ assessments of the publishability of contemporary history abstracts by investigating whether historians favor abstracts that align with their political orientation. Methods In an online experiment, 75 historians evaluated 17 fictitious contemporary history abstracts from 17 pairs, each presented with either a progressive or conservative stance. The participants made initial intuitive assessments regarding the publishability of each abstract and later provided more considered responses, also rating their Feeling of Rightness (FOR) regarding their initial judgments. Results The results revealed a significant interaction effect between an abstract’s political stance and historians’ political orientation, consistent with the observation that right-wing historians prefer conservative abstracts, left-wing historians prefer progressive abstracts, and moderate historians show no preference for either. Overall, participants preferred progressive abstracts, largely reflecting a majority of left-leaning historians in our sample. Moreover, after reconsidering their responses and providing FOR ratings, participants’ initial decisions did not significantly change. Conclusions Our study suggests that political preferences influence research evaluations and are not diminished by more deliberate processing, as demonstrated through the case study of historians.

                Background In Saudi Arabia, the gap between the demand for and availability of organs persists, with a total of 13,731 patients on the waiting list in 2019. Family refusal is a major obstacle limiting donation since their consent must be obtained prior to the retrieval of organs. The cause of family refusal is mainly due to their lack of knowledge of their loved ones’ wish to become a donor. This paper aimed to compare three systems of obtaining consent in terms of effectiveness, respect for autonomy, and the cultural role of families in Saudi Arabia to ensure feasibility and effectiveness in increasing the number of donors. Policy alternatives and implications The consent systems include informed consent, presumed consent, and mandated choice. The mandated choice policy might be the optimal solution since it is the most likely to balance the respect for individual autonomy and the cultural role of families in Saudi Arabia. Conclusions and recommendations Mandated choice could be an option that ensures respect for personal autonomy. Nevertheless, more research should be conducted to support adopting this policy in the Saudi context. Additionally, a recommendation to decision makers is to utilize the Tawakkalna app to send alerts to the next of kin when a user registers as a donor with the user’s consent.

                Background microRNAs (miRNAs) are key post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression in animals, yet their origins and early functions remain elusive. In this study, we explore the diversity and functionality of miRNAs in Ichthyosporea, a group of unicellular organisms that represent some of the closest relatives of animals. Methods We have performed miRNA identification by integrating deep small RNA sequencing with draft genome assemblies across six species of Ichthyosporea, including Abeoforma whisleri, Pirum gemmata, and Sphaeroforma sp. To assess the functional roles of these miRNAs, we have used computational target prediction and degradome sequencing. Results We identified a rich and varied repertoire of miRNAs across Ichthyosporea. Many of these miRNAs appear to be lineage-specific, while a subset is conserved among closely related species, suggesting both rapid evolutionary turnover and the persistence of ancient regulatory elements. Moreover, predicted target genes span a wide range of transcripts, implicating miRNAs in diverse cellular processes. Additionally, degradome sequencing reveal that in S. arctica, several miRNAs are likely to induce mRNA cleavage. Conclusions These findings not only extend previous reports of miRNA presence in Ichthyosporea but also underscore the deep evolutionary roots of miRNA-mediated gene regulation in the holozoan lineage. The miRNA induced target cleavage in S. arctica is also observed in cnidarians and supports the hypothesis that mRNA cleavage may represent the ancestral function of animal miRNAs.

<p>Optimized Golgi-Cox staining reduces the staining duration to 24 h for 100-µm-thick mouse brain sections, the optimized protocol exhibits excellent compatibility with immunostaining and transgenic models.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The Golgi-Cox staining technique is renowned for its ability to delineate neuronal architecture with remarkable precision. However, the traditional protocol's lengthy processing timeline and limited compatibility with immunostaining and transgenic labeling have hindered its widespread adoption in modern neuroscience research.</p>
<p>In the current study, we found that adjusting the incubation temperature to 55°C significantly reduced the staining duration to a mere 24 h for 100 µm-thick sections of mouse brain tissue. Importantly, our optimized protocol is compatible with immunostaining techniques and transgenic mouse models. In addition, using a lipopolysaccharides-induced mouse model of depression, we found a reduction in dendritic spines labeled by Golgi-Cox staining and an increase in the number of microglial cells labeled by immunofluorescence in the same samples, in addition, cross-talk between Golgi-Cox-stained neurons and microglial fibers were observed.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the modified Golgi-Cox staining technique allows for the acquisition of a more comprehensive set of data from the same biological tissue with increased efficiency. This advancement promises to improve methodologies in histopathology and neurobiology, making advanced applications of Golgi-Cox staining more accessible in contemporary neuroscience research.</p>

                Background Educational initiatives could foster the adoption of open science (OS) and responsible research practices (RRPs). This single group pre-post study evaluated the impact of an educational intervention on increasing the adherence, knowledge and perceptions about adopting OS practices and RRPs among graduate researchers at a Brazilian University. Methods Graduate students from a southern Brazilian university were invited to participate in a course addressing OS and RRPs. The intervention was an online interactive course on OS and RRPs. The number of OS outputs, including Open Science Framework (OSF) accounts, study registrations, protocols, analysis plans, data sets, preprints, and the number of projects published by each participant were collected before and after the intervention. Additionally, a self-administered online questionnaire was applied before and after the intervention to evaluate participants’ perceptions on RRPs, OS practices and on the current researchers’ evaluation system. Results Eighty-four students finished the course and 80 agreed to participate in the study. The number of OSF accounts increased from 7 to 78 after the course, and the number of projects increased from 7 to 10, six months after the intervention. No registrations, protocols, analysis plans, data sets, or preprints were found after 6 and 12 months, respectively. The participants’ perceptions of the current research evaluation system and on the OS practices and RRPs changed positively with the intervention. Also, the intention to adopt practices like registration, protocol and preprint publications has noticeably increased after the course. Conclusions The number of participants’ OSF outputs showed little or no improvement after the intervention. The most important impact difference could be identified in terms of the participants’ perceptions and intentions to adhere to such practices in the future.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.70011?af=R">Brain Networks Differ According to Levels of Interference in Spatiotemporal Processing</a></h4>

              
                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The ability to form different neural representations for similar inputs is a central process of episodic memory. Although the dorsal dentate gyrus and CA3 have been indicated as important in this phenomenon, the neuronal circuits underlying spatiotemporal memory processing with different levels of spatial similarity are still elusive. In this study, we measured the expression of the immediate early gene c-Fos to evaluate brain areas activated when rats recalled the temporal order of object locations in a task, with either high or low levels of spatial interference. Animals showed spatiotemporal memory in both conditions once they spent more time exploring the older object locations relative to the more recent ones. We found no difference in the levels of c-Fos expression between high and low spatial interference. However, the levels of c-Fos expression in CA2 positively correlated with the discrimination index in the low spatial interference condition. More importantly, functional network connectivity analysis revealed a wider and more interconnected neuronal circuit in conditions of high than in low spatial interference. Our study advances the understanding of brain networks recruited in episodic memory with different degrees of spatial similarity.</p>

                In a recent study, Dykstra and colleagues show that shortened TAR DNA Binding Protein 43 (sTDP-43) isoforms are generated as by-products of TDP-43 autoregulation. sTDP-43 levels are regulated through nonsense-mediated decay and proteasomal and autophagic degradation, and elicit toxicity through dominant negative effects on TDP-43 splicing activity. These results identify mechanisms contributing to sTDP-43 accumulation and toxicity in disease.

                The pain experience is modulated by descending pathways. Using an intersectional strategy, Li et al. map anatomical and molecular-spatial features of nociceptive descending pathways. Their findings uncover a pontine region, previously linked to micturition, as a powerful station for descending pain modulation, exposing an attractive target for combating pain.

                Bollmann et al. track reactivated CA1 assemblies representing spatial memories during 16–20 h of sleep/rest. Assemblies initially reflect recently learned spatial memories but are gradually transformed into those seen during the memory recall session following rest. Whereas slow-wave sleep accelerates the assembly drift, REM epochs counteract it.

                Tsai et al. describe comprehensive nucleoside profiles of archaeal RNAs and identify temperature-responsive modifications using LC-MS/MS. They establish a workflow for RNA-modifying enzyme discovery by associating enzyme predictions with global nucleoside profiles. This approach reveals a methyltransferase responsible for installing an m7G in the peptidyl transferase center of 23S rRNA.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101973">ORMDL3 restrains type I interferon signaling and anti-tumor immunity by promoting RIG-I degradation</a></h4>

              
                Mounting evidence has demonstrated the genetic association of ORMDL sphingolipid biosynthesis regulator 3 (ORMDL3) gene polymorphisms with bronchial asthma and a diverse set of inflammatory disorders. However, its role in type I interferon (type I IFN) signaling remains poorly defined. Herein, we report that ORMDL3 is a negative modulator of the type I IFN signaling by interacting with mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) and subsequently promoting the proteasome-mediated degradation of retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I). Immunoprecipitation coupled with mass spectrometry (IP-MS) assays uncovered that ORMDL3 binds to ubiquitin-specific protease 10 (USP10), which forms a complex with and stabilizes RIG-I through decreasing its K48-linked ubiquitination. ORMDL3 thus disrupts the interaction between USP10 and RIG-I, thereby promoting RIG-I degradation. Additionally, subcutaneous syngeneic tumor models in C57BL/6 mice revealed that inhibition of ORMDL3 enhances anti-tumor efficacy by augmenting the proportion of cytotoxic CD8 positive T cells and IFN production in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Collectively, our findings reveal the pivotal roles of ORMDL3 in maintaining antiviral innate immune responses and anti-tumor immunity.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99678">Spatial localization of hippocampal replay requires dopamine signaling</a></h4>

              
                Sequenced reactivations of hippocampal neurons called replays, concomitant with sharp-wave ripples in the local field potential, are critical for the consolidation of episodic memory, but whether replays depend on the brain’s reward or novelty signals is unknown. Here, we combined chemogenetic silencing of dopamine neurons in ventral tegmental area (VTA) and simultaneous electrophysiological recordings in dorsal hippocampal CA1, in freely behaving male rats experiencing changes to reward magnitude and environmental novelty. Surprisingly, VTA silencing did not prevent ripple increases where reward was increased, but caused dramatic, aberrant ripple increases where reward was unchanged. These increases were associated with increased reverse-ordered replays. On familiar tracks this effect disappeared, and ripples tracked reward prediction error (RPE), indicating that non-VTA reward signals were sufficient to direct replay. Our results reveal a novel dependence of hippocampal replay on dopamine, and a role for a VTA-independent RPE signal that is reliable only in familiar environments.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93373">Loss of CTRP10 results in female obesity with preserved metabolic health</a></h4>

              
                Obesity is a major risk factor for type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, cardiovascular disease, and hypertension. Intriguingly, there is a subset of metabolically healthy obese (MHO) individuals who are seemingly able to maintain a healthy metabolic profile free of metabolic syndrome. The molecular underpinnings of MHO, however, are not well understood. Here, we report that CTRP10/C1QL2-deficient mice represent a unique female model of MHO. CTRP10 modulates weight gain in a striking and sexually dimorphic manner. Female, but not male, mice lacking CTRP10 develop obesity with age on a low-fat diet while maintaining an otherwise healthy metabolic profile. When fed an obesogenic diet, female <i>Ctrp10</i> knockout (KO) mice show rapid weight gain. Despite pronounced obesity, <i>Ctrp10</i> KO female mice do not develop steatosis, dyslipidemia, glucose intolerance, insulin resistance, oxidative stress, or low-grade inflammation. Obesity is largely uncoupled from metabolic dysregulation in female KO mice. Multi-tissue transcriptomic analyses highlighted gene expression changes and pathways associated with insulin-sensitive obesity. Transcriptional correlation of the differentially expressed gene (DEG) orthologs in humans also shows sex differences in gene connectivity within and across metabolic tissues, underscoring the conserved sex-dependent function of CTRP10. Collectively, our findings suggest that CTRP10 negatively regulates body weight in females, and that loss of CTRP10 results in benign obesity with largely preserved insulin sensitivity and metabolic health. This female MHO mouse model is valuable for understanding sex-biased mechanisms that uncouple obesity from metabolic dysfunction.

">Validation of EEG data assimilation-based prefrontal excitation-inhibition balance estimation using TMS-EEG</a></h4>

              
                The excitation and inhibition (E/I) balance of neural circuits is a crucial index reflecting neurophysiological homeostasis. Although several cutting-edge methods have been established to assess E/I balance in an intact brain, they have inherent limitations, such as difficulties in tracking changes in E/I balance over time. To tackle this issue, we have proposed neural-mass-model-based tracking of the brain states using a data assimilation (DA) scheme in our previous work. However, although we verified that sleep-dependent changes in E/I balance can be estimated from electroencephalography data, the neurophysiological validity of the method was not evaluated. Therefore, in the current study, we directly compared estimated E/I states based on the DA methods with the concurrent transcranial magnetic stimulation and electroencephalography (TMS-EEG) based methods. The results showed that the E/I changes estimated by the DA-based method correlated significantly with E/I in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, as indexed by TMS-evoked EEG. These findings indicate that our proposed method can estimate neurophysiologically valid changes in E/I balance.

">Soluble Immune Factor Profiles in Blood and CSF Associated with LRRK2 Mutations and Parkinson's Disease</a></h4>

              
                Background and Objectives: Mutations in the Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene are one of the most common genetic causes of Parkinson's disease (PD) and are linked to immune dysregulation in both the central nervous system and periphery. However, peripheral and central profiles of soluble immune factors associated with LRRK2 mutations and PD have not been comprehensively characterized. Using serum and CSF samples from the LRRK2 Cohort Consortium (LCC), this study aimed to probe a broad range of soluble immune biomarkers associated with LRRK2 mutations and PD. Methods: We investigated the levels of soluble immune regulators in the serum (n=651) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF, n=129) of LRRK2 mutation carriers and non-carriers, both with and without PD. A total of 65 cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and soluble receptors were assessed by Luminex immunoassay. A multivariable robust linear model was used to determine levels associated with LRRK2 mutations and PD status, adjusting for age, sex, and sample cohort. Correlations were assessed using the Spearman correlation coefficient. LRRK2 G2019S knock-in mice were used to validate the associations identified in the LCC. Results: In this extensive discovery cohort, we identified several elevated serum immune regulatory factors associated with LRRK2 mutations. In particular, serum stromal cell-derived factor-1 alpha (SDF-1 alpha) levels, as supported by findings in LRRK2 G2019S knock-in mice, and tumor necrosis factor receptor II (TNF-RII) were significantly increased after multiple comparison adjustment. In contrast, LRRK2 mutations were associated with reduced soluble immune markers, including BAFF, CD40-Ligand, I-TAC, MIP-3 alpha, NGF beta, and IL-27 in CSF. Those with clinically diagnosed PD, with or without LRRK2 mutations, did not show strong signals in serum but reduced inflammatory analytes in CSF, including MIF, MMP-1, CD30, Tweak, and SDF-1 alpha. In addition, we found that the serum levels of these soluble immune factors display varied correlations with their corresponding CSF levels. Discussion: This study highlights distinct immune profiles associated with LRRK2 mutations and PD in the periphery and CNS. Serum levels of SDF-1alpha and TNF-RII were elevated in LRRK2 mutation carriers, while CSF immune markers were reduced. In PD, irrespective of LRRK2 status, reduced CSF inflammatory analytes and weak serum signals were observed. These results provide insight into immune dysregulation linked to LRRK2 mutations. If replicable in independent datasets, they offer potential avenues for biomarker and therapeutic exploration

">Glutamate indicators with increased sensitivity and tailored deactivation rates</a></h4>

              
                Identifying the input-output operations of neurons requires measurements of synaptic transmission simultaneously at many of a neuron's thousands of inputs in the intact brain. To facilitate this goal, we engineered and screened 3365 variants of the fluorescent protein glutamate indicator iGluSnFR3 in neuron culture, and selected variants in the mouse visual cortex. Two variants have high-sensitivity and fast activation (< 2 ms) and deactivation times tailored for recording large populations of synapses (iGluSnFR4s, 153 ms) or rapid dynamics (iGluSnFR4f, 26 ms). By imaging action-potential evoked signals on axons and visually-evoked signals on dendritic spines, we show that iGluSnFR4s/4f primarily detect local synaptic glutamate with single-vesicle sensitivity. The indicators detect a wide range of naturalistic synaptic transmission, including in the vibrissal cortex layer 4 and in hippocampal CA1 dendrites. iGluSnFR4 increases the sensitivity and scale (4s) or speed (4f) of tracking information flow in neural networks in vivo.

">Cocaine Blocks Cholinergic Activity in the Medial Habenula Prior to But Not After Induced Preference for the Drug</a></h4>

              
                Descending projections from the medial habenula potently influence brainstem systems associated with reward and mood. Relatedly, the ventral, cholinergic segment of the nucleus has been linked to nicotine and cocaine addiction. Here we report that cocaine has no effect on baseline firing in the ventral medial habenula but entirely blocks the self-sustained activity initiated by endogenous acetylcholine. This effect was not altered by antagonists to dopamine receptors and thus presumably reflects a direct action on cholinergic receptors. Remarkably, cocaine had no effect on endogenous cholinergic activity in mice that had been extinguished from an induced cocaine preference. In all, the drug has potent effects, albeit through an exotic mode of action, on the medial habenula and these are eliminated by prior experience with the drug. These results describe a novel target for cocaine that is plausibly related to the psychological effects of the drug, and an unexpected consequence of earlier use.

">Reward Network Activations of Win versus Loss in a Monetary Gambling Task</a></h4>

              
                Reward processing is a vital function for health and survival and is impaired in various psychiatric and neurological disorders. Using a monetary gambling task, the current study aims to elucidate neural substrates in the reward network underlying evaluation of win versus loss outcomes, and their association with behavioral characteristics, such as impulsivity and task performance, and neuropsychological functioning. Functional MRI was recorded in thirty healthy, male community volunteers (mean age = 27.4 years) while they performed a monetary gambling task in which they bet with either 10 or 50 tokens and received feedback of whether they won or lost the bet amount. Results showed that a set of key brain structures in the reward network, including putamen, caudate nucleus, superior and inferior parietal lobule, angular gyrus, and Rolandic operculum, had greater blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal during win relative to loss trials, and the BOLD signals in most of these regions were highly correlated with one another. Further, exploratory bivariate analyses between these reward related regions and behavioral and neuropsychological domains showed significant correlations with moderate effect sizes, including: (i) negative correlations between non-planning impulsivity and activations in putamen and caudate regions, (ii) positive correlations between risky bets and right putamen activation, (iii) negative correlations between safer bets and right putamen activation, (iv) a negative correlation between short-term memory capacity and right putamen activity, and (v) a negative correlation between poor planning skills and left inferior occipital cortex activation. These findings contribute to our understanding of the neural underpinnings of monetary reward processing and their relationships to aspects of behavior and cognitive function. Future studies may confirm these findings with larger samples of healthy controls and extend these findings by investigating various clinical groups with impaired reward processing.

">Reduced neural sensitivity to musical tempo despite enhanced neural tracking of musical features in older adults</a></h4>

              
                A substantial body of prior research has focused on how older adults process and comprehend speech, whereas less attention has been devoted to how older adults encode and perceive naturalistic music. In the current study, we investigated whether the neural tracking of different musical features in naturalistic music differs between age groups. Younger and older adults (both sexes) listened to the excerpts of naturalistic music with different tempi (1-4 Hz) while electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded. The results show an age-related enhancement of neural responses to sound onsets, suggesting a loss of inhibition in the aged auditory cortex. Neural tracking of different musical features, including the amplitude envelope, amplitude onset, and spectral flux, were also enhanced in older adults, indicating that the hyperresponsiveness generalizes to features of naturalistic music. However, our results show that, despite enhanced neural responses, older adults exhibit reduced neural sensitivity of early sensory responses to music pieces with different tempi. Moreover, spectral flux mostly effectively predicted the changes in EEG activity due to differences in musical tempo, but this was reduced in older adults compared to younger adults. The current findings suggest that hyperresponsiveness in auditory cortex of older adults is accompanied by a lack of sensitivity to the tempo in music. The results highlight the complex changes in the aged auditory system that affect the processing of naturalistic sounds.

">BAND: Behavior-Aligned Neural Dynamics is all you need to capture motor corrections</a></h4>

              
                Neural activity in motor cortical areas is well-explained by latent neural population dynamics: the motor preparation phase sets the initial condition for the movement while the dynamics that unfold during the motor execution phase orchestrate the sequence of muscle activations. While preparatory activity explains a large fraction of both neural and behavior variability during the execution of a planned movement, it cannot account for corrections and adjustments during movements as this requires sensory feedback not available during planning. Therefore, accounting for unplanned, sensory-guided movement requires knowledge of relevant inputs to the motor cortex from other brain areas. Here, we provide evidence that these inputs cause transient deviations from an autonomous neural population trajectory, and show that these dynamics cannot be found by unsupervised inference methods. We introduce the new Behavior-Aligned Neural Dynamics (BAND) model, which exploits semi-supervised learning to predict both planned and unplanned movements from neural activity in the motor cortex that can be missed by unsupervised inference methods. Our analysis using BAND suggests that 1) transient motor corrections are encoded in small neural variability; 2) motor corrections are encoded in a sparse sub-population of primary motor cortex neurons (M1); and 3) combining latent dynamical modeling with behavior supervision allows for capturing both the movement plan and corrections.

">Feeding-fasting cycle of obesogenic food determines glucocorticoid neuromodulation of cortico-hippocampal activities sustaining long-term memory</a></h4>

              
                Background: Highly caloric food consumed around the clock perturbs the metabolism and cognitive functioning. We hypothesized that obesogenic food could alter neuronal representations of memory depending on the feeding-fasting cycle. Methods: We tracked memory performance, dendritic spine dynamics and neuronal representations of memory in C57Bl6J mice fed obesogenic food ad libitum from peri-adolescence. We aimed to correct energy rich diet-induced plasticity deficits and cognitive impairment with time-restricted feeding in males and females. We further used chemogenetics, pharmacology and knock-in mice to investigate functional correlates underlying diet-induced neurocognitive impairments. Results: We find that changes in the feeding-fasting cycle reverted the effects of ad libitum obesogenic food on memory impairment in both sexes (n=55, p=0.003). Concurrently, it also corrected the increased dendritic spine maintenance and neuroactivity in hippocampus and the decreased spine maintenance and activity in parietal cortex (n=48, p<0.005). Bi-directional effects in cortex and hippocampus mediated by glucocorticoid signalling are causal to behavioural changes (n=91, p=0.0008), and scaling hippocampal with cortical activities restored memory in mice fed obesogenic food (n=44, p=0.02). Conclusion: These results indicate that meal scheduling is a promising approach to confront glucocorticoid signalling bias and memory deficits caused by obesogenic food.

">In vivo reconstruction of Duvernoy's postmortem vasculature images</a></h4>

              
                Non-invasive measurement of the human brain's angioarchitecture is critical for understanding the basis of functional neuroimaging signals, diagnosing cerebrovascular diseases, and tracking neurodegeneration. Ultra-high-field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has opened a new window for mesoscopic (<0.5 mm) imaging of angioarchitecture, revealing fine vascular details that were previously inaccessible in vivo. However, current mesoscopic MRI methods for imaging of the angioarchitecture face two major limitations. First, acquisition times are prohibitively long -often exceeding 40 minutes -making integration into everyday clinical practice and research projects impractical. Second, even with data successfully acquired, conventional data visualization methods- such as 2D slice browsing and 3D vessel segmentation renders- are rudimentary and have limited effectiveness for navigating and interpreting the complex vascular network. In this paper, we present a fast whole-brain MRI protocol that provides robust images of the brain's venous network at 0.35 mm resolution in under seven minutes. Additionally, we introduce novel data processing and visualization techniques that enable identification of specific vessel types and more informative navigation of the complex vascular network. We demonstrate that, with these advancements, we can reproduce the seminal postmortem vasculature images of Duvernoy and Vannson (1999) in vivo. Furthermore, leveraging the fact that MRI allows coverage of the entire brain, we achieve, for the first time, whole-brain intracortical mesoscopic vein maps in humans. Our acquisition and post-processing methods lay the groundwork for detailed examinations of vascular organization across individuals, brain regions, and cortical layers. More generally, these methods make mesoscopic imaging of angioarchitecture viable for broad neuroscientific and clinical applications.

">Comprehensive profiling of anaesthetised brain dynamics across phylogeny</a></h4>

              
                The intrinsic dynamics of neuronal circuits shape information processing and cognitive function. Combining non-invasive neuroimaging with anaesthetic-induced suppression of information processing provides a unique opportunity to understand how local dynamics mediate the link between neurobiology and the organism's functional repertoire. To address this question, we compile a unique dataset of multi-scale neural activity during wakefulness and anesthesia encompassing human, macaque, marmoset, mouse and nematode. We then apply massive feature extraction to comprehensively characterize local neural dynamics across >6,000 time-series features. Using dynamics as a common space for comparison across species, we identify a phylogenetically conserved dynamical profile of anaesthesia that encompasses multiple features, including reductions in intrinsic timescales. This dynamical signature has an evolutionarily conserved spatial layout, covarying with transcriptional profiles of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission across human, macaque and mouse cortex. At the network level, anesthetic-induced changes in local dynamics manifest as reductions in inter-regional synchrony. This relationship between local dynamics and global connectivity can be recapitulated in silico using a connectome-based computational model. Finally, this dynamical regime of anaesthesia is experimentally reversed in vivo by deep-brain stimulation of the centromedian thalamus in the macaque, resulting in restored arousal and behavioural responsiveness. Altogether, omprehensive dynamical phenotyping reveals that spatiotemporal isolation of local neural activity during anesthesia is conserved across species and anesthetics.

">American ginseng (Panax quinquefolius L.) extracts (G1899) reverse stress-induced behavioral abnormalities in mice</a></h4>

              
                Stress affects brain functions, which leads to the development of mental disorders like anxiety, depression, cognitive decline, and social dysfunction. There is increasing focus on the role of nutritional, herbal and nutraceutical compounds on mental and cognitive functioning. Interestingly, studies suggest that American ginseng (Panax quinquefolius L.) extracts (G1899) improve cognition. We thus examined whether G1899 showed protective effects on stress-induced behavioral changes in animals. 200 mg/kg G1899 was orally administered daily for 4 weeks to 2-3-month-old female and male mice before inducing stress. To induce acute stress in animals, we intraperitoneally injected a low dose of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) (10 g/kg), and saline was used as a control. We also used chronic restraint stress (CRS) as a chronic stress model in mice. After LPS injection or CRS, multiple behavioral assays were carried out - a sucrose preference test, an open filed test, reciprocal social interaction, contextual fear conditioning, and a tail suspension test - to determine whether acute or chronic stress affected animals' behaviors and whether G1899 had protective effects against stress-induced behavioral dysfunction. We found that both LPS injection and CRS induced stress-related behavioral dysfunction, including depression-like behavior, anhedonia, social dysfunction, and fear memory impairments in both females and males. However, G1899 treatment was sufficient to reverse stress-induced behavioral abnormalities in animals. Our data further suggested that G1899 reduced the activity of hippocampal neurons by suppressing glutamatergic activity. Our study suggests that G1899 supplements can be protective against both acute and chronic stress in mice by suppressing neuronal and synaptic activity.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We aimed to quantify differences in the brain and spinal cord between Friedreich ataxia and controls, stratified by age and disease stage, including for the first time in young children.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>TRACK-FA is the largest prospective, longitudinal, multi-modal neuroimaging study in Friedreich ataxia to date. We assessed individuals with Friedreich ataxia and controls, 5 to 42 years, at 7 sites across 4 continents. The 17 imaging primary outcome measures (POMs) were selected from metrics that showed a significant longitudinal change in previous small-scale studies. These included brain and spinal cord morphometry (structural magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) and microstructure (diffusion MRI); brain iron levels (quantitative susceptibility mapping); and spinal cord biochemistry (magnetic resonance spectroscopy). This study is registered with <a target="_blank"
   title="Link to external resource"
   href="http://clinicaltrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</a> (NCT04349514).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Between February 2021 and August 2023, we assessed 169 individuals with Friedreich ataxia and 95 controls. Compared to controls, individuals with Friedreich ataxia had lower volume of dentate nucleus and superior cerebellar peduncles; smaller cross-sectional area of spinal cord; lower fractional anisotropy and higher diffusivity in spinal cord and superior cerebellar peduncles; and lower total N-acetyl-aspartate/myo-inositol ratio in spinal cord. Morphometric differences in spinal cord and superior cerebellar peduncles increased dramatically with age during childhood, with rapid development in controls, but not in Friedreich ataxia. Many imaging POMs showed significant associations with clinical severity.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings provide strong imaging evidence of impaired development of spinal cord and superior cerebellar peduncles during childhood in Friedreich ataxia and open the way for the use of neuroimaging biomarkers in clinical trials. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Failure to manage emotional withdrawal symptoms can exacerbate relapse to methamphetamine use. Understanding the neuro-mechanisms underlying methamphetamine overuse and the associated emotional withdrawal symptoms is crucial for developing effective clinical strategies. This study aimed to investigate the distinct functional contributions of fine-scale gyro-sulcal signaling in the psychopathology of patients with methamphetamine use disorder and its associations with emotional symptoms. We recruited 48 male abstinent methamphetamine use disorders and 48 age- and gender-matched healthy controls, obtaining their resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data along with scores on anxiety and depressive symptoms. The proposed deep learning model, a spatio-temporal graph convolutional network utilizing gyro-sulcal subdivisions, achieved the highest average classification accuracy in distinguishing resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data of methamphetamine use disorders from healthy controls. Within this model, nodes in the lateral orbitofrontal cortex, and the habitual and executive control networks, contributed most significantly to the classification. Additionally, emotional symptom scores were negatively correlated with the sum of negative functional connectivity in the right caudal anterior cingulate sulcus and the functional connectivity between the left putamen and pallidum in methamphetamine use disorders. These findings provide novel insights into the differential functions of gyral and sulcal regions, enhancing our understanding of the neuro-mechanisms underlying methamphetamine use disorders.</span>

                <p>Alpha (8&ndash;12&nbsp;Hz) oscillations and default mode network (DMN) activity dominate the brain's intrinsic activity in the temporal and spatial domains, respectively. They are thought to play crucial roles in the spatiotemporal organization of the complex brain system. Relatedly, both have been implicated, often concurrently, in diverse neuropsychiatric disorders, with accruing electroencephalogram (EEG)/magnetoencephalogram and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data linking these two neural activities both at rest and during key cognitive operations. Prominent theories and extant findings thus converge to suggest a mechanistic relationship between alpha oscillations and the DMN. Here, we leveraged simultaneous EEG&ndash;fMRI data acquired before and after alpha-frequency transcranial alternating current stimulation (<I>&alpha;</I>-tACS) and observed that <I>&alpha;</I>-tACS tightened the dynamic coupling between spontaneous fluctuations in alpha power and DMN connectivity (especially, in the posterior DMN, between the posterior cingulate cortex and the bilateral angular gyrus). In comparison, no significant changes were observed for temporal correlations between power in other oscillatory frequencies and connectivity in other major networks. These results thus suggest an inherent coupling between alpha and DMN activity in humans. Importantly, these findings highlight the efficacy of <I>&alpha;</I>-tACS in regulating the DMN, a clinically significant network that is challenging to target directly with noninvasive methods.</p>

                <p>Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects 8&ndash;12% of children globally. Hyperactivity-related behaviors, as well as inattention and impulsivity, are regarded as the nuclear symptoms of ADHD. At present, its etiologies and risk factors are unknown. Previous research linked TARP -8 deficiency to ADHD-like behaviors in mice, including hyperactivity, impulsivity, and memory deficits. Aniracetam, a nootropic drug, enhances cognition by modulating cholinergic activity and glutamate receptors, offering neuroprotective effects. This study examined TARP -8 knockout (KO) mice at 4 and 8 weeks, assessing behaviors through locomotor activity, cliff avoidance, novel object recognition, and contextual fear conditioning tests. TARP -8 KO mice exhibited hyperactivity, reduced recognition memory, and impaired short-term memory and long-term memory. Aniracetam administration improved these behavioral deficits, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic agent for ADHD. The findings align with ADHD&rsquo;s pathophysiology, resembling the neurological impairments in TARP -8 KO mice. Aniracetam shows promise as a novel treatment for ADHD symptoms, highlighting its therapeutic value.</p>

                Objective This scoping review aims to map and synthesise the current research evidence targeting the electroencephalography (EEG) neural correlates during pregnancy and its association with parenting-related measures during pregnancy and postpartum period. Introduction Pregnancy is characterised by a wide range of biological changes associated with adaptation to parenthood. A growing body of literature has examined the neural correlates of pregnancy using EEG, revealing distinct patterns in pregnant females, with these EEG metrics changing throughout gestation and postpartum. Due to the heterogeneity of the evidence, the current literature lacks an organised synthesis, making it difficult to understand the neural correlates during pregnancy and their association with parenting-related measures during pregnancy and postpartum period. Inclusion criteria Studies will be included if they contain a quantitative EEG metric in their assessment in pregnant women. Studies will be included if they involve clinical or community samples. No sociodemographic, obstetric, or health exclusion criteria will be applied. Methods The scoping review will be conducted following the Joanna Briggs Institute’s (JBI) guidelines and will be reported following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines. Searches will be conducted in 7 databases (Cochrane for Trials and Reviews, PsycInfo, PubMed, Psychological and Behavioural Science Collection, Scopus and Web of Science Core Collection) for articles published in English, Portuguese, or Spanish with no limitation on the region or publication time frame. Two independent reviewers will screen each record following a standardised flowchart using asreview lab. Data extraction will be performed by the two reviewers using charting tables in Excel. Disagreements at any step will be resolved via consensus or by a third reviewer. Results will be reported using tables and graphs along with a descriptive analysis, according to the research questions.

                Background SARS-CoV has caused a high number of COVID-19 cases in Indonesia. COVID-19 cases continue to be reported, including incidents of the latest variant of SARS-CoV-2, Omicron. The development of vaccines remains essential to address potential future outbreaks. Methods We performed whole genome sequencing using Oxford Nanopore Technology and phylogenetic and mutational analysis using Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis to identify potential isolates as a new platform vaccine candidate. Results Nine isolates have the potential to serve as candidates for the next generation COVID-19 vaccine. The sequencing test results of the nine selected isolates revealed that two samples were identified as the alpha variant, two as the delta variant, and five as the Omicron variant. Alpha variant has been identified as B.1 lineage, the delta variant with lineage AY.23, and the omicron variant with three lineages including BA.1.1, BA.5.2, and BQ.1.23 lineages. Phylogenetic analysis revealed five distinct classes: 20A, 21J, 21K, 22B, and 22E. The quantification of SARS-CoV-2 amino acid mutations in structural proteins revealed that the spike protein had the highest mutation percentage at 44.56%, followed by the N protein at 9.05%, the M protein at 5.54%, and the E protein at 1.78%. Conclusions It was concluded that nine isolates had potential to be developed as candidates for the next generation SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. These isolates include three variants: alpha, delta, and omicron.

                Climate change significantly affects smallholder farmers, whose livelihoods are closely tied to the environment. This study explores factors influencing the adoption of climate-smart agriculture (CSA) practices and their impact on crop productivity among small-scale farmers in Nyimba District, Zambia. Data were collected from 194 households across 12 villages, and logistic regression and propensity score matching analyses were employed to identify key factors and evaluate CSA’s effects on crop yields. Findings revealed that CSA adoption is influenced by factors such as education level, household size, fertilizer use, age, gender, farming experience, livestock ownership, income, farmland size, marital status, and access to climate-related information. CSA adopters experienced a 20.20% increase in overall crop yields compared to non-adopters, with a 21.50% increase in maize yields specifically. The study underscores the need for targeted interventions to support CSA adoption through education, improved dissemination of climate information, and access to critical resources such as improved seeds and financial services. This research offers insights for policymakers and extension services to develop evidence-based strategies enhancing resilience and productivity among smallholder farmers in response to climate challenges.

                This paper explores the theoretical existence and implications of dark quarks and their role in forming dark hadrons, dark neutron stars, and dark black holes. By simplifying the relationship between hadron charge and quark number, we propose a more transparent and theoretically elegant framework for understanding the charge structure of fundamental particles. We introduce a classification system that distinguishes between bright and dark particles based on their charge and color charge properties, leading to potential extensions in particle physics models. Furthermore, we investigate the nature of dark black holes, differentiating them from bright black holes, and discuss their potential observational signatures in astrophysics. This study provides a theoretical foundation for future explorations of dark matter and its interactions in the universe.

Learned olfactory-guided navigation is a powerful platform for studying how a brain generates goal-directed behaviors. However, the quantitative changes that occur in sensorimotor transformations and the underlying neural circuit substrates to generate such learning-dependent navigation is still unclear. Here we investigate learned sensorimotor processing for navigation in the nematode <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> by measuring and modeling experience-dependent odor and salt chemotaxis. We then explore the neural basis of learned odor navigation through perturbation experiments. We develop a novel statistical model to characterize how the worm employs two behavioral strategies: a biased random walk and weathervaning. We infer weights on these strategies and characterize sensorimotor kernels that govern them by fitting our model to the worm’s time-varying navigation trajectories and precise sensory experiences. After olfactory learning, the fitted odor kernels reflect how appetitive and aversive trained worms up- and down-regulate both strategies, respectively. The model predicts an animal’s past olfactory learning experience with  > 90<i>%</i> accuracy given finite observations, outperforming a classical chemotaxis metric. The model trained on natural odors further predicts the animals’ learning-dependent response to optogenetically induced odor perception. Our measurements and model show that behavioral variability is altered by learning—trained worms exhibit less variable navigation than naive ones. Genetically disrupting individual interneuron classes downstream of an odor-sensing neuron reveals that learned navigation strategies are distributed in the network. Together, we present a flexible navigation algorithm that is supported by distributed neural computation in a compact brain.

                Objective To determine whether economic factors are crucial in empowering women, guiding them towards growth and development opportunities, achieving empowerment, and contributing to two sustainable development goals of the 2030 development agenda: ending poverty and achieving gender equality. Methodology The research was foundational, with a phenomenological and hermeneutic design. The applied technique was in-depth interviews with 12 women who had started a business within the last five years in a region of Peru. Results It is evident that economic factors are decisive in business experiences and decisions, highlighting the necessity of having contingency funds to prevent operational impacts. Through entrepreneurship, women achieved economic independence, enabling them to support their families and impacting their empowerment. It concludes that to promote economic opportunity equality, addressing financing needs, encouraging economic independence, strengthening family empowerment, improving customer management, and facilitating access to government funds are essential. Conclusions The narrative of the participants provides a solid foundation for designing specific policies and support programs that boost the economic empowerment of women entrepreneurs and encourage their active participation in the business sphere.

                In Peru, insect consumption, as a nutritional complement or as the main source in the diet, is limited to the regions of our the central jungle where Atta sexdens ants are consumed. An energy bar based on Andean grains with Atta sexdens ant flour was formulated. The ants were obtained from the department of San Martin, district of Rioja, province of Rioja. Four different formulations were prepared with different Atta sexdens ant flour concentrations: 15%, 20%, 25%, and 30%. Moisture, total fat, ash, proteins, fiber, carbohydrates, instrumental texture, and organoleptic analysis (taste, texture, and color) were performed. The developed cereal energy bar presented a 10 g protein content in 100 g of the final product. Acceptability was evaluated in adolescents and young adult populations. The developed cereal bars presented a high protein content, adequate organoleptic properties and high acceptability. However, this must be considered in the context of the rising cost of protein-rich foods.

                Background Hypertension is a significant risk factor for cardiovascular disease, contributing to global mortality and disability. Approximately 30% of Indian adults are diagnosed with hypertension. Evidence supports that self-monitoring and blood pressure self-management can lower systolic BP by an average of 3.2 mmHg. mHealth applications facilitate remote monitoring and self-management, yet existing applications in India lack customisation for user needs, limiting their usability. This study aims to develop and evaluate a novel, user-friendly mHealth application tailored to hypertensive individuals. Methods This study follows an Agile development design, an iterative software development approach that allows continuous feedback and refinement. The research will be conducted in three phases over an anticipated duration of 27 months. Phase 1 (6 months) will involve in-depth interviews and focus group discussions to identify essential features for a customised Android-based mHealth application. Phase 2 (9 months) will involve developing the application using Android Studio following Agile principles. Phase 3 (12 months) will be a community-based cluster randomised trial conducted in 12 villages to evaluate the application’s effectiveness. Villages will be randomised into intervention and control groups. Each group will include 118 participants. The intervention group will use the mHealth application, while the control group will follow the standard hypertension management regimen. Villages and participants will be selected based on specific criteria, including population size, availability of healthcare facilities, and smartphone accessibility among hypertensive patients. Results In the proposed study, if the intervention is helpful, hypertension patients in the community can be encouraged to use the mHealth application. If found effective, this application is anticipated to improve hypertensive patients’ health status, knowledge, and self-care approach.
