	<p>In a recent paper, Share discussed four different &amp;amp;ldquo;Common Misconceptions about the Phonological Deficit Theory of Dyslexia&amp;amp;rdquo; and described this theory as &amp;amp;ldquo;a model of true scientific progress&amp;amp;rdquo; and a clear &amp;amp;ldquo;success story&amp;amp;rdquo;. In this note, I argue that at least part of the success of this theory is due to the lack of explicit predictions which make it very difficult (if possible) to test its predictions, and, possibly, falsify the theory. Some areas of pertinent research, including categorical phoneme perception, picture naming, and phonological awareness are summarized. Furthermore, two lines of research in which groups of researchers have attempted to formulate more explicit predictions are briefly outlined. It is concluded that, although much research has variously referred to the phonological deficit theory of dyslexia, the resulting large body of evidence presents a complex pattern of results which, in the absence of an explicit formulation of the theory, is extremely difficult to frame within a unitary interpretation. Overall, what seems needed is a theoretical formulation that, on the one hand, can account for the complex pattern of available evidence and, on the other hand, provide testable predictions for future research.</p>

	<p>Sleep inertia (SI) refers to a complex psychophysiological phenomenon observed after morning awakening that can be described as the gradual recovery of waking-like status after a night of sleep. The time course of SI dissipation in an everyday life condition is little studied. The present study aims to investigate the SI dissipation in motor activity, as a function of age, upon spontaneous morning awakening after a usual night-time sleep. To this end, we performed a retrospective study in a naturalistic setting in a wide life span sample: 382 healthy participants (219 females) from middle childhood (9 years old) to late adulthood (70 years old). Participants were required to wear the actigraph on the non-dominant wrist for at least seven consecutive nights. Results show that SI of motor activity is dissipated in 70 min. Mean motor activity in such a time window was significantly modulated by age: lower age corresponded to higher motor activity.</p>

<p>Interleukin-18 may regulate the inflammatory response after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) through the activation of microglia. It is expected to be a promising therapeutic target for secondary brain injury after ICH.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Interleukin-18 (IL-18), a pro-inflammatory cytokine, is thought to be associated with inflammation in many neurological diseases such as ischemic stroke and poststroke depression, but the role of IL-18 in inflammatory injury after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) remains unclear. In this study, we established the ICH model in male mice and found that IL-18 expression including protein and mRNA levels was significantly increased in brain tissues after ICH. Meanwhile, exogenous IL-18 exacerbated cerebral hematoma and neurological deficits following ICH. In the IL-18 knockout group, the size of hematoma and neurological functions after ICH was decreased compared with the wild-type group, suggesting the critical role of IL-18 on the modulation of brain injury after ICH. Importantly, exogenous IL-18 increased microglial activation in brain tissues after ICH. Furthermore, IL-18 knockout resulted in the reduction of activated microglia after ICH. These results indicated that IL-18 may regulate the inflammatory response after ICH through the activation of microglia. Thus, IL-18 is expected to be a promising therapeutic target for secondary brain injury after ICH.</p>

     alt="Multimodal magnetic resonance imaging quantification of gray matter alterations in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder"/>
<p>Using neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging and synthetic magnetic resonance imaging-derived myelin volume fraction, we showed gray matter alterations in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD). Our findings suggested extensive neuroinflammation, along with a lesser extent demyelination and neuronal loss in RRMS. In contrast, we observed substantial neuronal loss with no evidence of demyelination and neuroinflammation in NMOSD.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Herein, we combined neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) and synthetic magnetic resonance imaging (SyMRI) to evaluate the spatial distribution and extent of gray matter (GM) microstructural alterations in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD). The NODDI (neurite density index [NDI], orientation dispersion index [ODI], and isotropic volume fraction [ISOVF]) and SyMRI (myelin volume fraction [MVF]) measures were compared between age- and sex-matched groups of 30 patients with RRMS (6 males and 24 females; mean age, 51.43 ± 8.02 years), 18 patients with anti-aquaporin-4 antibody-positive NMOSD (2 males and 16 females; mean age, 52.67 ± 16.07 years), and 19 healthy controls (6 males and 13 females; mean age, 51.47 ± 9.25 years) using GM-based spatial statistical analysis. Patients with RRMS showed reduced NDI and MVF and increased ODI and ISOVF, predominantly in the limbic and paralimbic regions, when compared with healthy controls, while only increases in ODI and ISOVF were observed when compared with NMOSD. Compared to NDI and MVF, the changes in ODI and ISOVF were observed more widely, including in the cerebellar cortex. These abnormalities were associated with disease progression and disability. In contrast, patients with NMOSD only showed reduced NDI mainly in the cerebellar, limbic, and paralimbic cortices when compared with healthy controls and patients with RRMS. Taken together, our study supports the notion that GM pathologies in RRMS are distinct from those of NMOSD. However, owing to the limitations of the study, the results should be cautiously interpreted.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Sex Differences in Behavioral Responding and Dopamine Release during Pavlovian Learning</a></h4>

              
                <p>Learning associations between cues and rewards require the mesolimbic dopamine system. The dopamine response to cues signals differences in reward value in well trained animals. However, these value-related dopamine responses are absent during early training sessions when cues signal differences in the reward rate. These findings suggest cue-evoked dopamine release conveys differences between outcomes only after extensive training, though it is unclear whether this is unique to when cues signal differences in reward rate, or whether this is also evident when cues signal differences in other value-related parameters such as reward size. To address this, we used a Pavlovian conditioning task in which one audio cue was associated with a small reward (one pellet) and another audio cue was associated with a large reward (three pellets). We performed fast-scan cyclic voltammetry to record changes in dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens of male and female rats throughout learning. While female rats exhibited higher levels of conditioned responding, a faster latency to respond, and elevated post-reward head entries relative to male rats, there were no sex differences in the dopamine response to cues. Multiple training sessions were required before cue-evoked dopamine release signaled differences in reward size. Reward-evoked dopamine release scaled with reward size, though females displayed lower reward-evoked dopamine responses relative to males. Conditioned responding related to the decrease in the peak reward-evoked dopamine response and not to cue-evoked dopamine release. Collectively, these data illustrate sex differences in behavioral responding as well as in reward-evoked dopamine release during Pavlovian learning.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Stimulus Generalization in Mice during Pavlovian Eyeblink Conditioning</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Here, we investigate stimulus generalization in a cerebellar learning paradigm, called eyeblink conditioning. Mice were conditioned to close their eyes in response to a 10-kHz tone by repeatedly pairing this tone with an air puff to the eye 250 ms after tone onset. After 10 consecutive days of training, when mice showed reliable conditioned eyelid responses to the 10-kHz tone, we started to expose them to tones with other frequencies, ranging from 2 to 20 kHz. We found that mice had a strong generalization gradient, whereby the probability and amplitude of conditioned eyelid responses gradually decreases depending on the dissimilarity with the 10-kHz tone. Tones with frequencies closest to 10 kHz evoked the most and largest conditioned eyelid responses and each step away from the 10-kHz tone resulted in fewer and smaller conditioned responses (CRs). In addition, we found that tones with lower frequencies resulted in CRs that peaked earlier after tone onset compared with those to tones with higher frequencies. Together, our data show prominent generalization patterns in cerebellar learning. Since the known function of cerebellum is rapidly expanding from pure motor control to domains that include cognition, reward-learning, fear-learning, social function, and even addiction, our data imply generalization controlled by cerebellum in all these domains.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Incorporating regulatory interactions into gene-set analyses for GWAS data: A controlled analysis with the MAGMA tool</a></h4>

              
                <p>by David Groenewoud, Avinoam Shye, Ran Elkon</p>

To date, genome-wide association studies have identified thousands of statistically-significant associations between genetic variants, and phenotypes related to a myriad of traits and diseases. A key goal for human-genetics research is to translate these associations into functional mechanisms. Popular gene-set analysis tools, like MAGMA, map variants to genes they might affect, and then integrate genome-wide association study data (that is, variant-level associations for a phenotype) to score genes for association with a phenotype. Gene scores are subsequently used in competitive gene-set analyses to identify biological processes that are enriched for phenotype association. By default, variants are mapped to genes in their proximity. However, many variants that affect phenotypes are thought to act at regulatory elements, which can be hundreds of kilobases away from their target genes. Thus, we explored the idea of augmenting a proximity-based mapping scheme with publicly-available datasets of regulatory interactions. We used MAGMA to analyze genome-wide association study data for ten different phenotypes, and evaluated the effects of augmentation by comparing numbers, and identities, of genes and gene sets detected as statistically significant between mappings. We detected several pitfalls and confounders of such “augmented analyses”, and introduced ways to control for them. Using these controls, we demonstrated that augmentation with datasets of regulatory interactions only occasionally strengthened the enrichment for phenotype association amongst (biologically-relevant) gene sets for different phenotypes. Still, in such cases, genes and regulatory elements responsible for the improvement could be pinpointed. For instance, using brain regulatory-interactions for augmentation, we were able to implicate two acetylcholine receptor subunits involved in post-synaptic chemical transmission, namely <i>CHRNB2</i> and <i>CHRNE</i>, in schizophrenia. Collectively, our study presents a critical approach for integrating regulatory interactions into gene-set analyses for genome-wide association study data, by introducing various controls to distinguish genuine results from spurious discoveries.

<p>Following quinolinic acid (QA) intrastriatal injection, glutaric acidemia type I (GA-I) animal model is more susceptible to QA-induced severe seizures, develops spontaneous recurrent seizures, and presents increased mortality rate and persistent changes in brain cortical oscillation patterns. This emphasizes the crucial role of QA in neurological impairment in GA-I</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Glutaric acidemia type I (GA-I) is an inborn error of metabolism of lysine, hydroxylysine, and tryptophan, caused by glutaryl-CoA-dehydrogenase (GCDH) deficiency, characterized by the buildup of toxic organic acids predominantly in the brain. After acute catabolic states, patients usually develop striatal degeneration, but the mechanisms behind this damage are still unknown. Quinolinic acid (QA), a metabolite of the kynurenine pathway, increases especially during infections/inflammatory processes, and could act synergically with organic acids, contributing to the neurological features of GA-I. The aim of this study was to investigate whether QA increases seizure susceptibility and modifies brain oscillation patterns in an animal model of GA-I, the <i>Gcdh<sup>−/−</sup>
</i> mice taking high-lysine diet (<i>Gcdh<sup>−/−</sup>
</i>-Lys). Therefore, the characteristics of QA-induced seizures and changes in brain oscillatory patterns were evaluated by video-electroencephalography (EEG) analysis recorded in <i>Gcdh<sup>−/−</sup>-</i>Lys, <i>Gcdh<sup>+/+</sup>-</i>Lys, and <i>Gcdh<sup>−/−</sup>
</i>-N (normal diet) animals. We found that the number of seizures <i>per</i> animal was similar for all groups receiving QA, <i>Gcdh<sup>−/−</sup>
</i>-Lys-QA, <i>Gcdh</i>
<sup>+/+</sup>-Lys-QA, and <i>Gcdh<sup>−/−</sup>
</i>-N-QA. However, severe seizures were observed in the majority of <i>Gcdh<sup>−/−</sup>
</i>-Lys-QA mice (82%), and only in 25% of <i>Gcdh</i>
<sup>+/+</sup>-Lys-QA and 44% of <i>Gcdh<sup>−/−</sup>
</i>-N-QA mice. All <i>Gcdh<sup>−/−</sup>
</i>-Lys animals developed spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRS), but <i>Gcdh<sup>−/−</sup>
</i>-Lys-QA animals had increased number of SRS, higher mortality rate, and significant predominance of lower frequency oscillations on EEG. Our results suggest that QA plays an important role in the neurological features of GA-I, as <i>Gcdh<sup>−/−</sup>
</i>-Lys mice exhibit increased susceptibility to intrastriatal QA-induced seizures and long-term changes in brain oscillations.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Approximately 1 in 36 children are diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The disorder is four times more common in males than in females. Zinc deficiency and mutations in <i>SHANK2</i> and <i>SHANK3</i> (members of a family of excitatory postsynaptic scaffolding proteins) are all risk factors that may contribute to the pathophysiology of the disease. The presence of shankopathies (loss of one copy of the <i>SHANK3</i> gene) can lead to the development of Phelan-McDermid syndrome (PMDS)—a rare genetic disorder characterized by developmental delay, intellectual disability, poor motor tone, and ASD-like symptoms. We reviewed the relationship between zinc, ASD, and PMDS as well as the effect of zinc supplementation in improving symptoms of ASD and PMDS based on 22 studies published within 6 years (2015–2020). Zinc deficiency (assessed by either dietary intake, blood, hair, or tooth matrix) was shown to be highly prevalent in ASD and PMDS patients as well as in preclinical models of ASD and PMDS. Zinc supplements improved the behavioral deficits in animal models of ASD and PMDS. Clinical trials are still needed to validate the beneficial therapeutic effects of zinc supplements in ASD and PMDS patients.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=10974547&type=etoc&feed=rss">Regulation of AMPAR trafficking in synaptic plasticity by BDNF and the impact of neurodegenerative disease</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Research demonstrates that the neural mechanisms underlying synaptic plasticity and learning and memory involve mobilization of AMPA-type neurotransmitter receptors at glutamatergic synaptic contacts, and that these mechanisms are targeted during neurodegenerative disease. Strengthening neural transmission occurs with insertion of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPARs) into synapses while weakening results from receptor withdrawal. A key player in the trafficking of AMPARs during plasticity and learning is the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling system. BDNF is a neurotrophic factor that supports neuronal growth and is required for learning and memory. Significantly, a primary feature of many neurodegenerative diseases is a reduction in BDNF protein as well as disrupted neuronal surface expression of synaptic AMPARs. The resulting weakening of synaptic contacts leads to synapse loss and neuronal degeneration that underlies the cognitive impairment and dementia observed in patients with progressive neurodegenerative disease such as Alzheimer’s. In the face of these data, one therapeutic approach is to increase BDNF bioavailability in brain. While this has been met with significant challenges, the results of the research have been promising. In spite of this, there are currently no clinical trials to test many of these findings on patients. Here, research showing that BDNF drives AMPARs to synapses, AMPAR trafficking is essential for synaptic plasticity and learning, and that neurodegenerative disease results in a significant decline in BDNF will be reviewed. The aim is to draw attention to the need for increasing patient-directed clinical studies to test the possible benefits of increasing levels of neurotrophins, specifically BDNF, to treat brain disorders. Much is known about the cellular mechanisms that underlie learning and memory in brain. It can be concluded that signaling by neurotrophins like BDNF and AMPA-type glutamate receptor synaptic trafficking are fundamental to these processes. Data from animal models and patients reveal that these mechanisms are adversely targeted during neurodegenerative disease and results in memory loss and cognitive decline. A brief summary of our understanding of these mechanisms indicates that it is time to apply this knowledge base directly to development of therapeutic treatments that enhance neurotrophins for brain disorders in patient populations.</p>

     alt="Comparison of prefrontal cortex sucrose seeking ensembles engaged in multiple seeking sessions: Context is key"/>
<p>TetTag mice self-administered sucrose, then underwent two seeking sessions either in the same or distinct environments. Reactivation of a prelimbic cortex ensemble tagged during the first seeking session shifted from being proportional to operant responding (cue reactivity) in the same context to goal directed (sucrose retrieval responding) in the distinct context.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Encoding of memories, including those associated with prior drug or reward, is thought to take place within distinct populations of neurons, termed ensembles. Neuronal ensembles for drug- and reward-seeking have been identified in regions of the medial prefrontal cortex, but much of our understanding of these ensembles is based on experiments that take place in a single reward-associated environment and measure ensemble encoding over short durations of time. In contrast, reward seeking behavior is evident across different reward-associated environments and persists over time. Using TetTag mice and Fos immunohistochemistry, we examined the relationship between persistent sucrose-seeking and ensemble encoding in mice that undergo seeking sessions in the same or different sucrose self-administration contexts 2 weeks apart. We found that prelimbic (PrL) and anterior cingulate cortex ensembles tagged in the first seeking session were highly sensitive to the context in which a second seeking session took place: reactivation of these ensembles was reduced in the same context but elevated in a distinct sucrose self-administration context. Correlational analyses revealed that ensemble reactivation in the PrL was proportional to the persistence of sucrose seeking behavior across sessions in differing ways in female mice. In the same context, reactivation was proportional to the persistence of non-reinforced operant responses, whereas in a distinct context, reactivation was proportional to the persistence of non-reinforced head entries into the sucrose receptacle. This study underlines the importance of the medial prefrontal cortex importance in maintaining a reward-seeking ensemble over time and identifies context-dependent changes in behavioral correlates of ensemble reactivation.</p>

     alt="Tau nuclear translocation is a leading step in tau pathology process through P53 stabilization and nucleolar dispersion"/>
<p>P53 is typically degraded by proteasomes, with Mdm2 playing a significant role. Under tauopathy stress, pathogenic P-tau (<i>cis</i> P-tau, AT8, and AT100 P-tau) are formed in the neurites. They gradually moved from the neurites into the soma and nucleus. P-tau nuclear mislocalization is accompanied by p53 stabilization, bax, and cleaved caspase-3 formation, and significant nucleolar dispersion, ultimately leading to neuron death. <i>Cis</i>Pt, <i>Cis</i> P-tau; AT8, AT8 P-tau; AT100, AT100 P-tau; CBax, cleaved bax; CCasp3, cleaved caspase-3; Cytoc, Cytochrome c.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Tau protein abnormalities are associated with various neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and traumatic brain injury (TBI). In tau-overexpressing SHSY5Y cells and iPSC-derived neuron models of frontotemporal dementia (FTD), axonal tau translocates into the nuclear compartment, resulting in neuronal dysfunction. Despite extensive research, the mechanisms by which tau translocation results in neurodegeneration remain elusive thus far. We studied the nuclear displacement of different P-tau species [<i>Cis</i> phosphorylated Thr231-tau (<i>cis</i> P-tau), phosphorylated Ser202/Thr205-tau (AT8 P-tau), and phosphorylated Thr212/Ser214-tau (AT100 P-tau)] at various time points using starvation in primary cortical neurons and single severe TBI (ssTBI) in male mouse cerebral cortices as tauopathy models. While all P-tau species translocated into the somatodendritic compartment in response to stress, <i>cis</i> P-tau did so more rapidly than the other species. Notably, nuclear localization of P-tau was associated with p53 apoptotic stabilization and nucleolar stress, both of which resulted in neurodegeneration. In summary, our findings indicate that P-tau nuclear translocation results in p53-dependent apoptosis and nucleolar dispersion, which is consistent with neurodegeneration.</p>

<p>Flavonoids slow down the death of photoreceptors in retinitis pigmentosa caused by the P23H rhodopsin mutation by stabilizing the structural conformation of the receptor mutant and decreasing the cellular stress response.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The balanced homeostasis of the G protein–coupled receptor (GPCR), rhodopsin (Rho), is required for vision. Misfolding mutations in Rho cause photoreceptor death, leading to retinitis pigmentosa (RP) and consequently blindness. With no cure currently available, the development of efficient therapy for RP is an urgent need. Pharmacological supplementation with molecular chaperones, including flavonoids, improves stability, folding, and membrane targeting of the RP Rho mutants in vitro. Thus, we hypothesized that flavonoids by binding to P23H Rho and enhancing its conformational stability could mitigate detrimental effects of this mutation on retinal health. In this work, we evaluated the pharmacological potential of two model flavonoids, quercetin and myricetin, by using in silico, in vitro, and in vivo models of P23H Rho. Our computational analysis showed that quercetin could interact within the orthosteric binding pocket of P23H Rho and shift the conformation of its N-terminal loop toward the wild type (WT)-like state. Quercetin added to the NIH-3T3 cells stably expressing P23H Rho increased the stability of this receptor and improved its function. Systemic administration of quercetin to P23H Rho knock-in mice substantially improved retinal morphology and function, which was associated with an increase in levels of Rho and cone opsins. In addition, treatment with quercetin resulted in downregulation of the UPR signaling and oxidative stress-related markers. This study unravels the pharmacological potential of quercetin to slow down the progression of photoreceptor death in Rho-related RP and highlights its prospective as a lead compound to develop a novel therapeutic remedy to counter RP pathology.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Fear-related disorders, mainly phobias and post-traumatic stress disorder, are highly prevalent, debilitating disorders that pose a significant public health problem. They are characterized by aberrant processing of aversive experiences and dysregulated fear extinction, leading to excessive expression of fear and diminished quality of life. The gold standard for treating fear-related disorders is extinction-based exposure therapy (ET), shown to be ineffective for up to 35% of subjects. Moreover, ET combined with traditional pharmacological treatments for fear-related disorders, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, offers no further advantage to patients. This prompted the search for ways to improve ET outcomes, with current research focused on pharmacological agents that can augment ET by strengthening fear extinction learning. Hallucinogenic drugs promote reprocessing of fear-imbued memories and induce positive mood and openness, relieving anxiety and enabling the necessary emotional engagement during psychotherapeutic interventions. Mechanistically, hallucinogens induce dynamic structural and functional neuroplastic changes across the fear extinction circuitry and temper amygdala's hyperreactivity to threat-related stimuli, effectively mitigating one of the hallmarks of fear-related disorders. This paper provides the first comprehensive review of hallucinogens' potential to alleviate symptoms of fear-related disorders by focusing on their effects on fear extinction and the underlying molecular mechanisms. We overview both preclinical and clinical studies and emphasize the advantages of hallucinogenic drugs over current first-line treatments. We highlight 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine and ketamine as the most effective therapeutics for fear-related disorders and discuss the potential molecular mechanisms responsible for their potency with implications for improving hallucinogen-assisted psychotherapy.</p>

<p>Ethnicity/race moderated the relationships between knee pain, pain catastrophizing, and resting-state functional connectivity in non-Hispanic Black and non-Hispanic White participants. Further investigations of the factors influencing sociodemographic differences are needed.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Chronic pain is a significant public health problem, and the prevalence and societal impact continues to worsen annually. Multiple cognitive and emotional factors are known to modulate pain, including pain catastrophizing, which contributes to pain facilitation and is associated with altered resting-state functional connectivity in pain-related cortical and subcortical circuitry. Pain and catastrophizing levels are reported to be higher in non-Hispanic black (NHB) compared with non-Hispanic White (NHW) individuals. The current study, a substudy of a larger ongoing observational cohort investigation, investigated the pathways by which ethnicity/race influences the relationship between pain catastrophizing, clinical pain, and resting-state functional connectivity between anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), insula, and primary somatosensory cortex (S1). Participants included 136 (66 NHBs and 70 NHWs) community-dwelling adults with knee osteoarthritis. Participants completed the Coping Strategies Questionnaire-Revised Pain Catastrophizing subscale and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index. Magnetic resonance imaging data were obtained, and resting-state functional connectivity was analyzed. Relative to NHW, the NHB participants were younger, reported lower income, were less likely to be married, and self-reported greater clinical pain and pain catastrophizing (<i>p</i>s &lt; 0.05). Ethnicity/race moderated the mediation effects of catastrophizing on the relationship between clinical pain and resting-state functional connectivity between the ACC, dlPFC, insula, and S1. These results indicate the NHB and NHW groups demonstrated different relationships between pain, catastrophizing, and functional connectivity. These results provide evidence for a potentially important role of ethnicity/race in the interrelationships among pain, catastrophizing, and resting-state functional connectivity.</p>

     alt="Lateral entorhinal cortex lesions impair odor-context associative memory in male rats"/>
<p>Rats with lesions of lateral entorhinal cortex have impaired memory for associations of odors and contexts while their memory for individual items is unaffected. This suggests that integration of associative information occurs at the level of lateral entorhinal cortex as well as the hippocampus.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) has been hypothesized to process nonspatial, item information that is combined with spatial information from medial entorhinal cortex to form episodic memories within the hippocampus. Recent studies, however, have demonstrated that LEC has a role in integrating features of episodic memory prior to the hippocampus. While the precise role of LEC is still unclear, anatomical studies show that LEC is ideally placed to be a hub integrating multisensory information. The current study tests whether the role of LEC in integrating information extends to long-term multimodal item-context associations. In Experiment 1, male rats were trained on a context-dependent odor discrimination task, where two different contexts served as the cue to the correct odor. Rats were pretrained on the task and then received either bilateral excitotoxic LEC or sham lesions. Following surgery, rats were tested on the previously learned odor-context associations. Control rats showed good memory for the previously learned association but rats with LEC lesions showed significantly impaired performance relative to both their own presurgery performance and to control rats. Experiment 2 went on to test whether impairments in Experiment 1 were the result of LEC lesions impairing either odor or context memory retention alone. Male rats were trained on simple odor and context discrimination tasks that did not require integration of features to solve. Following surgery, both LEC and control rats showed good memory for previously learned odors and contexts. These data show that LEC is critical for long-term odor-context associative memory.</p>

<p>Very low (≤0.5 Gy) radiation doses twice per week (ultra-hyper fractionated radiotherapy) started soon after the last standard 2.0 Gy radiotherapeutic fraction may help to control high-grade glioma progression (image credits: University of Utah).</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Ionizing radiation is a mainstay of high-grade glioma therapy. The current standard radiotherapeutic schedule involves a total 60 Gy split in 2.0 Gy fractions delivered on weekdays for six weeks. Thereafter, almost invariably the tumor relapses and progresses. <i>In vitro</i> studies have demonstrated that the therapeutic effectiveness of ionizing radiation towards high-grade glioma cells is greatly increased by splitting the total dose in fractions ten times smaller [0.1–0.5 Gy instead of standard 2.0 Gy—ultra-hyper-fractionated radiotherapy (ultra-hyper-FRT)]. Recently, it became possible to consistently translate this therapeutic effect to the animal setting, by using glioma-initiating cell-driven faithful animal modeling. A re-analysis of the literature reporting radiotherapeutic clinical trials also suggests that the lower the average fraction size, the higher is the achievable overall survival of patients. However, average fraction sizes ≤ 0.5 Gy have never been thoroughly investigated in the clinics. We propose to study in the clinical setting the therapeutic effect of an ultra-hyper-FRT schedule promptly extending the conventional radiation component of the current guidelines (“Stupp”) therapeutic protocol.</p>

     alt="Neural alterations in working memory of mild-moderate TBI: An fMRI study in Malaysia"/>
<p>The conventional letter n-back task elicited stronger activation in the mild–moderate TBI participants than the guided letter n-back. In TBI, there was a right dominance for working memory (WM) in the prefrontal cortex and precentral gyrus. Meanwhile, the load-dependent processing of WM was localized to the left middle frontal gyrus.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Working memory (WM) encompasses crucial cognitive processes or abilities to retain and manipulate temporary information for immediate execution of complex cognitive tasks in daily functioning such as reasoning and decision-making. The WM of individuals sustaining traumatic brain injury (TBI) was commonly compromised, especially in the domain of WM. The current study investigated the brain responses of WM in a group of participants with mild–moderate TBI compared to their healthy counterparts employing functional magnetic resonance imaging. All consented participants (healthy: <i>n</i> = 26 and TBI: <i>n</i> = 15) performed two variations of the n-back WM task with four load conditions (0-, 1-, 2-, and 3-back). The respective within-group effects showed a right hemisphere-dominance activation and slower reaction in performance for the TBI group. Random-effects analysis revealed activation difference between the two groups in the right occipital lobe in the guided n-back with cues, and in the bilateral occipital lobe, superior parietal region, and cingulate cortices in the n-back without cues. The left middle frontal gyrus was implicated in the load-dependent processing of WM in both groups. Further group analysis identified that the notable activation changes in the frontal gyri and anterior cingulate cortex are according to low and high loads. Though relatively smaller in scale, this study was eminent as it clarified the neural alterations in WM in the mild–moderate TBI group compared to healthy controls. It confirmed the robustness of the phenomenon in TBI with the reproducibility of the results in a heterogeneous non-Western sample.</p>

<p>Satellite microglia associate with different neuron types in the adult murine CNS. Their frequency correlates with the neuron density in a given brain region whereas a preference for neurons of a specific transmitter subtype is not apparent.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Microglia are the innate immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS). In the adult uncompromised CNS, they have a highly ramified morphology and continuously extend and retract their processes. A subpopulation of microglial cells forms close soma-to-soma contacts with neurons and have been termed satellite microglia, yet the role of such interaction is largely unknown. Here, we analyzed the distribution of satellite microglia in different areas of the CNS of adult male mice applying transgenic- and immunolabeling of neuronal subtypes and microglia followed by three-dimensional imaging analysis. We quantified satellite microglia associated with GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons in the somatosensory cortex, striatum, and thalamus; with dopaminergic and serotonergic neurons in the basal forebrain and raphe nucleus, respectively; and with cerebellar Purkinje cell neurons. Satellite microglia in the retina were assessed qualitatively. Microglia form satellites with all neuronal subtypes studied, whereas a preference for a specific neuron subtype was not found. The occurrence and frequency of satellite microglia is determined by the histo-architectural organization of the brain area and the densities of neuronal somata therein.</p>

     alt="Digital reconstruction and quantitative morphometric analysis of bipolar cells in live rat retinal slices"/>
<p>The tenet that structure is inextricably linked to function has inspired the characterization of complete morphologies of neurons since the time of Cajal. We have morphologically reconstructed and analyzed bipolar cells imaged with 2-photon microscopy in the rat retina. By precisely quantifying the level of stratification of the axon terminals in the inner plexiform layer, we have generated a reference system for reliable classification of individual cells in future studies focused on correlating morphological and physiological properties.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Bipolar cells convey signals from photoreceptors in the outer retina to amacrine and ganglion cells in the inner retina. In mammals, there are typically 10–15 types of cone bipolar cells and one type of rod bipolar cell. Different types of cone bipolar cells are thought to code and transmit different features of a complex visual stimulus, thereby generating parallel channels that uniquely filter and transform the photoreceptor outputs. Differential synaptic connectivity and expression of ligand- and voltage-gated ion channels are thought to be important mechanisms for processing and filtering visual signals. Whereas the biophysical basis for such mechanisms has been investigated more extensively in rat retina, there is a lack of quantitative morphological data necessary for advancing the structure–function correlation in this species, as recent connectomics investigations have focused on mouse retina. Here, we performed whole-cell recordings from cone and rod bipolar cells in rat retinal slices, filled the cells with fluorescent dyes, and acquired image stacks by multiphoton excitation microscopy. Following deconvolution, we performed digital reconstruction and morphometric analysis of 25 cone and 14 rod bipolar cells. Compared to previous descriptions, the extent and complexity of branching of the axon terminal was surprisingly high. By precisely quantifying the level of stratification of the axon terminals in the inner plexiform layer, we have generated a reference system for reliable classification of individual cells in future studies focused on correlating physiological and morphological properties. The implemented workflow can be extended to the development of morphologically realistic compartmental models for these neurons.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Prospectively defined patterns of APOBEC3A mutagenesis are prevalent in human cancers</a></h4>

              
                APOBEC3 cytidine deaminases are putative cancer mutagens. DeWeerd et al. experimentally define the genome-wide spectrum of mutagenesis caused by APOBEC3A deamination activity, which includes base substitutions, deletions, and mutations of 5-methylcytidines at CpG motifs. This mutational signature is prevalent in human cancers and provides a biomarker for APOBEC3A activity.

                Parhi et al. find that the oncofetal antigen Gal-GalNAc is displayed on trophoblast cells facing maternal blood and that its level rises during gestation. Gal-GalNAc is recognized by the Fusobacterium nucleatum lectin Fap2, facilitating fusobacterial colonization of the placenta.

                Using high-throughput microscopy, Tiruvadi-Krishnan et al. determine timings for critical cell-cycle checkpoints related to division and replication in Escherichia coli. The data, combined with cell-cycle modeling, show that the onset of constriction is blocked by the mid-cell nucleoid. In slow-growth conditions, the blockage is limiting for cell division.

                Stienne et al. investigate how BTLA and HVEM receptors control inflammatory and metabolic signaling in lymphocytes. A major function of these receptors in intestinal lymphoid tissue is to regulate mucosal antibody production. Ultimately, this system controls the composition of the intestinal microbiome, including pathogenic bacteria.

                Interferons inhibit viruses through the concerted action of many host restriction factors. Here, Fernbach et al. use siRNA screening to identify interferon-dependent host factors that limit early stages of the influenza A virus replication cycle, leading to the characterization of RABGAP1L-mediated disruption of endocytosis as a broadly acting host antiviral mechanism.

                Using proximity proteomics coupled with siRNA screens, Fang et al. reveal functional interactomes of the Ebola virus polymerase, which drives synthesis of viral RNA. These functional hits illuminate a panel of host-dependent regulators of Ebola viral RNA synthesis, which could be potential targets for antiviral drug discovery and development.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Strip1 regulates retinal ganglion cell survival by suppressing Jun-mediated apoptosis to promote retinal neural circuit formation</a></h4>

              
                In the vertebrate retina, an interplay between retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), amacrine (AC), and bipolar (BP) cells establishes a synaptic layer called the inner plexiform layer (IPL). This circuit conveys signals from photoreceptors to visual centers in the brain. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in its development remain poorly understood. Striatin-interacting protein 1 (Strip1) is a core component of the striatin-interacting phosphatases and kinases (STRIPAK) complex, and it has shown emerging roles in embryonic morphogenesis. Here, we uncover the importance of Strip1 in inner retina development. Using zebrafish, we show that loss of Strip1 causes defects in IPL formation. In <i>strip1</i> mutants, RGCs undergo dramatic cell death shortly after birth. AC and BP cells subsequently invade the degenerating RGC layer, leading to a disorganized IPL. Mechanistically, zebrafish Strip1 interacts with its STRIPAK partner, Striatin 3 (Strn3), and both show overlapping functions in RGC survival. Furthermore, loss of Strip1 or Strn3 leads to activation of the proapoptotic marker, Jun, within RGCs, and Jun knockdown rescues RGC survival in <i>strip1</i> mutants. In addition to its function in RGC maintenance, Strip1 is required for RGC dendritic patterning, which likely contributes to proper IPL formation. Taken together, we propose that a series of Strip1-mediated regulatory events coordinates inner retinal circuit formation by maintaining RGCs during development, which ensures proper positioning and neurite patterning of inner retinal neurons.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A novel immunopeptidomic-based pipeline for the generation of                    personalized oncolytic cancer vaccines</a></h4>

              
                Beside the isolation and identification of MHC-I restricted peptides from the                    surface of cancer cells, one of the challenges is eliciting an effective                    anti-tumor CD8+ T cell mediated response as part of therapeutic cancer vaccine.                    Therefore, the establishment of a solid pipeline for the downstream selection of                    clinically relevant peptides and the subsequent creation of therapeutic cancer                    vaccines are of utmost importance. Indeed, the use of peptides for eliciting                    specific anti-tumor adaptive immunity is hindered by two main limitations: the                    efficient selection of the most optimal candidate peptides and the use of a                    highly immunogenic platform to combine with the peptides to induce effective                    tumor-specific adaptive immune responses. Here, we describe for the first time a                    streamlined pipeline for the generation of personalized cancer vaccines starting                    from the isolation and selection of the most immunogenic peptide candidates                    expressed on the tumor cells and ending in the generation of efficient                    therapeutic oncolytic cancer vaccines. This immunopeptidomics-based pipeline was                    carefully validated in a murine colon tumor model CT26. Specifically, we used                    state-of-the-art immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometric methodologies to                    isolate &gt;8000 peptide targets from the CT26 tumor cell line. The selection of                    the target candidates was then based on two separate approaches: RNAseq analysis                    and the HEX software. The latter is a tool previously developed by Chiaro et al.                    (1), able to identify tumor antigens similar to pathogen antigens, in order to                    exploit molecular mimicry and tumor pathogen cross-reactive T-cells in cancer                    vaccine development. The generated list of candidates (twenty-six in total) was                    further tested in a functional characterization assay using interferon-g ELISpot                    (Enzyme-Linked Immunospot), reducing the number of candidates to six. These                    peptides were then tested in our previously described oncolytic cancer vaccine                    platform PeptiCRAd, a vaccine platform that combines an immunogenic oncolytic                    adenovirus (OAd) coated with tumor antigen peptides. In our work, PeptiCRAd was                    successfully used for the treatment of mice bearing CT26, controlling the                    primary malignant lesion and most importantly a secondary, non-treated, cancer                    lesion. These results confirmed the feasibility of applying the described                    pipeline for the selection of peptide candidates and generation of therapeutic                    oncolytic cancer vaccine, filling a gap in the field of cancer immunotherapy,                    and paving the way to translate our pipeline into human therapeutic                    approach.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Combining genotypes and T cell receptor distributions to infer genetic loci determining V(D)J recombination probabilities</a></h4>

              
                Every T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire is shaped by a complex probabilistic tangle of genetically determined biases and immune exposures. T cells combine a random V(D)J recombination process with a selection process to generate highly diverse and functional TCRs. The extent to which an individual’s genetic background is associated with their resulting TCR repertoire diversity has yet to be fully explored. Using a previously published repertoire sequencing dataset paired with high-resolution genome-wide genotyping from a large human cohort, we infer specific genetic loci associated with V(D)J recombination probabilities using genome-wide association inference. We show that V(D)J gene usage profiles are associated with variation in the <i>TCRB</i> locus and, specifically for the functional TCR repertoire, variation in the major histocompatibility complex locus. Further, we identify specific variations in the genes encoding the Artemis protein and the TdT protein to be associated with biasing junctional nucleotide deletion and N-insertion, respectively. These results refine our understanding of genetically-determined TCR repertoire biases by confirming and extending previous studies on the genetic determinants of V(D)J gene usage and providing the first examples of <i>trans</i> genetic variants which are associated with modifying junctional diversity. Together, these insights lay the groundwork for further explorations into how immune responses vary between individuals.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Control of spinal motor neuron terminal differentiation through sustained Hoxc8 gene activity</a></h4>

              
                Spinal motor neurons (MNs) constitute cellular substrates for several movement disorders. Although their early development has received much attention, how spinal MNs become and remain terminally differentiated is poorly understood. Here, we determined the transcriptome of mouse MNs located at the brachial domain of the spinal cord at embryonic and postnatal stages. We identified novel transcription factors (TFs) and terminal differentiation genes (e.g. ion channels, neurotransmitter receptors, adhesion molecules) with continuous expression in MNs. Interestingly, genes encoding homeodomain TFs (e.g. HOX, LIM), previously implicated in early MN development, continue to be expressed postnatally, suggesting later functions. To test this idea, we inactivated <i>Hoxc8</i> at successive stages of mouse MN development and observed motor deficits. Our in vivo findings suggest that <i>Hoxc8</i> is not only required to establish, but also maintain expression of several MN terminal differentiation markers. Data from in vitro generated MNs indicate <i>Hoxc8</i> acts directly and is sufficient to induce expression of terminal differentiation genes. Our findings dovetail recent observations in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> MNs, pointing toward an evolutionarily conserved role for Hox in neuronal terminal differentiation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Phylogenomic analyses of echinoid diversification prompt a re-evaluation of their fossil record</a></h4>

              
                Echinoids are key components of modern marine ecosystems. Despite a remarkable fossil record, the emergence of their crown group is documented by few specimens of unclear affinities, rendering their early history uncertain. The origin of sand dollars, one of its most distinctive clades, is also unclear due to an unstable phylogenetic context. We employ 18 novel genomes and transcriptomes to build a phylogenomic dataset with a near-complete sampling of major lineages. With it, we revise the phylogeny and divergence times of echinoids, and place their history within the broader context of echinoderm evolution. We also introduce the concept of a chronospace – a multidimensional representation of node ages – and use it to explore methodological decisions involved in time calibrating phylogenies. We find the choice of clock model to have the strongest impact on divergence times, while the use of site-heterogeneous models and alternative node prior distributions show minimal effects. The choice of loci has an intermediate impact, affecting mostly deep Paleozoic nodes, for which clock-like genes recover dates more congruent with fossil evidence. Our results reveal that crown group echinoids originated in the Permian and diversified rapidly in the Triassic, despite the relative lack of fossil evidence for this early diversification. We also clarify the relationships between sand dollars and their close relatives and confidently date their origins to the Cretaceous, implying ghost ranges spanning approximately 50 million years, a remarkable discrepancy with their rich fossil record.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Robust effects of corticothalamic feedback and behavioral state on movie responses in mouse dLGN</a></h4>

              
                Neurons in the dorsolateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) of the thalamus receive a substantial proportion of modulatory inputs from corticothalamic (CT) feedback and brain stem nuclei. Hypothesizing that these modulatory influences might be differentially engaged depending on the visual stimulus and behavioral state, we performed in vivo extracellular recordings from mouse dLGN while optogenetically suppressing CT feedback and monitoring behavioral state by locomotion and pupil dilation. For naturalistic movie clips, we found CT feedback to consistently increase dLGN response gain and promote tonic firing. In contrast, for gratings, CT feedback effects on firing rates were mixed. For both stimulus types, the neural signatures of CT feedback closely resembled those of behavioral state, yet effects of behavioral state on responses to movies persisted even when CT feedback was suppressed. We conclude that CT feedback modulates visual information on its way to cortex in a stimulus-dependent manner, but largely independently of behavioral state.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Proper migration of lymphatic endothelial cells requires survival and guidance cues from arterial mural cells</a></h4>

              
                The migration of lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) is key for the development of the complex and vast lymphatic vascular network that pervades most tissues in an organism. In zebrafish, arterial intersegmental vessels together with chemokines have been shown to promote lymphatic cell migration from the horizontal myoseptum (HM). We observed that emergence of mural cells around the intersegmental arteries coincides with lymphatic departure from HM which raised the possibility that arterial mural cells promote LEC migration. Our live imaging and cell ablation experiments revealed that LECs migrate slower and fail to establish the lymphatic vascular network in the absence of arterial mural cells. We determined that mural cells are a source for the C-X-C motif chemokine 12 (Cxcl12a and Cxcl12b), Vascular endothelial growth factor C (Vegfc) and Collagen and calcium-binding EGF domain-containing protein 1 (Ccbe1). We showed that chemokine and growth factor signalling function cooperatively to induce robust LEC migration. Specifically, Vegfc-Vegfr3 signalling, but not chemokines, induces extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation in LECs, and has an additional pro-survival role in LECs during the migration. Together, the identification of mural cells as a source for signals that guide LEC migration and survival will be important in the future design for rebuilding lymphatic vessels in disease contexts.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Chinese natural compound decreases pacemaking of rabbit cardiac sinoatrial cells by targeting second messenger regulation of f-channels</a></h4>

              
                Tongmai Yangxin (TMYX) is a complex compound of the Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) used to treat several cardiac rhythm disorders; however, no information regarding its mechanism of action is available. In this study we provide a detailed characterization of the effects of TMYX on the electrical activity of pacemaker cells and unravel its mechanism of action. Single-cell electrophysiology revealed that TMYX elicits a reversible and dose-dependent (2/6 mg/ml) slowing of spontaneous action potentials rate (−20.8/–50.2%) by a selective reduction of the diastolic phase (−50.1/–76.0%). This action is mediated by a negative shift of the I<sub>f</sub> activation curve (−6.7/–11.9 mV) and is caused by a reduction of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-induced stimulation of pacemaker channels. We provide evidence that TMYX acts by directly antagonizing the cAMP-induced allosteric modulation of the pacemaker channels. Noticeably, this mechanism functionally resembles the pharmacological actions of muscarinic stimulation or β-blockers, but it does not require generalized changes in cytoplasmic cAMP levels thus ensuring a selective action on rate. In agreement with a competitive inhibition mechanism, TMYX exerts its maximal antagonistic action at submaximal cAMP concentrations and then progressively becomes less effective thus ensuring a full contribution of I<sub>f</sub> to pacemaker rate during high metabolic demand and sympathetic stimulation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Retinoic acid signaling mediates peripheral cone photoreceptor survival in a mouse model of retina degeneration</a></h4>

              
                Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP) is a progressive, debilitating visual disorder caused by mutations in a diverse set of genes. In both humans with RP and mouse models of RP, rod photoreceptor dysfunction leads to loss of night vision, and is followed by secondary cone photoreceptor dysfunction and degeneration, leading to loss of daylight color vision. A strategy to prevent secondary cone death could provide a general RP therapy to preserve daylight color vision regardless of the underlying mutation. In mouse models of RP, cones in the peripheral retina survive long-term, despite complete rod loss. The mechanism for such peripheral cone survival had not been explored. Here, we found that active retinoic acid (RA) signaling in peripheral Muller glia is necessary for the abnormally long survival of these peripheral cones. RA depletion by conditional knockout of RA synthesis enzymes, or overexpression of an RA degradation enzyme, abrogated the extended survival of peripheral cones. Conversely, constitutive activation of RA signaling in the central retina promoted long-term cone survival. These results indicate that RA signaling mediates the prolonged peripheral cone survival in the rd1 mouse model of retinal degeneration, and provide a basis for a generic strategy for cone survival in the many diseases that lead to loss of cone-mediated vision.

                DNA methylation, repressive histone modifications, and PIWI-interacting RNAs are essential for controlling retroelement silencing in mammalian germ lines. Dysregulation of retroelement silencing is associated with male sterility. Although retroelement silencing mechanisms have been extensively studied in mouse germ cells, little progress has been made in humans. Here, we show that the Krüppel-associated box domain zinc finger proteins (KRAB-ZFPs) are associated with DNA methylation of retroelements in human primordial germ cells (hPGCs). Further, we show that the hominoid-specific retroelement SINE-VNTR-<i>Alus </i>(SVA) is subjected to transcription-directed <i>de novo </i>DNA methylation during human spermatogenesis. The degree of <i>de novo </i>DNA methylation in SVAs varies among human individuals, which confers significant inter-individual epigenetic variation in sperm. Collectively, our results highlight potential molecular mechanisms for the regulation of retroelements in human male germ cells.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Unsupervised Bayesian Ising Approximation for decoding neural activity and other biological dictionaries</a></h4>

              
                The problem of deciphering how low-level patterns (action potentials in the brain, amino acids in a protein, etc.) drive high-level biological features (sensorimotor behavior, enzymatic function) represents the central challenge of quantitative biology. The lack of general methods for doing so from the size of datasets that can be collected experimentally severely limits our understanding of the biological world. For example, in neuroscience, some sensory and motor codes have been shown to consist of precisely timed multi-spike patterns. However, the combinatorial complexity of such pattern codes have precluded development of methods for their comprehensive analysis. Thus, just as it is hard to predict a protein’s function based on its sequence, we still do not understand how to accurately predict an organism's behavior based on neural activity. Here we introduce the unsupervised Bayesian Ising Approximation (uBIA) for solving this class of problems. We demonstrate its utility in an application to neural data, detecting precisely timed spike patterns that code for specific motor behaviors in a songbird vocal system. In data recorded during singing from neurons in a vocal control region, our method detects such codewords with an arbitrary number of spikes, does so from small data sets, and accounts for dependencies in occurrences of codewords. Detecting such comprehensive motor control dictionaries can improve our understanding of skilled motor control and the neural bases of sensorimotor learning in animals. To further illustrate the utility of uBIA, used it to identify the distinct sets of activity patterns that encode vocal motor exploration versus typical song production. Crucially, our method can be used not only for analysis of neural systems, but also for understanding the structure of correlations in other biological and nonbiological datasets.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Decoding trans-saccadic prediction error</a></h4>

              
                We are constantly sampling our environment by moving our eyes, but our subjective experience of the world is stable and constant. One undesirable consequence of eye movements is that stimulus displacement during or shortly after a saccade often goes unnoticed, a phenomenon called the saccadic suppression of displacement. Although we fail to notice such displacements, our oculomotor system computes the post-saccadic prediction errors and adequately adjusts the gaze and future saccadic execution, a phenomenon known as saccadic adaptation. In the present study, we aimed to find a brain signature of the trans-saccadic prediction error that informs the motor system but not explicit perception. We asked human participants to report whether a visual target was displaced during a saccade towards it while recording electroencephalography (EEG). Using multivariate pattern analysis, we were able to differentiate displacements from no displacements, even when participants failed to report the displacement. In other words, we found that trans-saccadic prediction error is represented in the EEG signal 100 ms after the displacement presentation, mainly in occipital and parieto-occipital regions, even in the absence of explicit perception of the displacement.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Whole-brain modeling explains the context-dependent effects of cholinergic neuromodulation</a></h4>

              
                Integration and segregation are accepted as two fundamental principles of brain organization. The brain manages the transitions between different functional states, more segregated or integrated, through neuromodulatory systems. Recently computational and experimental works suggest a pro-segregation effect of cholinergic neuromodulation. Here, we studied the effects of the cholinergic system on brain functional connectivity using both empirical fMRI data and computational modeling. First, we analyzed the effects of nicotine on functional connectivity and network topology of healthy subjects during resting-state conditions and during an attentional task. Then, to find causal mechanisms about these changes, we employed a whole-brain neural mass model embedded into a human connectome for simulating the effects of nicotine. We found that nicotine incremented functional segregation in both empirical and simulated data, and the effects are context-dependent: observed during task, but not in resting-state. In-task performance correlates with functional segregation, discovering a link between functional network topology and behavior. In the model, the drug was modeled decreasing both the global coupling and local feedback inhibition parameters of the model, consistent with the known cellular effects of acetylcholine. Also, we found that the regional density of the nicotinic acetylcholine 4{beta}2 receptor explains better the effects of nicotine at the whole-brain level. Our results confirm that cholinergic neuromodulation promotes functional segregation in a context-dependent fashion, and suggest that this segregation is suited for simple visual-attentional tasks. In addition, we propose biophysical mechanisms to simulate cholinergic neuromodulation in whole-brain models.

                The microbiome-gut-brain axis has been proposed as a pathogenic path in Parkinson's disease (PD). Dietary driven dysbiosis and reduced gut barrier function could facilitate the interaction of toxic external or internal factors with the enteric nervous system, where PD could start. Amyloid bacterial protein such as curli can act as seed to corrupt enteric alpha-synuclein and lead to its aggregation. Misfolded alpha-synuclein can propagate to and throughout the brain. Here, we aimed at understanding if fibre deprivation and amyloidogenic protein curli could, individually or together, exacerbate the phenotype in both enteric and central nervous systems of a transgenic mouse overexpressing wild-type human alpha-synuclein. We analysed the gut microbiome, motor behaviour, gastrointestinal and brain pathologies in these mice. Our findings show that external interventions, akin to unhealthy life habits in humans, can exacerbate PD-like pathologies in mice. We believe that our results shed light on how lifestyle affects PD progression.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Reactivity to conditioned threat cues is distinct from exploratory drive in the elevated plus-maze.</a></h4>

              
                Fear and anxiety are adaptive states that allow humans and animals alike to respond appropriately to threatening cues in their environment. Commonly used tasks for studying behaviour akin to fear and anxiety in rodent models are pavlovian threat conditioning and the elevated plus maze (EPM) respectively. In threat conditioning the rodents learn to associate an aversive event with a specific stimulus or context. The learnt association between the two stimuli (the memory) can then be recalled by re-exposing the subject to the conditioned stimulus. The elevated plus maze is argued to measure the agoraphobic avoidance of the brightly lit open maze arms in crepuscular rodents. These two tasks have been used extensively, yet research into whether they interact is scarce. We investigated whether recall of an aversive memory, across contextual, odour or auditory modalities, would potentiate anxiety-like behaviour in the elevated plus maze. The data did not support that memory recall, even over a series of timepoints, could influence EPM behaviour. Furthermore, there was no correlation between EPM behaviour and conditioned freezing in independent cohorts tested in the EPM before or after auditory threat conditioning. Further analysis found the production of 22kHz ultrasonic vocalisations revealed the strongest responders to a conditioned threat cue. These results are of particular importance for consideration when using the EPM and threat conditioning to identify individual differences, and the possibility to use the tasks in batteries of tests without cross-task interference.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Individual differences in eye drift predict visual acuity</a></h4>

              
                Visual acuity is essential for daily activities. It is believed that optics and anatomy alone determine the limits of visual resolution. However, in addition to these factors, eye movements greatly contribute to input dynamics, as the eyes jitter incessantly during fixation, displacing stimuli over many photoreceptors. Here we examined the relation between this motion (ocular drift) and differences in visual acuity in emmetropic observers. We show that: (a) large individual variability exists in the characteristics of ocular drifts; (b) these differences profoundly affect the structure of spatiotemporal signals to the retina; and (c) the spectral distribution of the resulting input signals strongly correlates with visual acuity. Building on these findings, we further show that individual acuity differences can be predicted from the motor behavior elicited by a simple fixation task, without directly measuring acuity. These results shed new light on how oculomotor behavior contributes to individual variability in acuity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Deletion of CEP164 in mouse photoreceptors post-ciliogenesis interrupts ciliary intraflagellar transport (IFT)</a></h4>

              
                Centrosomal protein 164 (CEP164) is located at the edge of distal appendages in primary cilia and is necessary for basal body (BB) docking to the apical membrane. To investigate the function of CEP164 before and after BB docking in photoreceptors, we deleted CEP164 during retina embryonic development (Six3Cre), in postnatal rod photoreceptors (iCre75) and in mature retina using tamoxifen induction. BBs dock to the cell cortex during postnatal day 6 (P6) and extend a connecting cilium (CC) and an axoneme. P6 retina-specific knockouts (ret Cep164 -/-) are unable to dock BBs, thereby preventing formation of a CC or outer segments (OS). In rodspecific knockouts (rod Cep164 -/-), Cre expression starts after P9 and CC/OS form. P16 rod Cep164 -/- rods have nearly normal OS lengths, and maintain OS attachment through P21 despite loss of CEP164. Intraflagellar transport components (IFT88, IFT57 and IFT140) were reduced at P16 rod Cep164 -/- BBs and CC tips and nearly absent at P21, indicating impaired intraflagellar transport. Nascent OS discs, labeled with a fluorescent dye on P14 and P18 and harvested on P19, showed continued rod Cep164 -/- disc morphogenesis but absence of P14 discs mid-distally, indicating OS instability. Tamoxifen induction with PROM1 ETCre; Cep164 F/F (tam Cep164 -/-) adult mice affected maintenance of both rod and cone OS. The results suggest that CEP164 is key towards recruitment and stabilization of IFT-B particles at BB/CC. Impairment of IFT may be the main driver of ciliary malfunction observed with hypomorphic CEP164 mutations.

                In targeted movements of the hand, descending activation patterns must not only generate muscle activation, but must also adjust spinal reflexes from stabilizing the initial to stabilizing the final postural state. We estimate descending activation patterns that change minimally while generating a targeted movement within a given movement time based on a model of the biomechanics, muscle dynamics, and the stretch reflex. The estimated descending activation patterns predict human movement trajectories quite well. Their temporal structure varies across workspace and with movement speed,  from monotonic profiles for slow movements to non-monotonic profiles for fast movements. Descending activation patterns at different speeds thus do not result from a not mere rescaling of invariant templates, but reflect varying needs to compensate for interaction torques and muscle dynamics. The virtual attractor trajectories, on which active muscle torques are zero, lie within reachable workspace and are largely invariant movements when represented in end-effector coordinates. Their temporal structure along movement direction changes from linear ramps to ''N-shaped'' profiles with increasing movement speed.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Humans Adapt Multi-Objective Control of Stepping To Perform Lateral Maneuvers While Walking</a></h4>

              
                To successfully traverse their environment, humans must often perform maneuvers to achieve desired task goals while simultaneously maintaining balance. Humans accomplish these tasks primarily by modulating their foot placements. As humans are more unstable laterally, we must better understand how humans modulate lateral foot placement. We previously developed a theoretical framework and corresponding computational models to describe how humans regulate lateral stepping during straight-ahead continuous walking. This framework yields goal functions for step width and lateral body position that define the walking task and determine the set of all possible task solutions as Goal Equivalent Manifolds (GEMs). Here, we used this framework to determine if humans can regulate lateral stepping during non-steady-state lateral maneuvers by minimizing errors in accordance with these goal functions. Twenty young healthy adults each performed four lateral lane-change maneuvers in a virtual reality environment. Within our general lateral stepping regulation framework, we first re-examined the requirements of such transient walking tasks.  Doing so yielded new theoretical predictions regarding how steps during any such maneuver should be regulated to minimize error costs, consistent with the goals required at each step and with how these costs are adapted at each step during the maneuver. Humans performed the experimental lateral maneuvers in a manner consistent with our theoretical predictions. Furthermore, their stepping behavior was well modeled by merely adapting the parameters of our previous lateral stepping models from step to step. To our knowledge, our results are the first to demonstrate humans can use evolving cost landscapes in real time to perform such an adaptive motor task and, furthermore, that such adaptation can occur quickly - over only one step. Thus, the predictive capabilities of our general stepping regulation framework extend to a much greater range of walking tasks beyond just normal, straight-ahead walking.

                Mechanisms underpinning age-related variations in cortical thickness in the human brain remain poorly understood. We investigated whether inter-regional age-related variations in cortical thinning (in a multicohort neuroimaging dataset from the ENIGMA Lifespan Working Group totalling 14,248 individuals, aged 4-89 years) depended on cell-specific marker gene expression levels. We found differences amidst early-life (<20 years), mid-life (20-60 years), and late-life (>60 years) in the patterns of association between inter-regional profiles of cortical thickness and expression profiles of marker genes for CA1 and S1 pyramidal cells, astrocytes, and microglia. Gene ontology and enrichment analyses indicated that each of the three life-stages was associated with different biological processes and cellular components: synaptic modeling in early life, neurotransmission in mid-life, and neurodegeneration in late-life. These findings provide mechanistic insights into age-related cortical thinning during typical development and aging.

                Mammalian axonal development begins in embryonic stages and continues postnatally. After birth, axonal proteomic landscape changes rapidly, coordinated by transcription, protein turnover, and post-translational modifications. Comprehensive profiling of axonal proteomes across neurodevelopment is limited, with most studies lacking cell-type and neural circuit specificity, resulting in substantial information loss. We create a Cre-dependent APEX2 reporter mouse line and map cell-type specific proteome of corticostriatal projections across postnatal development. We synthesize analysis frameworks to define temporal patterns of axonal proteome and phosphoproteome, identifying co-regulated proteins and phosphorylations associated with genetic risk for human brain disorders. We discover proline-directed kinases as major developmental regulators. APEX2 transgenic reporter proximity labeling offers flexible strategies for subcellular proteomics with cell type specificity in early neurodevelopment, a critical period for neuropsychiatric disease.

	<p>In children, single-sided deafness (SSD) affects the development of linguistic and social skills and can impede educational progress. These difficulties may relate to cortical changes that occur following SSD, such as reduced inter-hemispheric functional asymmetry and maladaptive brain plasticity. To investigate these neuronal changes and their evolution in children, a non-invasive technique is required that is little affected by motion artifacts. Here, we present a research protocol that uses functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to evaluate the reorganization of cortical auditory asymmetry in children with SSD; it also examines how the cortical changes relate to auditory and language skills. The protocol is designed for children whose SSD has not been treated, because hearing restoration can alter both brain reorganization and behavioral performance. We propose a single-center, cross-sectional study that includes 30 children with SSD (congenital or acquired moderate-to-profound deafness) and 30 children with normal hearing (NH), all aged 5&amp;amp;ndash;16 years. The children undergo fNIRS during monaural and binaural stimulation, and the pattern of cortical activity is analyzed using measures of the peak amplitude and area under the curve for both oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin. These cortical measures can be compared between the two groups of children, and analyses can be run to determine whether they relate to binaural hearing (speech-in-noise and sound localization), speech perception and production, and quality of life (QoL). The results could be of relevance for developing individualized rehabilitation programs for SSD, which could reduce patients&amp;amp;rsquo; difficulties and prevent long-term neurofunctional and clinical consequences.</p>

	<p>Many individuals, when faced with mathematical tasks or situations requiring arithmetic skills, experience exaggerated levels of anxiety. Mathematical anxiety (MA), in addition to causing discomfort, can lead to avoidance behaviors and then to underachievement. However, the factors inducing MA and how MA deploys its detrimental effects are still largely debated. There is evidence suggesting that MA affects working memory capacity by further diminishing its limited processing resources. An alternative account postulates that MA originates from a coarse early numerical cognition capacity, the perception of numerosity. In the current study, we measured MA, math abilities, numerosity perception and visuo-spatial working memory (VSWM) in a sample of neurotypical adults. Correlational analyses confirmed previous studies showing that high MA was associated with lower math scores and worse numerosity estimation precision. Conversely, MA turned out to be unrelated to VSWM capacities. Finally, partial correlations revealed that MA fully accounted for the relationship between numerosity estimation precision and math abilities, suggesting a key role for MA as a mediating factor between these two domains.</p>

	<p>Recent advances in biomaterials offer new possibilities for brain tissue reconstruction. Biocompatibility, provision of cell adhesion motives and mechanical properties are among the present main design criteria. We here propose a radically new and potentially major element determining biointegration of porous biomaterials: the favorable effect of interstitial fluid pressure (IFP). The force applied by the lymphatic system through the interstitial fluid pressure on biomaterial integration has mostly been neglected so far. We hypothesize it has the potential to force 3D biointegration of porous biomaterials. In this study, we develop a capillary hydrostatic device to apply controlled in vitro interstitial fluid pressure and study its effect during 3D tissue culture. We find that the IFP is a key player in porous biomaterial tissue integration, at physiological IFP levels, surpassing the known effect of cell adhesion motives. Spontaneous electrical activity indicates that the culture conditions are not harmful for the cells. Our work identifies interstitial fluid pressure at physiological negative values as a potential main driver for tissue integration into porous biomaterials. We anticipate that controlling the IFP level could narrow the gap between in vivo and in vitro and therefore decrease the need for animal screening in biomaterial design.</p>

	<p>Communicative participation is restricted in many conditions associated with dysarthria. This position paper defines and describes the construct of communicative participation. In it, the emergence of this construct is reviewed, along with the predictors of and variables associated with communicative participation in the dysarthrias. In doing so, the features that make communicative participation unique and distinct from other measures of dysarthria are highlighted, through emphasizing how communicative participation cannot be predicted solely from other components of the World Health Organization&amp;amp;rsquo;s International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF), including levels of impairment or activity limitations. Next, the empirical literature related to the measurement of communicative participation and how this research relates to dysarthria management is presented. Finally, the development of robust clinical measures of communicative participation and approaches to management is described from the point of view of the clinician. We argue that communicative participation should be a primary focus of treatment planning and intervention to provide patient-centered, holistic, and value-based clinical interventions which are responsive to the needs of individuals living with dysarthria.</p>

	<p>Neurocognitive deficits have been consistently associated with a wide range of psychopathology and are proposed to not only be a consequence of the development of psychopathology but also directly involved in its aetiology. However, there is no clear understanding of what neurocognitive processes are particularly important to mental health. In this paper, we explored the association between neurocognitive abilities and the factors derived from structural models of psychopathology. Four hundred participants from a representative community sample completed measures of symptomology and substance use, as well as 8 neurocognitive tasks. We found a correlated-factors model, with internalising and externalising as the higher-order factors, and a single-factor model with only the p-factor, to be good fits for the data. Tasks that measured the speed of processing were significantly associated with internalising, externalising, and the p-factor, and accounted for significant amounts of unique variance in the factors after accounting for the common variance of the other tasks. Tasks that measured working memory, shifting, and inhibition were not significantly associated with psychopathology factors. Our findings suggest that neurocognitive abilities may not be differentially associated with psychopathology factors, but that speed of processing is a common correlate of the factors. We emphasise the importance of examining neurocognitive abilities and psychopathology on the individual level.</p>

	<p>The predictive saccade task is a motor learning paradigm requiring saccades to track a visual target moving in a predictable pattern. Previous research has explored extensively anti-saccade deficits observed across psychosis, but less is known about predictive saccade-related mechanisms. The dataset analysed came from the studies of Crawford et al, published in 1995, where neuroleptically medicated schizophrenia and bipolar affective disorder patients were compared with non-medicated patients and control participants using a predictive saccade paradigm. The participant groups consisted of medicated schizophrenia patients (n = 40), non-medicated schizophrenia patients (n = 18), medicated bipolar disorder patients (n = 14), non-medicated bipolar disorder patients (n = 18), and controls (n = 31). The current analyses explore relationships between predictive saccades and symptomatology, and the potential interaction of medication. Analyses revealed that the schizophrenia and bipolar disorder diagnostic categories are indistinguishable in patterns of predictive control across several saccadic parameters, supporting a dimensional hypothesis. Once collapsed into predominantly high-/low- negative/positive symptoms, regardless of diagnosis, differences were revealed, with significant hypometria and lower gain in those with more negative symptoms. This illustrates how the presentation of the deficits is homogeneous across diagnosis, but heterogeneous when surveyed by symptomatology; attesting that a diagnostic label is less informative than symptomatology when exploring predictive saccades.</p>

	<p>The main neurotransmitter in the brain responsible for the inhibition of neuronal activity is &amp;amp;gamma;-aminobutyric acid (GABA). It plays a crucial role in circuit formation during development, both via its primary effects as a neurotransmitter and also as a trophic factor. The GABAB receptors (GABABRs) are G protein-coupled metabotropic receptors; on one hand, they can influence proliferation and migration; and, on the other, they can inhibit cells by modulating the function of K+ and Ca2+ channels, doing so on a slower time scale and with a longer-lasting effect compared to ionotropic GABAA receptors. GABABRs are expressed pre- and post-synaptically, at both glutamatergic and GABAergic terminals, thus being able to shape neuronal activity, plasticity, and the balance between excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission in response to varying levels of extracellular GABA concentration. Furthermore, given their subunit composition and their ability to form complexes with several associated proteins, GABABRs display heterogeneity with regard to their function, which makes them a promising target for pharmacological interventions. This review will describe (i) the latest results concerning GABABRs/GABABR-complex structures, their function, and the developmental time course of their appearance and functional integration in the brain, (ii) their involvement in manifestation of various pathophysiological conditions, and (iii) the current status of preclinical and clinical studies involving GABABR-targeting drugs.</p>

	<p>Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and aggressive brain tumor in adults, with a median survival of about 15 months. After the prior treatment, GBM tends to relapse within the high dose radiation field, defined as the peritumoral brain zone (PTZ), needing a second treatment. In the present review, the primary role of ionizing radiation in recurrent GBM is discussed, and the current literature knowledge about the different radiation modalities, doses and fractionation options at our disposal is summarized. Therefore, the focus is on the necessity of tailoring the treatment approach to every single patient and using radiomics and PET/MRI imaging to have a relatively good outcome and avoid severe toxicity. The use of charged particle therapy and radiosensitizers to overcome GBM radioresistance is considered, even if further studies are necessary to evaluate the effectiveness in the setting of reirradiation.</p>

	<p>Vestibular migraine (VM) is a leading cause of episodic vertigo, affecting up to 1% of the general population. Despite established diagnostic criteria, there is currently no evidence-based approach for acute treatment of VM, with treatment recommendations generally extrapolated from studies on classical migraine headache. Several small-scale studies have identified flunarizine as a potentially effective prophylactic medication in VM. We conducted a single-centre observational service evaluation study exploring patient experiences of preventative medications over a 28-month period, including flunarizine, for control of VM symptoms. To compare patient experience of flunarizine with other medications, data from patients taking flunarizine were separately analysed. A total of 90% of VM patients taking flunarizine reported symptomatic improvement, compared to only 32% of patients on other medications. Whilst 50% of patients on flunarizine reported side effects. these were not deemed to outweigh the clinical benefits, with most patients deciding to continue treatment. Our data supports the use of flunarizine in VM.</p>

	<p>Background: Peripheral blood level of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) may be used as a diagnostic and/or prognostic marker for schizophrenia. Previous studies were inconsistent. A systematic review was conducted to examine whether BDNF level is different in patients with first episode psychosis (FEP) compared to health controls (HC) and whether it changes after treatment. Methods: Literature search was done in PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar following standard procedures. Hedges&amp;amp;rsquo; g was used as the measure of effect size (ES), which was pooled with random effects model. Publication bias and moderator effects were examined. Results: Search yielded 29 studies with a total sample size of 2912. First meta-analysis included 27 studies with FEP vs. HC comparison. Pooled ES was &amp;amp;minus;0.63, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001, indicating that BDNF level was lower in FEP than in HC. Studies were heterogeneous, and moderator analysis showed that studies of younger patient, higher symptom severity, and more drug na&amp;amp;iuml;ve had larger ES. Second meta-analysis examined change in BDNF levels before and after antipsychotic treatment in eight studies. A pooled ES of &amp;amp;minus;0.003 (p = 0.96) showed no change in peripheral BDNF level after treatment. Conclusion: Peripheral BDNF level was decreased in FEP compared to HC, but it did not change after treatment.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Environmental overlap influences goal‐oriented coding of spatial sequences differently along the long‐axis of hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>When navigating our world we often first plan or retrieve a route to our goal, avoiding alternative paths to other destinations. Inspired by computational and animal models, we have recently demonstrated evidence that the human hippocampus supports prospective spatial coding, mediated by interactions with the prefrontal cortex. But the relationship between such signals and the need to discriminate possible routes based on their goal remains unclear. In the current study, we combined human fMRI, multi-voxel pattern analysis, and an established paradigm for contrasting memories of nonoverlapping routes with those of routes that cross paths and must be disambiguated. By classifying goal-oriented representations at the initiation of a navigational route, we demonstrate that environmental overlap modulates goal-oriented representations in the hippocampus. This modulation manifest through representational shifts from posterior to anterior components of the right hippocampus. Moreover, declines in goal-oriented decoding due to overlapping memories were predicted by the strength of the alternative memory, suggesting co-expression and competition between alternatives in the hippocampus during prospective thought. Moreover, exploratory whole-brain analyses revealed that a region of frontopolar cortex, which we have previously tied to prospective route planning, represented goal-states in new overlapping routes. Together, our findings provide insight into the influences of contextual overlap on the long-axis of the hippocampus and a broader memory and planning network that we have long-associated with such navigation tasks.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Large self-assembled clathrin lattices spontaneously disassemble without sufficient adaptor proteins</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Si-Kao Guo, Alexander J. Sodt, Margaret E. Johnson</p>

Clathrin-coated structures must assemble on cell membranes to internalize receptors, with the clathrin protein only linked to the membrane via adaptor proteins. These structures can grow surprisingly large, containing over 20 clathrin, yet they often fail to form productive vesicles, instead aborting and disassembling. We show that clathrin structures of this size can both form and disassemble spontaneously when adaptor protein availability is low, despite high abundance of clathrin. Here, we combine recent <i>in vitro</i> kinetic measurements with microscopic reaction-diffusion simulations and theory to differentiate mechanisms of stable vs unstable clathrin assembly on membranes. While <i>in vitro</i> conditions drive assembly of robust, stable lattices, we show that concentrations, geometry, and dimensional reduction in physiologic-like conditions do not support nucleation if only the key adaptor AP-2 is included, due to its insufficient abundance. Nucleation requires a stoichiometry of adaptor to clathrin that exceeds 1:1, meaning additional adaptor types are necessary to form lattices successfully and efficiently. We show that the critical nucleus contains ~25 clathrin, remarkably similar to sizes of the transient and abortive structures observed <i>in vivo</i>. Lastly, we quantify the cost of bending the membrane under our curved clathrin lattices using a continuum membrane model. We find that the cost of bending the membrane could be largely offset by the energetic benefit of forming curved rather than flat structures, with numbers comparable to experiments. Our model predicts how adaptor density can tune clathrin-coated structures from the transient to the stable, showing that active energy consumption is therefore not required for lattice disassembly or remodeling during growth, which is a critical advance towards predicting productive vesicle formation.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Determining clinically relevant features in cytometry data using persistent homology</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Soham Mukherjee, Darren Wethington, Tamal K. Dey, Jayajit Das</p>

Cytometry experiments yield high-dimensional point cloud data that is difficult to interpret manually. Boolean gating techniques coupled with comparisons of relative abundances of cellular subsets is the current standard for cytometry data analysis. However, this approach is unable to capture more subtle topological features hidden in data, especially if those features are further masked by data transforms or significant batch effects or donor-to-donor variations in clinical data. We present that persistent homology, a mathematical structure that summarizes the topological features, can distinguish different sources of data, such as from groups of healthy donors or patients, effectively. Analysis of publicly available cytometry data describing non-naïve CD8+ T cells in COVID-19 patients and healthy controls shows that systematic structural differences exist between single cell protein expressions in COVID-19 patients and healthy controls. We identify proteins of interest by a decision-tree based classifier, sample points randomly and compute persistence diagrams from these sampled points. The resulting persistence diagrams identify regions in cytometry datasets of varying density and identify protruded structures such as ‘elbows’. We compute Wasserstein distances between these persistence diagrams for random pairs of healthy controls and COVID-19 patients and find that systematic structural differences exist between COVID-19 patients and healthy controls in the expression data for T-bet, Eomes, and Ki-67. Further analysis shows that expression of T-bet and Eomes are significantly downregulated in COVID-19 patient non-naïve CD8+ T cells compared to healthy controls. This counter-intuitive finding may indicate that canonical effector CD8+ T cells are less prevalent in COVID-19 patients than healthy controls. This method is applicable to any cytometry dataset for discovering novel insights through <i>topological data analysis</i> which may be difficult to ascertain otherwise with a standard gating strategy or existing bioinformatic tools.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Detection of focal source and arrhythmogenic substrate from body surface potentials to guide atrial fibrillation ablation</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yingjing Feng, Caroline H. Roney, Jason D. Bayer, Steven A. Niederer, Mélèze Hocini, Edward J. Vigmond</p>

Focal sources (FS) are believed to be important triggers and a perpetuation mechanism for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF). Detecting FS and determining AF sustainability in atrial tissue can help guide ablation targeting. We hypothesized that sustained rotors during FS-driven episodes indicate an arrhythmogenic substrate for sustained AF, and that non-invasive electrical recordings, like electrocardiograms (ECGs) or body surface potential maps (BSPMs), could be used to detect FS and AF sustainability. Computer simulations were performed on five bi-atrial geometries. FS were induced by pacing at cycle lengths of 120–270 ms from 32 atrial sites and four pulmonary veins. Self-sustained reentrant activities were also initiated around the same 32 atrial sites with inexcitable cores of radii of 0, 0.5 and 1 cm. FS fired for two seconds and then AF inducibility was tested by whether activation was sustained for another second. ECGs and BSPMs were simulated. Equivalent atrial sources were extracted using second-order blind source separation, and their cycle length, periodicity and contribution, were used as features for random forest classifiers. Longer rotor duration during FS-driven episodes indicates higher AF inducibility (area under ROC curve = 0.83). Our method had accuracy of 90.6±1.0% and 90.6±0.6% in detecting FS presence, and 93.1±0.6% and 94.2±1.2% in identifying AF sustainability, and 80.0±6.6% and 61.0±5.2% in determining the atrium of the focal site, from BSPMs and ECGs of five atria. The detection of FS presence and AF sustainability were insensitive to vest placement (±9.6%). On pre-operative BSPMs of 52 paroxysmal AF patients, patients classified with initiator-type FS on a single atrium resulted in improved two-to-three-year AF-free likelihoods (p-value < 0.01, logrank tests). Detection of FS and arrhythmogenic substrate can be performed from ECGs and BSPMs, enabling non-invasive mapping towards mechanism-targeted AF treatment, and malignant ectopic beat detection with likely AF progression.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Chemotherapy-induced cachexia and model-informed dosing to preserve lean mass in cancer treatment</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Suzan Farhang-Sardroodi, Michael A. La Croix, Kathleen P. Wilkie</p>

Although chemotherapy is a standard treatment for cancer, it comes with significant side effects. In particular, certain agents can induce severe muscle loss, known as cachexia, worsening patient quality of life and treatment outcomes. 5-fluorouracil, an anti-cancer agent used to treat several cancers, has been shown to cause muscle loss. Experimental data indicates a non-linear dose-dependence for muscle loss in mice treated with daily or week-day schedules. We present a mathematical model of chemotherapy-induced muscle wasting that captures this non-linear dose-dependence. Area-under-the-curve metrics are proposed to quantify the treatment’s effects on lean mass and tumour control. Model simulations are used to explore alternate dosing schedules, aging effects, and morphine use in chemotherapy treatment with the aim of better protecting lean mass while actively targeting the tumour, ultimately leading to improved personalization of treatment planning and improved patient quality of life.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">The synaptic scaffold protein MPP2 interacts with GABAA receptors at the periphery of the postsynaptic density of glutamatergic synapses</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Bettina Schmerl, Niclas Gimber, Benno Kuropka, Alexander Stumpf, Jakob Rentsch, Stella-Amrei Kunde, Judith von Sivers, Helge Ewers, Dietmar Schmitz, Christian Freund, Jan Schmoranzer, Nils Rademacher, Sarah A. Shoichet</p>

Recent advances in imaging technology have highlighted that scaffold proteins and receptors are arranged in subsynaptic nanodomains. The synaptic membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) scaffold protein membrane protein palmitoylated 2 (MPP2) is a component of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor–associated protein complexes and also binds to the synaptic cell adhesion molecule SynCAM 1. Using superresolution imaging, we show that—like SynCAM 1—MPP2 is situated at the periphery of the postsynaptic density (PSD). In order to explore MPP2-associated protein complexes, we used a quantitative comparative proteomics approach and identified multiple γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)<sub>A</sub> receptor subunits among novel synaptic MPP2 interactors. In line with a scaffold function for MPP2 in the assembly and/or modulation of intact GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, manipulating MPP2 expression had effects on inhibitory synaptic transmission. We further show that GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors are found together with MPP2 in a subset of dendritic spines and thus highlight MPP2 as a scaffold that serves as an adaptor molecule, linking peripheral synaptic elements critical for inhibitory regulation to central structures at the PSD of glutamatergic synapses.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">FtsZ filament structures in different nucleotide states reveal the mechanism of assembly dynamics</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Federico M. Ruiz, Sonia Huecas, Alicia Santos-Aledo, Elena A. Prim, José M. Andreu, Carlos Fernández-Tornero</p>

Treadmilling protein filaments perform essential cellular functions by growing from one end while shrinking from the other, driven by nucleotide hydrolysis. Bacterial cell division relies on the primitive tubulin homolog FtsZ, a target for antibiotic discovery that assembles into single treadmilling filaments that hydrolyse GTP at an active site formed upon subunit association. We determined high-resolution filament structures of FtsZ from the pathogen <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> in complex with different nucleotide analogs and cations, including mimetics of the ground and transition states of catalysis. Together with mutational and biochemical analyses, our structures reveal interactions made by the GTP γ-phosphate and Mg<sup>2+</sup> at the subunit interface, a K<sup>+</sup> ion stabilizing loop T7 for co-catalysis, new roles of key residues at the active site and a nearby crosstalk area, and rearrangements of a dynamic water shell bridging adjacent subunits upon GTP hydrolysis. We propose a mechanistic model that integrates nucleotide hydrolysis signaling with assembly-associated conformational changes and filament treadmilling. Equivalent assembly mechanisms may apply to more complex tubulin and actin cytomotive filaments that share analogous features with FtsZ.

     alt="Inhibition of androgenic pathway impairs encoding of cerebellar-dependent motor learning in male rats"/>
<p>Gaze stabilization reflexes such as the vestibuloocular reflex (VOR) and the optokinetic reflex (OKR) share some neuronal circuitry and interact in oculomotor adaptation phenomena. The presence of androgen receptors (Ars) in the cerebellar–vestibular network that mediates the adaptive modification of the VOR makes the VOR an excellent model to study the impact of androgens on cerebellar-dependent learning. In young male rats, the androgen receptor antagonist flutamide (FLUT) acutely impairs the capability of VOR to encode gain-increase and gain-decrease adaptation without influencing basal VOR and OKR. Such findings imply that the androgenic neuronal pathway activation participates in the VOR adaptation phenomenon probably via nonclassical mechanisms of regulation. We suggested that androgens, possibly testosterone (T) and dihydrotestosterone (DHT), by binding Ars may rapidly regulate cerebellar and extracerebellar plastic sites responsible for VOR adaptation.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Cerebellar-dependent learning is essential for the adaptation of motor and no motor behaviors to changing contexts, and neuroactive steroids—mainly referred to as estrogens—may regulate this process. However, the role of androgens in this process has not been established, although they may affect cerebellar physiology. Thus, this study aims to determine whether the activation of androgenic neural pathways may take part in controlling the vestibuloocular (VOR) and optokinetic reflexes (OKR), which depend on a defined cerebellar circuitry. To answer this question, we acutely blocked the activation of androgen receptors (Ars) using systemic administration of the Ars antagonist flutamide (FLUT; 20 mg/Kg) in peripubertal male rats. Then, we evaluated the FLUT effect on general oculomotor performance in the VOR and OKR as well as VOR adaptive gain increases and decreases. We used a paradigm causing fast VOR adaptation that combined in phase/out phase visuo-vestibular stimulations. We found that FLUT impaired the gain increase and decrease in VOR adaptation. However, FLUT altered neither acute nor overtime basal ocular-motor performance in the VOR or OKR. These findings indicate that the activation of androgenic neural pathways participates in phenomena leading to fast VOR adaptation, probably through the modulation of plasticity mechanisms that underlie adaptation of this reflex. Conversely, androgens may not be essential for neural information processing demands in basal ocular-motor reflexes. Moreover, our results suggest that androgens, possibly testosterone and dihydrotestosterone, could rapidly regulate motor memory encoding in the VOR adaptation, acting at both cerebellar and extracerebellar plasticity sites.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>This study aimed to determine the pattern of <sup>18</sup>F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) related to postmortem Lewy body disease (LBD) pathology in clinical Alzheimer’s disease (AD).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>FDG-PET scans were analyzed in 62 autopsy-confirmed patients and 110 controls in the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. Based on neuropathologic evaluations on Braak’s stage for neurofibrillary tangle, Consortium to Establish a Registry for AD score for neuritic plaque, and Lewy-related pathology, subjects were classified into AD(-)/LBD(-), AD(-)/LBD(+), AD(+)/LBD(-), and AD(+)/LBD(+) groups. The association between postmortem LBD and AD pathologies and antemortem brain metabolism was evaluated.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>AD and LBD pathologies had significant interaction effects to decrease metabolism in the cerebellar vermis, bilateral caudate, putamen, basal frontal cortex, and anterior cingulate cortex in addition to the left side of entorhinal cortex and amygdala; and those to increase metabolism in the bilateral parietal and occipital cortices. LBD pathology was associated with hypermetabolism in the cerebellar vermis, bilateral putamen, anterior cingulate cortex, and basal frontal cortex, corresponding to the LB-related hypermetabolic patterns. AD pathology was associated with hypometabolism in the bilateral hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and posterior cingulate cortex regardless of LBD pathology, while LBD pathology was associated with hypermetabolism in the bilateral putamen and anterior cingulate cortex regardless of AD pathology.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Postmortem LBD and AD pathologies had significant interaction effects on the antemortem brain metabolism in clinical AD patients. Specific metabolic patterns related to AD and LBD pathologies could be elucidated when simultaneously considering the two pathologies.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Restoring anti-JC virus (JCV) immunity is the only treatment of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). Interleukin-7 is a cytokine that increases number and function of T cells. We analyzed a population of PML patients who received recombinant human IL-7 (rhIL-7) to estimate survival and its determinants.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>After exclusion of patients with missing data or receiving other immunotherapies, findings from 64 patients with proven PML who received rhIL-7 between 2007 and 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. Logistic regression was used to analyze variables associated with one-year survival.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Underlying conditions were HIV/AIDS (n = 27, 42%), hematological malignancies (n = 16, 25%), primary immunodeficiencies (n = 13, 20%), solid organ transplantation (n = 4, 6%) and chronic inflammatory diseases (n = 4, 6%). One-year survival was 54.7% and did not differ by underlying condition. Survival was not associated with baseline characteristics, but with a &gt;50% increase in blood lymphocytes (OR 4.1, 95%CI 1.2–14.9) and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (OR 5.9, 95%CI 1.7–23.3), and a &gt; 1 log copies/mL decrease in cerebrospinal fluid JCV DNA (OR 7.6, 95%CI 1.6–56.1) during the first month after rhIL-7 initiation. Side effects were mainly local and flu-like symptoms (n = 8, 12.5%) and PML-immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) (n = 5, 8%).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In this non-controlled retrospective study, survival did not differ from that expected in HIV/AIDS patients, but might have been improved in those with hematological malignancies, primary immunodeficiencies and transplant recipients. RhIL-7 might have contributed to the increase in blood lymphocytes and decrease in CSF JCV replication that were associated with better survival. ANN NEUROL 2022;91:496–505</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective of this study was to evaluate novel plasma p-tau231 and p-tau181, as well as Aβ<sub>40</sub> and Aβ<sub>42</sub> assays as indicators of tau and Aβ pathologies measured with positron emission tomography (PET), and their association with cognitive change, in cognitively unimpaired older adults.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In a cohort of 244 older adults at risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) owing to a family history of AD dementia, we measured single molecule array (Simoa)-based plasma tau biomarkers (p-tau231 and p-tau181), Aβ<sub>40</sub> and Aβ<sub>42</sub> with immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry, and Simoa neurofilament light (NfL). A subset of 129 participants underwent amyloid-β (<sup>18</sup>F-NAV4694) and tau (<sup>18</sup>F-flortaucipir) PET assessments. We investigated plasma biomarker associations with Aβ and tau PET at the global and voxel level and tested plasma biomarker combinations for improved detection of Aβ-PET positivity. We also investigated associations with 8-year cognitive change.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Plasma p-tau biomarkers correlated with flortaucipir binding in medial temporal, parietal, and inferior temporal regions. P-tau231 showed further associations in lateral parietal and occipital cortices. Plasma Aβ<sub>42/40</sub> explained more variance in global Aβ-PET binding than Aβ<sub>42</sub> alone. P-tau231 also showed strong and widespread associations with cortical Aβ-PET binding. Combining Aβ<sub>42/40</sub> with p-tau231 or p-tau181 allowed for good distinction between Aβ-negative and -positive participants (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC] range = 0.81–0.86). Individuals with low plasma Aβ<sub>42/40</sub> and high p-tau experienced faster cognitive decline.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Plasma p-tau231 showed more robust associations with PET biomarkers than p-tau181 in presymptomatic individuals. The combination of p-tau and Aβ<sub>42/40</sub> biomarkers detected early AD pathology and cognitive decline. Such markers could be used as prescreening tools to reduce the cost of prevention trials.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Leigh Syndrome: A Study of 209 Patients at the Beijing Children's Hospital</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Leigh syndrome (LS) is a heterogeneous neurodegenerative disease and the most frequent pediatric manifestation of mitochondrial disease. In the largest patient collection to date, this study aimed to provide new insights into the clinical and genetic spectrum of LS, defect-specific associations, and predictors of disease course and survival.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Clinical, metabolic, neuroimaging, onset, and survival data were collected from the medical records of 209 patients referred to the Beijing Children's Hospital with symmetrical basal ganglia and/or brainstem neuroimaging changes indicative of LS by 30 centers from the Chinese network of mitochondrial disease (mitoC-NET) between January 2013 and July 2021 for exploratory analysis.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Pathogenic variants were identified in 52 genes, most frequently <i>MT-ATP6</i>, <i>SURF1</i>, and <i>PDHA1</i>. Maternally inherited variants accounted for 42% (heteroplasmy level ≥90% in 64%). Phenotypes spanned 92 Human Phenotype Ontology terms. Elevated serum lactate (144/195), global developmental delay (142/209), and developmental regression (103/209) were most frequent. Discriminating neuroimaging and/or clinical features were identified for <i>MT-ATP6</i> (m.9176T&gt;C), <i>MT-ND5</i>, <i>PDHA1</i>, <i>SUCLG1</i>, and <i>SURF1</i>. Poorest survival was associated with <i>MT-ND5</i>, <i>MT-ATP6</i> (m.8993T&gt;C and m.9176T&gt;C), <i>SURF1</i>, and <i>ALDH5A1</i> (≤50% 3 year's survival), in contrast to milder defects with specific treatment (<i>ECHS1</i> and <i>SLC19A3</i>, 100% 3 year's survival).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our data define phenotype, onset, and survival of LS in a defect-specific manner, identifying features discriminating between genetic defects and predictive of disease outcome. These findings are essential to early diagnosis, in optimizing family counseling, and to the design and monitoring of future clinical trials, the next frontier of LS research.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">International Validation of the Erasmus Guillain–Barré Syndrome Respiratory Insufficiency Score</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>This study aimed to validate the Erasmus Guillain–Barré Syndrome Respiratory Insufficiency Score in the International Guillain–Barré Syndrome Outcome Study cohort, and to improve its performance and region-specificity.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We examined data from the first 1,500 included patients, aged ≥6 years and not ventilated prior to study entry. Patients with a clinical variant or mild symptoms were also included. Outcome was mechanical ventilation within the first week from study entry. Model performance was assessed regarding the discriminative ability (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) and the calibration (observed vs predicted probability of mechanical ventilation), in the full cohort and in Europe/North America and Asia separately. We recalibrated the model to improve its performance and region-specificity.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In the group of 1,023 eligible patients (Europe/North America n = 842, Asia n = 104, other n = 77), 104 (10%) required mechanical ventilation within the first week from study entry. Area under the curve values were ≥0.80 for all validation subgroups. Mean observed proportions of mechanical ventilation were lower than predicted risks: full cohort 10% versus 21%, Europe/North America 9% versus 21%, and Asia 17% versus 23%. After recalibration, predicted risks for the full cohort and Europe/North America corresponded to observed proportions.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This prospective, international cohort study validated the Erasmus Guillain–Barré Syndrome Respiratory Insufficiency Score, and showed that the model can be used in the full spectrum of Guillain–Barré syndrome patients. In addition, a more accurate, region-specific version of the model was developed for patients from Europe/North America. ANN NEUROL 2022;91:521–531</p>

                <p>Retromer deficiency is reported in Down syndrome and correlates with amyloidosis, however, its association with tau neuropathology remains unclear. Down syndrome and control brain tissues were evaluated for phosphorylated tau, tau modulators, and cathepsin-D activity. Several kinases and phosphatase PP2A were unchanged, but tau phosphorylation was elevated, and cathepsin-D activity decreased in aged patients with Down syndrome. Retromer proteins positively associated with soluble tau, whereas pathogenic tau negatively correlated with retromer proteins and cathepsin-D activity. Retromer deficiency and consequent reduction of cathepsin-D activity may contribute to pathogenic tau accumulation, thus, retromer represents a viable therapeutic target against tau pathology in Down syndrome.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Comparing Natural History of Early and Late Onset Pediatric Multiple Sclerosis</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>This study was undertaken to describe and compare disease course and prognosis of early (ie, disease onset before age 11 years) and late (ie, disease onset after age 11 years) onset pediatric multiple sclerosis.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Prospectively collected clinical information from Italian Multiple Sclerosis Register of 1993 pediatric multiple sclerosis patients, of whom 172 had early onset, was analyzed. Cox models adjusted for sex, baseline Expanded Disability Status Scale score, and disease-modifying treatments and stratified for diagnostic criteria adopted (Poser vs McDonald) were used to assess the risk of reaching irreversible Expanded Disability Status Scale scores of 3, 4, and 6, and conversion to secondary progressive phenotype in early versus late onset pediatric patients. Prognostic factors were also evaluated.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A greater proportion of males, isolated brainstem involvement, and longer time interval between first and second clinical episode were observed in early versus late onset pediatric patients. Compared to late onset, early onset pediatric patients took longer from disease onset to convert to secondary progressive phenotype and to reach all disability milestones. Recovery from first demyelinating event, time to first relapse, annualized relapse rate during the first 3 years of disease, and disease-modifying treatment exposure were independent predictors for long-term disability in early onset pediatric patients. In late onset pediatric patients, isolated optic neuritis, multifocal symptoms, and progressive course at disease onset were additional predictors for long-term disability.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These findings point toward the existence of a different natural history in early versus late onset pediatric multiple sclerosis patients. ANN NEUROL 2022;91:483–495</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Axonal Excitability Does Not Differ between Painful and Painless Diabetic or Chemotherapy‐Induced Distal Symmetrical Polyneuropathy in a Multicenter Observational Study</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Axonal excitability reflects ion channel function, and it is proposed that this may be a biomarker in painful (vs painless) polyneuropathy. Our objective was to investigate the relationship between axonal excitability parameters and chronic neuropathic pain in deeply phenotyped cohorts with diabetic or chemotherapy-induced distal symmetrical polyneuropathy.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Two hundred thirty-nine participants with diabetic polyneuropathy were recruited from sites in the UK and Denmark, and 39 participants who developed chemotherapy-induced polyneuropathy were recruited from Denmark. Participants were separated into those with probable or definite neuropathic pain and those without neuropathic pain. Axonal excitability of large myelinated fibers was measured with the threshold tracking technique. The stimulus site was the median nerve, and the recording sites were the index finger (sensory studies) and abductor pollicis brevis muscle (motor studies).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Participants with painless and painful polyneuropathy were well matched across clinical variables. Sensory and motor axonal excitability measures, including recovery cycle, threshold electrotonus, strength–duration time constant, and current–threshold relationship, did not show differences between participants with painful and painless diabetic polyneuropathy, and there were only minor changes for chemotherapy-induced polyneuropathy.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Axonal excitability did not significantly differ between painful and painless diabetic or chemotherapy-induced polyneuropathy in a multicenter observational study. Threshold tracking assesses the excitability of myelinated axons; the majority of nociceptors are unmyelinated, and although there is some overlap of the "channelome" between these axonal populations, our results suggest that alternative measures such as microneurography are required to understand the relationship between sensory neuron excitability and neuropathic pain.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective of this study was to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and benefits of a teleneurology clinic serving adults usually attending a neurology outpatient clinic in Lusaka, Zambia during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Televisits were offered to patients scheduled for neurology appointments between March and July 2020 using the telephone, WhatsApp video, or Zoom calls based on patient accessibility. Visit outcomes were documented, and patient and neurologist satisfaction surveys were completed.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Of 323 patients, 195 (60%) were reachable by telephone, 179 of these were alive, and 74% (133/179) of those alive agreed to a televisit. Stroke (30%), seizures (20%), and headache (16%) were the most common diagnoses seen via televisit. Most televisits (80%) were by telephone call, 14% by WhatsApp video call, and 6% by Zoom. Nearly one-third (30%) of the patients were stable and discharged from the clinic, 32% only required medication refills, and 19% required an in-person visit. Sixty patients (out of 85 reachable and 71% response rate) and 7 of 9 neurologists (78% response rate) completed satisfaction surveys. Neurologists reported greater assessment confidence with Zoom, but confidence was high for all modalities. Patients preferring televisits (75%, 45/60) noted reduced expense and time requirements, whereas those preferring in-person visits (22%, 13/60) cited the desire for physical examinations. Overall, 98% of patients and 100% of neurologists were satisfied with televisits.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Teleneurology visits were acceptable and feasible for adults attending an outpatient neurology clinic in Zambia and their neurologists. They offer a promising supplement to in-person visits in resource-limited settings, even when video-conference capabilities and electronic medical records are absent.

                <p>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 infection) can lead to intensive care unit (ICU) admission and critical illness myopathy (CIM). We examined 3 ICU patients with COVID-19 who required mechanical ventilation for pneumonia and developed CIM. Pathological examination of the skeletal muscle biopsies revealed myopathic changes consistent with CIM, variable inflammation with autophagic vacuoles, SARS-CoV immunostaining + fibers/granules, and electron microscopy findings of mitochondrial abnormalities and coronavirus-like particles. Although mitochondrial dysfunction with compromised energy production is a critical pathogenic mechanism of non-COVID-19-associated CIM, in our series of COVID-19-associated CIM, myopathic changes including prominent mitochondrial damage suggest a similar mechanism and association with direct SARS-CoV-2 muscle infection.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We examined how maternal epilepsy and use of antiseizure medications in pregnancy was associated with offspring mortality.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This population-based cohort study included all live- and stillborn singletons in Denmark between 1981 and 2016. We used nation-wide registers to retrieve information on pregnancy characteristics, epilepsy diagnoses, use of antiseizure medications, and mortality. Adjusted mortality rate ratios (MRR) were estimated using log-linear Poisson regression.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The cohort consisted of 1,862,474 children. In total, 12,026 live-born children died during follow-up, of whom 170 (1.4%) were offspring of mothers with epilepsy. Overall mortality was increased in offspring of mothers with epilepsy compared to offspring of mothers without epilepsy (MRR = 1.46, 95% CI: 1.23–1.71), driven by an excess mortality only in the first year of life. Mortality was increased for natural deaths (MRR = 1.50, 95% CI: 1.25–1.78) but not from unnatural deaths (MRR = 1.38, 95% CI: 0.84–2.14), and only in offspring of women with epilepsy who used antiseizure medications during pregnancy (MRR = 1.51, 95% CI: 1.00–2.17), but not in offspring of women with epilepsy who did not use antiseizure medications while pregnant (MRR = 0.97, 95% CI: 0.69–1.31). When analyses were restricted to children born from 2000 and onwards, the excess mortality that was observed in the first year of life among children of mothers with epilepsy, was no longer evident.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>During the 1981 to 1999 epoch, offspring of women with epilepsy were at increased risk of dying in the first year of life. However, this risk did not extend to children born after 2000. Future retrospective studies of the effects of maternal epilepsy on the health of the offspring should take this difference into account. ANN NEUROL 2022;91:455–465</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Repulsive guidance molecule-a (RGMa) is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked glycoprotein which has multiple functions including axon growth inhibition and immune regulation. However, its role in the pathophysiology of neuromyelitis optica (NMO) is poorly understood. Perivascular astrocytopathy, which is induced by the leakage of aquaporin-4 (AQP4)-specific IgG into the central nervous system parenchyma, is a key feature of NMO pathology. We investigated the RGMa involvement in the pathology of NMO astrocytopathy, and tested a therapeutic potential of humanized anti-RGMa monoclonal antibody (RGMa-mAb).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Using a clinically relevant NMO rat model, we evaluated the therapeutic effect of a RGMa-mAb by behavioral testing, immunohistochemistry, and gene expression assay. We further performed in vitro experiments to address the RGMa-signaling in macrophages.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In both NMO rats and an NMO-autopsied sample, RGMa was expressed by the spared neurons and astrocytes, whereas its receptor neogenin was expressed by infiltrating macrophages. AQP4-IgG-induced astrocytopathy and clinical exacerbation in NMO rats were ameliorated by RGMa-mAb treatment. RGMa-mAb treatment significantly suppressed neutrophil infiltration, and decreased the expression of neutrophil chemoattractants. Interestingly, neogenin-expressing macrophages accumulated in the lesion expressed CXCL2, a strong neutrophil chemoattractant, and further analysis revealed that RGMa directly regulated CXCL2 expression in macrophages. Finally, we found that our NMO rats developed neuropathic pain, and RGMa-mAb treatment effectively ameliorated the severity of neuropathic pain.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>RGMa signaling in infiltrated macrophages is a critical driver of neutrophil-related astrocytopathy in NMO lesions, and RGMa-mAb may provide an efficient therapeutic strategy for NMO-associated neuropathic pain and motor deficits in patients with NMO.

                <p>This study shows that plasma p-tau231 may be a more robust indicator of Aβ and tau pathologies in pre-clinical Alzheimer's disease than plasma p-tau181. Associations of p-tau231 with flortaucipir (Tau-PET) binding was mainly observable in the precuneus, medial and lateral temporal, and parietal regions. See paper in this issue by Meyer et al. (pp. 548–560).</p>

                Stress impacts memory, with important implications for stress-related mental disorders. Schwabe and colleagues review recent advances in the field and propose an integrative framework that links cellular, systems, and cognitive mechanisms underlying the impact of acute stress on memory.

                The fern <i>Ceratopteris richardii</i> has been studied as a model organism for over 50 years because it is easy to grow and has a short life cycle. In particular, as the first homosporous vascular plant for which genomic resources were developed, <i>C. richardii</i> has been an important system for studying plant evolution. However, we know relatively little about the natural history of <i>C. richardii</i>. In this article, we summarize what is known about this aspect of <i>C. richardii</i>, and discuss how learning more about its natural history could greatly increase our understanding of the evolution of land plants.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Ligand binding remodels protein side chain conformational heterogeneity</a></h4>

              
                While protein conformational heterogeneity plays an important role in many aspects of biological function, including ligand binding, its impact has been difficult to quantify. Macromolecular X-ray diffraction is commonly interpreted with a static structure, but it can provide information on both the anharmonic and harmonic contributions to conformational heterogeneity. Here, through multiconformer modeling of time- and space-averaged electron density, we measure conformational heterogeneity of 743 stringently matched pairs of crystallographic datasets that reflect unbound/apo and ligand-bound/holo states. When comparing the conformational heterogeneity of side chains, we observe that when binding site residues become more rigid upon ligand binding, distant residues tend to become more flexible, especially in non-solvent exposed regions. Among ligand properties, we observe increased protein flexibility as the number of hydrogen bonds decrease and relative hydrophobicity increases. Across a series of 13 inhibitor bound structures of CDK2, we find that conformational heterogeneity is correlated with inhibitor features and identify how conformational changes propagate differences in conformational heterogeneity away from the binding site. Collectively, our findings agree with models emerging from NMR studies suggesting that residual side chain entropy can modulate affinity and point to the need to integrate both static conformational changes and conformational heterogeneity in models of ligand binding.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Perceptual coupling and decoupling of the default mode network during mind-wandering and reading</a></h4>

              
                While reading, our mind can wander to unrelated autobiographical information, creating a perceptually decoupled state detrimental to narrative comprehension. To understand how this mind-wandering state emerges, we asked whether retrieving autobiographical content necessitates functional disengagement from visual input. In Experiment 1, brain activity was recorded using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in an experimental situation mimicking naturally occurring mind-wandering, allowing us to precisely delineate neural regions involved in memory and reading. Individuals read expository texts and ignored personally relevant autobiographical memories, as well as the opposite situation. Medial regions of the default mode network (DMN) were recruited during memory retrieval. In contrast, left temporal and lateral prefrontal regions of the DMN, as well as ventral visual cortex, were recruited when reading for comprehension. Experiment two used functional connectivity both at rest and during tasks to establish that (i) DMN regions linked to memory are more functionally decoupled from regions of ventral visual cortex than regions in the same network engaged when reading; and (ii) individuals with more self-generated mental contents and poorer comprehension, while reading in the lab, showed more decoupling between visually connected DMN sites important for reading and primary visual cortex. A similar pattern of connectivity was found in Experiment 1, with greater coupling between this DMN site and visual cortex when participants reported greater focus on reading in the face of conflict from autobiographical memory cues; moreover, the retrieval of personally relevant memories increased the decoupling of these sites. These converging data suggest we lose track of the narrative when our minds wander because generating autobiographical mental content relies on cortical regions within the DMN which are functionally decoupled from ventral visual regions engaged during reading.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Inhibiting USP16 rescues stem cell aging and memory in an Alzheimer's model</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease observed with aging that represents the most common form of dementia. To date, therapies targeting end-stage disease plaques, tangles, or inflammation have limited efficacy. Therefore, we set out to identify a potential earlier targetable phenotype. Utilizing a mouse model of AD and human fetal cells harboring mutant amyloid precursor protein, we show cell intrinsic neural precursor cell (NPC) dysfunction precedes widespread inflammation and amyloid plaque pathology, making it the earliest defect in the evolution of the disease. We demonstrate that reversing impaired NPC self-renewal <i>via</i> genetic reduction of USP16, a histone modifier and critical physiological antagonist of the Polycomb Repressor Complex 1, can prevent downstream cognitive defects and decrease astrogliosis<i> in vivo</i>. Reduction of USP16 led to decreased expression of senescence gene <i>Cdkn2a</i> and mitigated aberrant regulation of the BMP pathway, a previously unknown function of USP16. Thus, we reveal USP16 as a novel target in an AD model that can both ameliorate the NPC defect and rescue memory and learning through its regulation of both <i>Cdkn2a</i> and BMP signaling.'

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Structural insights into recognition of chemokine receptors by Staphylococcus aureus leukotoxins</a></h4>

              
                Staphylococcus aureus (SA) leukocidin LukED belongs to a family of bicomponent pore forming toxins that play important roles in SA immune evasion and nutrient acquisition. LukED targets specific G protein-coupled chemokine receptors to lyse human erythrocytes (red blood cells) and leukocytes (white blood cells). The first recognition step of receptors is critical for specific cell targeting and lysis. The structural and molecular bases for this mechanism are not well understood but could constitute essential information to guide antibiotic development. Here, we characterized the interaction of LukE with chemokine receptors ACKR1, CCR2 and CCR5 using a combination of structural, pharmacological and computational approaches. First, crystal structures of LukE in complex with a small molecule mimicking sulfotyrosine side chain (p-cresyl sulfate) and with peptides containing sulfotyrosines issued from receptor sequences revealed the location of receptor sulfotyrosine binding sites in the toxins. Then, by combining previous and novel experimental data with protein docking, classical and accelerated weight histogram (AWH) molecular dynamics we propose models of the ACKR1-LukE and CCR5-LukE complexes. This work provides novel insights into chemokine receptor recognition by leukotoxins and suggests that the conserved sulfotyrosine binding pocket could be a target of choice for future drug development.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">How to assemble a scale-invariant gradient</a></h4>

              
                Intracellular protein gradients serve a variety of functions, such as the establishment of cell polarity or to provide positional information for gene expression in developing embryos. Given that cell size in a population can vary considerably, for the protein gradients to work properly they often have to be scaled to the size of the cell. Here we examine a model of protein gradient formation within a cell that relies on cytoplasmic diffusion and cortical transport of proteins toward a cell pole. We show that the shape of the protein gradient is determined solely by the cell geometry. Furthermore, we show that the length scale over which the protein concentration in the gradient varies is determined by the linear dimensions of the cell, independent of the diffusion constant or the transport speed. This gradient provides scale-invariant positional information within a cell, which can be used for assembly of intracellular structures whose size is scaled to the linear dimensions of the cell, such as the cytokinetic ring and actin cables in budding yeast cells.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Activity in perirhinal and entorhinal cortex predicts perceived visual similarities among category exemplars with highest precision</a></h4>

              
                Vision neuroscience has made great strides in understanding the hierarchical organization of object representations along the ventral visual stream (VVS). How VVS representations capture fine-grained visual similarities between objects that observers subjectively perceive has received limited examination so far. In the current study, we addressed this question by focusing on perceived visual similarities among subordinate exemplars of real world-categories. We hypothesized that these perceived similarities are reflected with highest fidelity in neural activity patterns downstream from inferotemporal regions, namely in perirhinal and anterolateral entorhinal cortex in the medial temporal-lobe. To address this issue with fMRI, we administered a modified 1-Back task that required discrimination between category exemplars as well as categorization. Further, we obtained observer-specific ratings of perceived visual similarities, which predicted behavioural performance during scanning. As anticipated, we found that activity patterns in perirhinal and anterolateral entorhinal cortex predicted the structure of perceived visual similarity relationships among category exemplars, including its observer-specific component, with higher precision than any other VVS region. Our findings provide new evidence that subjective aspects of object perception that rely on fine-grained visual differentiation are reflected with highest fidelity in the medial temporal lobe.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Nucleoporin107 mediates female sexual differentiation via Dsx</a></h4>

              
                We recently identified a missense mutation in Nucleoporin107 (Nup107; D447N) underlying XX-ovarian-dysgenesis, a rare disorder characterized by underdeveloped and dysfunctional ovaries. Modeling of the human mutation in <i>Drosophila</i> or specific knockdown of Nup107 in the gonadal soma resulted in ovarian-dysgenesis-like phenotypes. Transcriptomic analysis identified the somatic sex-determination gene <i>doublesex (dsx)</i> as a target of Nup107. Establishing Dsx as a primary relevant target of Nup107, either loss or gain of Dsx in the gonadal soma is sufficient to mimic or rescue the phenotypes induced by <i>Nup107</i> loss. Importantly, the aberrant phenotypes induced by compromising either <i>Nup107</i> or <i>dsx</i> are reminiscent of BMP signaling hyperactivation. Remarkably, in this context, the metalloprotease AdamTS-A, a transcriptional target of both Dsx and Nup107, is necessary for the calibration of BMP signaling. As modulation of BMP signaling is a conserved critical determinant of soma-germline interaction, the sex and tissue specific deployment of Dsx-F by Nup107 seems crucial for the maintenance of the homeostatic balance between the germ cells and somatic gonadal cells.

                Division of labor between cells is ubiquitous in biology but the use of multi-cellular consortia for engineering applications is only beginning to be explored. A significant advantage of multi-cellular circuits is their potential to be modular with respect to composition but this claim has not yet been extensively tested using experiments and quantitative modeling. Here, we construct a library of 24 yeast strains capable of sending, receiving or responding to three molecular signals, characterize them experimentally and build quantitative models of their input-output relationships. We then compose these strains into two- and three-strain cascades as well as a four-strain bistable switch and show that experimentally measured consortia dynamics can be predicted from the models of the constituent parts. To further explore the achievable range of behaviors, we perform a fully automated computational search over all two-, three- and four-strain consortia to identify combinations that realize target behaviors including logic gates, band-pass filters and time pulses. Strain combinations that are predicted to map onto a target behavior are further computationally optimized and then experimentally tested. Experiments closely track computational predictions. The high reliability of these model descriptions further strengthens the feasibility and highlights the potential for distributed computing in synthetic biology.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Stage-specific control of oligodendrocyte survival and morphogenesis by TDP-43</a></h4>

              
                Generation of oligodendrocytes in the adult brain enables both adaptive changes in neural circuits and regeneration of myelin sheaths destroyed by injury, disease, and normal aging. This transformation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) into myelinating oligodendrocytes requires processing of distinct mRNAs at different stages of cell maturation. Although mislocalization and aggregation of the RNA binding protein, TDP-43, occur in both neurons and glia in neurodegenerative diseases, the consequences of TDP-43 loss within different stages of the oligodendrocyte lineage are not well understood. By performing stage-specific genetic inactivation of <i>Tardbp in vivo</i>, we show that oligodendrocyte lineage cells are differentially sensitive to loss of TDP-43. While OPCs depend on TDP-43 for survival, with conditional deletion resulting in cascading cell loss followed by rapid regeneration to restore their density, oligodendrocytes become less sensitive to TDP-43 depletion as they mature. Deletion of TDP-43 early in the maturation process led to eventual oligodendrocyte degeneration, seizures and premature lethality, while oligodendrocytes that experienced late deletion survived and mice exhibited a normal lifespan. At both stages, TDP-43 deficient oligodendrocytes formed fewer and thinner myelin sheaths and extended new processes that inappropriately wrapped neuronal somata and blood vessels. Transcriptional analysis revealed that in the absence of TDP-43, key proteins involved in oligodendrocyte maturation and myelination were misspliced, leading to aberrant incorporation of cryptic exons. Inducible deletion of TDP-43 from oligodendrocytes in the adult CNS induced the same progressive morphological changes and mice acquired profound hindlimb weakness, suggesting that loss of TDP-43 function in oligodendrocytes may contribute to neuronal dysfunction in neurodegenerative disease.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A light-gated transcriptional recorder for detecting cell-cell contacts</a></h4>

              
                Technologies for detecting cell-cell contacts are powerful tools for studying a wide range of biological processes, from neuronal signaling to cancer-immune interactions within the tumor microenvironment. Here, we report TRACC (Transcriptional Readout Activated by Cell-cell Contacts), a GPCR-based transcriptional recorder of cellular contacts, which converts contact events into stable transgene expression. TRACC is derived from our previous protein-protein interaction recorders, SPARK (Kim et al., 2017) and SPARK2 (Kim et al., 2019), reported in this journal. TRACC incorporates light gating via the light-oxygen-voltage-sensing (LOV) domain, which provides user-defined temporal control of tool activation and reduces background. We show that TRACC detects cell-cell contacts with high specificity and sensitivity in mammalian cell culture and that it can be used to interrogate interactions between neurons and glioma, a form of brain cancer.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Purinergic receptor P2RY14 cAMP signaling regulates Schwann cell precursor self-renewal, Schwann cell proliferation, and nerve tumor initiation in a mouse model of neurofibromatosis</a></h4>

              
                Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is characterized by nerve tumors called neurofibromas, in which Schwann cells (SCs) show deregulated RAS signaling. NF1 is also implicated in regulation of cAMP. We identified the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) P2RY14 in human neurofibromas, neurofibroma-derived SC precursors (SCPs), mature SCs and mouse SCPs. Mouse <i>Nf1-/-</i>SCP self-renewal was reduced by genetic or pharmacological inhibition of P2RY14. In a mouse model of NF1, genetic deletion of P2RY14 rescued low cAMP signaling, increased mouse survival, delayed neurofibroma initiation, and improved SC Remak bundles. P2RY14 signals via Gi to increase intracellular cAMP, implicating P2RY14 as a key upstream regulator of cAMP. We found that elevation of cAMP by either blocking the degradation of cAMP or by using a P2RY14 inhibitor diminished <i>NF1-/-</i>SCP self-renewal <i>in vitro</i> and neurofibroma SC proliferation in <i>in vivo</i>. These studies identifyP2RY14 as a critical regulator of SCP self-renewal, SC proliferation and neurofibroma initiation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Implicit versus explicit timing - separate or shared mechanisms?</a></h4>

              
                Time implicitly shapes cognition, but time is also explicitly represented, for instance in the form of durations. Parsimoniously, the brain could use the same mechanisms for implicit and explicit timing. Yet, the evidence has been equivocal, revealing both joint versus separate signatures of timing. Here, we directly compared implicit and explicit timing using magnetoencephalography, whose temporal resolution allows investigating the different stages of the timing processes. Implicit temporal predictability was induced in an auditory paradigm by a manipulation of the foreperiod. Participants received two consecutive task instructions: discriminate pitch (indirect measure of implicit timing) or duration (direct measure of explicit timing). The results show that the human brain efficiently extracts implicit temporal statistics of sensory environments, to enhance the behavioral and neural responses to auditory stimuli, but that those temporal predictions did not improve explicit timing. In both tasks, attentional orienting in time during predictive foreperiods was indexed by an increase in alpha power over visual and parietal areas. Furthermore, pre-target induced beta power in sensorimotor and parietal areas increased during implicit compared to explicit timing, in line with the suggested role for beta oscillations in temporal prediction. Interestingly, no distinct neural dynamics emerged when participants explicitly paid attention to time, compared to implicit timing. Our work thus indicates that implicit timing shapes the behavioral and sensory response in an automatic way, and is reflected in oscillatory neural dynamics, while the translation of implicit temporal statistics to explicit durations remains somewhat inconclusive, possibly due to the more abstract nature of this task.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Multisensory integration in neurons of the medial pulvinar of macaque monkey</a></h4>

              
                The pulvinar is a heterogeneous thalamic nucleus, which is well developed in primates. One of its subdivisions, the medial pulvinar, is connected to many cortical areas, including the visual, auditory and somatosensory cortices, as well as with multisensory areas and premotor areas. However, except for the visual modality, little is known about its sensory functions. A hypothesis is that, as a region of convergence of information from different sensory modalities, the medial pulvinar plays a role in multisensory integration. To test this hypothesis, two macaque monkeys were trained to a fixation task and the responses of single-units to visual, auditory and auditory-visual stimuli were examined. Analysis revealed auditory, visual and multisensory neurons in the medial pulvinar. It also revealed multisensory integration in this structure, mainly subadditive and suppressive. These findings show that the medial pulvinar is involved in multisensory integration.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Investigating the "two-hit hypothesis": effects of prenatal maternal immune activation and adolescent cannabis use on neurodevelopment in mice</a></h4>

              
                Background: Prenatal exposure to maternal immune activation (MIA) and chronic adolescent cannabis use are both risk factors for neuropsychiatric disorders. However, exposure to a single risk factor may not result in major mental illness, indicating that multiple exposures may be required for illness onset. Here, we examine whether combined exposure to prenatal MIA and adolescent delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main psychoactive component of cannabis, lead to enduring neuroanatomical and behavioural changes in adulthood. Methods: Mice were prenatally exposed to viral mimetic, poly I:C (5mg/kg), or vehicle at gestational day (GD)9, and postnatally exposed to chronic THC (5mg/kg, intraperitoneal) or vehicle during adolescence (postnatal day [PND]28-45). Longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed pre-treatment, PND25, post-treatment, PND50, and in adulthood, PND85, followed by behavioural tests for anxiety-like, social, and sensorimotor gating. Post-mortem assessment of cannabinoid (CB)1 and 2 receptor expressing cells was performed in altered regions identified by MRI (anterior cingulate and somatosensory cortices, striatum, and hippocampus). Results: Subtle deviations in neurodevelopmental trajectory and subthreshold anxiety-like behaviours were observed in mice exposed to both risk factors. Sex-dependent effects were observed in patterns of shared brain-behaviour covariation, indicative of potential sex differences in response to MIA and THC. Density of CB1 and CB2 receptor positive cells was significantly decreased in all mice exposed to MIA, THC, or both. Conclusions: These findings suggest that there may be a cumulative effect of risk factor exposure on gross neuroanatomical development, and that the endocannabinoid system may be sensitive to both prenatal MIA, adolescent THC, or the combination.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Lipid Accumulation Induced by APOE4 Impairs Microglial Surveillance of Neuronal-Network Activity</a></h4>

              
                Apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) is the greatest known genetic risk factor for developing late-onset Alzheimers disease and its expression in microglia is associated with pro-inflammatory states. How the interaction of APOE4 microglia with neurons differs from microglia expressing the disease-neutral allele APOE3 is currently unknown. Here, we employ CRISPR-edited induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to dissect the impact of APOE4 in neuron-microglia communication. Our results reveal that APOE4 induces a distinct metabolic program in microglia that is marked by the accumulation of intracellular neutral lipid stores through impaired lipid catabolism. Importantly, this altered lipid-accumulated state shifts microglia away from homeostatic surveillance and renders APOE4 microglia weakly responsive to neuronal activity. By examining the transcriptional signatures of APOE3 versus APOE4 microglia before and after exposure to neuronal conditioned media, we further established that neuronal soluble cues differentially induce a lipogenic program in APOE4 microglia that exacerbates pro-inflammatory signals. Pharmacological blockade of lipogenesis in APOE4 microglia is sufficient to diminish intracellular lipid accumulation and restore microglial homeostasis. Remarkably, unlike APOE3 microglia that support neuronal network activity, co-culture of APOE4 microglia with neurons disrupts the coordinated activity of neuronal ensembles. We identified that through decreased uptake of extracellular fatty acids and lipoproteins, APOE4 microglia disrupts the net flux of lipids which results in decreased neuronal activity via the potentiation of the lipid-gated K+ channel, GIRK3. These findings suggest that neurological diseases that exhibit abnormal neuronal network-level disturbances may in part be triggered by impairment in lipid homeostasis in non-neuronal cells, underscoring a novel therapeutic route to restore circuit function in the diseased brain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sleep Deprivation Induces Acute Dissociation via Altered EEG Rhythms Expression and Connectivity.</a></h4>

              
                The fragmented sleep, fragmented mind hypothesis has associated sleep disturbances and dissociative states in subjects with dissociative traits, as supported by neurophysiological theories of consciousness stating that altered states might result from an altered functional interaction among brain modules due to inefficient sleep processes. Irrespective of dissociative traits, it is conceivable that a labile sleep-wake cycle might fuel dissociative states such as derealization, depersonalization, and dissociative amnesia. To verify whether acute sleep loss can prompt dissociative states and to identify possible psychophysiological correlates, we evaluated dissociative experiences (by means of Phenomenology of Consciousness Inventory and Clinician Administered Dissociative State Scale) and resting state EEG features (band-wise spectral content and phase synchronization) after total sleep deprivation. After deprivation, participants reported increased perception of altered state of consciousness and dissociative experiences, and a decreased perception of cognitive control. Analyzing the psychophysiological correlates of dissociative states following deprivation, we observed the following results: the higher the prefrontal theta spectral content, the higher the depersonalization state and the lower the self-awareness; the higher the intensity of the dissociative experiences, the higher the synchronization increase in alpha, beta, and gamma bands; the higher the decrease of higher-order functions, the higher the synchronization in the aforementioned bands. Thus, acute sleep deprivation appears to fuel dissociative experiences by establishing a state of consciousness promoted by a higher large-scale synchronization at high frequencies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Novel method for reliably measuring spontaneous postsynaptic potentials/currents in whole-cell patch clamp recordings in the central nervous system</a></h4>

              
                In chemical synapses of the central nervous system (CNS) an information unit is transmitted via the presynaptic release of a neurotransmitter vesicle, a quantum, eliciting a postsynaptic membrane electric response of a certain amplitude, a quantal size. This key determinant of neural computation has not been reliably measured due to the nature of synaptic communication and technical limitations of electrophysiological recordings in the CNS. Measuring amplitudes of spontaneous postsynaptic currents (sPSCs) or potentials (sPSPs) at the cell soma potentially offers a technically straight forward way to estimate the quantal size as these miniature responses (minis) are ellicited by the spontaneous release of a single neurotransmitter vesicle. However, somatically recorded minis are massively attenuated and, for the most part, are indistinguishable from background noise fluctuations. For them to be accurately estimated, a revised method would have to isolate the noise component. As the first step in devising such a method, we developed and described a novel sPSP/sPSC detection algorithm as part of our quantal analysis software called 'minis'. We tested the performance of the algorithm in detecting real and simulated minis in rat cortical slice whole-cell recordings and compared it to other most commonly used similar detection algorithms in the field of the synaptic function research. This benchmarking analysis revealed superior detection performance by our algorithm. The release version of the algorithm also offers great flexibility as it can be controlled through graphical and programming interfaces making it suitable for the needs of most individual researchers studying the central synapse function.

                In-vivo electrophysiology requires direct access to brain tissue, necessitating the development and refinement of surgical procedures and techniques that promote the health and well-being of the animal subjects. Here, we report a series of findings noted on structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans in monkeys with MRI-compatible implants following small craniotomies that provide access for intracranial electrophysiology. We found distinct brain regions exhibiting hyperintensities in T2-weighted scans that were prominent underneath the sites at which craniotomies had been performed. We interpreted these hyperintensities as edema of the neural tissue and found that they were predominantly present following electric drilling, but not when manual, hand-operated drills were used. Further, the anomalies subsided within 2-3 weeks following surgery. Our report highlights the utility of MRI-compatible implants that promote clinical examination of the animal's brain, sometimes revealing findings that may go unnoticed when incompatible implants are used. We show replicable differences in outcome when using electric vs. mechanical devices, both ubiquitous in the field. If electric drills are used, our report cautions electrophysiological recordings from tissue directly underneath the craniotomy for the first 2-3 weeks following the procedure due to putative edema.

                Cognitive functional neuroimaging has been around for over 30 years and has shed light on the brain areas relevant for reading. However, new methodological developments enable mapping the interaction between functional imaging and the underlying white matter networks. In this study, we used such a novel method, called the disconnectome, to decode the reading circuitry in the brain. We used the resulting disconnection patterns to predict the typical lesion that would lead to reading deficits after brain damage. Our results suggest that white matter connections critical for reading include fronto-parietal U-shaped fibres and the vertical occipital fasciculus (VOF). The lesion most predictive of a reading deficit would impinge on the left inferior parietal and the three temporal and occipital gyri. This novel framework can systematically be applied to bridge the gap between the neuropathology of language and cognitive neuroscience.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Task feedback suggests a post-perceptual locus of serial dependence</a></h4>

              
                Decisions across a range of perceptual tasks are known to be biased toward stimuli and choices from the past. So-called serial dependence is thought to be an adaptive low-level mechanism that promotes perceptual stability across visual inputs. However, recent studies suggest post-perceptual mechanisms may instead contribute to serially-biased responses, calling into question the locus of serial dependence and the nature of integration of past and present sensory inputs. Here, we uncover decisional contributions to serial dependence that account for the majority, if not all of the bias. We measured serial dependence in a 3D motion extrapolation task where uncertainty in the sensory information varied from trial to trial. Furthermore, visual and auditory response feedback were provided to a subset of participants on every trial. We found that responses were significantly more biased toward the previously reported motion direction rather than the previously presented direction, with larger biases on trials with greater uncertainty in the sensory input. Critically, response feedback was associated with an abolishment of bias toward the previously presented direction, and a significant reduction of bias toward the previously reported direction. These results provide clear evidence for a post-perceptual locus of serial dependence and support the role of serial dependence as a behavioral strategy to overcome sensory uncertainty.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A passive computational marker for individual differences in non-reinforced learning</a></h4>

              
                Although research about preference formation and modification has classically focused on the role of external reinforcements, there is also increasing evidence for a key role of non-externally reinforced cognitive mechanisms such as attention and memory in preference modification. In a novel paradigm for behavioral change called the Cue-Approach training (CAT) task, preferences are modified via the mere association of images of stimuli with a neutral cue and a rapid motor response, without external reinforcements. The procedure's efficacy has been replicated across dozens of studies, and the net behavioral change was linked with increased activity in a frontal value-based decision-making brain region during the post-training probe choice phase. However, the cognitive mechanisms during the training phase itself have not been elucidated. Based on the structure of the task alongside recent findings of the involvement of striatal and supplementary motor regions during training, we hypothesized that a motor-related learning process could be a prospective candidate. To test this hypothesis, we developed a computational model of the motor response pattern during training in a large corpus of data collected from 864 participants across 29 different CAT experiments. Using Bayesian modeling of the meta-analysis data, we developed a computational marker for individualized learning in the training task, which was found to be associated with the preference modification effect in the subsequent probe task, both at the participant-level as well as in the more granular individual-item level. Following the conclusions of the meta-analysis, in two additional experiments (a pilot study and a larger preregistered replication study) we aimed to affect learning efficacy by manipulating the training procedure difficulty. As hypothesized and preregistered, training difficulty was captured by the new computational marker identified on the previously collected samples. Manipulation of the training difficulty also resulted in a differential preference modification effect, suggesting a causal relationship between the motor learning captured by the computational model and the post-training behavioral change effect. Our work highlights a novel non-reinforced preference modification pathway, suggesting that attention and motor learning are linked to preference formation, and provides a computational framework to identify individualized training markers which could predict future behavioral change effects.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Discovering dynamical models of human behavior</a></h4>

              
                Response time (RT) data collected from cognitive tasks are a cornerstone of psychology and neuroscience research, yet existing models of these data either make strong assumptions about the data generating process or are limited to modeling single trials. We introduce task-DyVA, a deep learning framework in which expressive dynamical systems are trained to reproduce sequences of RTs observed in data from individual human subjects. Models fitted to a large task-switching dataset captured subject-specific behavioral differences with high temporal precision, including task-switching costs. Through perturbation experiments and analyses of the models' latent dynamics, we find support for a rational account of switch costs in terms of a stability-flexibility tradeoff. Thus, our framework can be used to discover interpretable cognitive theories that explain how the brain dynamically gives rise to behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins uptake mediated by lipid raft ganglioside GM1 in human cerebrovascular cells</a></h4>

              
                SARS-CoV-2 and its spike protein (SP) interact with the endothelium but the roles of extracellular peptidase domain on angiotensin converting enzyme 2 receptors (ACE2) and ACE2 independent pathways (such as glycans) are not fully elucidated. In addition, for SARS-CoV-2 to enter the brain parenchyma from blood it has to cross several cell types, including the endothelium, pericytes and vascular smooth muscle. Since SARS-CoV-2 interacts with host cells via it SP at the entry point of it life cycle, we used fluorescently labelled SP (SP-555) (wild type and mutants) to model viral behaviour, in vitro, for these cell types (endothelial, pericytes and vascular smooth muscle) to explore pathways of viral entry into brain from blood. There was differential SP uptake by these cell types. The endothelial cells had the least uptake, which may limit SP uptake into brain from blood. Uptake was mediated by ACE2, but it was dependent on SP interaction with ganglioside GM1 in the lipid raft. Mutation sites, N501Yand E484K and D614G, as seen in variants of interest, were differentially taken up by these cell types. There was greater uptake but neutralization with anti-ACE2 and anti-GM1antibodies was less effective. Our data suggested that GM1/lipid raft is an important entry point of SARS-CoV-2 into these cells since inhibition of SP uptake with both anti-ACE2 and anti-GM1 together was similar to that with only anti-GM1, and both ACE2 and GM1 are within the lipid raft region of plasma membrane. Thus, GM1 is a potential SARS-CoV-2 and therapeutic target at the cerebrovasculature.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Long-distance axon growth ability of corticospinal neurons is lost in a segmentally-distinct manner.</a></h4>

              
                The neonatal central nervous system (CNS) in mammals is known to support greater regeneration than the adult CNS. Established models of neonatal CNS injuries cause significant disruption to the microenvironments needed for axon growth and guidance. This limits their ability to investigate long-distance axon growth ability. We established a novel microsurgical approach to transect developing corticospinal neuron (CSN) axons, without producing an overt spinal lesion and investigated long-distance growth ability of the developing corticospinal tract (CST) in neonatal mice. We identified, rather surprisingly, that this ability is not equivalently lost at distinct spinal levels. At postnatal day 4 (P4), while this ability is robustly maintained at thoracic T11, it is completely abolished at cervical C2. We further identify that thoraco-lumbar-projecting CSN lose growth ability at cervical C2 even while extending axons to thoraco-lumbar segments. Further, long-distance regrowth is possible even when CSN axons are displaced from their normal location in the dorsal funiculus to the dorsolateral funiculus, where only a minority of the CST normally traverses. The differential loss of long-distance growth at distinct spinal levels does not appear to be due to segmental differences in astrocytic or microglial activation. Our results suggest that the initial control over long-distance axon growth is differentially governed across the length of an axon by context-specific mechanisms.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Target-agnostic discovery of Rett Syndrome therapeutics by coupling computational network analysis and CRISPR-enabled in vivo disease modeling</a></h4>

              
                It is difficult to develop effective treatments for neurodevelopmental genetic disorders, such as Rett syndrome, which are caused by a single gene mutation but trigger changes in numerous other genes, and thereby also severely impair functions of organs beyond the central nervous system (CNS). This challenge is further complicated by the lack of sufficiently broad and biologically relevant drug screens, and the inherent complexity in identifying clinically relevant targets responsible for diverse phenotypes. Here, we combined human gene regulatory network-based computational drug prediction with in vivo screening in a population-level diversity, CRISPR-edited, Xenopus laevis tadpole model of Rett syndrome to carry out target-agnostic drug discovery, which rapidly led to the identification of the FDA-approved drug vorinostat as a potential repurposing candidate. Vorinostat broadly improved both CNS and non-CNS (e.g., gastrointestinal, respiratory, inflammatory) abnormalities in a pre-clinical mouse model of Rett syndrome. This is the first Rett syndrome treatment to demonstrate pre-clinical efficacy across multiple organ systems when dosed after the onset of symptoms, and network analysis revealed a putative therapeutic mechanism for its cross-organ normalizing effects based on its impact on acetylation metabolism and post-translational modifications of microtubules.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Unsupervised approach to decomposing neural tuning variability</a></h4>

              
                Neural representation is often described by the tuning curves of individual neurons with respect to certain stimulus variables. Despite this tradition, it has become increasingly clear that neural tuning can vary substantially in accordance with a collection of internal and external factors. A challenge we are facing is the lack of appropriate methods to accurately capture trial-to-trial tuning variability directly from the noisy neural responses. Here we introduce an unsupervised statistical approach, Poisson functional principal component analysis (PfPCA), which identifies different sources of systematic tuning fluctuations, moreover encompassing several current models (e.g.,multiplicative gain models) as special cases. Applying this method to neural data recorded from macaque primary visual cortex, a paradigmatic case for which the tuning curve approach has been scientific essential, we discovered a novel simple relationship governing the variability of orientation tuning, which unifies different types of gain changes proposed previously. By decomposing the neural tuning variability into interpretable components, our method enables discovery of new structure of the neural code, capturing the influence of the stimulus drive and internal states simultaneously.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The effect of type and context of sensorimotor information on corticospinal excitability</a></h4>

              
                During skilled hand-object interactions, the human sensorimotor system generates predictive motor commands based on visual information and sensorimotor memories established from previous experience. Here we investigated whether predictive force scaling could be adapted to context-dependent information that is not always explicitly available. We probed the effect of motor prediction mechanisms on corticospinal excitability (CSE) with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). In experiment 1, participants performed a continuous force tracking task by squeezing a manipulandum. We varied the type of visual information for predicting motor output by displaying either the actual target force curve participants had to match (sinusoidal curve condition) or the visual error between the required and exerted force (horizontal line condition). CSE was modulated by the rate of change of forces (speed) in both conditions. Force direction changes further modulated CSE but in the sinusoidal curve condition only. These findings indicate that the corticospinal output mainly reflects the ongoing motor command, but can also be modulated by less explicit contextual information. In experiment 2, we tested whether participants could accurately predict the required force scaling in a standard random weight object lifting task, which also included series of small weight increments. Results showed that participants were unable to generate accurate force predictions by extrapolating weight from the implicit series, which failed to modulate CSE, unsurprisingly. Altogether, these findings suggest that corticospinal output is modulated based on context-dependent information when mediated by explicit visual cues, but not when sensorimotor cues are presented in an implicit manner.

                The neural substrates for processing classical rewards such as food or drugs of abuse are well-understood. In contrast, the mechanisms by which organisms perceive social contact as rewarding and subsequently modify their interactions are unclear. Here we tracked the gradual emergence of a repetitive and highly-stereotyped parental behavior and show that trial-by-trial performance correlates with the history of midbrain dopamine (DA) neuron activity. We used a novel behavior paradigm to manipulate the subject's expectation of imminent pup contact and show that DA signals conform to reward prediction error, a fundamental component of reinforcement learning (RL). Finally, closed-loop optogenetic inactivation of DA neurons at the onset of pup contact dramatically slowed emergence of parental care. We conclude that this prosocial behavior is shaped by an RL mechanism in which social contact itself is the primary reward.

                Locomotion engages widely distributed networks of neurons. However, the spatial architecture and temporal dynamics of the networks that underpin walking, a fundamental mode of locomotion, have not been described at brain-wide scale in any animal. We use volumetric two-photon imaging to map neural activity associated with walking across the entire brain of Drosophila. We define spatially clustered neural signals selectively associated with changes in either forward or angular velocity, revealing distinct topographic maps in diverse brain regions involved in navigation, memory, sensory processing, and motor control. We discover temporal trajectories of neural activity that sweep across these maps as behavior is performed, representing the sequential engagement of clusters with different behavioral selectivity. These motor maps suggest a dynamical systems framework for constructing walking maneuvers reminiscent of models of forelimb reaching in primates and set a foundation for understanding how local circuits interact within large-scale networks.

	<p>Although allophonic speech processing has been hypothesized to be a contributing factor in developmental dyslexia, experimental evidence is limited and inconsistent. The current study compared the categorization of native similar sounding vowels of typically developing (TD) children and children at familial risk (FR) of dyslexia. EEG response was collected in a non-attentive passive oddball paradigm from 35 TD and 35 FR Dutch 20-month-old infants who were matched on vocabulary. The children were presented with two nonwords &amp;amp;ldquo;giep&amp;amp;rdquo; [&amp;amp;#611;ip] and &amp;amp;ldquo;gip&amp;amp;rdquo; [&amp;amp;#611;Ip] that contrasted solely with respect to the vowel. In the multiple-speaker condition, both nonwords were produced by twelve different speakers while in the single-speaker condition, single tokens of each word were used as stimuli. For both conditions and for both groups, infant positive mismatch response (p-MMR) was elicited, and the p-MMR amplitude was comparable between the two groups, although the FR children had a later p-MMR peak than the TD children in the multiple-speaker condition. These findings indicate that FR children are able to categorize speech sounds, but that they may do so in a more effortful way than TDs.</p>

	<p>The self is one of the most important concepts in psychology, which is of great significance for human survival and development. As an important self-related stimulus, the subject&amp;amp;rsquo;s own name (SON) shows great advantages in cognitive and social processing and is widely used as an oddball stimulus in previous studies. However, it remained unknown whether the multiple repetition of stimulus would have similar influence on the neural response to SON and the other names under equal probability. In this study, adopting EEG and an equal&amp;amp;ndash;probability paradigm, we first detected the SON-related ERP components which could differentiate SON from other names, and then investigated how these components are influenced by repeated exposure of the stimulus. Our results showed that SON evoked an earlier SON-related negativity (SRN) at the fronto-central region and a late positive potential (LPP) at the centro-parietal region. More intriguingly, the earlier SRN demonstrated reduction after multiple repetitions, whereas LPP did not exhibit significant changes. In conclusion, these findings revealed that multiple repetitions of the stimulus might influence the various temporal stages in SON-related processing and highlighted the robustness of the late stage in this processing.</p>

	<p>The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of metacognitive training (MCT) on improving the neurocognitive function of Chinese patients with schizophrenia. One hundred inpatients with schizophrenia were selected by regional group randomization and divided into the control (treated as usual, TAU) group (n = 50) and the TAU + MCT group (n = 50). In this study, a 10-module MCT was used and the intervention process lasted 30 days. Cognitive function was assessed blindly using the Repeatable Battery of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) scale at baseline, 24 h post-treatment, and 12 weeks&amp;amp;rsquo; post-treatment. The differences between the total RBANS score and baseline (pre-test) for the post-test and 12-week-follow-up tests were used as the primary outcome, and the difference between the RBANS dimension scores and baseline (pre-test) were used as a secondary outcome in this study. The completion rate at follow-up was high in the TAU + MCT group (94%). Intention-to-treat analysis and per-protocol analysis showed a significant increase in total neurocognitive function scores and three-dimensional scores (delayed memory, visual breadth, and attention) in the TAU + MCT group immediately after the intervention and at the 12-week follow-up compared with baseline. This study provides support for the efficacy of 10 module MCT concerning neurocognition.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A deep learning classification task for accurate brain navigation during functional ultrasound imaging</a></h4>

              
                Functional ultrasound imaging is a breakthrough technology for imaging brain activity at high spatiotemporal resolution. As it monitors hemodynamic activity, the resulting images are a non-standard representation of local anatomy. This leads to difficulties when determining the exact anatomical location of the recorded image, which is necessary for correctly interpreting the data. Here we propose a convolutional neural network-based framework for accurately navigating the brain during functional ultrasound imaging solely based on vascular landmarks. Our approach uses an image classification task to identify a suitable set of reference positions, from which the anatomical position of an image can be inferred with a precision of 102 {+/-} 98 m. Further analysis revealed that the predictions are driven by deep brain areas. The robustness of our approach was validated using an ischemic stroke model. It confirms that functional ultrasound imaging information is sufficient for positioning even when local blood flow is disrupted, as observed in many brain pathologies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Structural connectivity gradient associated with a dichotomy reveals the topographic organization of the macaque insular cortex</a></h4>

              
                Histology studies revealed that the macaque insular cortex was characterized by the gradual organizations containing agranular, dysgranular and granular insula. However, no consensus has been reached on the elaborate subdivisions of macaque insula. Until now, no neuroimaging study to our knowledge combining connectivity-based gradients and parcellation has been performed to investigate the topographic organization of the macaque insular cortex. In this study, we used high-resolution ex vivo diffusion-weighted imaging data to explore the macaque insular cortexs global gradient organization and subdivisions. We found a rostrocaudal organization of the dominant gradient in the macaque insula using a diffusion map embedding. Meanwhile, extracting the 25% top and bottom components from the dominant and second gradient, which explained variance over 60% in total within ten gradients, the connectivity-based parcellation method was performed to subdivide each component into two subregions confirmed by the cross-validation analysis. Furthermore, permutations tests identified that two subregions from each component showed significant differences between their connectivity fingerprints. Finally, we found that the dominant and second gradients were significantly correlated with the T1w/T2w and cortical thickness maps in the macaque insula. Taken together, the global gradients combining the subdivisions examined the topographic organization of the macaque insular cortex based on the structural connectivity, which may contribute to a better understanding of the intricate insular cortex anatomy.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Shared and distinct brain regions targeted for immediate early gene expression by ketamine and psilocybin</a></h4>

              
                Background: Psilocybin is a psychedelic with therapeutic potential. While there is growing evidence that psilocybin exerts its beneficial effects through enhancing neural plasticity, the exact brain regions involved are not completely understood. Determining the impact of psilocybin on plasticity-related gene expression throughout the brain can broaden our understanding of the neural circuits involved in psychedelic-evoked neural plasticity. Methods: Whole-brain serial two-photon microscopy and light sheet microscopy were employed to map the expression of the immediate early gene, c-Fos, in male and female mice. The drug-induced c-Fos expression following psilocybin administration was compared to that of subanesthetic ketamine and saline control. To gain insights into the contributions of receptors and cell types, the c-Fos expression maps were related to brain-wide in situ hybridization data. Results: Psilocybin and ketamine produced acutely comparable elevations in c-Fos expression in numerous brain regions, including anterior cingulate cortex, locus coeruleus, primary visual cortex, central and basolateral amygdala, and claustrum. Select regions exhibited drug-preferential differences, such as dorsal raphe, lateral habenula, and insular cortex for psilocybin and retrosplenial cortex for ketamine. Correlation of psilocybin's effects with gene expression highlighted potential roles of 5-HT2A and GluN2B subunit of NMDA receptors. Conclusions: The systematic mapping approach produced an unbiased list of brain regions impacted by psilocybin and ketamine. The data are a valuable resource that highlights previously underappreciated regions for future investigations. By identifying regions with similar and disparate effects, the results provide insights into how psilocybin and ketamine may produce their rapid-acting and long-lasting therapeutic effects.
