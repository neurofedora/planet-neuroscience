                Background: This paper focuses on advances in crowd control study with an emphasis on high-density crowds, particularly Hajj crowds. Video analysis and visual surveillance have been of increasing importance in order to enhance the safety and security of pilgrimages in Makkah, Saudi Arabia. Hajj is considered to be a particularly distinctive event, with hundreds of thousands of people gathering in a small space, which does not allow a precise analysis of video footage using advanced video and computer vision algorithms. This research proposes an algorithm based on a Convolutional Neural Networks model specifically for Hajj applications. Additionally, the work introduces a system for counting and then estimating the crowd density. Methods: The model adopts an architecture which detects each person in the crowd, spots head location with a bounding box and does the counting in our own novel dataset (HAJJ-Crowd). Results: Our algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art method, and attains a remarkable Mean Absolute Error result of 200 (average of 82.0 improvement) and Mean Square Error of 240 (average of 135.54 improvement). Conclusions: In our new HAJJ-Crowd dataset for evaluation and testing, we have a density map and prediction results of some standard methods.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Data-driven modeling predicts gene regulatory network dynamics during the differentiation of multipotential hematopoietic progenitors</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Joanna E. Handzlik, Manu</p>

Cellular differentiation during hematopoiesis is guided by gene regulatory networks (GRNs) comprising transcription factors (TFs) and the effectors of cytokine signaling. Based largely on analyses conducted at steady state, these GRNs are thought to be organized as a hierarchy of bistable switches, with antagonism between Gata1 and PU.1 driving red- and white-blood cell differentiation. Here, we utilize transient gene expression patterns to infer the genetic architecture—the type and strength of regulatory interconnections—and dynamics of a twelve-gene GRN including key TFs and cytokine receptors. We trained gene circuits, dynamical models that learn genetic architecture, on high temporal-resolution gene-expression data from the differentiation of an inducible cell line into erythrocytes and neutrophils. The model is able to predict the consequences of gene knockout, knockdown, and overexpression experiments and the inferred interconnections are largely consistent with prior empirical evidence. The inferred genetic architecture is densely interconnected rather than hierarchical, featuring extensive cross-antagonism between genes from alternative lineages and positive feedback from cytokine receptors. The analysis of the dynamics of gene regulation in the model reveals that PU.1 is one of the last genes to be upregulated in neutrophil conditions and that the upregulation of PU.1 and other neutrophil genes is driven by Cebpa and Gfi1 instead. This model inference is confirmed in an independent single-cell RNA-Seq dataset from mouse bone marrow in which Cebpa and Gfi1 expression precedes the neutrophil-specific upregulation of PU.1 during differentiation. These results demonstrate that full PU.1 upregulation during neutrophil development involves regulatory influences extrinsic to the Gata1-PU.1 bistable switch. Furthermore, although there is extensive cross-antagonism between erythroid and neutrophil genes, it does not have a hierarchical structure. More generally, we show that the combination of high-resolution time series data and data-driven dynamical modeling can uncover the dynamics and causality of developmental events that might otherwise be obscured.

                <p>by Xiangyu Kuang, Guoye Guan, Ming-Kin Wong, Lu-Yan Chan, Zhongying Zhao, Chao Tang, Lei Zhang</p>

Morphogenesis is a precise and robust dynamic process during metazoan embryogenesis, consisting of both cell proliferation and cell migration. Despite the fact that much is known about specific regulations at molecular level, how cell proliferation and migration together drive the morphogenesis at cellular and organismic levels is not well understood. Using <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> as the model animal, we present a phase field model to compute early embryonic morphogenesis within a confined eggshell. With physical information about cell division obtained from three-dimensional time-lapse cellular imaging experiments, the model can precisely reproduce the early morphogenesis process as seen <i>in vivo</i>, including time evolution of location and morphology of each cell. Furthermore, the model can be used to reveal key cell-cell attractions critical to the development of <i>C</i>. <i>elegans</i> embryo. Our work demonstrates how genetic programming and physical forces collaborate to drive morphogenesis and provides a predictive model to decipher the underlying mechanism.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A Bayesian approach to modeling phytoplankton population dynamics from size distribution time series</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jann Paul Mattern, Kristof Glauninger, Gregory L. Britten, John R. Casey, Sangwon Hyun, Zhen Wu, E. Virginia Armbrust, Zaid Harchaoui, François Ribalet</p>

The rates of cell growth, division, and carbon loss of microbial populations are key parameters for understanding how organisms interact with their environment and how they contribute to the carbon cycle. However, the invasive nature of current analytical methods has hindered efforts to reliably quantify these parameters. In recent years, size-structured matrix population models (MPMs) have gained popularity for estimating division rates of microbial populations by mechanistically describing changes in microbial cell size distributions over time. Motivated by the mechanistic structure of these models, we employ a Bayesian approach to extend size-structured MPMs to capture additional biological processes describing the dynamics of a marine phytoplankton population over the day-night cycle. Our Bayesian framework is able to take prior scientific knowledge into account and generate biologically interpretable results. Using data from an exponentially growing laboratory culture of the cyanobacterium <i>Prochlorococcus</i>, we isolate respiratory and exudative carbon losses as critical parameters for the modeling of their population dynamics. The results suggest that this modeling framework can provide deeper insights into microbial population dynamics provided by size distribution time-series data.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Identification of periodic attractors in Boolean networks using a priori information</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Ulrike Münzner, Tomoya Mori, Marcus Krantz, Edda Klipp, Tatsuya Akutsu</p>

Boolean networks (BNs) have been developed to describe various biological processes, which requires analysis of attractors, the long-term stable states. While many methods have been proposed to detection and enumeration of attractors, there are no methods which have been demonstrated to be theoretically better than the naive method and be practically used for large biological BNs. Here, we present a novel method to calculate attractors based on <i>a priori</i> information, which works much and verifiably faster than the naive method. We apply the method to two BNs which differ in size, modeling formalism, and biological scope. Despite these differences, the method presented here provides a powerful tool for the analysis of both networks. First, our analysis of a BN studying the effect of the microenvironment during angiogenesis shows that the previously defined microenvironments inducing the specialized phalanx behavior in endothelial cells (ECs) additionally induce stalk behavior. We obtain this result from an extended network version which was previously not analyzed. Second, we were able to heuristically detect attractors in a cell cycle control network formalized as a bipartite Boolean model (bBM) with 3158 nodes. These attractors are directly interpretable in terms of genotype-to-phenotype relationships, allowing network validation equivalent to an <i>in silico</i> mutagenesis screen. Our approach contributes to the development of scalable analysis methods required for whole-cell modeling efforts.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Cardiac forces regulate zebrafish heart valve delamination by modulating Nfat signaling</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Renee Wei-Yan Chow, Hajime Fukui, Wei Xuan Chan, Kok Soon Justin Tan, Stéphane Roth, Anne-Laure Duchemin, Nadia Messaddeq, Hiroyuki Nakajima, Fei Liu, Nathalie Faggianelli-Conrozier, Andrey S. Klymchenko, Yap Choon Hwai, Naoki Mochizuki, Julien Vermot</p>

In the clinic, most cases of congenital heart valve defects are thought to arise through errors that occur after the endothelial–mesenchymal transition (EndoMT) stage of valve development. Although mechanical forces caused by heartbeat are essential modulators of cardiovascular development, their role in these later developmental events is poorly understood. To address this question, we used the zebrafish superior atrioventricular valve (AV) as a model. We found that cellularized cushions of the superior atrioventricular canal (AVC) morph into valve leaflets via mesenchymal–endothelial transition (MEndoT) and tissue sheet delamination. Defects in delamination result in thickened, hyperplastic valves, and reduced heart function. Mechanical, chemical, and genetic perturbation of cardiac forces showed that mechanical stimuli are important regulators of valve delamination. Mechanistically, we show that forces modulate Nfatc activity to control delamination. Together, our results establish the cellular and molecular signature of cardiac valve delamination in vivo and demonstrate the continuous regulatory role of mechanical forces and blood flow during valve formation.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The effect of corporate social responsibility on Malaysian financial institutions' dividend payout [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The corporate social responsibility (CSR) disclosure was made mandatory in Malaysia in 2007 with the introduction of the CSR Framework by Bursa Malaysia. Since then, the practice of CSR disclosure is growing, as Malaysia joins global efforts towards sustainable development. Despite increased research on CSR; limited studies are assessing the relationship of specific dimensions – environmental, community, workplace and marketplace, towards dividend payout, which is crucial to investment and corporate financial decision making.    Method: The study involved 32 Malaysian public listed finance companies as of 2017. It deployed data from annual reports and databases. Additionally, the study used content analysis to measure the CSR disclosure score, and dividend payout was calculated from the database.     Results: There was a significant correlation between community and workplace dimensions with dividend payout. Despite the absence of significant results, the regression analysis showed a positive relationship between community and workplace dimensions with dividend payout. Besides, there was an inverse relationship between the environmental and marketplace dimension with dividend payout. The results indicated that active involvement in the community dimension resulted from an immediate positive impact towards brand equity, attracting current and new customers, and therefore improving the earning levels and dividend payout. Additionally, greater participation in the workplace dimension solidifies employees' engagement and motivation, improves the productivity level, which can be translated into enhanced earning levels and dividend payout. Meanwhile, participation in environmental and marketplace dimensions requires a longer period to yield an impact, higher development expenditure, and involve sensitive information that might benefit competitors. Hence, companies tend to utilise internal funding instead of redistributing the wealth through dividend payout.        Conclusion: The study contributes to the literature of CSR by explaining the relationship of specific dimensions of environmental, community, workplace, and marketplace towards dividend payout using the evidence from the emerging economy.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Inflammatory laboratory findings associated with severe illness among hospitalized individuals with COVID-19 in Medan, Indonesia: a cross-sectional study [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) remains a global health problem. COVID-19 patients with severe pneumonia have a higher risk for critical illness, mostly complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome. The inflammatory response is critical, and the cytokine storm increases the severity of COVID-19. Many factors could be associated with a cytokine storm but they are incompletely understood. This study presents characteristics of COVID-19 patients and explore the clinical and inflammatory parameters of severe and critically ill COVID-19 patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). Method: This cross-sectional study was conducted in all severe COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU. Peripheral blood was taken for laboratory examination within 24 hours of admission. Haematologic parameters, serum electrolyte, renal function, liver function, pancreas enzyme, D-dimer, inflammatory cytokines interferon (IFN)-gamma, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), and C-reactive protein (CRP) were assessed in this study. Comparative analyses were done between sex, existing comorbidities, body mass index (BMI), and COVID-19 vaccination status. Results: A total of 80 subjects were included in the study. The most frequent comorbidities found among the subjects were obesity (36.35%) and diabetes (22.5%). Only 13.75% of subjects were vaccinated. Laboratory results indicated leucocytosis and neutrophilia, with a neutrophil-lymphocyte-ratio (NLR) of 7. The mean inflammatory findings (IL-6, IL-10, TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, MCP-1), D-dimer, CRP, and lipase increased. Lipase levels were higher in men (p = 0.003) and in comorbidity groups. No significant differences were found among different BMI groups. Lipase, IL-6, and MCP-1 levels were significantly higher (p=0.019, <0.0001, and 0.03, respectively) in the non-vaccinated group. Conclusions: Most patients with severe COVID-19 have comorbidities and increased inflammatory markers.

                Background: Nanoparticles are globally synthesized for their antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, wound healing, catalytic, magnetic, optical, and electronic properties that have put them at the forefront of a wide variety of studies. Among them, zinc oxide (ZnO) has received much consideration due to its technological and medicinal applications. In this study, we report on the synthesis process of ZnO nanoparticles using Athrixia phylicoides DC natural extract as a reducing agent.   Methods: Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was used to identify the compounds responsible for the synthesis of ZnO nanoparticles. Structural, morphological and optical properties of the synthesized nanoparticles have been characterized through X-ray diffraction (XRD), Ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS).   Results: LC-MS results showed that different flavonoids and polyphenols, as well as Coumarin, an aromatic compound, reacted with the precursor to form ZnO nanoparticles. XRD and UV-Vis analysis confirmed the synthesis of ZnO nanoparticles, with a spherical shape showed in SEM images. The quasi-spherical ZnO crystals had an average crystallite size of 24 nm. EDS and FTIR analysis confirmed that the powders were pure with no other phase or impurity.   Conclusions: This study successfully demonstrated that the natural plant extract of A. phylicoides DC. can be used in the bio-reduction of zinc nitrate hexahydrate to prepare pure ZnO nanoparticles, thus, extending the use of this plant to an industrial level.

                Background: Phlebotomy is a medical procedure that is performed frequently in the blood collection activities of medical institutions. The procedure involves close interaction with different types of patients—some of whom are cooperative and others, who, for many reasons, are not (for example, patients who have a fear of needles). Blood extraction is an essential skill in several medical specialties, such as in laboratory sciences. Lesson planning in phlebotomy education is mainly focused on procedural skills, and very little attention is given towards teaching communication skills despite the close patient interaction in phlebotomy. In this paper, I propose a lesson plan for teaching communication skills to medical laboratory sciences and nursing students based on Gagne’s instructional design. Methods: The training session included two main parts: training session using Gange’s instructional design and at the end of the session, the participants were surveyed for the effectiveness of the training session. Results: 17 participants were included in the study. Overall, the majority of the participants were highly satisfied with the effectiveness of the training session in teaching communication skills with all seven survey questions receiving a mean score of 4.58 on a Likert scale of 1-5. Conclusion: We demonstrated the effectiveness of Gange’s instructional beyond theoretical lesson planning to teach communication skills through role-play in phlebotomy education.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Immunoreactivity for calcium-/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) in the primate dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) has been attributed to geniculocortical relay neurons and has also been suggested to arise from terminals of retinal ganglion cells. Here, we combined immunostaining with single-cell injections to investigate the expression of CaMKII in retinal ganglion cells of three primate species: macaque (<i>Macaca fascicularis</i>, <i>M. nemestrina</i>), human, and marmoset (<i>Callithrix jacchus</i>). We found that in all species, about 2%–10% of the total ganglion cell population expressed CaMKII. In all species, CaMKII was expressed by multiple types of wide-field ganglion cell including large sparse, giant sparse (melanopsin-expressing), broad thorny, and narrow thorny cells. Three other ganglion cells types, namely, inner and outer stratifying maze cells in macaque and tufted cells in marmoset were also found. Double labeling experiments showed that CaMKII-expressing cells included inner and outer stratifying melanopsin cells. Nearly all CaMKII-expressing ganglion cell types identified here are known to project to the koniocellular layers of the dLGN as well as to the superior colliculus. The best characterized koniocellular projecting cell type—the small bistratified (blue ON/yellow OFF) cell—was, however, not CaMKII-positive in any species. Our results indicate that the pattern of CaMKII expression in retinal ganglion cells is largely conserved across different species of primate suggesting a common functional role. But the results also show that CaMKII is not a marker for all koniocellular projecting retinal ganglion cells.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Regeneration of the larval sea star nervous system by wounding induced respecification to the sox2 lineage</a></h4>

              
                The ability to restore lost body parts following traumatic injury is a fascinating area of biology that challenges current understanding of the ontogeny of differentiation. The origin of new cells needed to regenerate lost tissue, and whether they are pluripotent stem cells, tissue-specific stem cells or have de- or trans- differentiated, remains one of the most important open questions in regeneration. Additionally, it is not clearly known whether developmental gene regulatory networks (GRNs) are reused to direct specification in these cells or whether regeneration specific networks are deployed. Echinoderms, including sea stars, have extensive ability for regeneration and have therefore been the subject of many thorough studies on the ultrastructural and molecular properties of cells needed for regeneration. However, the technologies for obtaining transgenic echinoderms are limited and tracking cells involved in regeneration, and thus identifying the cellular sources and potencies has proven challenging. In this study we develop new transgenic tools to follow the fate of populations of cells in the regenerating bipinnaria larva of the sea star <i>Patira minaita</i>. We show that the larval serotonergic nervous system can regenerate following decapitation. Using a BAC-transgenesis approach with photoconvertible fluorescent proteins, we show that expression of the pan ectodermal marker, <i>sox2</i>, is induced in previously <i>sox2</i> minus cells at the wound site, even when cell division is inhibited. <i>sox2</i>+ cells give rise to new <i>sox4</i>+ neural precursors that then proceed along an embryonic neurogenesis pathway to reform the anterior nervous systems. sox2+ cells contribute to only neural and ectoderm lineages, indicating that these progenitors maintain their normal, embryonic lineage restriction. This indicates that sea star larval regeneration uses a combination of existing lineage restricted stem cells, as well as respecification of cells into neural lineages, and at least partial reuse of developmental GRNs to regenerate their nervous system.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">CASP microdomain formation requires cross cell wall stabilization of domains and non-cell autonomous action of LOTR1</a></h4>

              
                Efficient uptake of nutrients in both animal and plant cells requires tissue-spanning diffusion barriers separating inner tissues from the outer lumen/soil. However, we poorly understand how such contiguous three-dimensional superstructures are formed in plants. Here, we show that correct establishment of the plant Casparian Strip (CS) network relies on local neighbor communication. We show that positioning of Casparian Strip membrane domains (CSDs) is tightly coordinated between neighbors in wild-type and that restriction of domain formation involves the putative extracellular protease LOTR1. Impaired domain restriction in <i>lotr1</i> leads to fully functional CSDs at ectopic positions, forming 'half strips'. LOTR1 action in the endodermis requires its expression in the stele. LOTR1 endodermal expression cannot complement, while cortex expression causes a dominant-negative phenotype. Our findings establish <i>LOTR1</i> as a crucial player in CSD positioning acting in a directional, non-cell-autonomous manner to restrict and coordinate CS positioning.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The mitotic spindle protein CKAP2 potently increases formation and stability of microtubules</a></h4>

              
                Cells increase microtubule dynamics to make large rearrangements to their microtubule cytoskeleton during cell division. Changes in microtubule dynamics are essential for the formation and function of the mitotic spindle, and misregulation can lead to aneuploidy and cancer. Using <i>in vitro</i> reconstitution assays we show that the mitotic spindle protein Cytoskeleton-Associated Protein 2 (CKAP2) has a strong effect on nucleation of microtubules by lowering the critical tubulin concentration 100-fold. CKAP2 increases the apparent rate constant <i>k<sub>a</sub></i> of microtubule growth by 50-fold and increases microtubule growth rates. In addition, CKAP2 strongly suppresses catastrophes. Our results identify CKAP2 as the most potent microtubule growth factor to date. These finding help explain CKAP2's role as an important spindle protein, proliferation marker, and oncogene.

                The Puerto Rican coquí frog <i>Eleutherodactylus coqui</i> (<i>E. coqui</i>) is both a cultural icon and a species with an unusual natural history that has attracted attention from researchers in a number of different fields within biology. Unlike most frogs, the coquí frog skips the tadpole stage, which makes it of interest to developmental biologists. The frog is best known in Puerto Rico for its notoriously loud mating call, which has allowed researchers to study aspects of social behavior such as vocal communication and courtship, while the ability of coquí to colonize new habitats has been used to explore the biology of invasive species. This article reviews research on the natural history of <i>E. coqui</i> and opportunities for future research.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Lateral connections in the primary visual cortex (V1) have long been hypothesized to be responsible for several visual processing mechanisms such as brightness induction, chromatic induction, visual discomfort, and bottom-up visual attention (also named saliency). Many computational models have been developed to independently predict these and other visual processes, but no computational model has been able to reproduce all of them simultaneously. In this work, we show that a biologically plausible computational model of lateral interactions of V1 is able to simultaneously predict saliency and all the aforementioned visual processes. Our model's architecture (NSWAM) is based on Penacchio's neurodynamic model of lateral connections of V1. It is defined as a network of firing rate neurons, sensitive to visual features such as brightness, color, orientation, and scale. We tested NSWAM saliency predictions using images from several eye tracking data sets. We show that the accuracy of predictions obtained by our architecture, using shuffled metrics, is similar to other state-of-the-art computational methods, particularly with synthetic images (CAT2000-Pattern and SID4VAM) that mainly contain low-level features. Moreover, we outperform other biologically inspired saliency models that are specifically designed to exclusively reproduce saliency. We show that our biologically plausible model of lateral connections can simultaneously explain different visual processes present in V1 (without applying any type of training or optimization and keeping the same parameterization for all the visual processes). This can be useful for the definition of a unified architecture of the primary visual cortex.</span>

Nevertheless, dealing with physical contacts and generating accurate motions are inevitable for practical robot control tasks, such as precise manipulation. For a real-time, model-based approach, the difficulty of contact-rich tasks that requires precise movement lies in the fact that a model needs to accurately predict forthcoming contact events within a limited length of time rather than detect them afterward with sensors. Therefore, in this study, we investigate whether and how neural network models can learn a task-related model useful enough for model-based control, that is, a model predicting future states, including contact events. To this end, we propose a structured neural network model predictive control (SNN-MPC) method, whose neural network architecture is designed with explicit inertia matrix representation. To train the proposed network, we develop a two-stage modeling procedure for contact-rich dynamics from a limited number of samples. As a contact-rich task, we take up a trackball manipulation task using a physical 3-DoF finger robot. The results showed that the SNN-MPC outperformed MPC with a conventional fully connected network model on the manipulation task.</span>

We show here that in a randomly connected network of simulated spiking neurons, periodic stimulation of neurons with distributed phase offsets, along with standard spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), efficiently creates distributed attractors. These attractors may have a consistent ordered firing pattern or become irregular, depending on the conditions. We also show that when two such attractors are stimulated in sequence, the same STDP mechanism can create a directed association between them, forming the basis of an associative network. We find that for an STDP time constant of 20 ms, the dependence of the efficiency of attractor creation on the driving frequency has a broad peak centered around 8 Hz. Upon restimulation, the attractors self-oscillate, but with an oscillation frequency that is higher than the driving frequency, ranging from 10 to 100 Hz.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The quantification of human perception through the study of psychometric functions Ψ is one of the pillars of experimental psychophysics. In particular, the evaluation of the threshold is at the heart of many neuroscience and cognitive psychology studies, and a wide range of adaptive procedures has been developed to improve its estimation. However, these procedures are often implicitly based on different mathematical assumptions on the psychometric function, and unfortunately, these assumptions cannot always be validated prior to data collection. This raises questions about the accuracy of the estimator produced using the different procedures. In the study we examine in this letter, we compare five adaptive procedures commonly used in psychophysics to estimate the threshold: Dichotomous Optimistic Search (DOS), Staircase, PsiMethod, Gaussian Processes, and QuestPlus. These procedures range from model-based methods, such as the PsiMethod, which relies on strong assumptions regarding the shape of Ψ, to model-free methods, such as DOS, for which assumptions are minimal. The comparisons are performed using simulations of multiple experiments, with psychometric functions of various complexity. The results show that while model-based methods perform well when Ψ is an ideal psychometric function, model-free methods rapidly outshine them when Ψ deviates from this model, as, for instance, when Ψ is a beta cumulative distribution function. Our results highlight the importance of carefully choosing the most appropriate method depending on the context.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Classification is one of the major tasks that deep learning is successfully tackling. Categorization is also a fundamental cognitive ability. A well-known perceptual consequence of categorization in humans and other animals, categorical perception, is notably characterized by a within-category compression and a between-category separation: two items, close in input space, are perceived closer if they belong to the same category than if they belong to different categories. Elaborating on experimental and theoretical results in cognitive science, here we study categorical effects in artificial neural networks. We combine a theoretical analysis that makes use of mutual and Fisher information quantities and a series of numerical simulations on networks of increasing complexity. These formal and numerical analyses provide insights into the geometry of the neural representation in deep layers, with expansion of space near category boundaries and contraction far from category boundaries. We investigate categorical representation by using two complementary approaches: one mimics experiments in psychophysics and cognitive neuroscience by means of morphed continua between stimuli of different categories, while the other introduces a categoricality index that, for each layer in the network, quantifies the separability of the categories at the neural population level. We show on both shallow and deep neural networks that category learning automatically induces categorical perception. We further show that the deeper a layer, the stronger the categorical effects. As an outcome of our study, we propose a coherent view of the efficacy of different heuristic practices of the dropout regularization technique. More generally, our view, which finds echoes in the neuroscience literature, insists on the differential impact of noise in any given layer depending on the geometry of the neural representation that is being learned, that is, on how this geometry reflects the structure of the categories.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Reinforcement learning involves updating estimates of the value of states and actions on the basis of experience. Previous work has shown that in humans, reinforcement learning exhibits a confirmatory bias: when the value of a chosen option is being updated, estimates are revised more radically following positive than negative reward prediction errors, but the converse is observed when updating the unchosen option value estimate. Here, we simulate performance on a multi-arm bandit task to examine the consequences of a confirmatory bias for reward harvesting. We report a paradoxical finding: that confirmatory biases allow the agent to maximize reward relative to an unbiased updating rule. This principle holds over a wide range of experimental settings and is most influential when decisions are corrupted by noise. We show that this occurs because on average, confirmatory biases lead to overestimating the value of more valuable bandits and underestimating the value of less valuable bandits, rendering decisions overall more robust in the face of noise. Our results show how apparently suboptimal learning rules can in fact be reward maximizing if decisions are made with finite computational precision.</span>

However, the sparsity constraint requires knowing certain properties of the true model, which are not available in practice. Moreover, computation is difficult due to the discrete nature of the sparsity constraint. In this letter, we propose a novel penalized estimation method for sparse DNNs that resolves the problems existing in the sparsity constraint. We establish an oracle inequality for the excess risk of the proposed sparse-penalized DNN estimator and derive convergence rates for several learning tasks. In particular, we prove that the sparse-penalized estimator can adaptively attain minimax convergence rates for various nonparametric regression problems. For computation, we develop an efficient gradient-based optimization algorithm that guarantees the monotonic reduction of the objective function.</span>

                We tested whether joint spectrotemporal sensitivity follows from spectrotemporal separability for normal-hearing conditions and for impaired-hearing simulations. In a manual reaction-time task, normal-hearing listeners had to detect the onset of a ripple (with density between 0-8 cycles/octave and a fixed modulation depth of 50%), that moved up or down the log-frequency axis at constant velocity (between 0-64 Hz), in an otherwise-unmodulated broadband white-noise. Spectral and temporal modulations elicited band-pass filtered sensitivity characteristics, with fastest detection rates around 1 cycle/oct and 32 Hz for normal-hearing conditions. These results closely resemble data from other studies that typically used the modulation-depth threshold as a sensitivity measure for spectral-temporal modulations. To simulate hearing-impairment, stimuli were processed with a 6-channel cochlear-implant vocoder, and a hearing-aid simulation that introduced spectral smearing and low-pass filtering. Reaction times were always much slower compared to normal hearing, especially for the highest spectral densities. Binaural performance was predicted well by the benchmark race model of statistical facilitation of independent monaural channels. For the impaired-hearing simulations this implied a "best-of-both-worlds" principle in which the listeners relied on the hearing-aid ear to detect spectral modulations, and on the cochlear-implant ear for temporal-modulation detection. Although singular-value decomposition indicated that the joint spectrotemporal sensitivity matrix could be largely reconstructed from independent temporal and spectral sensitivity functions, in line with time-spectrum separability, a significant inseparable spectral-temporal interaction was present in all hearing conditions. These results imply that the reaction-time task yields a solid and effective objective measure of acoustic spectrotemporal modulation sensitivity, which may also be applicable to hearing-impaired individuals.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Increased insula activity precedes the formation of subjective Gestalt</a></h4>

              
                The constructive nature of human perception sometimes leads us to perceiving rather complex impressions from simple sensory input. Bistable stimuli give us a rare opportunity to study the neural mechanisms behind this process. Such stimuli can be visually interpreted as simple or as more complex on the basis of the same sensory input. Previous studies demonstrated increased activity in the superior parietal cortex when participants perceived an illusory Gestalt impression compared to a simpler interpretation of individual elements. Here we tested whether activity related to the illusory Gestalt can be detected not only during, but also prior to it, by examining the slow fluctuations of resting-state-fMRI activity before the stimulus onset. We presented 31 participants with a bistable motion stimulus, which can be perceived either as four moving dot pairs (local) or two moving illusory squares (global). This allowed us to isolate the specific neural mechanisms that accompany the experience of an illusion under matched sensory input. fMRI was used to measure brain activity in a sparse event-related design. We observed stronger IPS and putamen responses to the stimulus when participants perceived the global interpretation compared to local, confirming the previously reported role of these areas in perceptual grouping. Most importantly, we also observed that the global stimulus interpretation was preceded by an increased activity of the bilateral dorsal insula, which is known to process saliency and gate information for conscious access. Our data suggest an important role of the dorsal insula in shaping an internally generated illusory Gestalt percept.

                Gustatory Cortex (GC), a structure deeply involved in the making of consumption decisions, presumably performs this function by integrating information about taste, experiences, and internal states related to the animals health, such as illness. Here, we investigated this assertion, examining whether illness is represented in GC activity, and how this representation impacts taste responses and behavior. We recorded GC single-neuron activity and local field potentials (LFP) from healthy rats and (the same) rats made ill ( via LiCl injection). We show (consistent with the extant literature) that the onset of illness-related behaviors arises contemporaneously with alterations in spontaneous 7-12Hz LFP power at ~11 min following injection. This process was accompanied by reductions in single-neuron taste response magnitudes and discriminability, and with enhancements in palatability-relatedness - a result reflecting the collapse of responses toward a simple "good-bad" code arising in a specific subset of GC neurons. Overall, our data show that a state (illness) that profoundly reduces consumption changes basic properties of the sensory cortical response to tastes, in a manner that can easily explain illness impact on consumption.

                Contextual associations facilitate object recognition in human vision. However, the role of context in artificial vision remains elusive as does the characteristics that humans use to define context. We investigated whether contextually related objects (bicycle-helmet) are represented more similarly in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) used for image understanding than unrelated objects (bicycle-fork). Stimuli were of objects against a white background and consisted of a diverse set of contexts (N=73). CNN representations of contextually related objects were more similar to one another than to unrelated objects across all CNN layers. Critically, the similarity found in CNNs correlated with human behavior across three experiments assessing contextual relatedness, emerging significant only in the later layers. The results demonstrate that context is inherently represented in CNNs as a result of object recognition training, and that the representation in the later layers of the network tap into the contextual regularities that predict human behavior.

                Currently, therapeutic intervention for spinal cord injury is limited. Many approaches rely on strengthening the remaining substrate and driving recovery through rehabilitative training. As compared to learning novel compensatory strategies, rehabilitation focuses on restoring movements lost to injury. Whether rehabilitation of previously learned movements after spinal cord injury requires the molecular mechanisms of motor learning, or if it engages previously trained motor circuits without requiring novel learning. Our findings implicate the latter mechanism, as we demonstrate that nicotinic acetylcholine signaling is required for motor learning but is dispensable for the recovery of previously trained motor behavior after cervical spinal cord injury.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">White Matter Brain Structure Predicts Language Performance and Learning Success</a></h4>

              
                Individual differences in the ability to deal with language have long been discussed. The neural basis of these, however, is yet unknown. Here we investigated the relationship between long-range white matter connectivity of the brain, as revealed by diffusion tractography, and the ability to process syntactically complex sentences in the participants' native language as well as the improvement thereof by multi-day training. We identified specific network motifs that indeed related white matter tractography to individual language processing performance. First, for two such motifs, one in the left and one in the right hemisphere, their individual prevalence significantly predicted the individual language performance suggesting a predisposition for the individual ability to process syntactically complex sentences, which manifests itself in the white matter brain structure. Both motifs comprise a number of cortical regions, but seem to be dominated by areas known for the involvement in working memory rather than the classical language network itself. Second, we identified another left hemispheric network motif, whose change of prevalence over the training period significantly correlated with the individual change in performance, thus reflecting training induced white matter plasticity. This motif comprises diverse cortical areas including regions known for their involvement in language processing, working memory and motor functions. The present findings suggest that individual differences in language processing and learning can be explained, in part, by individual differences in the brain's white matter structure. Brain structure may be a crucial factor to be considered when discussing variations in human cognitive performance, more generally.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Using intracerebral microdialysis to probe the efficacy of repurposed drugs in Alzheimer's disease pathology</a></h4>

              
                All disease-targeting drug trials completed to date have fallen short of meeting the clinical endpoint of significantly slowing cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease patients. Even the recently approved drug Aducanumab, has proven effective in removing amyloid-{beta}, but does not reduce cognitive decline. This emphasizes the urgent need for novel therapeutic approaches that could reduce several AD neuropathologies simultaneously, eventually leading to improved cognitive performance. To validate whether our mouse model replicates AD neuropathology as observed in patients, we characterized the 3xTg AD mouse model to avoid premature translation of successful results. In this study we have repurposed two FDA-approved drugs, Fasudil and Lonafarnib, targeting the Wnt signaling and endosomal-lysosomal pathway respectively, to test their potential to attenuate AD pathology. Using intracerebral microdialysis, we simultaneously infused these disease-targeting drugs between 1-2 weeks, separately and also in combination, while collecting cerebrospinal fluid. We found that Fasudil reduces intracellular amyloid-{beta} in young, and amyloid plaques in old animals, and overall cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-{beta}. Lonafarnib reduces tau neuropathology and cerebrospinal fluid tau biomarkers in young and old animals. Co-infusion of both drugs was more effective in reducing intracellular amyloid-{beta} than either drug alone, and appeared to improve contextual memory performance. However, an unexpected finding was that Lonafarnib treatment increased amyloid plaque size, suggesting that activating the endosomal-lysosomal system may inadvertently increase amyloid-{beta} pathology if administered too late in the AD continuum. Taken together, these findings lend support to the application of repurposed drugs to attenuate AD neuropathology at various therapeutic time windows.

                This paper extends our frequency domain quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) methods pursuing higher sensitivity to detect Brain Developmental Disorders. Prior qEEG work lacked integration of cross-spectral information omitting important functional connectivity descriptors. Lack of geographical diversity precluded accounting for site-specific variance, increasing qEEG nuisance variance. We ameliorate these weaknesses. i) Create lifespan Hermitian Riemannian multinational qEEG norms for cross-spectral tensors. These norms result from the HarMNqEEG project fostered by the Global Brain Consortium. We calculate the norms with data from 9 countries, 12 devices, and 14 studies, including 1564 subjects. Instead of raw data, only anonymized metadata and EEG cross-spectral tensors were shared. After visual and automatic quality control developmental equations for the mean and standard deviation of qEEG traditional and Hermitian Riemannian descriptive parameters were calculated using additive mixed-effects models. We demonstrate qEEG "batch effects" and provide methods to calculate harmonized z-scores. ii) We also show that the multinational harmonized Hermitian Riemannian norms produce z-scores with increased diagnostic accuracy to predict brain dysfunction at school-age produced by malnutrition only in the first year of life. We provide data and software for constructing norms. iii) We offer open code and data to calculate different individual z-scores from the HarMNqEEG dataset. These results contribute to developing bias-free, low-cost neuroimaging technologies applicable in various health settings.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Impaired functional connectivity of the hippocampus in murine models of NMDA-receptor antibody associated pathology</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: While decreased hippocampal connectivity and disruption of functional networks are established MRI features in human anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis, the underlying pathophysiology for brain network alterations remains poorly understood. Application of patient-derived monoclonal antibodies against the NR1 subunit of the NMDAR allows for the investigation of potential functional connectivity alterations in experimental murine NMDAR antibody disease models. Objective: To explore functional connectivity changes in NR1 antibody mouse models using resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI). Methods: Adult C57BL/6J mice (n=10) were intrathecally injected with a recombinant human NR1 antibody over 14 days and then studied using rs-fMRI at 7 Tesla. In addition, a newly established mouse model with in utero exposure to a human recombinant NR1 antibody characterized by a neurodevelopmental disorder (NR1-offspring) was investigated with rs-fMRI at the age of 8 weeks (n=15) and 10 months (n=14). Mice exposed to isotype-matched control antibodies served as controls. Independent component analysis (ICA) and dual regression analysis were performed to compare functional connectivity between NMDAR antibody mouse models and control mice. Results: Adult NR1-antibody injected mice showed significantly impaired functional connectivity within the dentate gyrus of the left hippocampus in comparison to controls, resembling impaired hippocampal functional connectivity patterns observed in human patients with NMDAR encephalitis. Similarly, analyses showed significantly reduced functional connectivity in the dentate gyrus in NR1-offspring compared after 8 weeks, and impaired connectivity in the dentate gyrus and CA3 hippocampal subregion in NR1-offspring at the age of 10 months. Conclusion: Functional connectivity changes within the hippocampus resulting from both direct application and in utero exposure to NMDAR antibodies can be modeled in experimental murine systems. With this translational approach, we successfully reproduced functional MRI alterations previously observed in human NMDAR encephalitis patients. Future experimental studies will identify the detailed mechanisms that cause functional network alterations and may eventually allow for non-invasive monitoring of disease activity and therapeutic effects in autoimmune encephalitis.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Lateral entorhinal cortex inputs modulate hippocampal dendritic excitability by recruiting a local disinhibitory microcircuit</a></h4>

              
                The lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) provides information about multi-sensory environmental cues to the hippocampus through direct inputs to the distal dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons. A growing body of work suggests that LEC neurons perform important functions for episodic memory processing, coding for contextually-salient elements of an environment or the experience within it. However, we know little about the functional circuit interactions between LEC and the hippocampus. In this study, we combine functional circuit mapping and computational modeling to examine how long-range glutamatergic LEC projections modulate compartment-specific excitation-inhibition dynamics in hippocampal area CA1. We demonstrate that glutamatergic LEC inputs can drive local dendritic spikes in CA1 pyramidal neurons, aided by the recruitment of a disinhibitory vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-expressing inhibitory neuron microcircuit. Our circuit mapping further reveals that, in parallel, LEC also recruits cholecystokinin (CCK)-expressing inhibitory neurons, which our model predicts act as a strong suppressor of dendritic spikes. These results provide new insight into a cortically-driven GABAergic microcircuit mechanism that gates non-linear dendritic computations, which may support compartment-specific coding of multi-sensory contextual features within the hippocampus.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">qEEG Analysis in the Diagnosis of Alzheimers Disease; a Comparison of Functional Connectivity and Spectral Analysis</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimers disease (AD) is a brain disorder that is mainly characterized by a progressive degeneration of neurons in the brain, causing a decline in cognitive abilities and difficulties in engaging in day-to-day activities. This study compares an FFT-based spectral analysis against a functional connectivity analysis based on phase synchronization, for finding known differences between AD patients and Healthy Control (HC) subjects. Both of these quantitative analysis methods were applied on a dataset comprising bipolar EEG montages values from 20 diagnosed AD patients and 20 age-matched HC subjects. Additionally, an attempt was made to localize the identified AD-induced brain activity effects in AD patients. The obtained results showed the advantage of the functional connectivity analysis method compared to a simple spectral analysis. Specifically, while spectral analysis could not find any significant differences between the AD and HC groups, the functional connectivity analysis showed statistically higher synchronization levels in the AD group in the lower frequency bands (delta and theta), suggesting that the AD patients brains are in a phase-locked state. Further comparison of functional connectivity between the homotopic regions confirmed that the traits of AD were localized in the centro-parietal and centro-temporal areas in the theta frequency band (4-8 Hz). The contribution of this study is that it applies a neural metric for Alzheimers detection from a data science perspective rather than from a neuroscience one. The study shows that the combination of bipolar derivations with phase synchronization yields similar results to comparable studies employing alternative analysis methods.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">APOE ε4 effects on hippocampal atrophy in the healthy elderly reflect future cognitive decline</a></h4>

              
                The APOE {epsilon}4 allele is the primary genetic risk factor for late onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). A cardinal problem in determining APOE {epsilon}4's effect on cognition and brain structure in older individuals is dissociating prodromal changes -- linked to increased AD risk -- from potential phenotypic differences. To address this, we used cognitive and neuroimaging data from a large cohort of cognitively normal 69-86 year-olds with up to 8 yearly follow-ups to investigate cross-sectional and longitudinal differences between APOE {epsilon}3/{epsilon}3 homozygotes and {epsilon}3/{epsilon}4 heterozygotes. Although we found a significant age-by-genotype interaction in right hippocampal volume, once our analyses were conditionalised by future diagnosis to account for prodromal mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD, this effect was no longer observed. Likewise, longitudinally, rate of hippocampal atrophy was determined not by genotype, but by future diagnosis. Thus, we provide direct evidence in support of the prodromal hypothesis of APOE {epsilon}4 on brain structure.

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) can initiate complex pathophysiological changes in the brain. Numerous cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying these pathologic changes are altered after injury, including those involved in energy utilization, excitotoxicity, ionic disturbances, and inflammation. It is thought that targeting multiple mechanisms may be necessary to produce meaningful reductions in brain pathology and to improve outcome. Previous studies have reported that the anti-diabetic drug metformin can also affect inflammatory, cell survival, and metabolic outcomes, possibly by acting on multiple targets and/or pathways. We therefore questioned whether metformin treatment can reduce pathology after repeat mild closed head injury (rmCHI) in male C57Bl/6 mice. We found that metformin, administered acutely after each head impact, resulted in markedly reduced white matter damage, astrogliosis, loss of hippocampal parvalbumin neurons, and improved mitochondrial function. In addition, both motor and cognitive functions were significantly improved when tested after discontinuation of the treatment. These studies suggest that metformin may be beneficial as a treatment for repeat concussion.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Effect of cogon grass root ethanol extract on fatty acid binding protein 4 and oxidative stress markers in a sepsis mouse model [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Sepsis causes several immunological and metabolic alterations that induce oxidative stress. The modulation of fatty acid-binding protein 4 (FABP4) has been shown to worsen this condition. Extract of cogon grass root (ECGR) contains flavonoids and isoeugenol compounds that exhibit anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. This study aimed to assess the effects of ECGR on FABP4 and oxidative stress–related factors in a sepsis mouse model. Methods: Twenty-nine male mice (Mus musculus) of the Deutsche Denken Yoken strain were divided into four groups: group 1, control; group 2, mice treated with 10 μL/kg body weight (BW) lipopolysaccharide (LPS); and groups 3 and 4, mice pre-treated with 90 and 115 mg/kg BW, respectively, and then treated with 10 μL/kg BW LPS for 14 d. Blood, liver, lymph, and cardiac tissue samples were collected and subjected to histological and complete blood examinations. Antioxidant (Glutathione peroxidase 3 (GPx3) and superoxide dismutase), FABP4 levels, and immune system-associated biomarker levels (TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β ) were measured. Results: Significant increases in platelet levels (p = 0.03), cardiomyocyte counts (p =0.004), and hepatocyte counts (p = 0.0004) were observed in group 4 compared with those in group 2. Conversely, compared with those in group 2, there were significant decreases in TNF-α expression in group 3 (p = 0.004), white pulp length and width in group 4 (p = 0.001), FABP4 levels in groups 3 and 4 (p = 0.015 and p = 0.012, respectively), lymphocyte counts in group 4 (p = 0.009), and monocyte counts (p = 0.000) and polymorphonuclear cell counts in the livers (p = 0.000) and hearts (p = 0.000) of groups 3 and 4. GPx3 activity was significantly higher in group 3 than in group 1 (p = 0.04). Conclusions: ECGR reduces FABP4 level and modulating oxidative stress markers in sepsis mouse model.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Novel measures of Morris water maze performance that use vector field maps to assess accuracy, uncertainty, and intention of navigational searches</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Most commonly used behavioral measures for testing learning and memory in the Morris water maze (MWM) involve comparisons of an animal's residence time in different quadrants of the pool. Such measures are limited in their ability to test different aspects of the animal's performance. Here, we describe novel measures of performance in the MWM that use vector fields to capture the motion of mice as well as their search pattern in the maze. Using these vector fields, we develop quantitative measures of performance that are intuitive and more sensitive than classical measures. First, we describe search patterns in terms of vector field properties and use these properties to define three metrics of spatial memory namely Spatial Accuracy, Uncertainty and, Intensity of Search. We demonstrate the usefulness of these measures using four different data sets including comparisons between different strains of mice, an analysis of two mouse models of Noonan syndrome (NS; <i>Ptpn11</i> D61G and <i>Ptpn11</i> N308D/+), and a study of goal reversal training. Importantly, besides highlighting novel aspects of performance in this widely used spatial task, our measures were able to uncover previously undetected differences, including in an animal model of NS, which we rescued with the mitogen activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitor SL327. Thus, our results show that our approach breaks down performance in the MWM into sensitive measurable independent components that highlight differences in spatial learning and memory in the MWM that were undetected by conventional measures.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Ultrasound findings in lateral elbow tendinopathy: A retrospective analysis of radiological tendon features [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Lateral elbow tendinopathy (LET) is prevalent in the upper extremity, with various therapeutic options. Understanding the types and the relations between the radiological tendon features would help to develop more specific treatments. This study reviewed ultrasound exams of LET to investigate the types of degenerative findings and the relationships between them in one of the most prominent sports medicine clinics in Latin America. Methods: A retrospective study was performed. We evaluated 4335 ultrasonographic exams with LET from 2017 and 2018. Five principal degenerative ultrasound criteria with subtypes were selected: hypoechogenicity, neovascularity, calcification, enthesopathy, and intrasubstance tear. A multiple linear regression model was conducted to explore the association between the findings, sex, and age. Results: Overall, 4324 ultrasound exams were analyzed; 2607 (60.29%) were males. Multiple degenerative tendon findings were found in adults (≥18 years) with LET. Hypoechogenicity (67.77%) and neovascularity (37.8%) were the most frequent. The mean length of a tendon tear in both sexes was 4.44 (± 2.81) millimeters. Mild hypoechogenicity (P < .001), and depth intrasubstance tear (P < .01) were statistically significant between them. Severe hypoechogenicity was associated with an increase in all tendon tear dimensions for length 1.37 ([95% Confidence interval (CI), 0.57, 2.17]; P < .001), for width 1.10 ([95% CI, 0.33, 1.87]; P < .01) and for depth 1.64 ([95% CI, 0.40, 2.88]; P < .01). Additional findings associated with an increase in the length dimension were 0.42 associated with focal neovascularity ([95% CI, 0.19, 0.65]; P < .001), and 0.71 associated with multiple neovascularity ([95% CI, 0.27, 1.15]; P < .01). Conclusions: Hypoechogenicity and neovascularity findings presented a positive association with the size of tendon tear in patients with LET. This study reaffirms the increased predominance of tendon tear during the 4th to 6th decades of life.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">An initial ‘snapshot’ of sensory information biases the likelihood and speed of subsequent changes of mind</a></h4>

              
                <p>by William Turner, Daniel Feuerriegel, Robert Hester, Stefan Bode</p>

We often need to rapidly change our mind about perceptual decisions in order to account for new information and correct mistakes. One fundamental, unresolved question is whether information processed prior to a decision being made (‘pre-decisional information’) has any influence on the likelihood and speed with which that decision is reversed. We investigated this using a luminance discrimination task in which participants indicated which of two flickering greyscale squares was brightest. Following an initial decision, the stimuli briefly remained on screen, and participants could change their response. Using psychophysical reverse correlation, we examined how moment-to-moment fluctuations in stimulus luminance affected participants’ decisions. This revealed that the strength of even the very earliest (pre-decisional) evidence was associated with the likelihood and speed of later changes of mind. To account for this effect, we propose an extended diffusion model in which an initial ‘snapshot’ of sensory information biases ongoing evidence accumulation.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Using population-specific add-on polymorphisms to improve genotype imputation in underrepresented populations</a></h4>

Genome-wide association studies rely on the statistical inference of untyped variants, called imputation, to increase the coverage of genotyping arrays. However, the results are often suboptimal in populations underrepresented in existing reference panels and array designs, since the selected single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) may fail to capture population-specific haplotype structures, hence the full extent of common genetic variation. Here, we propose to sequence the full genomes of a small subset of an underrepresented study cohort to inform the selection of population-specific add-on tag SNPs and to generate an internal population-specific imputation reference panel, such that the remaining array-genotyped cohort could be more accurately imputed. Using a Tanzania-based cohort as a proof-of-concept, we demonstrate the validity of our approach by showing improvements in imputation accuracy after the addition of our designed add-on tags to the base H3Africa array.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Dominating lengthscales of zebrafish collective behaviour</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yushi Yang, Francesco Turci, Erika Kague, Chrissy L. Hammond, John Russo, C. Patrick Royall</p>

Collective behaviour in living systems is observed across many scales, from bacteria to insects, to fish shoals. Zebrafish have emerged as a model system amenable to laboratory study. Here we report a three-dimensional study of the collective dynamics of fifty zebrafish. We observed the emergence of collective behaviour changing between ordered to randomised, upon adaptation to new environmental conditions. We quantify the spatial and temporal correlation functions of the fish and identify two length scales, the persistence length and the nearest neighbour distance, that capture the essence of the behavioural changes. The ratio of the two length scales correlates robustly with the polarisation of collective motion that we explain with a reductionist model of self–propelled particles with alignment interactions.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">C-type lectin 4 regulates broad-spectrum melanization-based refractoriness to malaria parasites</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Maria L. Simões, Yuemei Dong, Godfree Mlambo, George Dimopoulos</p>

<i>Anopheles gambiae</i> melanization-based refractoriness to the human malaria parasite <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> has rarely been observed in either laboratory or natural conditions, in contrast to the rodent model malaria parasite <i>Plasmodium berghei</i> that can become completely melanized by a TEP1 complement-like system-dependent mechanism. Multiple studies have shown that the rodent parasite evades this defense by recruiting the C-type lectins CTL4 and CTLMA2, while permissiveness to the human malaria parasite was not affected by partial depletion of these factors by RNAi silencing. Using CRISPR/Cas9-based CTL4 knockout, we show that <i>A</i>. <i>gambiae</i> can mount melanization-based refractoriness to the human malaria parasite, which is independent of the TEP1 complement-like system and the major anti-<i>Plasmodium</i> immune pathway Imd. Our study indicates a hierarchical specificity in the control of <i>Plasmodium</i> melanization and proves CTL4 as an essential host factor for <i>P</i>. <i>falciparum</i> transmission and one of the most potent mosquito-encoded malaria transmission-blocking targets.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Microbial defenses against mobile genetic elements and viruses: Who defends whom from what?</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Eduardo P. C. Rocha, David Bikard</p>

Prokaryotes have numerous mobile genetic elements (MGEs) that mediate horizontal gene transfer (HGT) between cells. These elements can be costly, even deadly, and cells use numerous defense systems to filter, control, or inactivate them. Recent studies have shown that prophages, conjugative elements, their parasites (phage satellites and mobilizable elements), and other poorly described MGEs encode defense systems homologous to those of bacteria. These constitute a significant fraction of the repertoire of cellular defense genes. As components of MGEs, these defense systems have presumably evolved to provide them, not the cell, adaptive functions. While the interests of the host and MGEs are aligned when they face a common threat such as an infection by a virulent phage, defensive functions carried by MGEs might also play more selfish roles to fend off other antagonistic MGEs or to ensure their maintenance in the cell. MGEs are eventually lost from the surviving host genomes by mutational processes and their defense systems can be co-opted when they provide an advantage to the cell. The abundance of defense systems in MGEs thus sheds new light on the role, effect, and fate of the so-called “cellular defense systems,” whereby they are not only merely microbial defensive weapons in a 2-partner arms race, but also tools of intragenomic conflict between multiple genetic elements with divergent interests that shape cell fate and gene flow at the population level.

                Priapism in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) appears to be an infrequent manifestation as well as a crucial emergency. Here, we report an 18-year-old male presenting with a persistent erection of the penis for 20 days. We evaluated and compared the reported cases within 20 years discussing the management of priapism in CML. Cytoreductive therapy followed by leukapheresis, the administration of tyrosine kinase inhibitor, and intra-cavernosal blood aspiration may resolve the symptoms of priapism. Early intervention for cytoreduction and aspiration are the pivotal keys to successfully impeding the complications.

                Background: Coping with COVID-19 is a challenge for culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) older adults. In Australia, little attention has been given to understanding associations between cultural contexts, health promotion, and socio-emotional and mental health challenges of older CALD adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, we have collected data from older CALD adults to examine their COVID-19 risk perceptions and its association with their health precautions, behavioural dimensions and emergency preparation. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in South Australia. The CALD population aged 60 years and above were approached through 11 South Australian multicultural NGOs. Results: We provide the details of 155 older CALD South Australians’ demographics, risk perceptions, health precautions (problem-and-emotion-focused), behavioural dimensions and emergency preparation.  The explanatory variables included demographic characteristics (age, gender, education and ethnicity); and risk perception (cognitive [likelihood of being affected] and affective dimension [fear and general concerns], and psychometric paradigm [severity, controllability, and personal impact]. The outcome measure variables were health precautions (problem-focused and emotion-focused), behavioral adaptions and emergency preparation. Conclusions: This dataset may help the researchers who investigate multicultural health or aged care in the pandemic and or who may have interest to link with other datasets and secondary use of this primary dataset in order to develop culturally tailored pandemic-related response plan.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Causes and consequences of psychological stress in the working life and emergency services of veterinary professionals in the Federal Republic of Germany: A protocol for a nationwide cross-sectional study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Veterinarians are exposed to high workloads. International studies show they have an above-average risk of suicide and burnout. Hardly any studies dealing with causes and consequences of workload and emergency services are available in Germany. Methods: The aim of the observational cross-sectional study presented here is to assess their workloads and working conditions (Slesina questionnaire), health situation and well-being (KÖPS questionnaire - physical, psychological and social symptoms; Maslach Burnout Inventory MBI-GS; WHO-5 well-being index), as well as occupational psychological aspects (irritation scales; overcommitment; questionnaire on work-related behavior and experience patterns AVEM) which will be recorded and analyzed according to general sociodemographic and occupational data (sector-, gender, assignment- and country-specific). In addition, the heart rate variability of some members of the veterinary profession will be analyzed using 24 hour electrocardiogram recordings, which together with the subjective insights into the stress situation from the questionnaires, will allow objective psychophysiological stress analyses. Conclusions: The results of the study will provide further empirical insights into the workloads and stresses faced by the veterinary profession in Germany, based on which important insights into this professional group’s mental health can be identified. In this way, it should be possible to identify (mis)stress-triggering factors in the target groups, derive target group-specific recommendations for health-promoting work design, and identify approaches to veterinary studies and career selection.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Desired support system to eradicate urban homelessness: an exploratory descriptive study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background - The new increasing homeless lately consist of women, children, youth, the elderly and marginalized ethnic or migrant groups. Some of them are working and earn salaries, however, the income is not sufficient to live modestly. Purpose – The purpose of this research is to establish a desired support system to eradicate urban homelessness in the country. Design/methodology/approach – This is an exploratory descriptive method study which employed quantitative techniques.  The study employed a social ecological model to investigate behavior of homeless via multiple levels of influences including intrapersonal, interpersonal, organizational, community and public policy. Surveys have been conducted on sixty-five homeless individuals.  Findings – It was found that support systems and structures should be derived from the whole streams from families, communities, organizations and government. Employment opportunities, long-term shelters within the community places and highly demanded skills are needed to improve their living condition. Research limitations – This study is only focused on the socio-economic structures of the homeless in a capital city. Originality/value – This is an empirical research using a social ecological model for the homeless in the Kuala Lumpur area. Research on homeless study has received little attention and has yet to be fully explored.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Thromboembolic events during neoadjuvant chemotherapy in muscle invasive bladder cancer – any correlation to the central venous access? A clinical practice article [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Patients with muscle invasive bladder cancer have a generally known 5-year overall survival of approximately 58% with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). During the last decades, addition of Cisplatinum-based NAC in fit patients prior to radical cystectomy (RC), has significantly improved OS, compared to RC only. However, some published studies following NAC addition, describe an intermediate risk increase of thromboembolic events (TEEs). Placement of central venous access (CVA) before NAC has also been suggested as being a potential risk factor for thrombosis. We present a combination of images and cases from the Northern Swedish health region where three patients developed venous TEE after CVA placement for NAC-administration and found that the time until curable RC was prolonged circa one month each, with an addition of one RC cancelled. These are serious events and to our knowledge, there are no current guidelines on prevention of TEE before RC. The aim with this report was to provide examples of these events and conclude that further prospective trials are warranted on prevention and future guidelines regarding venous anticoagulant treatment for TEE that occur pre-RC in NAC-patients.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of rurioctocog alfa pegol for prophylactic treatment in previously treated patients with severe hemophilia A: a systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved wit</a></h4>

              
                Background: Patients with severe hemophilia often present with painful joint and soft tissue bleeding which may restrict them from their daily activities. The current standard of care still relies on a regular prophylactic factor VIII (FVIII), which has a high daily treatment burden. Recently, rurioctocog alfa pegol, a third-generation recombinant FVIII with a modification in its polyethylene glycol (PEG) component, has been developed. Several trials have studied this synthetic drug as bleeding prophylaxis in severe hemophilia A. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of rurioctocog alfa pegol for previously treated patients with severe hemophilia A. Methods: This study was conducted in conformity with the PRISMA guidelines. Data were retrieved from PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Library, Wiley Online Library, and CINAHL (via EBSCOhost). Study qualities were assessed using the Methodological Index for Non-Randomized Studies (MINORS) and Modified Jadad scales. Results: Four studies involving 517 previously treated severe hemophilia A patients were included in this study. The pooled mean of total annualized bleeding rate (ABR) and hemostatic efficacy was 2.59 (95% CI = 2.04–3.14) and 92% (95% CI = 85%–97%), respectively. Only 30 (2.3%) non-serious and one (1.4%) serious adverse events were considered related to rurioctocog alfa pegol treatment. At the end of the studies, no development of FVIII inhibitory antibodies was observed. None of the developed binding antibodies to FVIII, PEG-FVIII, or PEG was correlated to the treatment efficacy and safety. Conclusions: Despite the limited availability of direct comparison studies, our analyses indicate that rurioctocog alfa pegol could serve as a safe and effective alternative for bleeding prophylaxis in previously treated hemophilia A patients. Moreover, it appears to have low immunogenicity, which further increases the safety profile of the drug in such clinical conditions.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The post-pandemic era: will physical distancing be a perceived way of life? [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: This study aimed to determine whether people living in the Eastern Region of Saudi Arabia would prefer to continue the practice of physical distancing after the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic or to return to their previous way of life. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted from August 2020 to October 2020 in the Eastern Region of Saudi Arabia. A pre-tested questionnaire was sent electronically through social media. Data on participants’ demographics and their perspectives regarding post-pandemic physical distancing were collected. The calculated sample size was 1,066; however, the total number of responses included in the analysis was 989. Results: The average age of the participants was 31.15±11.93 years. There were 435 men and 554 women in the study. Participants showed significantly high levels of disagreement with statements indicating that they were willing to use public transportation (61%), attend social gatherings (36%), and hug relatives or colleagues (40%) after the pandemic (p<0.001); however, 43% agreed that they would spend time with family or friends (p<0.001). The level of education was also found to be significantly related to the responses, and the level of disagreement increased as the level of education increased (p<0.001). Conclusions: One-third of the study participants planned to continue engaging in physical distancing even after the current pandemic and if the COVID-19 related restriction will remain in place for longer, there is chance to increase in this proportion. However, it cannot be concluded whether or not this behavior will prevail in the long run, after the ease in restrictions. If so, it may greatly affect some businesses and perhaps some social norms and values as well.

                Bruxism is a disease with a multifactorial etiology. Its clinical manifestations are most often an unaesthetic smile with abraded tooth surfaces, temporomandibular disorders and muscle hyperactivity. Here we present a case of bruxism where proper articulation of the occlusal splint was performed using the T-scan Novus system. A patient with bruxism underwent treatment with stabilization splint made by 3D printer technology. Intraoral scanning was performed using Trios Color (3Shape, 2014), and the digital design was achieved using the 3Shape Dental system design - splint studio. Formlabs Form 2 printer with biocompatible resin Dental LT Clear Resin was used for printing. The T-Scan Novus system with software attached to it, version 9.1, was used for digital examination of the occlusion. A 2.7 mm thick occlusal splint was developed, and the software adapted the occlusion with antagonists. After adjustment with T-Scan Novus, a reduction in disocclusion time of the patient was achieved, which is a desired result in the treatment of bruxism. The position of the joint components was proven radiologically. The treatment of bruxism with splint therapy continues to be the main method of treatment. Using digital technology allows for more accurate constructions and precise balancing of occlusal relationships.

                Background Acute and chronic child undernutrition is a continuous problem in Ethiopia. Therefore, this study was initiated to compare the prevalence of underweight and its associated factors among children aged 6-23 months in the Kuyu district, North Shewa zone, Oromia, Ethiopia. Methods An observational community-based study was conducted on 612 children (304 from household security and 308 from household food insecurity). A structured and standardize questionnaire was used in this study. Anthropometric measurements were generated using WHO standardize. Data was analyzed using SPSS version 20.0. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify the independent variables associated with underweight (weight-for-age) among children in household food security and insecurity, a p value less than 0.05 with 95%CI was considered as statistically significant. Results The results indicated that 30.9% [95%CI; 25.7, 36.2] and 36.7% [95% CI; 31.8, 42.5] of children were underweight for their age in household food security and insecurity. Low wealth status (AOR=3.2; 95%CI: 1.099, 9.275), poor dietary diets (AOR=5.2; 95%CI: 2.046, 13.27), and lack of breastfeeding for two years (AOR= 2.1; 95%CI= 1.78, 5, 42) were associated with underweight children in household food security. Whereas lack of antenatal care visits (AOR=0.52; 95%CI: 0.12, 0.68) and poor dietary diets (AOR=3.01; 95%CI= 2.1, 17.4) were other independent variables associated with underweight children in household food insecurity. Conclusions This study established that there was a high prevalence of underweight in children from Oromia.  Therefore, introducing household income generating activities are vital interventions in order to overcome the problem of undernutrition in this region.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Improving prediction of core transcription factors for cell reprogramming and transdifferentiation [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Identification of transcription factors (TFs) that could induce and direct cell conversion remains a challenge. Though several hundreds of TFs are usually transcribed in each cell type, the identity of a cell is controlled and can be achieved through the ectopic overexpression of only a small subset of so-called core TFs. Currently, the experimental identification of the core TFs for a broad spectrum of cell types remains challenging. Computational solutions to this problem would provide a better understanding of the mechanisms controlling cell identity during natural embryonic or malignant development, as well as give a foundation for cell-based therapy. Herein, we propose a computational approach based on over-enrichment of transcription factors binding sites (TFBS) in differentially accessible chromatin regions that could identify the potential core TFs for a variety of primary human cells involved in hematopoiesis. Our approach enables the integration of both transcriptomic (single-cell RNA sequencing, scRNA-seq) and epigenenomic (single-cell assay for transposable-accessible chromatin, scATAC-seq) data at the single-cell resolution to search for core TFs, and can be scalable to predict subsets of core TFs and their role in a given conversion between cells.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Personalized fMRI delineates functional regions preserved within brain tumors</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Accumulating evidence from invasive cortical stimulation mapping and non-invasive neuroimaging studies indicates that brain function may be preserved within brain tumors. However, a non-invasive approach to accurately and comprehensively delineate individual-specific functional networks in the whole brain, especially in brain tissues within and surrounding tumors, is still lacking. The purpose of the study is to develop a clinically useful technique that can map functional regions within tumoral brains.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We developed an individual-specific functional network parcellation approach using resting state functional MRI (rsfMRI) that effectively captured functional networks within and nearby tumors in 20 patients. We examined the accuracy of the functional maps using invasive cortical stimulation and task response.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We found that approximately 33.2% of the tumoral mass appeared to be functionally active and demonstrated robust functional connectivity with non-tumoral brain regions. Functional networks nearby tumors were validated by invasive cortical stimulation mapping. Intratumoral sensorimotor networks mapped by our technique could be distinguished by their distinct cortico-cerebellar connectivity patterns and were consistent with hand movement evoked fMRI task activations. Furthermore, in some patients, cognitive networks that were detected in the tumor mass showed long-distance and distributed functional connectivity.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our non-invasive approach to mapping individual-specific functional networks using rsfMRI represents a promising new tool for identifying regions with preserved functional connectivity within and surrounding brain tumors, and could be used as a complement to presurgical planning for patients undergoing tumor resection surgery.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">Lysosomal dysfunction in neurodegeneration: emerging concepts and methods</a></h4>

              
                The understanding of lysosomes has come a long way since the initial discovery of their role in degrading cellular waste. The lysosome is now recognized as a highly dynamic organelle positioned at the crossroads of cell signaling, transcription, and metabolism. Underscoring its importance is the observation that, in addition to rare monogenic lysosomal storage disorders, genes regulating lysosomal function are implicated in common sporadic neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).

                Maternal obesity during pregnancy has immediate and long-term detrimental effects on the offspring heart. In this study, we characterized the cardiac and circulatory lipid profiles in late gestation E18.5 fetuses of diet-induced obese pregnant mice and established the changes in lipid abundance and fetal cardiac transcriptomics. We used untargeted and targeted lipidomics and transcriptomics to define changes in the serum and cardiac lipid composition and fatty acid metabolism in male and female fetuses. From these analyses we observed: (1) maternal obesity affects the maternal and fetal serum lipidome distinctly; (2) female fetal heart lipidomes are more sensitive to maternal obesity than males; (3) changes in lipid supply might contribute to early expression of lipolytic genes in mouse hearts exposed to maternal obesity. These results highlight the existence of sexually dimorphic responses of the fetal heart to the same <i>in utero</i> obesogenic environment and identify lipids species that might mediate programming of cardiovascular health.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Breaking antimicrobial resistance by disrupting extracytoplasmic protein folding</a></h4>

              
                Antimicrobial resistance in Gram-negative bacteria is one of the greatest threats to global health. New antibacterial strategies are urgently needed, and the development of antibiotic adjuvants that either neutralize resistance proteins or compromise the integrity of the cell envelope is of ever-growing interest. Most available adjuvants are only effective against specific resistance proteins. Here we demonstrate that disruption of cell envelope protein homeostasis simultaneously compromises several classes of resistance determinants. In particular, we find that impairing DsbA-mediated disulfide bond formation incapacitates diverse β-lactamases and destabilizes mobile colistin resistance enzymes. Furthermore, we show that chemical inhibition of DsbA sensitizes multidrug-resistant clinical isolates to existing antibiotics and that the absence of DsbA, in combination with antibiotic treatment, substantially increases the survival of <i>Galleria mellonella</i> larvae infected with multidrug-resistant <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>. This work lays the foundation for the development of novel antibiotic adjuvants that function as broad-acting resistance breakers.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Drosophila p53 isoforms have overlapping and distinct functions in germline genome integrity and oocyte quality control</a></h4>

              
                p53 gene family members in humans and other organisms encode a large number of protein isoforms whose functions are largely undefined. Using <i>Drosophila</i> as a model, we find that a p53B isoform is expressed predominantly in the germline where it colocalizes with p53A into subnuclear bodies. It is only p53A, however, that mediates the apoptotic response to ionizing radiation in the germline and soma. In contrast, p53A and p53B are both required for the normal repair of meiotic DNA breaks, an activity that is more crucial when meiotic recombination is defective. We find that in oocytes with persistent DNA breaks p53A is also required to activate a meiotic pachytene checkpoint. Our findings indicate that <i>Drosophila</i> p53 isoforms have DNA lesion and cell type-specific functions, with parallels to the functions of mammalian p53 family members in the genotoxic stress response and oocyte quality control.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Epigenetic scores for the circulating proteome as tools for disease prediction</a></h4>

              
                Protein biomarkers have been identified across many age-related morbidities. However, characterising epigenetic influences could further inform disease predictions. Here, we leverage epigenome-wide data to study links between the DNAm signatures of the circulating proteome and incident diseases. Using data from four cohorts, we trained and tested epigenetic scores (EpiScores) for 953 plasma proteins, identifying 109 scores that explained between 1% and 58% of the variance in protein levels after adjusting for known protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL) genetic effects. By projecting these EpiScores into an independent sample, (Generation Scotland; n=9,537) and relating them to incident morbidities over a follow-up of 14 years, we uncovered 137 EpiScore – disease associations. These associations were largely independent of immune cell proportions, common lifestyle and health factors and biological aging. Notably, we found that our diabetes-associated EpiScores highlighted previous top biomarker associations from proteome-wide assessments of diabetes. These EpiScores for protein levels can therefore be a valuable resource for disease prediction and risk stratification.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Disruption of PIKFYVE causes congenital cataract in human and zebrafish</a></h4>

              
                Congenital cataract, an ocular disease predominantly occurring within the first decade of life, is one of the leading causes of blindness in children. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of congenital cataract remain incompletely defined. Through whole-exome sequencing of a Chinese family with congenital cataract, we identified a potential pathological variant (p.G1943E) in <i>PIKFYVE</i>, which is located in the PIP kinase domain of the PIKFYVE protein. We demonstrated that heterozygous/homozygous disruption of PIKFYVE kinase domain, instead of overexpression of <i>PIKFYVE<sup>G1943E</sup></i> in zebrafish mimicked the cataract defect in human patients, suggesting that haploinsufficiency, rather than dominant-negative inhibition of PIKFYVE activity caused the disease. Phenotypical analysis of <i>pikfyve</i> zebrafish mutants revealed that loss of Pikfyve caused aberrant vacuolation (accumulation of Rab7<sup>+</sup>Lc3<sup>+</sup> amphisomes) in lens cells, which was significantly alleviated by treatment with the V-ATPase inhibitor bafilomycin A1 (Baf-A1). Collectively, we identified <i>PIKFYVE</i> as a novel causative gene for congenital cataract and pinpointed the potential application of Baf-A1 for the treatment of congenital cataract caused by PIKFYVE deficiency.

                Here, we report the generation and characterization of a novel Huntington’s disease (HD) mouse model BAC226Q by using a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) system, expressing full-length human HTT with ~226 CAG-CAA repeats and containing endogenous human HTT promoter and regulatory elements. BAC226Q recapitulated a full-spectrum of age-dependent and progressive HD-like phenotypes without unwanted and erroneous phenotypes. BAC226Q mice developed normally, and gradually exhibited HD-like psychiatric and cognitive phenotypes at 2 months. From 3 to 4 months, BAC226Q mice showed robust progressive motor deficits. At 11 months, BAC226Q mice showed significant reduced life span, gradual weight loss and exhibited neuropathology including significant brain atrophy specific to striatum and cortex, striatal neuronal death, widespread huntingtin inclusions, and reactive pathology. Therefore, the novel BAC226Q mouse accurately recapitulating robust, age-dependent, progressive HD-like phenotypes will be a valuable tool for studying disease mechanisms, identifying biomarkers, and testing gene-targeting therapeutic approaches for HD.

                In silico modelling revealed how only three Spike mutations of maVie16 enhanced interaction with murine ACE2. MaVie16 induced profound pathology in BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice and the resulting mouse COVID-19 (mCOVID-19) replicated critical aspects of human disease, including early lymphopenia, pulmonary immune cell infiltration, pneumonia and specific adaptive immunity. Inhibition of the proinflammatory cytokines IFNg and TNF substantially reduced immunopathology. Importantly, genetic ACE2-deficiency completely prevented mCOVID-19 development. Finally, inhalation therapy with recombinant ACE2 fully protected mice from mCOVID-19, revealing a novel and efficient treatment. Thus, we here present maVie16 as a new tool to model COVID-19 for the discovery of new therapies and show that disease severity is determined by cytokine-driven immunopathology and critically dependent on ACE2 <i>in vivo</i>.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Shallow neural networks trained to detect collisions recover features of visual loom-selective neurons</a></h4>

              
                Animals have evolved sophisticated visual circuits to solve a vital inference problem: detecting whether or not a visual signal corresponds to an object on a collision course. Such events are detected by specific circuits sensitive to visual looming, or objects increasing in size. Various computational models have been developed for these circuits, but how the collision-detection inference problem itself shapes the computational structures of these circuits remains unknown. Here, inspired by the distinctive structures of LPLC2 neurons in the visual system of Drosophila, we build anatomically-constrained shallow neural network models and train them to identify visual signals that correspond to impending collisions. Surprisingly, the optimization arrives at two distinct, opposing solutions, only one of which matches the actual dendritic weighting of LPLC2 neurons. Both solutions can solve the inference problem with high accuracy when the population size is large enough. The LPLC2-like solutions reproduces experimentally observed LPLC2 neuron responses for many stimuli, and reproduces canonical tuning of loom sensitive neurons, even though the models are never trained on neural data. Thus, LPLC2 neuron properties and tuning are predicted by optimizing an anatomically-constrained neural network to detect impending collisions. More generally, these results illustrate how optimizing inference tasks that are important for an animal's perceptual goals can reveal and explain computational properties of specific sensory neurons.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Structural basis of Plasmodium vivax inhibition by antibodies binding to the circumsporozoite protein repeats</a></h4>

              
                Malaria is a global health burden, with <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> (Pf) and <i>Plasmodium vivax</i> (Pv) responsible for the majority of infections worldwide. Circumsporozoite protein (CSP) is the most abundant protein on the surface of <i>Plasmodium</i> sporozoites, and antibodies targeting the central repeat region of CSP can prevent parasite infection. Although much has been uncovered about the molecular basis of antibody recognition of the PfCSP repeats, data remains scarce for PvCSP. Here, we performed molecular dynamics simulations for peptides comprising the PvCSP repeats from strains VK210 and VK247 to reveal how the PvCSP central repeats are highly disordered, with minor propensities to adopt turn conformations. Next, we solved eight crystal structures to unveil the interactions of two inhibitory monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), 2F2 and 2E10.E9, with PvCSP repeats. Both antibodies can accommodate subtle sequence variances in the repeat motifs and recognize largely coiled peptide conformations that also contain isolated turns. Our structural studies uncover various degrees of Fab-Fab homotypic interactions upon recognition of the PvCSP central repeats by these two inhibitory mAbs, similar to potent mAbs against PfCSP. These findings augment our understanding of host-<i>Plasmodium</i> interactions, and contribute molecular details of Pv inhibition by mAbs to unlock structure-based engineering of PvCSP-based vaccines.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Invariance in pitch perception</a></h4>

              
                Information in speech and music is often conveyed through changes in fundamental frequency (f0), the perceptual correlate of which is known as "pitch". One challenge of extracting this information is that such sounds can also vary in their spectral content due to the filtering imposed by a vocal tract or instrument body. Pitch is envisioned as invariant to spectral shape, potentially providing a solution to this challenge, but the extent and nature of this invariance remain poorly understood. We examined the extent to which human pitch judgments are invariant to spectral differences between natural sounds. Listeners performed up/down and interval discrimination tasks with spoken vowels, instrument notes, or synthetic tones, synthesized to be either harmonic or inharmonic (lacking a well-defined f0). Listeners were worse at discriminating pitch across different vowel and instrument sounds compared to when vowels/instruments were the same, being biased by differences in the spectral centroids of the sounds being compared. However, there was no interaction between this effect and that of inharmonicity. In addition, this bias decreased when sounds were separated by short delays. This finding suggests that the representation of a sound's pitch is itself unbiased, but that pitch comparisons between sounds are influenced by changes in timbre, the effect of which weakens over time. Pitch representations thus appears to be relatively invariant to spectral shape. But relative pitch judgments are not, even when spectral shape variation is naturalistic, and when such judgments are based on representations of the f0.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Detailed measurements and simulations of electric field distribution of two TMS coils cleared for obsessive compulsive disorder in the brain and in specific regions associated with OCD</a></h4>

              
                The FDA cleared deep transcranial magnetic stimulation (Deep TMS) with the H7 coil for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) treatment, following a double-blinded placebo-controlled multicenter trial. Two years later the FDA cleared TMS with the D-B80 coil on the basis of substantial equivalence. In order to investigate the induced electric field characteristics of the two coils, these were placed at the treatment position for OCD over the prefrontal cortex of a head phantom, and the field distribution was measured. Additionally, numerical simulations were performed in eight Population Head Model repository models with two sets of conductivity values and three Virtual Population anatomical head models and their homogeneous versions. The H7 was found to induce significantly higher maximal electric fields (p<0.0001, t=11.08) and to stimulate two to five times larger volumes in the brain (p<0.0001, t=6.71). The rate of decay of electric field with distance is significantly slower for the H7 coil (p < 0.0001, Wilcoxon matched-pairs test). The field at the scalp is 306% of the field at a 3 cm depth with the D-B80, and 155% with the H7 coil. The H7 induces significantly higher intensities in broader volumes within the brain and in specific brain regions known to be implicated in OCD (dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA)) compared to the D-B80.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Comparable human spatial memory distortions in physical, desktop virtual and immersive virtual environments</a></h4>

              
                Boundaries define regions of space and are integral to episodic memories. The impact of boundaries on spatial memory and neural representations of space has been extensively studied in freely-moving rodents. But less is known in humans and many prior studies have employed desktop virtual reality (VR) which lacks the body-based self-motion cues of the physical world, diminishing the potentially strong input from path integration to spatial memory. We replicated a desktop-VR study testing the impact of boundaries on spatial memory (Hartley et al., 2004) in a physical room (2.4m x 2.4m, 2m tall) by having participants (N = 27) learn the location of a circular stool and then after a short delay replace it where they thought they had found it. During the delay, the wall boundaries were either expanded or contracted. We compared performance to groups of participants undergoing the same procedure in a laser-scanned replica in both desktop VR (N = 44) and freely-walking head mounted display (HMD) VR (N = 39) environments. Performance was measured as goodness of fit between the spatial distributions of group responses and seven modelled distributions that prioritised different metrics based on boundary geometry or walking paths to estimate the stool location. The best fitting model was a weighted linear combination of all the geometric spatial models, but an individual model derived from place cell firing in Hartley et al. 2004 also fit well. High levels of disorientation in all three environments prevented detailed analysis on the contribution of path integration. We found identical model fits across the three environments, though desktop VR and HMD-VR appeared more consistent in spatial distributions of group responses than the physical environment and displayed known variations in virtual depth perception. Thus, while human spatial representation appears differentially influenced by environmental boundaries, the influence is similar across virtual and physical environments. Despite differences in body-based cue availability, desktop and HMD-VR allow a good and interchangeable approximation for examining human spatial memory in small-scale physical environments.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Role of Yap1 in adult neural stem cell activation</a></h4>

              
                Most adult hippocampal neural stem cells (NSCs) remain quiescent with only a minor portion undergoing active proliferation and neurogenesis. The molecular mechanisms that trigger eventually the transition from quiescence to activation are still poorly understood. Here, we found the activity of the transcriptional activator Yap1 to be enriched in active NSCs. Genetic deletion of Yap1 led to a significant reduction in the relative proportion of active NSCs supporting a physiological role of Yap1 in regulating the transition from quiescence to activation. Overexpression of wild type Yap1 in adult NSCs did not induce NSC activation suggesting tight upstream control mechanisms, but overexpression of a gain-of-function mutant (Yap1-5SA) elicited cell cycle entry in NSCs and hilar astrocytes. Consistent with a role of Yap1 in NSC activation, single cell RNA sequencing revealed the partial induction of an activated NSC gene expression program. Yet, Yap1-5SA expression also induced Taz and other key components of the Yap/Taz regulon previously identified in glioblastoma stem cell-like cells. Consequently, dysregulated Yap1 activity led to repression of hippocampal neurogenesis, promoting aberrant differentiation instead.

                Viral tracers that permit efficient retrograde targeting of projection neurons are powerful vehicles for structural and functional dissections of the neural circuit and for the treatment of brain diseases. Recombinant adeno-associated viruses (rAAVs) are the most potential candidates because they are low-toxic with high-level transgene expression and minimal host immune responses. Currently, some rAAVs based on capsid engineering for retrograde tracing have been widely used in the analysis and manipulation of neural circuits, but suffer from brain area selectivity and inefficient retrograde transduction in certain neural connections. Here, we discovered that the recombinant adeno-associated virus 11 (rAAV11) exhibits potent retrograde labeling of projection neurons with enhanced efficiency to rAAV2-retro in some neural connections. Combined with calcium recording technology, rAAV11 can be used to monitor neuronal activities by expressing Cre recombinase or calcium-sensitive functional probe. In addition, we further showed the suitability of rAAV11 for astrocyte targeting. These properties make rAAV11 a promising tool for the mapping and manipulation of neural circuits and gene therapy of some neurological and neurodegenerative disorders.

                Loss-of-function GRN mutations result in progranulin haploinsufficiency and are a common cause of frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) are emerging as a promising therapeutic modality for neurological diseases, but ASO-based strategies for increasing target protein levels are still relatively limited. Here, we report the use of ASOs to increase progranulin protein levels by targeting the miR-29b binding site in the 3' UTR of the GRN mRNA, resulting in increased translation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A Precision Functional Atlas of Network Probabilities and Individual-Specific Network Topography</a></h4>

              
                The brain is organized into a broad set of functional neural networks. These networks and their various characteristics have been described and scrutinized through in vivo resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). While the basic properties of networks are generally similar between healthy individuals, there is vast variability in the precise topography across the population. These individual differences are often lost in population studies due to population averaging which assumes topographical uniformity. We leveraged precision brain mapping methods to establish a new open-source, method-flexible set of probabilistic functional network atlases: the Masonic Institute for the Developing Brain (MIDB) Precision Atlas. Using participants from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study, single subject precision maps were generated with two supervised network-matching procedures (template matching and non-negative matrix factorization), as well as an unsupervised community detection algorithm (Infomap). We demonstrate that probabilistic network maps generated for two demographically-matched groups of n~3000 each were nearly identical, both between groups (Pearson r >0.999) and between methods (r=0.96), revealing both regions of high invariance and high variability. Compared to using parcellations based on groups averages, the MIDB Precision Atlases allowed us to derive a set of brain regions that are largely invariant in network topography and provide more reproducible statistical maps of executive function brain-wide associations. We explore an example use case for probabilistic maps, highlighting their potential for use in targeted neuromodulation. The MIDB Precision Atlas is expandable to alternative datasets and methods and is provided open-source with an online web interface to encourage the scientific community to experiment with probabilistic atlases and individual-specific topographies to more precisely relate network phenomenon to functional organization of the human brain.

                Vision plays a crucial role in instructing the brain's spatial navigation systems. However, little is known about how vision loss affects the neuronal encoding of spatial information. Here, recording from head direction (HD) cells in the anterior dorsal nucleus of the thalamus in mice, we find stable and robust HD tuning in blind animals. In contrast, placing sighted animals in darkness significantly impairs HD cell tuning. We find that blind mice use olfactory cues to maintain stable HD tuning and that prior visual experience leads to refined HD cell tuning in blind adult mice compared to congenitally blind animals. Finally, in the absence of both visual and olfactory cues, the HD attractor network remains intact but the preferred firing direction of HD cells continuously drifts over time. We thus demonstrate remarkable flexibility in how the brain uses diverse sensory information to generate a stable directional representation of space.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Enhanced food motivation in obese mice is controlled by D1R expressing spiny projection neurons in the nucleus accumbens.</a></h4>

              
                Obesity is a chronic relapsing disorder that is caused by an excess of caloric intake relative to energy expenditure. In addition to homeostatic feeding mechanisms, there is growing recognition of the involvement of food reward and motivation in the development of obesity. However, it remains unclear how brain circuits that control food reward and motivation are altered in obese animals. Here, we tested the hypothesis that signaling through pro-motivational circuits in the core of the nucleus accumbens (NAc) is enhanced in the obese state, leading to invigoration of food seeking. Using a novel behavioral assay that quantifies physical work during food seeking, we confirmed that obese mice work harder than lean mice to obtain food, consistent with an increase in the relative reinforcing value of food in the obese state. To explain this behavioral finding, we recorded neural activity in the NAc core with both in vivo electrophysiology and cell-type specific calcium fiber photometry. Here we observed greater activation of D1-receptor expressing NAc spiny projection neurons (NAc D1SPNs) during food seeking in obese mice relative to lean mice. With ex vivo slice physiology we identified both pre- and post-synaptic mechanisms that contribute to this enhancement in NAc D1SPN activity in obese mice. Finally, blocking synaptic transmission from D1SPNs decreased physical work during food seeking and attenuated high-fat diet-induced weight gain. These experiments demonstrate that obesity is associated with a selective increase in the activity of D1SPNs during food seeking, which enhances the vigor of food seeking. This work also establishes the necessity of D1SPNs in the development of diet-induced obesity, identifying a novel potential therapeutic target.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Parent-Child Autonomic Synchrony During Vicarious Extinction Learning in Pediatric PTSD</a></h4>

              
                Children must learn basic functional processes directly from their caregivers and child psychopathology may disrupt this transmission. This transmission may be seen through biological measures like peripheral nervous system outputs like skin conductance (SCR). Fear learning deficits have been seen in affective disorders like PTSD and are useful for studying parent-child learning transmission. Our study uses a vicarious fear extinction paradigm to study if biological synchrony (SCR and heart rate variability (HRV)) are potential mechanisms in which children learn safety cues from their parents. There were 16 dyads (PTSD n=11, TD n=5) undergoing a vicarious fear extinction paradigm. We used cross-recurrence quantification analysis (CRQA) to assess SCR and HRV synchrony between parent-child dyads. We then used a linear model looking at group differences between PTSD dyads and typically developing (TD) dyads. For SCR, we saw a significant group difference (p=.037) indicating that TD dyads had higher SCR synchrony compared to PTSD dyads. For HRV, there were no group differences between PTSD and TD dyads (p=.325). These results suggest that SCR synchrony, but not HRV, may be a potential mechanism that allows for fear and safety learning in youth. While this is preliminary, it may give the first insights on how therapies such as Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy critically rely on parental coaching to model appropriate fear responses to help their child to recover from trauma.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Exogenous capture accounts for fundamental differences between prosaccade and antisaccade performance</a></h4>

              
                Oculomotor circuits generate eye movements based on the physical salience of objects and current behavioral goals, exogenous and endogenous influences, respectively. However, the interactions between exogenous and endogenous mechanisms and their dynamic contributions to target selection have been difficult to resolve because they evolve extremely rapidly. In a recent study (Salinas et al., 2019), we achieved the necessary temporal precision using an urgent variant of the antisaccade task wherein motor plans are initiated early and choice accuracy depends sharply on when exactly the visual cue information becomes available. Empirical and modeling results indicated that the exogenous signal arrives ~80 ms after cue onset and rapidly accelerates the (incorrect) plan toward the cue, whereas the informed endogenous signal arrives ~25 ms later to favor the (correct) plan away from the cue. Here, we scrutinize a key mechanistic hypothesis about this dynamic, that the exogenous and endogenous signals act at different times and independently of each other. We test quantitative model predictions by comparing the performance of human participants instructed to look toward a visual cue versus away from it under high urgency. We find that, indeed, the exogenous response is largely impervious to task instructions; it simply flips its sign relative to the correct choice, and this largely explains the drastic differences in psychometric performance between the two tasks. Thus, saccadic choices are strongly dictated by the alignment between salience and behavioral goals.

                Among the features of cisplatin chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy are chronic pain and innocuous mechanical hypersensitivity. The complete etiology of the latter remains unknown. Here, we show that cisplatin targets a heterogeneous population of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive (TH+) primary afferent dorsal root ganglion neurons (DRGNs) within the primary afferent dorsal root ganglia in mice, determined using single-cell transcriptome and electrophysiological analyses. TH+ DRGNs regulate innocuous mechanical sensation through C-low threshold mechanoreceptors. A differential assessment of wild-type and vitamin E deficient TH+ DRGNs revealed heterogeneity and specific functional phenotypes. The TH+ DRGNs comprise; fast-adapting eliciting one action potential (AP; 1-AP), moderately-adapting (>=2-APs), in responses to square-pulse current injection, and spontaneously firing (SF). Cisplatin increased the input resistance and AP frequency but reduced the temporal coding feature of 1-AP and >= 2-APs neurons. By contrast, cisplatin has no measurable effect on the SF neurons. Vitamin E reduced the cisplatin-mediated increased excitability, but did not improve the TH+ neuron temporal coding properties. Cisplatin mediates its effect by targeting outward K+ current, likely carried by through K2P18.1 (Kcnk18), discovered through the differential transcriptome studies and heterologous expression. Studies show a potential new cellular target for chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy and implicate the possible neuroprotective effects of vitamin E in cisplatin chemotherapy.

                In addition to its critical role in encoding individual episodes, the hippocampus is capable of extracting regularities across experiences. This ability is central to category learning, and a growing literature indicates that the hippocampus indeed makes important contributions to this kind of learning. Using a neural network model that mirrors the anatomy of the hippocampus, we investigated the mechanisms by which the hippocampus may support novel category learning. We simulated three category learning paradigms and evaluated the network's ability to categorize and to recognize specific exemplars in each. We found that the trisynaptic pathway within the hippocampus-connecting entorhinal cortex to dentate gyrus, CA3, and CA1-was critical for remembering individual exemplars, reflecting the rapid binding and pattern separation functions of this circuit. The monosynaptic pathway from entorhinal cortex to CA1, in contrast, was responsible for detecting the regularities that define category structure, made possible by the use of distributed representations and a slower learning rate. Together, the simulations provide an account of how the hippocampus and its constituent pathways support novel category learning.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A whole-cell recording database of neuromodulatory action in the adult neocortex</a></h4>

              
                Background: The recent release of two large intracellular electrophysiological databases now allows high-dimensional systematic analysis of mechanisms of information processing in the neocortex. Here, to complement these efforts, we introduce a freely and publicly available database that provides a comparative insight into the role of various neuromodulatory transmitters in controlling neural information processing. Findings: A database of in vitro whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from primary somatosensory and motor cortices (layers 2/3) of the adult mice (2-15 months old) from both sexes is introduced. A total of 464 current-clamp experiments from identified excitatory and inhibitory neurons are provided. Experiments include recordings with (i) Step-and-Hold protocol during which the current was transiently held at 10 steps, gradually increasing in amplitude, (ii) 'Frozen Noise' injections that model the amplitude and time-varying nature of synaptic inputs to a neuron in biological networks. All experiments follow a within neuron across drug design which includes a vehicle control and a modulation of one of the following targets in the same neuron: dopamine and its receptors D1R, D2R, serotonin 5HT1f receptor, norepinephrine Alpha1, and acetylcholine M1 receptors. Conclusions: This dataset is the first to provide a systematic and comparative insight into the role of the selected neuromodulators in controlling cellular excitability. The data will help to mechanistically address how bottom-up information processing can be modulated, providing a reference for studying neural coding characteristics and revealing the contribution of neuromodulation to information processing.

                Background: Cortical neuron loss is a pathological hallmark of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, it remains unclear which neuronal subtypes are most vulnerable to degeneration and contribute most to cognitive decline. Methods: We analyzed postmortem bulk brain RNA-sequencing (RNAseq) data collected from three studies of aging and AD comprising six neocortical regions (704 individuals; 1037 samples). We estimated relative cell type proportions from each brain sample using neuronal subclass-specific marker genes derived from ultra-high depth single-nucleus RNAseq data (snRNAseq). We associated cell type proportions with AD across all samples using mixed-effects mega-analyses. Bulk tissue analyses were complemented by analyses of three AD snRNAseq datasets using the same cell type definitions and diagnostic criteria (51 individuals). Lastly, we identified cell subtype associations with specific neuropathologies, cognitive decline, and residual cognition. Results: In our mega-analyses, we identified the strongest associations of AD with fewer somatostatin (SST) inhibitory neurons ({beta}=-0.48, pbonf=8.98x10-9) and intra-telencephalic (IT) excitatory neurons ({beta}=-0.45, pbonf =4.32x10-7). snRNAseq-based cell type proportion analyses especially supported the association of SST neurons. Analyses of cell type proportions with specific AD-related phenotypes in ROS/MAP consistently implicated fewer SST neurons with greater brain-wide postmortem tau and beta amyloid ({beta}=-0.155, pFDR=3.1x10-4) deposition, as well as more severe cognitive decline prior to death ({beta}=0.309, pFDR=3.9x10-6). Greater IT neuron proportions were associated strongly with improved cognition ({beta}=0.173, pFDR=8.3x10-5) and residual cognition ({beta}=0.175, pFDR=1.2x10-5), but not canonical AD neuropathology. Conclusions: Proportionally fewer SST and IT neurons were significantly associated with AD diagnosis across multiple studies and cortical regions. These findings support seminal work implicating somatostatin and pyramidal neurons in the pathogenesis of AD and improves our current understanding of neuronal vulnerability in AD.

                Methods to spatially profile the transcriptome are dominated by a trade-off between resolution and throughput. Here, we developed a method named EEL FISH that can rapidly process large tissue samples without compromising spatial resolution. By electrophoretically transferring RNA from a tissue section onto a capture surface, EEL speeds up data acquisition by reducing the amount of imaging needed, while ensuring that RNA molecules move straight down towards the surface, preserving single-cell resolution. We applied EEL on eight entire sagittal sections of the mouse brain and measured the expression patterns of up to 440 genes to reveal complex tissue organisation. Moreover, EEL enabled the study of challenging human samples by removing autofluorescent lipofuscin, so that we could study the spatial transcriptome of the human visual cortex. We provide full hardware specification, all protocols and complete software for instrument control, image processing, data analysis and visualization.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Theory for weakly polydisperse cytoskeleton filaments</a></h4>

              
                The ability of actins and tubulins to change dynamically from alterations in the number density of actins/tubulin, number density and type of binding agents, and electrolyte concentration is crucial for eukaryotic cells to regulate their cytoskeleton conformations in different cellular compartments. Conventional approaches on biopolymers solution break down for cytoskeleton filaments because they entail several approximations to treat their polyelectrolyte and mechanical properties. In this article, we introduce a novel density functional theory for polydisperse, semiflexible cytoskeleton filaments. The approach accounts for the equilibrium polymerization kinetics, length, and orientation filament distributions, as well as the electrostatic interaction between filaments and the electrolyte. This is essential for cytoskeleton polymerization in different cell compartments generating filaments of different lengths, sometimes long enough to become semiflexible. We characterized the thermodynamics properties of actin filaments in electrolyte aqueous solutions. We calculated the free energy, pressure, chemical potential, and second virial coefficient for each filament conformation. We also calculated the phase diagram of actin filaments solution and compared it with available experimental data.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Accounting for motion in fMRI: What part of the spectrum are we characterizing in autism spectrum disorder?</a></h4>

              
                The exclusion of high-motion participants can reduce the impact of motion in functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data. However, the exclusion of high-motion participants may change the distribution of clinically relevant variables in the study sample, and the resulting sample may not be representative of the population. Our goals are two-fold: 1) to document the biases introduced by common motion exclusion practices in functional connectivity research and 2) to introduce a framework to address these biases by treating excluded scans as a missing data problem. We use a study of autism spectrum disorder to illustrate the problem and the potential solution. We aggregated data from 545 children (8-13 years old) who participated in resting-state fMRI studies at Kennedy Krieger Institute (173 autistic and 372 typically developing) between 2007 and 2020. We found that autistic children were more likely to be excluded than typically developing children, with 29.1% and 16.1% of autistic and typically developing children excluded, respectively, using a lenient criterion and 80.8% and 59.8% with a stricter criterion. The resulting sample of autistic children with usable data tended to be older, have milder social deficits, better motor control, and higher intellectual ability than the original sample. These measures were also related to functional connectivity strength among children with usable data. This suggests that the generalizability of previous studies reporting naive analyses (i.e., based only on participants with usable data) may be limited by the selection of older children with less severe clinical profiles because these children are better able to remain still during an rs-fMRI scan. We adapt doubly robust targeted minimum loss based estimation with an ensemble of machine learning algorithms to address these data losses and the resulting biases. The proposed approach selects more edges that differ in functional connectivity between autistic and typically developing children than the naive approach, supporting this as a promising solution to improve the study of heterogeneous populations in which motion is common.

                Cyclin Dependent Kinase family members include members of the non-cell cycle CDK, such as PFTK1/Eip63E. Eip63E expresses primarily in postnatal and adult nervous system in Drosophila melanogaster but its role in CNS development remains unknown. We sought to understand its role in the CNS by studying the fly ventral nerve cord during development. Eip63E regulates axogenesis in neurons and its deficiency leads to neuronal defects. We describe a functional interaction between Eip63E and Rho1. Studies in cultured cortical neurons from PFTK1 knockout mice, confirmed that PFTK1 plays a role in axonal outgrowth and its deficiency resulted in faster growing axons. We demonstrate that GDP bound RhoA is a substrate of PFTK1 and this phosphorylation resulted in higher activity of RhoA. In conclusion, our work represents the first steps in the characterization of the neuronal functions of PFTK1 and points to RhoA activation in the regulation of PFTK1 mediated axogenesis.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Multimodal cues displayed by submissive rats promote prosocial choices by dominants</a></h4>

              
                Animals often display prosocial behaviours, performing actions that benefit others. Although prosociality is essential for social bonding and cooperation, we still know very little about how animals integrate behavioural cues from those in need to make decisions that increase their wellbeing. To address this question, we used a two-choice task where rats can provide rewards to a conspecific in the absence of self-benefit, and interrogated which conditions promote prosociality by manipulating the social context of the interacting animals. While sex or degree of familiarity did not affect prosocial choices in rats, social hierarchy revealed to be a potent modulator, with dominant decision-makers showing faster emergence and higher levels of prosocial choices towards their submissive cage-mates. Leveraging quantitative analysis of multimodal social dynamics prior to choice, we identified that pairs with dominant decision-makers exhibited more proximal interactions in social distance. Interestingly, these more coordinated interactions were driven by submissive animals that modulated their position and movement towards their dominants and increased 50kHz vocalisation rate when their partners were going to behave selfishly. This display of multimodal cues by submissive animals while signalling need promoted social saliency and a faster emergence of prosocial choices from dominant rats. Multivariate analysis highlighted non-canonical body language as the main information dominants use on a trial-by-trial basis to learn that their actions have effects on others. Our results provide a refined understanding of the behavioural dynamics that rats use for action-selection upon perception of socially relevant cues and navigate social decision-making.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Involvement of prelimbic cortex neurons and related circuits in the acquisition of cooperative learning by pairs of rats</a></h4>

              
                Social behaviors such as cooperation are crucial for mammals. A deeper knowledge of the neuronal mechanisms underlying cooperation can be beneficial for people suffering from pathologies with impaired social behavior. Our aim was to study the brain activity when two animals synchronize their behavior to obtain a mutual reinforcement. In a previous work, we showed that the activity of the prelimbic cortex (PrL) was enhanced during cooperation in rats, especially in the ones leading most cooperative trials (leader rats). In this study, we investigated the specific cell type/s in the PrL contributing to cooperative behaviors. To this end, we collected rats' brains at key moments of the learning process to analyze the levels of c-FOS expression in the main cellular groups of the PrL (glutamatergic cells containing D1 and D2 receptors and interneurons). Leader rats showed increased c-FOS activity in cells expressing D1 receptors during cooperation. In addition, we analyzed the levels of anxiety, dominance, and locomotor behavior, finding that leader rats are in general less anxious and less dominant than followers. We also recorded local field potentials (LFPs) from the PrL, the nucleus accumbens septi (NAc), and the basolateral amygdala (BLA). Spectral analysis showed that delta activity in PrL and NAc increased when rats cooperated, while BLA activity in delta and theta bands decreased considerably during cooperation. The PrL and NAc also increased their connectivity in the high theta band during cooperation. Thus, the present work identifies the specific PrL cell types engaged in this behavior, as well as its connectivity with subcortical brain regions (BLA, NAc) during cooperation.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Neuroscience lacks a diverse repertoire of model organisms, resulting in an incomplete understanding of the general principles of neural function. Ctenophores display many neurobiological and experimental features which make them a promising candidate to fill this gap. They possess a nerve net distributed across their body surface in the epithelial layer. There is a long-held assumption that nerve nets are “simple” and lack distinct organizational principles. We want to challenge this assumption and determine how stereotyped the structure of this network is. We estimated body surface area in <i>Pleurobrachia pileus</i> using custom optical projection tomography and light sheet morphometry imaging systems. Using an antibody against tyrosinated α-tubulin, we visualized the nerve net in situ and quantified the geometric properties using an automated segmentation approach. We characterized organizational rules of the epithelial nerve net in animals of different sizes and at different regions of the body. We found that specific morphological features within the nerve net are largely unchanged during growth. These properties must be essential to the functionality of the nervous system and therefore are maintained during a change in body size. We have also established the principles of organization of the network and showed that some of the geometric properties are variable across different parts of the body. This suggests that there may be different functions occurring in regions with different structural characteristics. This is the most comprehensive structural description of a ctenophore nerve net to date and demonstrates the amenability of <i>P. pileus</i> for whole organism network analysis.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Repeated Administration of 2-Hydroxypropyl-{beta}-Cyclodextrin (HP{beta}CD) Attenuates the Chronic Inflammatory Response to Experimental Stroke</a></h4>

              
                <p>Globally, more than 67 million people are living with the effects of ischemic stroke. Importantly, many stroke survivors develop a chronic inflammatory response that may contribute to cognitive impairment, a common and debilitating sequela of stroke that is insufficiently studied and currently untreatable. 2-Hydroxypropyl-&beta;-cyclodextrin (HP&beta;CD) is an FDA-approved cyclic oligosaccharide that can solubilize and entrap lipophilic substances. The goal of the present study was to determine whether the repeated administration of HP&beta;CD curtails the chronic inflammatory response to stroke by reducing lipid accumulation within stroke infarcts in a distal middle cerebral artery occlusion mouse model of stroke. To achieve this goal, we subcutaneously injected young adult and aged male mice with vehicle or HP&beta;CD 3 times per week, with treatment beginning 1 week after stroke. We evaluated mice at 7 weeks following stroke using immunostaining, RNA sequencing, lipidomic, and behavioral analyses. Chronic stroke infarct and peri-infarct regions of HP&beta;CD-treated mice were characterized by an upregulation of genes involved in lipid metabolism and a downregulation of genes involved in innate and adaptive immunity, reactive astrogliosis, and chemotaxis. Correspondingly, HP&beta;CD reduced the accumulation of lipid droplets, T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, and plasma cells in stroke infarcts. Repeated administration of HP&beta;CD also preserved NeuN immunoreactivity in the striatum and thalamus and c-Fos immunoreactivity in hippocampal regions. Additionally, HP&beta;CD improved recovery through the protection of hippocampal-dependent spatial working memory and reduction of impulsivity. These results indicate that systemic HP&beta;CD treatment following stroke attenuates chronic inflammation and secondary neurodegeneration and prevents poststroke cognitive decline.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Dementia is a common and debilitating sequela of stroke. Currently, there are no available treatments for poststroke dementia. Our study shows that lipid metabolism is disrupted in chronic stroke infarcts, which causes an accumulation of uncleared lipid debris and correlates with a chronic inflammatory response. To our knowledge, these substantial changes in lipid homeostasis have not been previously recognized or investigated in the context of ischemic stroke. We also provide a proof of principle that solubilizing and entrapping lipophilic substances using HP&beta;CD could be an effective strategy for treating chronic inflammation after stroke and other CNS injuries. We propose that using HP&beta;CD for the prevention of poststroke dementia could improve recovery and increase long-term quality of life in stroke sufferers.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Stopping Interference in Response Inhibition: Behavioral and Neural Signatures of Selective Stopping</a></h4>

              
                <p>Response inhibition is an essential aspect of cognitive control that is necessary for terminating inappropriate preplanned or ongoing responses. Response-selective stopping represents a complex form of response inhibition where only a subcomponent of a multicomponent action must be terminated. In this context, a substantial response delay emerges on unstopped effectors after the cued effector is successfully stopped. This response delay has been termed the stopping interference effect. Converging lines of evidence indicate that this effect results from a global response inhibition mechanism that is recruited regardless of the stopping context. However, behavioral observations reveal that the stopping interference effect may not always occur during selective stopping. This review summarizes the behavioral and neural signatures of response inhibition during selective stopping. An overview of selective stopping contexts and the stopping interference effect is provided. A "restart" model of selective stopping is expanded on in light of recent neurophysiological evidence of selective and nonselective response inhibition. Factors beyond overt action cancellation that contribute to the stopping interference effect are discussed. Finally, a pause-then-cancel model of action stopping is presented as a candidate framework to understand stopping interference during response-selective stopping. The extant literature indicates that stopping interference may result from both selective and nonselective response inhibition processes, which can be amplified or attenuated by response conflict, task familiarity, and functional coupling.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Gephyrin Interacts with the K-Cl Cotransporter KCC2 to Regulate Its Surface Expression and Function in Cortical Neurons</a></h4>

              
                <p>The K<sup>+</sup>-Cl<sup>&ndash;</sup> cotransporter KCC2, encoded by the <I>Slc12a5</I> gene, is a neuron-specific chloride extruder that tunes the strength and polarity of GABA<SUB>A</SUB> receptor-mediated transmission. In addition to its canonical ion transport function, KCC2 also regulates spinogenesis and excitatory synaptic function through interaction with a variety of molecular partners. KCC2 is enriched in the vicinity of both glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses, the activity of which in turn regulates its membrane stability and function. KCC2 interaction with the submembrane actin cytoskeleton via 4.1N is known to control its anchoring near glutamatergic synapses on dendritic spines. However, the molecular determinants of KCC2 clustering near GABAergic synapses remain unknown. Here, we used proteomics to identify novel KCC2 interacting proteins in the adult rat neocortex. We identified both known and novel candidate KCC2 partners, including some involved in neuronal development and synaptic transmission. These include gephyrin, the main scaffolding molecule at GABAergic synapses. Gephyrin interaction with endogenous KCC2 was confirmed by immunoprecipitation from rat neocortical extracts. We showed that gephyrin stabilizes plasmalemmal KCC2 and promotes its clustering in hippocampal neurons, mostly but not exclusively near GABAergic synapses, thereby controlling KCC2-mediated chloride extrusion. This study identifies gephyrin as a novel KCC2 anchoring molecule that regulates its membrane expression and function in cortical neurons.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Fast synaptic inhibition in the brain is mediated by chloride-permeable GABA<SUB>A</SUB> receptors (GABA<SUB>A</SUB>Rs) and therefore relies on transmembrane chloride gradients. In neurons, these gradients are primarily maintained by the K/Cl cotransporter KCC2. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms controlling KCC2 expression and function is crucial to understand its physiological regulation and rescue its function in the pathology. KCC2 function depends on its membrane expression and clustering, but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. We describe the interaction between KCC2 and gephyrin, the main scaffolding protein at inhibitory synapses. We show that gephyrin controls plasmalemmal KCC2 clustering and that loss of gephyrin compromises KCC2 function. Our data suggest functional units comprising GABA<SUB>A</SUB>Rs, gephyrin, and KCC2 act to regulate synaptic GABA signaling.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Gli1 Regulates the Postnatal Acquisition of Peripheral Nerve Architecture</a></h4>

              
                <p>Peripheral nerves are organized into discrete compartments. Axons, Schwann cells (SCs), and endoneurial fibroblasts (EFs) reside within the endoneurium and are surrounded by the perineurium, a cellular sheath comprised of layers of perineurial glia (PNG). SC secretion of Desert Hedgehog (Dhh) regulates this organization. In Dhh nulls, the perineurium is deficient and the endoneurium is subdivided into small compartments termed minifascicles. Human Dhh mutations cause a neuropathy with similar defects. Here we examine the role of Gli1, a canonical transcriptional effector of hedgehog signaling, in regulating peripheral nerve organization in mice of both genders. We identify PNG, EFs, and pericytes as Gli1-expressing cells by genetic fate mapping. Although expression of Dhh by SCs and Gli1 in target cells is coordinately regulated with myelination, Gli1 expression unexpectedly persists in Dhh null EFs. Thus, Gli1 is expressed in EFs noncanonically (i.e., independent of hedgehog signaling). Gli1 and Dhh also have nonredundant activities. Unlike Dhh nulls, Gli1 nulls have a normal perineurium. Like Dhh nulls, Gli1 nulls form minifascicles, which we show likely arise from EFs. Thus, Dhh and Gli1 are independent signals: Gli1 is dispensable for perineurial development but functions cooperatively with Dhh to drive normal endoneurial development. During development, Gli1 also regulates endoneurial extracellular matrix production, nerve vascular organization, and has modest, nonautonomous effects on SC sorting and myelination of axons. Finally, in adult nerves, induced deletion of Gli1 is sufficient to drive minifascicle formation. Thus, Gli1 regulates the development and is required to maintain the endoneurial architecture of peripheral nerves.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Peripheral nerves are organized into distinct cellular/ECM compartments: the epineurium, perineurium, and endoneurium. This organization, with its associated cellular constituents, is critical for the structural and metabolic support of nerves and their response to injury. Here, we show that Gli1, a transcription factor normally expressed downstream of hedgehog signaling, is required for the proper organization of the endoneurium but not the perineurium. Unexpectedly, Gli1 expression by endoneurial cells is independent of, and functions nonredundantly with, Schwann Cell-derived Desert Hedgehog in regulating peripheral nerve architecture. These results further delineate how peripheral nerves acquire their distinctive organization during normal development, and highlight mechanisms that may regulate their reorganization in pathologic settings, including peripheral neuropathies and nerve injury.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Loss of RNA-Binding Protein HuR Leads to Defective Ependymal Cells and Hydrocephalus</a></h4>

              
                <p>Multiciliated ependymal cells line the ventricle wall and generate CSF flow through ciliary beating. Defects in ependymal cells cause hydrocephalus; however, there are still significant gaps in our understanding the molecular, cellular and developmental mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of hydrocephalus. Here, we demonstrate that specific deletion of RNA-binding protein (RBP) Hu antigen R (HuR) in the mouse brain results in hydrocephalus and causes postnatal death. HuR deficiency leads to impaired ependymal cell development with defective motile ciliogenesis in both female and male mice. Transcriptome-wide analysis reveals that HuR binds to mRNA transcripts related to ciliogenesis, including cilia and flagella associated protein 52 (<I>Cfap52</I>), the effector gene of Foxj-1 and Rfx transcriptional factors. HuR deficiency accelerates the degradation of <I>Cfap52</I> mRNA, while overexpression of Cfap52 is able to promote the development of HuR-deficient ependymal cells. Taken together, our results unravel the important role of HuR in posttranscriptional regulation of ependymal cell development by stabilizing <I>Cfap52</I> mRNA.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> This study identifies Hu antigen R (HuR) as a genetic factor involved in the pathogenesis of hydrocephalus. Mechanistically, HuR regulates ependymal cell differentiation and ciliogenesis through stabilizing <I>Cfap52</I> mRNA, the effector gene of Foxj-1 and Rfx transcriptional factors.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Cortical Control of Virtual Self-Motion Using Task-Specific Subspaces</a></h4>

              
                <p>Brain&ndash;machine interfaces (BMIs) for reaching have enjoyed continued performance improvements, yet there remains significant need for BMIs that control other movement classes. Recent scientific findings suggest that the intrinsic covariance structure of neural activity depends strongly on movement class, potentially necessitating different decode algorithms across classes. To address this possibility, we developed a self-motion BMI based on cortical activity as monkeys cycled a hand-held pedal to progress along a virtual track. Unlike during reaching, we found no high-variance dimensions that directly correlated with to-be-decoded variables. This was due to no neurons having consistent correlations between their responses and kinematic variables. Yet we could decode a single variable&mdash;self-motion&mdash;by nonlinearly leveraging structure that spanned multiple high-variance neural dimensions. Resulting online BMI-control success rates approached those during manual control. These findings make two broad points regarding how to build decode algorithms that harmonize with the empirical structure of neural activity in motor cortex. First, even when decoding from the same cortical region (e.g., arm-related motor cortex), different movement classes may need to employ very different strategies. Although correlations between neural activity and hand velocity are prominent during reaching tasks, they are not a fundamental property of motor cortex and cannot be counted on to be present in general. Second, although one generally desires a low-dimensional readout, it can be beneficial to leverage a multidimensional high-variance subspace. Fully embracing this approach requires highly nonlinear approaches tailored to the task at hand, but can produce near-native levels of performance.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Many brain&ndash;machine interface decoders have been constructed for controlling movements normally performed with the arm. Yet it is unclear how these will function beyond the reach-like scenarios where they were developed. Existing decoders implicitly assume that neural covariance structure, and correlations with to-be-decoded kinematic variables, will be largely preserved across tasks. We find that the correlation between neural activity and hand kinematics, a feature typically exploited when decoding reach-like movements, is essentially absent during another task performed with the arm: cycling through a virtual environment. Nevertheless, the use of a different strategy, one focused on leveraging the highest-variance neural signals, supported high performance real-time brain&ndash;machine interface control.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Speech Categorization Reveals the Role of Early-Stage Temporal-Coherence Processing in Auditory Scene Analysis</a></h4>

              
                <p>Temporal coherence of sound fluctuations across spectral channels is thought to aid auditory grouping and scene segregation. Although prior studies on the neural bases of temporal-coherence processing focused mostly on cortical contributions, neurophysiological evidence suggests that temporal-coherence-based scene analysis may start as early as the cochlear nucleus (i.e., the first auditory region supporting cross-channel processing over a wide frequency range). Accordingly, we hypothesized that aspects of temporal-coherence processing that could be realized in early auditory areas may shape speech understanding in noise. We then explored whether physiologically plausible computational models could account for results from a behavioral experiment that measured consonant categorization in different masking conditions. We tested whether within-channel masking of target-speech modulations predicted consonant confusions across the different conditions and whether predictions were improved by adding across-channel temporal-coherence processing mirroring the computations known to exist in the cochlear nucleus. Consonant confusions provide a rich characterization of error patterns in speech categorization, and are thus crucial for rigorously testing models of speech perception; however, to the best of our knowledge, they have not been used in prior studies of scene analysis. We find that within-channel modulation masking can reasonably account for category confusions, but that it fails when temporal fine structure cues are unavailable. However, the addition of across-channel temporal-coherence processing significantly improves confusion predictions across all tested conditions. Our results suggest that temporal-coherence processing strongly shapes speech understanding in noise and that physiological computations that exist early along the auditory pathway may contribute to this process.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Temporal coherence of sound fluctuations across distinct frequency channels is thought to be important for auditory scene analysis. Prior studies on the neural bases of temporal-coherence processing focused mostly on cortical contributions, and it was unknown whether speech understanding in noise may be shaped by across-channel processing that exists in earlier auditory areas. Using physiologically plausible computational modeling to predict consonant confusions across different listening conditions, we find that across-channel temporal coherence contributes significantly to scene analysis and speech perception and that such processing may arise in the auditory pathway as early as the brainstem. By virtue of providing a richer characterization of error patterns not obtainable with just intelligibility scores, consonant confusions yield unique insight into scene analysis mechanisms.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Hypocretin/Orexin Interactions with Norepinephrine Contribute to the Opiate Withdrawal Syndrome</a></h4>

              
                <p>We previously found that human heroin addicts and mice chronically exposed to morphine exhibit a significant increase in the number of detected hypocretin/orexin (Hcrt)-producing neurons. However, it remains unknown how this increase affects target areas of the hypocretin system involved in opioid withdrawal, including norepinephrine containing structures locus coeruleus (LC) and A1/A2 medullary regions. Using a combination of immunohistochemical, biochemical, imaging, and behavioral techniques, we now show that the increase in detected hypocretin cell number translates into a significant increase in hypocretin innervation and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) levels in the LC without affecting norepinephrine-containing neuronal cell number. We show that the increase in TH is completely dependent on Hcrt innervation. The A1/A2 regions were unaffected by morphine treatment. Manipulation of the Hcrt system may affect opioid addiction and withdrawal.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Previously, we have shown that the hypothalamic hypocretin system undergoes profound anatomic changes in human heroin addicts and in mice exposed to morphine, suggesting a role of this system in the development of addictive behaviors. The locus coeruleus plays a key role in opioid addiction. Here we report that the hypothalamic hypocretin innervation of the locus coeruleus increases dramatically with morphine administration to mice. This increase is correlated with a massive increase in tyrosine hydroxylase expression in locus coeruleus. Elimination of hypocretin neurons prevents the tyrosine hydroxylase increase in locus coeruleus and dampens the somatic and affective components of opioid withdrawal.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Aging Enhances Neural Activity in Auditory, Visual, and Somatosensory Cortices: The Common Cause Revisited</a></h4>

              
                <p>In humans, age-related declines in vision, hearing, and touch coincide with changes in amplitude and latency of sensory-evoked potentials. These age-related differences in neural activity may be related to a common deterioration of supra-modal brain areas (e.g., PFC) that mediate activity in sensory cortices or reflect specific sensorineural impairments that may differ between sensory modalities. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we measured neuroelectric brain activity while 37 young adults (18-30 years, 18 males) and 35 older adults (60-88 years, 20 males) were presented with a rapid randomized sequence of lateralized auditory, visual, and somatosensory stimuli. Within each sensory domain, we compared amplitudes and latencies of sensory-evoked responses, source activity, and functional connectivity (via phase-locking value) between groups. We found that older adults' early sensory-evoked responses were greater in amplitude than those of young adults in all three modalities, which coincided with enhanced source activity in auditory, visual, and somatosensory cortices. Older adults also showed stronger neural synchrony than young adults between superior prefrontal and sensory cortices; and in older adults, the degree of phase synchrony was positively correlated with the magnitude of source activity in sensory areas. Critically, older adults who showed enhanced neural activity in one sensory domain also showed enhanced activity in other modalities. Together, these findings support the common cause hypothesis of aging and highlight the role of prefrontal regions in exerting top-down control over sensory cortices.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> A prominent theory of aging posits that age-related declines in sensory processing across domains are related to a single common neurobiological mechanism. However, the neural evidence supporting this common cause hypothesis has remained elusive. Our study revealed robust age-related changes in three sensory domains across a range of neural metrics. Importantly, older adults who showed increased neural activity within one sensory domain also showed enhanced neural activity in the other two sensory modalities. No such relation among activity in sensory cortices was observed in young adults. Age-related increases in neural activity in sensory cortices coincided with enhanced neural synchrony between the PFC and sensory cortices, underlining the importance of the PFC in regulating sensory processing.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">A One-Shot Shift from Explore to Exploit in Monkey Prefrontal Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>Much animal learning is slow, with cumulative changes in behavior driven by reward prediction errors. When the abstract structure of a problem is known, however, both animals and formal learning models can rapidly attach new items to their roles within this structure, sometimes in a single trial. Frontal cortex is likely to play a key role in this process. To examine information seeking and use in a known problem structure, we trained monkeys in an explore/exploit task, requiring the animal first to test objects for their association with reward, then, once rewarded objects were found, to reselect them on further trials for further rewards. Many cells in the frontal cortex showed an explore/exploit preference aligned with one-shot learning in the monkeys' behavior: the population switched from an explore state to an exploit state after a single trial of learning but partially maintained the explore state if an error indicated that learning had failed. Binary switch from explore to exploit was not explained by continuous changes linked to expectancy or prediction error. Explore/exploit preferences were independent for two stages of the trial: object selection and receipt of feedback. Within an established task structure, frontal activity may control the separate processes of explore and exploit, switching in one trial between the two.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Much animal learning is slow, with cumulative changes in behavior driven by reward prediction errors. When the abstract structure a problem is known, however, both animals and formal learning models can rapidly attach new items to their roles within this structure. To address transitions in neural activity during one-shot learning, we trained monkeys in an explore/exploit task using familiar objects and a highly familiar task structure. When learning was rapid, many frontal neurons showed a binary, one-shot switch between explore and exploit. Within an established task structure, frontal activity may control the separate operations of exploring alternative objects to establish their current role, then exploiting this knowledge for further reward.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Microglial Correlates of Late Life Physical Activity: Relationship with Synaptic and Cognitive Aging in Older Adults</a></h4>

              
                <p>Physical activity relates to reduced dementia risk, but the cellular and molecular mechanisms are unknown. We translated animal and <I>in vitro</I> studies demonstrating a causal link between physical activity and microglial homeostasis into humans. Decedents from Rush Memory and Aging Project completed actigraphy monitoring (average daily activity) and cognitive evaluation in life, and neuropathological examination at autopsy. Brain tissue was analyzed for microglial activation via immunohistochemistry (anti-human HLA-DP-DQ-DR) and morphology (% Stage I, II, or III), and synaptic protein levels (SNAP-25, synaptophysin, complexin-I, VAMP, syntaxin, synaptotagmin-1). Proportion of morphologically activated microglia (PAM) was estimated in ventromedial caudate, posterior putamen, inferior temporal (IT), and middle frontal gyrus. The 167 decedents averaged 90 years at death, two-thirds were nondemented, and 60% evidenced pathologic Alzheimer's disease (AD). Adjusting for age, sex, education, and motor performances, greater physical activity associated with lower PAM in the ventromedial caudate and IT. Relationships between physical activity and PAM in the ventromedial caudate or IT were particularly prominent in adults evidencing microinfarcts or AD pathology, respectively. Mediational analyses indicated that PAM IT mediated ~30% of the relationships between (1) physical activity and synaptic protein in IT, and (2) physical activity and global cognition, in separate models. However, the size of the mediation depended on AD pathology ranging from &gt;40% in adults with high AD burden, but &lt;10% in adults with low AD burden. Lower microglial activation may be a pathway linking physical activity to age-related brain health in humans. Physical activity may promote AD-related synaptic and cognitive resilience through reduction of pro-inflammatory microglial states.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Physical activity relates to better cognitive aging and reduced risk of neurodegenerative disease, yet the cellular and molecular pathways linking behavior-to-brain in humans are unknown. Animal studies indicate that increasing physical activity leads to decreased microglial activation and corresponding increases in synaptogenesis and neurogenesis. We objectively monitored physical activity (accelerometer-based actigraphy) and cognitive performances in life, and quantified microglial activation and synaptic markers in brain tissue at death in older adults. These are the first data supporting microglial activation as a physiological pathway by which physical activity relates to brain heath in humans. Although more interventional work is needed, we suggest that physical activity may be a modifiable behavior leveraged to reduce pro-inflammatory microglial states in humans.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Predictive Representations in Hippocampal and Prefrontal Hierarchies</a></h4>

              
                <p>As we navigate the world, we use learned representations of relational structures to explore and to reach goals. Studies of how relational knowledge enables inference and planning are typically conducted in controlled small-scale settings. It remains unclear, however, how people use stored knowledge in continuously unfolding navigation (e.g., walking long distances in a city). We hypothesized that multiscale predictive representations guide naturalistic navigation in humans, and these scales are organized along posterior-anterior prefrontal and hippocampal hierarchies. We conducted model-based representational similarity analyses of neuroimaging data collected while male and female participants navigated realistically long paths in virtual reality. We tested the pattern similarity of each point, along each path, to a weighted sum of its successor points within predictive horizons of different scales. We found that anterior PFC showed the largest predictive horizons, posterior hippocampus the smallest, with the anterior hippocampus and orbitofrontal regions in between. Our findings offer novel insights into how cognitive maps support hierarchical planning at multiple scales.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Whenever we navigate the world, we represent our journey at multiple horizons: from our immediate surroundings to our distal goal. How are such cognitive maps at different horizons simultaneously represented in the brain? Here, we applied a reinforcement learning-based analysis to neuroimaging data acquired while participants virtually navigated their hometown. We investigated neural patterns in the hippocampus and PFC, key cognitive map regions. We uncovered predictive representations with multiscale horizons in prefrontal and hippocampal gradients, with the longest predictive horizons in anterior PFC and the shortest in posterior hippocampus. These findings provide empirical support for the computational hypothesis that multiscale neural representations guide goal-directed navigation. This advances our understanding of hierarchical planning in everyday navigation of realistic distances.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Distinct Roles for Prefrontal Dopamine D1 and D2 Neurons in Social Hierarchy</a></h4>

              
                <p>Neuronal activity in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) controls dominance hierarchies in groups of animals. Dopamine (DA) strongly modulates PFC activity mainly through D1 receptors (D1Rs) and D2 receptors (D2Rs). Still, it is unclear how these two subpopulations of DA receptor-expressing neurons in the PFC regulate social dominance hierarchy. Here, we demonstrate distinct roles for prefrontal D1R- and D2R-expressing neurons in establishing social hierarchy, with D1R<sup>+</sup> neurons determining dominance and D2R<sup>+</sup> neurons for subordinate. <I>Ex vivo</I> whole-cell recordings revealed that the dominant status of male mice correlates with rectifying AMPAR transmission and stronger excitatory synaptic strength onto D1R<sup>+</sup> neurons in PFC pyramidal neurons. In contrast, the submissive status is associated with higher neuronal excitability in D2R<sup>+</sup> neurons. Moreover, simultaneous manipulations of synaptic efficacy of D1R<sup>+</sup> neurons in dominant male mice and neuronal excitability of D2R<sup>+</sup> neurons of their male subordinates switch their dominant&ndash;subordinate relationship. These results reveal that prefrontal D1R<sup>+</sup> and D2R<sup>+</sup> neurons have distinct but synergistic functions in the dominance hierarchy, and DA-mediated regulation of synaptic strengths acts as a powerful behavioral determinant of intermale social rank.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Dominance hierarchy exists widely among animals who confront social conflict. Studies have indicated that social status largely relies on the neuronal activity in the PFC, but how dopamine influences social hierarchy via subpopulation of prefrontal neurons is still elusive. Here, we explore the cell type-specific role of dopamine receptor-expressing prefrontal neurons in the dominance&ndash;subordinate relationship. We found that the synaptic strength of D1 receptor-expressing neurons determines the dominant status, whereas hyperactive D2-expressing neurons are associated with the subordinate status. These findings highlight how social conflicts recruit distinct cortical microcircuits to drive different behaviors and reveal how D1- and D2-receptor enriched neurocircuits in the PFC establish a social hierarchy.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Insight into the cellular and circuit mechanisms underlying development of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) will provide a foundation for improved therapies. We studied a model in which an episode of prolonged seizures is followed by recovery lasting two weeks before emergence of spontaneous recurrent seizures. We focused on the interval between the prolonged seizures and the late onset recurrent seizures. We investigated the hippocampal mossy fiber CA3 pyramidal cell microcircuit in models spanning <I>in vitro</I>, <I>in vivo</I>, and <I>ex vivo</I> preparations. Expression of channelrhodopsin-2 in the dentate granule cells of <I>DGC ChR</I> mice enabled the selective activation of mossy fiber axons. <I>In vivo</I> studies revealed marked potentiation of mossy fiber evoked field potentials in hippocampal CA3 beginning within hours following seizures, a potentiation which persisted at least 7 d. Stimulation of mossy fibers in hippocampal slices <I>in vitro</I> using patterns of activity mimicking seizures induced LTP not only of the monosynaptic EPSC but also of the disynaptic IPSC of CA3 pyramidal cells. <I>Ex vivo</I> studies of slices isolated following seizures revealed evidence of LTP of mossy fiber evoked EPSC and disynaptic IPSC of CA3 pyramidal cells. We suggest that activation of dentate granule cells during seizures induces these plasticities <I>in vivo</I> and the retained balance of synaptic excitation and inhibition limits excessive activation of CA3 pyramidal cells, thereby protecting animals from spontaneous recurrent seizures at this interval following status epilepticus.</p>

                Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has transformed the world’s economy, health and education in a blink of an eye. Almost 1 billion learners have been affected across the globe. This has resulted in a paradigm shift to blended learning. Therefore, it was felt necessary to provide practical guidelines for the development of blended curriculum in medical education. It would help to overcome the challenges faced due to unprecedented transformation of medical education on account of pandemic. Methods: Guidelines based on personal experience of the authors and literature search were developed using the complex adapted blended learning system (CALBS) framework. Seven experts developed these guidelines using the nominal group technique. The consent form and literature for CABLS framework was shared with experts. The experts developed the guidelines independently during phase one of the technique. After a given time, phase 2 started with moderator mediated discussion about the individual guidelines developed by the experts. After discussion and mutual consensus four types of guideline ideas were developed. During the third phase the experts ranked the guideline ideas on a scale of 1 to 5. The guideline idea that ranked highest was selected as a final guideline for developing a blended learning curriculum. Results: The group consensus resulted in developing seven guidelines for a blended course or curriculum in medical education. These guidelines are based on a conceptual framework supplemented by expert’s own personal experience and current evidence from literature. Conclusions: These guidelines would provide a comprehensive and systematic approach to develop a blended learning curriculum in medical education.

                Background: Academic sabbaticals are seen as an important aspect of academic life and require considerable resources, however, little research has been done into how they are used and whether their effects can be measured. We explored these issues at the University of Cambridge. Methods: A mixed method approach including 24 interviews with academics, eight interviews with administrators; alongside analysis of administrative and publication data between 2010 and 2019. Results: Academics underline the importance of sabbaticals in providing uninterrupted time for research that is used to think, explore new ideas, master new techniques, develop new collaborations, draw together previous work, set work in a wider context, and provide personal discretion in research direction. They also highlight sabbaticals’ contributions in allowing the beneficial effects of combining teaching and research, while mitigating some of the disadvantages. However, it is difficult to detect the effect of sabbaticals on publications using a time series approach. Conclusions: Sabbaticals provide manifold contributions to academic research at the University of Cambridge; however, detecting and quantifying this contribution, and extending these findings requires wider and more detailed investigation.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Factors Associated with Knowledge and Awareness of Stroke Among the Jordanian Population: A Cross-Sectional Study [version 2; peer review: 3 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background and objective: Stroke is the second leading cause of death in Jordan and over the world. Knowledge and awareness towards stroke play a crucial role in the management and prevention of its complications. This study aims to assess the knowledge and awareness about stroke among the Jordanian population and determine factors associated with stroke awareness. Methods: This cross-sectional study through a web-based anonymous questionnaire that needed 10 minutes to be completed. It examined sociodemographic characteristics and recognition of the risk factors, warning signs, stroke consequences, and early response to stroke symptoms. Logistic regression analysis identified the factors associated with poor knowledge of stroke.  Results: A total of 573 Jordanian adults participated in this study. The participant's ability to identify at least one early symptom of stroke and the proper response to the symptoms were significantly correlated with the educational level (OR of 3.4 and 2.5, respectively). At least one consequence of stroke was significantly associated with different demographic factors such as gender, socioeconomic income, females versus males and those with medium income versus low income had significantly higher odds (OR of 6.6 and 4.1, respectively). Conclusion: This study revealed a good knowledge and awareness level about stroke among Jordanians correlated mainly with their educational level. Therefore, new strategies should be considered to decrease the prevalence of stroke in Jordan, including the need for engagement in enhanced awareness campaigns.

                Thermal injuries in young children involving the buttocks, perineum, and lower limbs raise suspicion of child abuse. Determining the manner of death and ruling out homicide in a fatal case of scalding remains a challenge for forensic practitioners. One such issue is reported in the present case report, where a medicolegal evaluation of a fatal scald in a two-year-old girl child is discussed. Young children sustaining serious injuries from scalds is a grave social concern. Such young lives need to be protected from scald injuries whether accidental or purposeful. Differences in injury patterns on the basis of their distribution and their characteristics are important to determine manner of death in such cases.

                Invasive fungal diseases due to resistant yeasts and molds are an important and increasing public health threat, likely due to a growing population of immunosuppressed hosts, increases in antifungal resistance, and improvements in laboratory diagnostics.  The significant morbidity and mortality associated with these pathogens bespeaks the urgent need for novel safe and effective therapeutics.  This review highlights promising investigational antifungal agents in clinical phases of development: fosmanogepix, ibrexafungerp, rezafungin, encochleated amphotericin B, oteseconazole (VT-1161), VT-1598, PC945, and olorofim.  We discuss three first-in-class members of three novel antifungal classes, as well as new agents within existing antifungal classes with improved safety and tolerability profiles due to enhanced pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Sub-chronic effects of Baccharis dracunculifolia treatment on biochemical, oxidative, and histopathological parameters in diabetic rats [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Oxidative stress and the mild inflammatory process present in diabetes play a critical role in the pathogenesis of the disease and its comorbidities. This understanding has opened new avenues and targets for developing improved treatments since the risk factors associated with diabetes may be reduced through non-pharmacological interventions. In this sense, plant extracts could be efficient in preventing or assisting these pathological conditions treatment. Methods: Diabetes mellitus was induced in 24 rats, which were allocated in 4 groups: Control (CT), Control+Baccharis (CT-B), Diabetes (DB), and Diabetes+Baccharis (DB-B). For 28 days, the animals of CT-B and DB-B groups were treated, via gavage, with B. dracunculifolia extract at 50 mg.kg-1. Results: The DB group presented higher values than the DB-B group on parameters such as creatinine (26.42%), urea (31.42%), and triglycerides (60.80%). Creatinine and triglycerides values of DB-B group (0.39±0.01 e 75.0±8.4, receptively) were equivalent to the values of CT group (0.32±0.01 e 71.7±5.4) and of CT-B group (0.39±0.01, and 58.8±4.5). The treatment with B. dracunculifolia improved the levels of fasting glucose and response of glucose tolerance (32%), insulin (52,17%) and lipid peroxidation (liver 33.33%, kidney 38.77%) when compared to the DB group. Conclusions: The phenolic compounds and the anti-inflammatory activity of the extract of Baccharis dracunculifolia may be responsible for the hypoglycemic effect observed in the study.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Hybrid simulation modelling of networks of heterogeneous care homes and the inter-facility spread of Covid-19 by sharing staff</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Le Khanh Ngan Nguyen, Itamar Megiddo, Susan Howick</p>

Although system dynamics [SD] and agent-based modelling [ABM] have individually served as effective tools to understand the Covid-19 dynamics, combining these methods in a hybrid simulation model can help address Covid-19 questions and study systems and settings that are difficult to study with a single approach. To examine the spread and outbreak of Covid-19 across multiple care homes via bank/agency staff and evaluate the effectiveness of interventions targeting this group, we develop an integrated hybrid simulation model combining the advantages of SD and ABM. We also demonstrate how we use several approaches adapted from both SD and ABM practices to build confidence in this model in response to the lack of systematic approaches to validate hybrid models. Our modelling results show that the risk of infection for residents in care homes using bank/agency staff was significantly higher than those not using bank/agency staff (Relative risk [RR] 2.65, 95% CI 2.57–2.72). Bank/agency staff working across several care homes had a higher risk of infection compared with permanent staff working in a single care home (RR 1.55, 95%CI 1.52–1.58). The RR of infection for residents is negatively correlated to bank/agency staff’s adherence to weekly PCR testing. Within a network of heterogeneous care homes, using bank/agency staff had the most impact on care homes with lower intra-facility transmission risks, higher staff-to-resident ratio, and smaller size. Forming bubbles of care homes had no or limited impact on the spread of Covid-19. This modelling study has implications for policy makers considering developing effective interventions targeting staff working across care homes during the ongoing and future pandemics.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Optimism and pessimism in optimised replay</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Georgy Antonov, Christopher Gagne, Eran Eldar, Peter Dayan</p>

The replay of task-relevant trajectories is known to contribute to memory consolidation and improved task performance. A wide variety of experimental data show that the content of replayed sequences is highly specific and can be modulated by reward as well as other prominent task variables. However, the rules governing the choice of sequences to be replayed still remain poorly understood. One recent theoretical suggestion is that the prioritization of replay experiences in decision-making problems is based on their effect on the choice of action. We show that this implies that subjects should replay sub-optimal actions that they dysfunctionally choose rather than optimal ones, when, by being forgetful, they experience large amounts of uncertainty in their internal models of the world. We use this to account for recent experimental data demonstrating exactly pessimal replay, fitting model parameters to the individual subjects’ choices.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Robust dynamic experiments for the precise estimation of respiration and fermentation parameters of fruit and vegetables</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Arno Strouwen, Bart M. Nicolaï, Peter Goos</p>

Dynamic models based on non-linear differential equations are increasingly being used in many biological applications. Highly informative dynamic experiments are valuable for the identification of these dynamic models. The storage of fresh fruit and vegetables is one such application where dynamic experimentation is gaining momentum. In this paper, we construct optimal O<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> gas input profiles to estimate the respiration and fermentation kinetics of pear fruit. The optimal input profiles, however, depend on the true values of the respiration and fermentation parameters. Locally optimal design of input profiles, which uses a single initial guess for the parameters, is the traditional method to deal with this issue. This method, however, is very sensitive to the initial values selected for the model parameters. Therefore, we present a robust experimental design approach that can handle uncertainty on the model parameters.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Positional weight matrices have sufficient prediction power for analysis of noncoding variants [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                The commonly accepted model to quantify the specificity of transcription factor binding to DNA is the position weight matrix, also called the position-specific scoring matrix. Position weight matrices are used in thousands of projects and computational tools in regulatory genomics, including prediction of the regulatory potential of single-nucleotide variants. Yet, recently Yan et al. presented new experimental method for analysis of regulatory variants and, based on its results, reported that "the position weight matrices of most transcription factors lack sufficient predictive power". Here, we re-analyze the rich experimental dataset obtained by Yan et al. and show that appropriately selected position weight matrices in fact can successfully quantify transcription factor binding to alternative alleles.
