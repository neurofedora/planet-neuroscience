                The still stubbornly high maternal mortality ratio challenges Indonesia to improve health program strategies to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal 3.1 target of a maternal mortality ratio below 70 per 100,000 live births by 2030. Indonesia has already adopted maternal-neonatal health experts’ recommendation of four core program strategies to reduce maternal mortality: (1) family planning with related reproductive health services; (2) skilled care during pregnancy and childbirth; (3) timely emergency obstetric care; and (4) immediate postnatal care (WHO, 1996). These four core strategies would reduce maternal mortality through reduced high-risk births. To be effective, however, these four core program strategies require continued strong quality assurance and central and local government support to ensure program effectiveness yielded towards widely accessible, sustained, quality family planning and maternal and neonatal emergency services. This paper provides evidence for the importance of family planning to help health program strategies to accelerate maternal mortality reduction.

                Reconsolidation enables the activity-dependent modification of memory traces and has been used to reverse addiction, fear memory, and pain hypersensitivity in animal models. We demonstrate that non-ionotropic NMDA receptor signalling in the spinal dorsal horn is sufficient to reverse pain hypersensitivity and necessary for pain modulation by spinal reconsolidation. These findings reveal a key process by which reconsolidation weakens memory traces that may be exploited in the treatment of pain and other disorders.

	<p>Objective: To identify possible relevant factors contributing to tremor relapse after MRgFUS thalamotomy in patients with essential tremor (ET) and Parkinson’s disease (PD). Methods: We identified patients with tremor relapse from a series of 79 treatments in a single institution. The demographic and clinical characteristics of the study group patients were compared to those of patients who did not relapse in the same follow-up period. Imaging and procedural factors were compared using a control group matched for clinical and demographic characteristics. Results: Concerning clinical and demographic characteristics, we did not find statistically significant differences in gender and age. Seventy-three percent of patients with tremor relapse were Parkinson’s disease patients. Using MRI, we found larger thalamotomy lesions at the 1-year follow-up in the control group with stable outcomes, compared to patients with tremor relapse. In the tractography evaluation, we found a more frequent eccentric position of the DRTt in patients with tremor relapse. Conclusions: The most relevant determining factors for tremor relapse after MRgFUS thalamotomy appear to be tremor from Parkinson’s disease and inaccurate thalamic targeting. Size of the thalamotomy lesion can also influence the outcome of treatment.</p>

     alt="Isoxazole-9 reduces enhanced fear responses and retrieval in ethanol-dependent male rats"/>
<p>This study used an established animal model of ethanol dependence and found that abstinence from ethanol experience alters fear memory consolidation and plasticity in the hippocampus. Treatment with small molecule isoxazole-9 prevented the altered fear responses during abstinence and normalized cellular and plasticity changes in the ventral dentate gyrus.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Plasticity in the dentate gyrus (DG) is strongly influenced by ethanol, and ethanol experience alters long-term memory consolidation dependent on the DG. However, it is unclear if DG plasticity plays a role in dysregulation of long-term memory consolidation during abstinence from chronic ethanol experience. Outbred male Wistar rats experienced 7 weeks of chronic intermittent ethanol vapor exposure (CIE). Seventy-two hours after CIE cessation, CIE and age-matched ethanol-naïve Air controls experienced auditory trace fear conditioning (TFC). Rats were tested for cue-mediated retrieval in the fear context either twenty-four hours (24 hr), ten days (10 days), or twenty-one days (21 days) later. CIE rats showed enhanced freezing behavior during TFC acquisition compared to Air rats. Air rats showed significant fear retrieval, and this behavior did not differ at the three time points. In CIE rats, fear retrieval increased over time during abstinence, indicating an incubation in fear responses. Enhanced retrieval at 21 days was associated with reduced structural and functional plasticity of ventral granule cell neurons (GCNs) and reduced expression of synaptic proteins important for neuronal plasticity. Systemic treatment with the drug Isoxazole-9 (Isx-9; small molecule that stimulates DG plasticity) during the last week and a half of CIE blocked altered acquisition and retrieval of fear memories in CIE rats during abstinence. Concurrently, Isx-9 modulated the structural and functional plasticity of ventral GCNs and the expression of synaptic proteins in the ventral DG. These findings identify that abstinence-induced disruption of fear memory consolidation occurs via altered plasticity within the ventral DG, and that Isx-9 prevented these effects.</p>

<p>This study leveraged data from 3,109 youth to examine associations between genotype, functional connectivity, and anxiety.

<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The endocannabinoid system is an important regulator of emotional responses such as fear, and a number of studies have implicated endocannabinoid signaling in anxiety. The fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) C385A polymorphism, which is associated with enhanced endocannabinoid signaling in the brain, has been identified across species as a potential protective factor from anxiety. In particular, adults with the variant FAAH 385A allele have greater fronto-amygdala connectivity and lower anxiety symptoms. Whether broader network-level differences in connectivity exist, and when during development this neural phenotype emerges, remains unknown and represents an important next step in understanding how the FAAH C385A polymorphism impacts neurodevelopment and risk for anxiety disorders. Here, we leveraged data from 3,109 participants in the nationwide Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study℠ (10.04 ± 0.62 years old; 44.23% female, 55.77% male) and a cross-validated, data-driven approach to examine associations between genetic variation and large-scale resting-state brain networks. Our findings revealed a distributed brain network, comprising functional connections that were both significantly greater (95% CI for <i>p</i> values = [&lt;0.001, &lt;0.001]) and lesser (95% CI for <i>p</i> values = [0.006, &lt;0.001]) in A-allele carriers relative to non-carriers. Furthermore, there was a significant interaction between genotype and the summarized connectivity of functional connections that were greater in A-allele carriers, such that non-carriers with connectivity more similar to A-allele carriers (i.e., greater connectivity) had lower anxiety symptoms (<i>β</i> = −0.041, <i>p</i> = 0.030). These findings provide novel evidence of network-level changes in neural connectivity associated with genetic variation in endocannabinoid signaling and suggest that genotype-associated neural differences may emerge at a younger age than genotype-associated differences in anxiety.</p>

<p>MK-801 and amphetamine are largely used in mice and rats to model schizophrenia-related behavioral phenotypes. Here we compare the effects of these drugs in several zebrafish behavioral assays. We found that MK-801 disrupted social interaction and altered locomotion in a context-dependent manner, with hyperactivity when fish were tested in the presence of social cues and hypoactivity when tested alone. Exposure to amphetamine was devoid of effects on locomotion and social behavior, while it increased lipid peroxidation in the brain. This corroborates previous studies and reinforces the use of zebrafish to study schizophrenia-related endophenotypes.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Schizophrenia pathophysiology has been associated with dopaminergic hyperactivity, NMDA receptor hypofunction, and redox dysregulation. Most behavioral assays and animal models to study this condition were developed in rodents, leaving room for species-specific biases that could be avoided by cross-species approaches. As MK-801 and amphetamine are largely used in mice and rats to mimic schizophrenia features, this study aimed to compare the effects of these drugs in several zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio</i>) behavioral assays. Male and female adult zebrafish were exposed to MK-801 (1, 5, and 10 μM) or amphetamine (0.625, 2.5, and 10 mg/L) and observed in paradigms of locomotor activity and social behavior. Oxidative parameters were quantified in brain tissue. Our results demonstrate that MK-801 disrupted social interaction, an effect that resembles the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. It also altered locomotion in a context-dependent manner, with hyperactivity when fish were tested in the presence of social cues and hypoactivity when tested alone. On the other hand, exposure to amphetamine was devoid of effects on locomotion and social behavior, while it increased lipid peroxidation in the brain. Key outcomes induced by MK-801 in rodents, such as social interaction deficit and locomotor alterations, were replicated in zebrafish, corroborating previous studies and reinforcing the use of zebrafish to study schizophrenia-related endophenotypes. More studies are necessary to assess the predictive validity of preclinical paradigms with this species and ultimately optimize the screening of potential novel treatments.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Cholinergic projections from the brainstem serve as important modulators of activity in visual thalamic nuclei such as the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN). While these projections have been studied in several mammals, a comprehensive examination of their organization in the mouse is lacking. We used the retrograde transport of viruses or cholera toxin subunit B (CTB) injected in the dLGN, immunocytochemical labeling with antibodies against choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), brain nitric oxide synthase (BNOS), and vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT), ChAT-Cre mice crossed with a reporter line (Ai9), as well as brainstem virus injections in ChAT-Cre mice to examine the pattern of thalamic innervation from cholinergic neurons in the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPTg), laterodorsal tegmental nucleus (LDTg), and the parabigeminal nucleus (PBG). Retrograde tracing demonstrated that the dLGN receives input from the PPTg, LDTg, and PBG. Viral tracing in ChAT-Cre mice and retrograde tracing combined with immunocytochemistry revealed that many of these inputs originate from cholinergic neurons in the PBG and PPTg. Most notable was an extensive cholinergic projection from the PBG which innervated most of the contralateral dLGN, with an especially dense concentration in the dorsolateral shell, as well as a small region in the dorsomedial pole of the ipsilateral dLGN. The PPTg was found to provide a sparse somewhat diffuse innervation of the ipsilateral dLGN. Neurons in the PPTg co-expressed ChAT, BNOS, and VAChT, whereas PBG neurons expressed ChAT, but not BNOS or VAChT. These results highlight the presence of distinct cholinergic populations that innervate the mouse dLGN.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Comparison of Ciliary Targeting of Two Rhodopsin-Like GPCRs: Role of C-Terminal Localization Sequences in Relation to Cilium Type</a></h4>

              
                <p>Primary cilia exhibit a distinct complement of proteins, including G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that mediate sensory and developmental signals. The localization of GPCRs to the ciliary membrane involves ciliary localization sequences (CLSs), but it is not known how CLSs might relate to cilium type. Here, we studied the localization of two rhodopsin (RHO)-like GPCRs, somatostatin receptor (SSTR3) and RHO, in three types of cilia, from inner medullary collecting duct (IMCD3) cells, hTERT-RPE1 cells (possessing pocket cilia), and rod photoreceptors (whose cilia grow into elaborate phototransductive outer segments). SSTR3 was localized specifically to all three types of cilia, whereas RHO showed more selectivity for the photoreceptor cilium. Focusing on C-terminal CLSs, we characterized a novel CLS in the SSTR3 C terminus, which was required for the robust ciliary localization of SSTR3. Replacing the C terminus of RHO with this SSTR3 CLS-enhanced ciliary localization, compared with full-length RHO in IMCD3 and hTERT-RPE1 cells. Addition of the SSTR3 CLS to the single transmembrane protein CD8A enabled ciliary localization. In hTERT-RPE1 cells, a partial SSTR3 CLS added to CD8A effected specific localization to the periciliary (pocket) membrane, demonstrating C-terminal localization sequence targeting to this domain. Using retinas from mice, including both sexes, we show that deletion of the C terminus of RHO reduced the rod outer segment localization and that addition of the SSTR3 C-terminal CLS to the truncated RHO partly rescued this mislocalization. Overall, the study details elements of the different C termini of SSTR3 and RHO that are major effectors in determining specificity of cilium (or pericilium) localization among different types of cilia.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The localization of G-protein-coupled receptors to primary cilia is key to many types of signal transduction. After characterizing a novel C-terminal CLS in SSTR3, we investigated how SSTR3 and RHO localization to the cilium relates to C-terminal CLSs and to cilium type. We found that the SSTR3 C-terminal CLS was effective in three different types of cilia, but the RHO C terminus showed a clear localization preference for the highly elaborate photoreceptor cilium. When added to CD8A, part of the SSTR3 CLS promoted specific periciliary membrane localization in hTERT-RPE1 cells, demonstrating an effective CLS for this domain. Thus, we demonstrate that elements of the C termini of SSTR3 and RHO determine different localization patterns among different types of cilia.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Acetaldehyde Excitation of Lateral Habenular Neurons via Multiple Cellular Mechanisms</a></h4>

              
                <p>Acetaldehyde (ACD), the first metabolite of ethanol, is implicated in several of ethanol's actions, including the reinforcing and aversive effects. The neuronal mechanisms underlying ACD's aversive effect, however, are poorly understood. The lateral habenula (LHb), a regulator of midbrain monoaminergic centers, is activated by negative valence events. Although the LHb has been linked to the aversive responses of several abused drugs, including ethanol, little is known about ACD. We, therefore, assessed ACD's action on LHb neurons in rats. The results showed that intraperitoneal injection of ACD increased cFos protein expression within the LHb and that intra-LHb infusion of ACD induced conditioned place aversion in male rats. Furthermore, electrophysiological recording in brain slices of male and female rats showed that bath application of ACD facilitated spontaneous firing and glutamatergic transmission. This effect of ACD was potentiated by an aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) inhibitor, disulfiram (DS), but attenuated by the antagonists of dopamine (DA) receptor (DAR) subtype 1 (SCH23390) and subtype 2 (raclopride), and partly abolished by the pretreatment of DA or DA reuptake blocker (GBR12935; GBR). Moreover, application of ACD initiated a depolarizing inward current (<I>I</I><SUB>ACD</SUB>) and enhanced the hyperpolarizing-activated currents in LHb neurons. Bath application of Rp-cAMPs, a selective cAMP-PKA inhibitor, attenuated ACD-induced potentiation of EPSCs and <I>I</I><SUB>ACD</SUB>. Finally, bath application of ZD7288, a selective blocker of hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channels, attenuated ACD-induced potentiation of firing, EPSCs, and <I>I</I><SUB>ACD</SUB>. These results show that ACD exerts its aversive property by exciting LHb neurons via multiple cellular mechanisms, and new treatments targeting the LHb may be beneficial for alcoholism.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Acetaldehyde (ACD) has been considered aversive peripherally and rewarding centrally. However, whether ACD has a central aversive property is unclear. Here, we report that ACD excites the lateral habenula (LHb), a brain region associated with aversion and negative valence, through multiple cellular and molecular mechanisms. Intra-LHb ACD produces significant conditioned place aversion. These results suggest that ACD's actions on the LHb neurons might contribute to its central aversive property and new treatments targeting the LHb may be beneficial for alcoholism.</p>

                <p>Voltage-gated Ca<SUB>V</SUB>2.2 calcium channels are expressed in nociceptors at presynaptic terminals, soma, and axons. Ca<SUB>V</SUB>2.2 channel inhibitors applied to the spinal cord relieve pain in humans and rodents, especially during pathologic pain, but a biological function of nociceptor Ca<SUB>V</SUB>2.2 channels in processing of nociception, outside presynaptic terminals in the spinal cord, is underappreciated. Here, we demonstrate that functional Ca<SUB>V</SUB>2.2 channels in peripheral axons innervating skin are required for capsaicin-induced heat hypersensitivity in male and female mice. We show that Ca<SUB>V</SUB>2.2 channels in TRPV1-nociceptor endings are activated by capsaicin-induced depolarization and contribute to increased intracellular calcium. Capsaicin induces hypersensitivity of both thermal nociceptors and mechanoreceptors, but only heat hypersensitivity depends on peripheral Ca<SUB>V</SUB>2.2 channel activity, and especially a cell-type-specific Ca<SUB>V</SUB>2.2 splice isoform. Ca<SUB>V</SUB>2.2 channels at peripheral nerve endings might be important therapeutic targets to mitigate certain forms of chronic pain.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> It is generally assumed that nociceptor termini in the spinal cord dorsal horn are the functionally significant sites of Ca<SUB>V</SUB>2.2 channel in control of transmitter release and the transmission of sensory information from the periphery to central sites. We show that peripheral Ca<SUB>V</SUB>2.2 channels are essential for the classic heat hypersensitivity response to develop in skin following capsaicin exposure. This function of Ca<SUB>V</SUB>2.2 is highly selective for heat, but not mechanical hypersensitivity induced by capsaicin exposure, and is not a property of closely related Ca<SUB>V</SUB>2.1 channels. Our findings suggest that interrupting Ca<SUB>V</SUB>2.2-dependent calcium entry in skin might reduce heat hypersensitivity that develops after noxious heat exposure and may limit the degree of heat hypersensitivity associated with certain other forms of pain.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">An Emergent Population Code in Primary Auditory Cortex Supports Selective Attention to Spectral and Temporal Sound Features</a></h4>

              
                <p>Textbook descriptions of primary sensory cortex (PSC) revolve around single neurons' representation of low-dimensional sensory features, such as visual object orientation in primary visual cortex (V1), location of somatic touch in primary somatosensory cortex (S1), and sound frequency in primary auditory cortex (A1). Typically, studies of PSC measure neurons' responses along few (one or two) stimulus and/or behavioral dimensions. However, real-world stimuli usually vary along many feature dimensions and behavioral demands change constantly. In order to illuminate how A1 supports flexible perception in rich acoustic environments, we recorded from A1 neurons while rhesus macaques (one male, one female) performed a feature-selective attention task. We presented sounds that varied along spectral and temporal feature dimensions (carrier bandwidth and temporal envelope, respectively). Within a block, subjects attended to one feature of the sound in a selective change detection task. We found that single neurons tend to be high-dimensional, in that they exhibit substantial mixed selectivity for both sound features, as well as task context. We found no overall enhancement of single-neuron coding of the attended feature, as attention could either diminish or enhance this coding. However, a population-level analysis reveals that ensembles of neurons exhibit enhanced encoding of attended sound features, and this population code tracks subjects' performance. Importantly, surrogate neural populations with intact single-neuron tuning but shuffled higher-order correlations among neurons fail to yield attention- related effects observed in the intact data. These results suggest that an emergent population code not measurable at the single-neuron level might constitute the functional unit of sensory representation in PSC.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The ability to adapt to a dynamic sensory environment promotes a range of important natural behaviors. We recorded from single neurons in monkey primary auditory cortex (A1), while subjects attended to either the spectral or temporal features of complex sounds. Surprisingly, we found no average increase in responsiveness to, or encoding of, the attended feature across single neurons. However, when we pooled the activity of the sampled neurons via targeted dimensionality reduction (TDR), we found enhanced population-level representation of the attended feature and suppression of the distractor feature. This dissociation of the effects of attention at the level of single neurons versus the population highlights the synergistic nature of cortical sound encoding and enriches our understanding of sensory cortical function.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Cross Laminar Traveling Components of Field Potentials due to Volume Conduction of Non-Traveling Neuronal Activity in Macaque Sensory Cortices</a></h4>

              
                <p>Field potentials (FPs) reflect neuronal activities in the brain, and often exhibit traveling peaks across recording sites. While traveling FPs are interpreted as propagation of neuronal activity, not all studies directly reveal such propagating patterns of neuronal activation. Neuronal activity is associated with transmembrane currents that form dipoles and produce negative and positive fields. Thereby, FP components reverse polarity between those fields and have minimal amplitudes at the center of dipoles. Although their amplitudes could be smaller, FPs are never flat even around these reversals. What occurs around the reversal has not been addressed explicitly, although those are rationally in the middle of active neurons. We show that sensory FPs around the reversal appeared with peaks traveling across cortical laminae in macaque sensory cortices. Interestingly, analyses of current source density did not depict traveling patterns but lamina-delimited current sinks and sources. We simulated FPs produced by volume conduction of a simplified 2 dipoles' model mimicking sensory cortical laminar current source density components. While FPs generated by single dipoles followed the temporal patterns of the dipole moments without traveling peaks, FPs generated by concurrently active dipole moments appeared with traveling components in the vicinity of dipoles by superimposition of individually non-traveling FPs generated by single dipoles. These results indicate that not all traveling FP are generated by traveling neuronal activity, and that recording positions need to be taken into account to describe FP peak components around active neuronal populations.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Field potentials (FPs) generated by neuronal activity in the brain occur with fields of opposite polarity. Likewise, in the cerebral cortices, they have mirror-imaged waveforms in upper and lower layers. We show that FPs appear like traveling across the cortical layers. Interestingly, the traveling FPs occur without traveling components of current source density, which represents transmembrane currents associated with neuronal activity. These seemingly odd findings are explained using current source density models of multiple dipoles. Concurrently active, non-traveling dipoles produce FPs as mixtures of FPs produced by individual dipoles, and result in traveling FP waveforms as the mixing ratio depends on the distances from those dipoles. The results suggest that not all traveling FP components are associated with propagating neuronal activity.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Neuronal Activity in the Premotor Cortex of Monkeys Reflects Both Cue Salience and Motivation for Action Generation and Inhibition</a></h4>

              
                <p>Reward prospect weighs on motor decision processes, enhancing the selection of appropriate actions and the inhibition of others. While many studies have investigated the neuronal basis of reward representations and of cortical control of actions, the neuronal correlates of the influences of reward prospect on motor decisions are less clear. We recorded from the dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) of 2 male macaque monkeys performing a modified version of the Stop-signal (countermanding) task. This task challenges motor decisions by requiring responding to a frequent Go stimulus, but to suppress this response when a rare Stop signal is presented during the reaction time. We unbalanced the motivation to respond or to suppress the response by presenting a cue informing on three different rewards schedules: in one case, Go trials were rewarded more than Stop trials; in another case, Stop trials were rewarded more than Go trials; in the last case, both types of trials were rewarded equally. Monkeys adopted different strategies according to reward information provided by the cue: the higher the reward for Stop trials, the higher their ability to suppress the response and the slower their response to Go stimuli. PMd neuronal activity evolved in time and correlated with the behavior: PMd signaled first the cue salience, representing the chance to earn the highest reward at stake, then reflected the shaping of the motor choice by the motivation to move or to stop. These findings represent a neuronal correlate of the influence of reward information on motor decision.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The motivation to obtain rewards drives how animals act over their environment. To explore the involvement of motor cortices in motivated behaviors, we recorded high-resolution neuronal activity in the premotor cortex of monkeys performing a task that manipulated the motivation to generate/withhold a movement through different cued reward probabilities. Our results show the presence of neuronal signals dynamically reflecting the salience of the cue, in the time immediately following its presentation, and a motivation-related activity in performing (or cancelling) a motor program, while the behavioral response approached. The encoding of multiple reward-related signals in this region leads to consider an important role of premotor areas in the reward circuitry supporting action.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Neuropeptide Modulation Increases Dendritic Electrical Spread to Restore Neuronal Activity Disrupted by Temperature</a></h4>

              
                <p>Peptide neuromodulation has been implicated to shield neuronal activity from acute temperature changes that can otherwise lead to loss of motor control or failure of vital behaviors. However, the cellular actions neuropeptides elicit to support temperature-robust activity remain unknown. Here, we find that peptide neuromodulation restores rhythmic bursting in temperature-compromised central pattern generator (CPG) neurons by counteracting membrane shunt and increasing dendritic electrical spread. We show that acutely rising temperatures reduced spike generation and interrupted ongoing rhythmic motor activity in the crustacean gastric mill CPG. Neuronal release and extrinsic application of <I>Cancer borealis</I> tachykinin-related peptide Ia (CabTRP Ia), a substance-P-related peptide, restored rhythmic activity. Warming led to a significant decrease in membrane resistance and a shunting of the dendritic signals in the main gastric mill CPG neuron. Using a combination of fluorescent calcium imaging and electrophysiology, we observed that postsynaptic potentials and antidromic action potentials propagated less far within the dendritic neuropil as the system warmed. In the presence of CabTRP Ia, membrane shunt decreased and both postsynaptic potentials and antidromic action potentials propagated farther. At elevated temperatures, CabTRP Ia restored dendritic electrical spread or extended it beyond that at cold temperatures. Selective introduction of the CabTRP Ia conductance using a dynamic clamp demonstrated that the CabTRP Ia voltage-dependent conductance was sufficient to restore rhythmic bursting. Our findings demonstrate that a substance-P-related neuropeptide can boost dendritic electrical spread to maintain neuronal activity when perturbed and reveals key neurophysiological components of neuropeptide actions that support pattern generation in temperature-compromised conditions.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Changes in body temperature can have detrimental consequences for the well-being of an organism. Temperature-dependent changes in neuronal activity can be especially dangerous if they affect vital behaviors. Understanding how temperature changes disrupt neuronal activity and identifying how to ameliorate such effects is critically important. Our study of a crustacean circuit shows that warming disrupts rhythmic neuronal activity by increasing membrane shunt and reducing dendritic electrical spread in a key circuit neuron. Through the ionic conductance activated by it, substance-P-related peptide modulation restored electrical spread and counteracted the detrimental temperature effects on rhythmic activity. Because neuropeptides are commonly implicated in sustaining neuronal activity during perturbation, our results provide a promising mechanism to support temperature-robust activity.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Connectivity and Neuronal Synchrony during Seizures</a></h4>

              
                <p>There is uncertainty regarding when and which groups of neurons fire synchronously during seizures. While several studies found heterogeneous firing during seizures, others suggested synchronous neuronal firing in the seizure core. We tested whether neuronal activity during seizures is orderly in the direction of the excitatory neuronal connections in the circuit. There are strong excitatory connections laterally within the septotemporally organized lamella and inhibitory trans-lamellar connections in the hippocampus, which allow testing of the connectivity hypothesis. We further tested whether epileptogenesis enhances synchrony and antiseizure drug administration disrupts it. We recorded local field potentials from CA1 pyramidal neurons using a small microelectrode array and kindled rats by a rapid, recurrent hippocampal stimulation protocol. We compared cross-correlation, theta phase synchronization, entropy, and event synchronization. These analyses revealed that the firing pattern was correlated along the lamellar, but not the septotemporal, axis during evoked seizures. During kindling, neuronal synchrony increased along the lamellar axis, while synchrony along the septotemporal axis remained relatively low. Additionally, the theta phase distribution demonstrated that CA1 pyramidal cell firing became preferential for theta oscillation negative peak as kindling progressed in the lamellar direction but not in the trans-lamellar direction. Last, event synchronization demonstrated that neuronal firings along the lamellar axis were more synchronized than those along the septotemporal axis. There was a marked decrease in synchronization and phase preference after treatment with phenytoin and levetiracetam. The synchrony structure of CA1 pyramidal neurons during seizures and epileptogenesis depends on anatomic connectivity and plasticity.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We could improve the efficacy of brain stimulation to treat seizures by understanding the structure of synchrony. Electrical stimulation may disrupt seizures by desynchronizing neurons, but there is an uncertainty on which groups of neurons fire synchronously or chaotically during seizures. Here, we demonstrate that neurons linked by excitatory connections fire synchronously during seizures, and this synchrony is modulated by epileptogenesis and antiseizure drugs. Closed-loop brain stimulation carefully targeted to disrupt synchrony may improve the treatment of seizures.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Establishment of Emotional Memories Is Mediated by Vagal Nerve Activation: Evidence from Noninvasive taVNS</a></h4>

              
                <p>Emotional memories are better remembered than neutral ones, but the mechanisms leading to this memory bias are not well understood in humans yet. Based on animal research, it is suggested that the memory-enhancing effect of emotion is based on central noradrenergic release, which is triggered by afferent vagal nerve activation. To test the causal link between vagus nerve activation and emotional memory in humans, we applied continuous noninvasive transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) during exposure to emotional arousing and neutral scenes and tested subsequent, long-term recognition memory after 1 week. We found that taVNS, compared with sham, increased recollection-based memory performance for emotional, but not neutral, material. These findings were complemented by larger recollection-related brain potentials (parietal ERP Old/New effect) during retrieval of emotional scenes encoded under taVNS, compared with sham. Furthermore, brain potentials recorded during encoding also revealed that taVNS facilitated early attentional discrimination between emotional and neutral scenes. Extending animal research, our behavioral and neural findings confirm a modulatory influence of the vagus nerve in emotional memory formation in humans.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Emotionally relevant information elicits stronger and more enduring memories than nonrelevant information. Animal research has shown that this memory-enhancing effect of emotion is related to the noradrenergic activation in the brain, which is triggered by afferent fibers of the vagus nerve (VN). In the current study, we show that noninvasive transcutaneous auricular VN stimulation enhances recollection-based memory formation specifically for emotionally relevant information as indicated by behavioral and electrophysiological indices. These human findings give novel insights into the mechanisms underlying the establishment of emotional episodic memories by confirming the causal link between the VN and memory formation which may help understand the neural mechanisms underlying disorders associated with altered memory functions and develop treatment options.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Combining Repetition Suppression and Pattern Analysis Provides New Insights into the Role of M1 and Parietal Areas in Skilled Sequential Actions</a></h4>

              
                <p>How does the brain change during learning? In functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies, both multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) and repetition suppression (RS) have been used to detect changes in neuronal representations. In the context of motor sequence learning, the two techniques have provided discrepant findings: pattern analysis showed that only premotor and parietal regions, but not primary motor cortex (M1), develop a representation of trained sequences. In contrast, RS suggested trained sequence representations in all these regions. Here, we applied both analysis techniques to a five-week finger sequence training study, in which participants executed each sequence twice before switching to a different sequence. Both RS and pattern analysis indicated learning-related changes for parietal areas, but only RS showed a difference between trained and untrained sequences in M1. A more fine-grained analysis, however, revealed that the RS effect in M1 reflects a fundamentally different process than in parietal areas. On the first execution, M1 represents especially the first finger of each sequence, likely reflecting preparatory processes. This effect dramatically reduces during the second execution. In contrast, parietal areas represent the identity of a sequence, and this representation stays relatively stable on the second execution. These results suggest that the RS effect does not reflect a trained sequence representation in M1, but rather a preparatory signal for movement initiation. More generally, our study demonstrates that across regions RS can reflect different representational changes in the neuronal population code, emphasizing the importance of combining pattern analysis and RS techniques.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Previous studies using pattern analysis have suggested that primary motor cortex (M1) does not represent learnt sequential actions. However, a study using repetition suppression (RS) has reported M1 changes during motor sequence learning. Combining both techniques, we first replicate the discrepancy between them, with learning-related changes in M1 in RS, but not pattern dissimilarities. We further analyzed the representational changes with repetition, and found that the RS effects differ across regions. M1's activity represents the starting finger of the sequence, an effect that vanishes with repetition. In contrast, activity patterns in parietal areas exhibit sequence dependency, which persists with repetition. These results demonstrate the importance of combining RS and pattern analysis to understand the function of brain regions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Stimulus Reliability Automatically Biases Temporal Integration of Discrete Perceptual Targets in the Human Brain</a></h4>

              
                <p>Many decisions, from crossing a busy street to choosing a profession, require integration of discrete sensory events. Previous studies have shown that integrative decision-making favors more reliable stimuli, mimicking statistically optimal integration. It remains unclear, however, whether reliability biases operate even when they lead to suboptimal performance. To address this issue, we asked human observers to reproduce the average motion direction of two suprathreshold coherent motion signals presented successively and with varying levels of reliability, while simultaneously recording whole-brain activity using electroencephalography. By definition, the averaging task should engender equal weighting of the two component motion signals, but instead we found robust behavioral biases in participants' average decisions that favored the more reliable stimulus. Using population-tuning modeling of brain activity we characterized tuning to the average motion direction. In keeping with the behavioral biases, the neural tuning profiles also exhibited reliability biases. A control experiment revealed that observers were able to reproduce motion directions of low and high reliability with equal precision, suggesting that unbiased integration in this task was not only theoretically optimal but demonstrably possible. Our findings reveal that temporal integration of discrete sensory events in the brain is automatically and suboptimally weighted according to stimulus reliability.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Many everyday decisions require integration of several sources of information. To safely cross a busy road, for example, one must consider the movement of vehicles with different speeds and trajectories. Previous research has shown that individual stimuli are weighted according to their reliability. Whereas reliability biases typically yield performance that closely mimics statistically optimal integration, it remains unknown whether such biases arise even when they lead to suboptimal performance. Here we combined a novel integrative decision-making task with concurrent brain recording and modeling to address this question. While unbiased decisions were optimal in the task, observers nevertheless exhibited robust reliability biases in both behavior and brain activity, suggesting that reliability-weighted integration is automatic and dissociable from statistically optimal integration.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Learning and Representation of Hierarchical Concepts in Hippocampus and Prefrontal Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>A key aspect of conceptual knowledge is that it can be flexibly applied at different levels of abstraction, implying a hierarchical organization. It is yet unclear how this hierarchical structure is acquired and represented in the brain. Here we investigate the computations underlying the acquisition and representation of the hierarchical structure of conceptual knowledge in the hippocampal-prefrontal system of 32 human participants (22 females). We assessed the hierarchical nature of learning during a novel tree-like categorization task via computational model comparisons. The winning model allowed to extract and quantify estimates for accumulation and updating of hierarchical compared with single-feature-based concepts from behavior. We find that mPFC tracks accumulation of hierarchical conceptual knowledge over time, and mPFC and hippocampus both support trial-to-trial updating. As a function of those learning parameters, mPFC and hippocampus further show connectivity changes to rostro-lateral PFC, which ultimately represented the hierarchical structure of the concept in the final stages of learning. Our results suggest that mPFC and hippocampus support the integration of accumulated evidence and instantaneous updates into hierarchical concept representations in rostro-lateral PFC.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> A hallmark of human cognition is the flexible use of conceptual knowledge at different levels of abstraction, ranging from a coarse category level to a fine-grained subcategory level. While previous work probed the representational geometry of long-term category knowledge, it is unclear how this hierarchical structure inherent to conceptual knowledge is acquired and represented. By combining a novel hierarchical concept learning task with computational modeling of categorization behavior and concurrent fMRI, we differentiate the roles of key concept learning regions in hippocampus and PFC in learning computations and the representation of a hierarchical category structure.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Tau and {beta}-Amyloid Burden Predict Actigraphy-Measured and Self-Reported Impairment and Misperception of Human Sleep</a></h4>

              
                <p>Alzheimer's disease is associated with poor sleep, but the impact of tau and &beta;-amyloid (A&beta;) pathology on sleep remains largely unknown. Here, we test the hypothesis that tau and A&beta; predict unique impairments in objective and self-perceived human sleep under real-life, free-living conditions. Eighty-nine male and female cognitively healthy older adults received <sup>18</sup>F-FTP-tau and <sup>11</sup>C-PIB-A&beta; PET imaging, 7 nights of sleep actigraphy and questionnaire measures, and neurocognitive assessment. Tau burden, but not A&beta;, was associated with markedly worse objective sleep. In contrast, A&beta; and tau were associated with worse self-reported sleep quality. Of clinical relevance, A&beta; burden predicted a unique perceptual mismatch between objective and subject sleep evaluation, with individuals underestimating their sleep. The magnitude of this mismatch was further predicted by worse executive function. Thus, early-stage tau and A&beta; deposition are linked with distinct phenotypes of real-world sleep impairment, one that includes a cognitive misperception of their own sleep health.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Alzheimer's disease is associated with sleep disruption, often before significant memory decline. Thus, real-life patterns of sleep behavior have the potential to serve as a window into early disease progression. In 89 cognitive healthy older adults, we found that tau burden was associated with worse wristwatch actigraphy-measured sleep quality, and that both tau and &beta;-amyloid were independently predictive of self-reported sleep quality. Furthermore, individuals with greater &beta;-amyloid deposition were more likely to underestimate their sleep quality, and sleep quality underestimation was associated with worse executive function. These data support the role of sleep impairment as a key marker of early Alzheimer's disease, and offer the possibility that actigraphy may be an affordable and scalable tool in quantifying Alzheimer's disease-related behavioral changes.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Detecting industrial motor faults with current signatures [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: A major player in industry is the induction motor. The constant motion and mechanical nature of motors causes much wear and tear, creating a need for frequent maintenance such as changing contact brushes. Unmannered and infrequent monitoring of motors, as is common in the industry, can lead to overexertion and cause major faults. If a motor fault is detected earlier through the use of automated fault monitoring, it could prevent minor faults from developing into major faults, reducing the cost and down-time of production due the motor repairs. There are few available methods to detect three-phase motor faults. One method is to analyze average vibration signals values of V, I, pf, P, Q, S, THD and frequency. Others are to analyze instantaneous signal signatures of V and I frequencies, or V and I trajectory plotting a Lissajous curve. These methods need at least three sensors for current and three for voltage for a three-phase motor detection. Methods: Our proposed method of monitoring faults in three-phase industrial motors uses Hilbert Transform (HT) instantaneous current signature curve only, reducing the number of sensors required. Our system detects fault signatures accurately at any voltage or current levels, whether it is delta or star connected motors. This is due to our system design, which incorporates normalized curves of HT in the fault analysis database. We have conducted this experiment in our campus laboratory for two different three-phase motors with four different fault experiments. Results: The results shown in this paper are a comparison of two methods, the V and I Lissajous trajectory curve and our HT instantaneous current signature curve. Conclusion: We have chosen them as our benchmark as their fault results closely resemble our system results, but our system benefits such as universality and a cost reduction in sensors of 50%.

                Background: Research in natural substances for their anticancer potential has become increasingly popular. Lunasin, a soybean protein, is known to inhibit cancer progression via various pathways.  The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of Lunasin Extract (LE) on the expression of Intercellular Adhesion Molecule 1 (ICAM-1) and epithelial cadherins (E-Cadherin) in breast cancer. Methods: In this true-experimental in vivo study, 24 Sprague-Dawley rats that were induced by 7,12-Dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA), were used. Based on the therapy given, the groups were divided into, normal, positive control (PC), negative control (NC), adjuvant, curative, and preventive. Lunasin was extracted from soybean seeds of the Grobogan variety in Indonesia. Tissue samples were obtained, processed, stained with anti-ICAM-1 and anti-E-Cadherin antibodies, examined under a microscope, and quantified using H-score. The data were analyzed using ANOVA, which was then followed by Duncan's test. Results: Statistically significant difference in ICAM-1 expression was observed between the following groups: adjuvant and NC, normal and NC, PC and NC, adjuvant and preventive, normal and preventive, PC and preventive, adjuvant and curative, normal and curative, PC and curative. E-Cadherin expression was significantly different between preventive and NC, adjuvant and NC, PC and NC, normal and NC, adjuvant and curative, PC and curative, normal and curative, normal and preventive. Significant negative correlation was found between ICAM-1 and E-Cadherin [-0.616 (-0.8165; -0.283)] with p = 0.001. Conclusion: Preventive dose of LE was able to reduce ICAM-1 expression while increasing E-Cadherin expression.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Improving the data access control using blockchain for healthcare domain [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction Unauthorized access to data is one of the most significant privacy issues that hinder most industries from adopting big data technologies. Even though specific processes and structures have been put in place to deal with access authorization and identity management for large databases nonetheless, the scalability criteria are far beyond the capabilities of traditional databases. Hence, most researchers are looking into other solutions, such as big data management. Methods In this paper, we firstly study the strengths and weaknesses of implementing cryptography and blockchain for identity management and authorization control in big data, focusing on the healthcare domain. Subsequently, we propose a decentralized data access and sharing system that preserves privacy to ensure adequate data access management under the blockchain. In addition, we designed a blockchain framework to resolve the decentralized data access and sharing system privacy issues, by implementing a public key infrastructure model, which utilizes a signature cryptography algorithm (elliptic curve and signcryption). Lastly, we compared the proposed blockchain model to previous techniques to see how well it performed. Results We evaluated the blockchain on four performance metrics which include throughput, latency, scalability, and security. The proposed blockchain model was tested using a sample of 5000 patients and 500,000 observations. The performance evaluation results further showed that the proposed model achieves higher throughput and lower latency compared to existing approaches when the workload varies up to 10,000 transactions. Discussion This research reviews the importance of blockchains as they provide infinite possibilities to individuals, companies, and governments.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">An integrated framework for building trustworthy data-driven epidemiological models: Application to the COVID-19 outbreak in New York City</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Sheng Zhang, Joan Ponce, Zhen Zhang, Guang Lin, George Karniadakis</p>

Epidemiological models can provide the dynamic evolution of a pandemic but they are based on many assumptions and parameters that have to be adjusted over the time when the pandemic lasts. However, often the available data are not sufficient to identify the model parameters and hence infer the unobserved dynamics. Here, we develop a general framework for building a trustworthy data-driven epidemiological model, consisting of a workflow that integrates data acquisition and event timeline, model development, identifiability analysis, sensitivity analysis, model calibration, model robustness analysis, and projection with uncertainties in different scenarios. In particular, we apply this framework to propose a modified susceptible–exposed–infectious–recovered (SEIR) model, including new compartments and model vaccination in order to project the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in New York City (NYC). We find that we can uniquely estimate the model parameters and accurately project the daily new infection cases, hospitalizations, and deaths, in agreement with the available data from NYC’s government’s website. In addition, we employ the calibrated data-driven model to study the effects of vaccination and timing of reopening indoor dining in NYC.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">The induction of preterm labor in rhesus macaques is determined by the  strength of immune response to intrauterine infection</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Monica Cappelletti, Pietro Presicce, Ma Feiyang, Paranthaman Senthamaraikannan, Lisa A. Miller, Matteo Pellegrini, Myung S. Sim, Alan H. Jobe, Senad Divanovic, Sing Sing Way, Claire A. Chougnet, Suhas G. Kallapur</p>

Intrauterine infection/inflammation (IUI) is a major contributor to preterm labor (PTL). However, IUI does not invariably cause PTL. We hypothesized that quantitative and qualitative differences in immune response exist in subjects with or without PTL. To define the triggers for PTL, we developed rhesus macaque models of IUI driven by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or live <i>Escherichia coli</i>. PTL did not occur in LPS challenged rhesus macaques, while <i>E</i>. <i>coli–</i>infected animals frequently delivered preterm. Although LPS and live <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> both caused immune cell infiltration, <i>E</i>. <i>coli–</i>infected animals showed higher levels of inflammatory mediators, particularly interleukin 6 (IL-6) and prostaglandins, in the chorioamnion-decidua and amniotic fluid (AF). Neutrophil infiltration in the chorio-decidua was a common feature to both LPS and <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i>. However, neutrophilic infiltration and <i>IL6</i> and <i>PTGS2</i> expression in the amnion was specifically induced by live <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i>. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of fetal membranes revealed that specific pathways involved in augmentation of inflammation including type I interferon (IFN) response, chemotaxis, sumoylation, and iron homeostasis were up-regulated in the <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> group compared to the LPS group. Our data suggest that the intensity of the host immune response to IUI may determine susceptibility to PTL.

Viruses may not only affect our daily lives but also shape our genome evolution. A recent study shows that the zinc-finger antiviral protein (ZAP) drives CpG suppression in a biased manner. Genes involved in the defense against viral invaders are particularly CpG suppressed to avoid self-targeting and to promote an effective immune response.

                Background Digital transformation is changing the structure and landscape of future banking needs with much emphasis on value creation. Autonomous banking solutions must incorporate on-the-fly processing for risky transactions to create this value. In an autonomous environment, access control with role and trust delegation has been said to be highly relevant. The aim of this research is to provide an end to end working solution that will enable autonomous transaction and task processing for banking. Method We illustrate the use case for task delegation with the aid of risk graphs, risk bands and finite state machines. This paper also highlights a step by step task delegation process using a risk ordering relation methodology that can be embedded into smart contracts. Results Task delegation with risk ordering relation is illustrated with six process owners that share immutable ledgers. Task delegation properties using Multi Agent Systems (MAS) is used to eliminate barriers for autonomous transaction processing. Secondly, the application of risk graph and risk ordering relation with reference to delegation of tasks is a novel approach that is nonexistent in RBAC. Conclusion The novelty of this study is the logic for task delegation and task policies for autonomous execution on autonomous banking platforms akin to the idea of federated ID (Liberty Alliance).

                Background: One way to reduce the length of the gain medium in Erbium-Doped Fiber Amplifier (EDFA) is by doping the fiber core with a high concentration of Erbium. However, this method caused ion clustering effects, which limits the EDFA’s efficiency.  In this research, the use of Gallium as a new co-dopant in erbium-doped silica fiber is explored. Methods: The new fiber, namely Gallium co-doped Erbium fiber (Ga-EDF), is used as a gain medium in an optical fiber amplifier setup. A 2-meter length of the Ga-EDF fiber was used in a single pass configuration with a forward pumping scheme at 150 mW pump power. The Ga-EDF amplifier's gain and noise figure while pumping at 980 nm and 1480 nm were compared. The amplifier's performance was evaluated as the input signal power varied between -30 dBm to 3 dBm, over the wavelength range of 1520 nm to 1580 nm. Results: The 980 nm-pumped Ga-EDF amplifier achieved the maximum small-signal gain of 22.45 dB and the corresponding noise figure of 5.71 dB at the input signal wavelength of 1535 nm. Meanwhile, the 1480 nm-pumped Ga-EDF amplifier attained the maximum small-signal gain of 20.83 dB and the corresponding noise figure of 5.09 dB at the input signal wavelength of 1550 nm. At the input signal power below -20 dBm and the wavelength range 1520 nm to 1547 nm, the Ga-EDF performs better when pumped at 980 nm. Their performance is comparable at the input signal wavelength range between 1547 nm to 1580 nm. At the input signal power above -20 dBm, the 1480 nm-pumped Ga-EDF outperformed the 980 nm-pumped amplifier. Conclusions: The overall performance indicates that the gain saturation point of the 1480 nm-pumped amplifier is higher than the 980 nm-pumped.

                Nason et al. present a real-time brain-machine interface for controlling the simultaneous and independent movements of two groups of fingers in nonhuman primates. These techniques can be used to restore naturalistic control of paralyzed hands and enable a deeper understanding of how motor cortex represents dexterous finger behaviors.

                Astrocytes regulate the formation and function of neuronal synapses via multiple signals, however, what controls regional and temporal expression of these signals during development is unknown. We determined the expression profile of astrocyte synapse-regulating genes in the developing mouse visual cortex, identifying astrocyte signals that show differential temporal and layer-enriched expression. These patterns are not intrinsic to astrocytes, but regulated by visually-evoked neuronal activity, as they are absent in mice lacking glutamate release from thalamocortical terminals. Consequently, synapses remain immature. Expression of synapse-regulating genes and synaptic development are also altered when astrocyte signaling is blunted by diminishing calcium release from astrocyte stores. Single nucleus RNA sequencing identified groups of astrocytic genes regulated by neuronal and astrocyte activity, and a cassette of genes that show layer-specific enrichment. Thus, the development of cortical circuits requires coordinated signaling between astrocytes and neurons, highlighting astrocytes as a target to manipulate in neurodevelopmental disorders.

                Signaling pathways in biological systems rely on specific interactions between multiple biomolecules. Fluorescence fluctuation spectroscopy provides a powerful toolbox to quantify such interactions directly in living cells. Cross-correlation analysis of spectrally separated fluctuations provides information about inter-molecular interactions but is usually limited to two fluorophore species. Here, we present scanning fluorescence spectral correlation spectroscopy (SFSCS), a versatile approach that can be implemented on commercial confocal microscopes, allowing the investigation of interactions between multiple protein species at the plasma membrane. We demonstrate that SFSCS enables cross-talk-free cross-correlation, diffusion and oligomerization analysis of up to four protein species labeled with strongly overlapping fluorophores. As an example, we investigate the interactions of influenza A virus (IAV) matrix protein 2 with two cellular host factors simultaneously. We furthermore apply raster spectral image correlation spectroscopy for the simultaneous analysis of up to four species and determine the stoichiometry of ternary IAV polymerase complexes in the cell nucleus.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The interplay of RNA:DNA hybrid structure and G-quadruplexes determines the outcome of R-loop-replisome collisions</a></h4>

              
                R-loops are a major source of genome instability associated with transcription-induced replication stress. However, how R-loops inherently impact replication fork progression is not understood. Here, we characterize R-loop-replisome collisions using a fully reconstituted eukaryotic DNA replication system. We find that RNA:DNA hybrids and G-quadruplexes at both co-directional and head-on R-loops can impact fork progression by inducing fork stalling, uncoupling of leading strand synthesis from replisome progression, and nascent strand gaps. RNase H1 and Pif1 suppress replication defects by resolving RNA:DNA hybrids and G-quadruplexes, respectively. We also identify an intrinsic capacity of replisomes to maintain fork progression at certain R-loops by unwinding RNA:DNA hybrids, repriming leading strand synthesis downstream of G-quadruplexes, or utilizing R-loop transcripts to prime leading strand restart during co-directional R-loop-replisome collisions. Collectively, the data demonstrates that the outcome of R-loop-replisome collisions is modulated by R-loop structure, providing a mechanistic basis for the distinction of deleterious from non-deleterious R-loops.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Sex specific pubertal and metabolic regulation of Kiss1 neurons via Nhlh2</a></h4>

              
                Hypothalamic Kiss1 neurons control gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) release through the secretion of kisspeptin. Kiss1 neurons serve as a nodal center that conveys essential regulatory cues for the attainment and maintenance of reproductive function. Despite this critical role, the mechanisms that control kisspeptin synthesis and release remain largely unknown. Using Drop-Seq data from the arcuate nucleus of adult mice and <i>in situ</i> hybridization, we identified Nescient Helix-Loop-Helix 2 (<i>Nhlh2),</i> a transcription factor (TF) of the basic helix-loop-helix family, to be enriched in Kiss1 neurons. JASPAR analysis revealed several binding sites for NHLH2 in the <i>Kiss1</i> and <i>Tac2</i> (neurokinin B) 5' regulatory regions. <i>In vitro</i> luciferase assays evidenced a robust stimulatory action of NHLH2 on human <i>KISS1</i> and <i>TAC3</i> promoters. The recruitment of NHLH2 to the <i>KISS1</i> and <i>TAC3</i> promoters was further confirmed through chromatin immunoprecipitation. <i>In vivo</i> conditional ablation of <i>Nhlh2</i> from Kiss1 neurons using <i>Kiss1</i><sup>Cre</sup>:<i>Nhlh2</i><sup>fl/fl</sup> mice induced a male-specific delay in puberty onset, in line with a decrease in arcuate <i>Kiss1</i> expression. Females retained normal reproductive function albeit with irregular estrous cycles. Further analysis of male <i>Kiss1<sup>Cre</sup>:Nhlh2<sup>fl/fl</sup></i> mice revealed higher susceptibility to metabolic challenges in the release of luteinizing hormone (LH) and impaired response to leptin. Overall, in Kiss1 neurons, Nhlh2 contributes to the metabolic regulation of kisspeptin and NKB synthesis and release, with implications for the timing of puberty onset and regulation of fertility in male mice.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Off-target expression of Cre-dependent adeno-associated viruses in wild type C57BL/6J mice</a></h4>

              
                Adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) are a commonly used tool in neuroscience to efficiently label, trace, and/or manipulate neuronal populations. Highly specific targeting can be achieved through recombinase-dependent AAVs in combination with transgenic rodent lines that express Cre-recombinase in specific cell types. Visualization of viral expression is typically achieved through fluorescent reporter proteins (e.g., GFP or mCherry) packaged within the AAV genome. Although non-amplified fluorescence is usually sufficient to observe viral expression, immunohistochemical amplification of the fluorescent reporter is routinely used to improve viral visualization. In the present study, Cre-dependent AAVs were injected into the hippocampus and cortex of wild-type C57BL/6J mice. While we observed weak but consistent non-amplified off-target DIO expression in C57BL/6J mice, antibody amplification of the GFP or mCherry reporter revealed extensive Cre-independent viral expression. Off-target expression of DIO constructs in wild-type C57BL/6J mice occurred independent of vendor, AAV serotype or promoter. We also evaluated whether Cre-independent expression had functional effects via Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs). The DREADD agonist C21 had no effect on contextual fear conditioning or cFos expression in DIO-hM3Dq-mCherry+ cells of C57BL/6J mice. Taken together, our results indicate that DIO constructs have considerable off-target expression in wild type subjects. Our findings are particularly important for the design of experiments featuring sensitive systems and/or quantitative measurements that could be negatively impacted by off-target expression.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Conformational Change of Syntaxin-3b in Regulating SNARE Complex Assembly in the Ribbon Synapses</a></h4>

              
                Neurotransmitter release of synaptic vesicles relies on the assembly of the soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) complex, consisting of syntaxin and SNAP-25 on the plasma membrane and synaptobrevin on the synaptic vesicle. The formation of the SNARE complex progressively zippers towards the membranes, which drives membrane fusion between the plasma membrane and the synaptic vesicle. However, the underlying molecular mechanism of SNARE complex regulation is unclear. In this study, we investigate the syntaxin-3b isoform found in the retinal ribbon synapses using single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) to monitor the conformational changes of syntaxin-3b that modulate the SNARE complex formation. We found that syntaxin-3b is predominantly in a self-inhibiting closed conformation, inefficiently forming the ternary SNARE complex. Conversely, a phosphomimetic mutation (T14E) at the N-terminal region of syntaxin-3b promoted the open conformation, similar to the constitutively open form of syntaxin LE mutant. When syntaxin-3b is bound to Munc18-1, SNARE complex formation is almost completely blocked. Surprisingly, the T14E mutation of syntaxin-3b partially abolishes Munc18-1 regulation, acting as a conformational switch to trigger SNARE complex assembly. Thus, we suggest a model where the conformational change of syntaxin-3b induced by phosphorylation initiates the release of neurotransmitters in the ribbon synapses.

                A significant component of the repetitive dynamics during locomotion in vertebrates is generated within the spinal cord. The legged locomotion of mammals is most likely controled by a hierarchical, multi-layer spinal network structure, while the axial circuitry generating the undulatory swimming motion of animals like lamprey is thought to have only a single layer in each segment. Recent experiments have suggested a hybrid network structure in zebrafish larvae in which two types of excitatory interneurons (V2a-I and V2a-II) both make first-order connections to the brain and last-order connections to the motor pool. These neurons are connected by electrical and chemical synapses across segments. Through computational modeling and an asymptotic perturbation approach we show that this interleaved interaction between the two neuron populations allows the spinal network to quickly establish the correct activation sequence of the segments when starting from random initial conditions and to reduce the dependence of the intersegmental phase difference (ISPD) of the oscillations on the swimming frequency. The latter reduces the frequency dependence of the waveform of the swimming motion. In the model the reduced frequency dependence is largely due to the different impact of chemical and electrical synapses on the ISPD and to the significant spike-frequency adaptation that has been observed experimentally in V2a-II neurons, but not in V2a-I neurons. Our model makes experimentally testable predictions and points to a benefit of the hybrid structure for undulatory locomotion that may not be relevant for legged locomotion.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">An individualized fMRI-based protocol to assess semantic memory in a heterogeneous multilingual population</a></h4>

              
                The cognitive stimulation induced by multilingualism may slow down age-related memory impairment. However, a suitable neuroscientific framework to assess the influence of multilingualism on age-related memory processes is missing. We propose an experimental paradigm that assesses semantic memory processes using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). To this end, we modified the picture-word interference (PWI) task to be suitable for multilingual subjects undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). In particular, stimulus material was prepared in multiple languages and closely matched in semantic properties, thus enabling participants to perform the experiment in a language of their choice. This paradigm was validated in a group (n = 62) of healthy elderly ([&ge;]64 years) multilingual subjects, all practicing three or more languages. Consistent with the engagement of semantic memory processes, we found that the encoding and recognition of semantically related vs. unrelated picture-word pairs evoked robust differences in behavior and the neural activity of parietal-temporal networks. These effects were not modulated by the language in which the task was performed. Based on this validation in a multilingual population, we conclude that the proposed paradigm will allow future studies to evaluate whether multilingualism aptitude engages neural systems in a manner that protects long-term memory from aging-related decline.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Common and distinct neurofunctional representations of core and social disgust in the brain: An ALE meta-analysis and MACM characterization</a></h4>

              
                Disgust represents a multifaceted defensive-avoidance response. On the behavioral level, the response includes withdrawal and a disgust-specific facial expression. While both serve the avoidance of pathogens the latter additionally transmits social-communicative information. Given that common and distinct brain representation of the primary defensive-avoidance response (core disgust) and encoding of the social-communicative signal (social disgust) remain debated we employed neuroimaging meta-analyses to (1) determine brain systems generally engaged in disgust processing, and (2) segregate common and distinct brain systems for core and social disgust. Disgust processing, in general, engaged a bilateral network encompassing the insula, amygdala, occipital and prefrontal regions. Core disgust evoked stronger reactivity in left-lateralized threat detection and defensive response network including amygdala, occipital and frontal regions while social disgust engaged a right-lateralized superior temporal-frontal network engaged in social cognition. Anterior insula, inferior frontal and fusiform regions were commonly engaged during core and social disgust suggesting a common neural basis. We demonstrate a common and separable neural basis of primary disgust responses and encoding of associated social-communicative signals.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Mapping electromagnetic networks to haemodynamic networks in the human brain</a></h4>

              
                Whole-brain neural communication is typically estimated from statistical associations among electromagnetic or haemodynamic time-series. The relationship between functional network architectures recovered from these two types of neural activity remains unknown. Here we map electromagnetic networks (measured using magnetoencephalography; MEG) to haemodynamic networks (measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging; fMRI). We find that the relationship between the two modalities is regionally heterogeneous and systematically follows the cortical hierarchy, with close correspondence in unimodal cortex and poor correspondence in transmodal cortex, potentially reflecting patterns of laminar differentiation, recurrent subcortical input and neurovascular coupling. Correspondence between the two is largely driven by slower rhythms, particularly the delta (2-4 Hz) and beta (15-29 Hz) frequency band. Moreover, haemodynamic connectivity cannot be explained by electromagnetic activity in a single frequency band, but rather arises from the mixing of multiple neurophysiological rhythms. Collectively, these findings demonstrate highly organized but only partly overlapping patterns of connectivity in MEG and fMRI functional networks, opening fundamentally new avenues for studying the relationship between cortical micro-architecture and multi-modal connectivity patterns.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Selective activation of BK channels in small-headed dendritic spines suppresses excitatory postsynaptic potentials</a></h4>

              
                Dendritic spines are the main receptacles of excitatory information in the brain. Their particular morphology, with a small head connected to the dendrite by a slender neck, has inspired theoretical and experimental work to understand how these structural features affect the processing, storage and integration of synaptic inputs in pyramidal neurons (PNs). The activation of glutamate receptors in spines triggers a large voltage change as well as calcium signals at the spine head. Thus, voltage-gated and calcium-activated potassium channels located in the spine head likely play a key role in synaptic transmission. Here we study the presence and function of large conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) channels in spines from layer 5 PNs. We find that BK channels are localized to dendrites and spines regardless of their size, but their activity can only be detected in spines with small head volumes (less than or equal to 0.09 micrometer^3), which reduces the amplitude of two-photon (2P) uncaging (u) excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) recorded at the soma. In addition, we find that calcium signals in spines with small head volumes are significantly larger than those observed in spines with larger head volumes. In accordance with our experimental data, numerical simulations predict that synaptic inputs impinging onto spines with small head volumes generate voltage responses and calcium signals within the spine head itself that are significantly larger than those observed in spines with bigger head volumes, which are sufficient to activate spine BK channels. These results show that BK channels are selectively activated in small-headed spines, suggesting a new level of dendritic spine-mediated regulation of synaptic processing, integration, and plasticity in cortical PNs.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A generalized cortical activity pattern at internally-generated mental context boundaries during unguided narrative recall</a></h4>

              
                Current theory and empirical studies suggest that humans segment continuous experiences into events based on the mismatch between predicted and actual sensory inputs; detection of these "event boundaries" evokes transient neural responses. However, boundaries can also occur at transitions between internal mental states, without relevant external input changes. To what extent do such "internal boundaries" share neural response properties with externally-driven boundaries? We conducted an fMRI experiment where subjects watched a series of short movies and then verbally recalled the movies, unprompted, in the order of their choosing. During recall, transitions between movies thus constituted major boundaries between internal mental contexts, generated purely by subjects' unguided thoughts. Following the offset of each recalled movie, we observed stereotyped spatial activation patterns in the default mode network, especially the posterior medial cortex, consistent across different movie contents and even across the different tasks of movie watching and recall. Surprisingly, the between-movie boundary patterns were negatively correlated with patterns at boundaries between events within a movie. Thus, major transitions between mental contexts elicit neural phenomena shared across internal and external modes and distinct from within-context event boundary detection, potentially reflecting a cognitive state related to the flushing and reconfiguration of situation models.

	<p>Background: Acute symptomatic seizures (ASS) are a common manifestation of autoimmune encephalitis (AE), but the risk of developing epilepsy as a sequela of AE remains unknown, and factors predisposing the development of epilepsy have not been fully identified. Objective: To assess the risk of developing epilepsy in AE and study related risk factors. Materials and methods: This was a retrospective single centre study including patients diagnosed with AE according to criteria described by Graus et al., with a minimum follow-up of 12 months after AE resolution. The sample was divided according to whether patients developed epilepsy or not. Results: A total of 19 patients were included; 3 (15.8%) had AE with intracellular antibodies, 9 (47.4%) with extracellular antibodies, and 7 (36.8%) were seronegative. During follow-up, 3 patients (15.8%) died, 4 (21.1%) presented relapses of AE, and 11 (57.89%) developed epilepsy. There was a significant association between the development of epilepsy and the presence of hippocampal atrophy in control brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (p = 0.037), interictal epileptiform discharges (IED) on control electroencephalogram (EEG) (p = 0.045), and immunotherapy delay (p = 0.016). Conclusions: Hippocampal atrophy in neuroimaging, IED on EEG during follow-up, and immunotherapy delay could be predictors of the development of epilepsy in patients with AE.</p>

	<p>The authors of this study evaluated the potential benefit on visual performance of a novel 3 week visual rehabilitation program based on the use of Gabor patches in patients undergoing bilateral cataract surgery with the implantation of two models of trifocal diffractive intraocular lens (IOL). A total of 30 patients were randomly assigned to two groups: a study group (15 patients) that used a videogame based on Gabor patches and a placebo group (15 patients) that used a videogame without specific stimuli for improving visual performance. No statistically significant differences between groups were found in distance, intermediate, and near post-training visual acuity (p ≥ 0.15). Significantly better distance contrast sensitivity (CS) was found for the spatial frequencies of 6 (p = 0.02) and 12 cpd (p = 0.01) in the study group. Likewise, significantly better values of near CS were found in the study group compared to the placebo group for the spatial frequency of 1.5 cpd (p = 0.02). In conclusion, a 3 week visual rehabilitation program based on the use of Gabor patches in the immediate postoperative period after the bilateral implantation of trifocal diffractive IOLs seems to be beneficial for improving both distance and near visual performance achieved with the implant.</p>

	<p>The Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative showed that Japanese had significantly lower brain Aβ burden than Americans among a cognitively normal population. This cross-sectional study aimed to compare vascular disease burden, Aβ burden, and neurodegeneration between cognitively normal elderly Japanese and Americans. Japanese and American participants were matched for age (± 4-year-old), sex, and Apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype. Brain vascular disease burden and brain Aβ burden were measured using white matter lesions (WMLs) and 11C-labeled Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB) retention, respectively. Neurodegeneration was measured using hippocampal volumes and cortical thickness. A total of 95 Japanese and 95 Americans were recruited (50.5% men, mean age = 82). Compared to Americans, Japanese participants had larger WMLs, and a similar global Aβ standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR), cortical thickness and hippocampal volumes. Japanese had significantly lower regional Aβ SUVR in the anterior ventral striatum, posterior cingulate cortex, and precuneus. Cognitively normal elderly Japanese and Americans had different profiles regarding vascular disease and Aβ burden. This suggests that multiple risk factors are likely to be involved in the development of dementia. Additionally, Japanese might have a lower risk of dementia due to lower Aβ burden than Americans. Longitudinal follow-up of these cohorts is warranted to ascertain the predictive accuracy of these findings.</p>

	<p>Background. Few individuals with fragile X syndrome (FXS) successfully meet adult normative expectations in education, employment, peer relations, and habitation, although there is within-syndrome variability in this regard. The primary goal of this study was to determine whether expressive language skills contribute to the capacity for independent functioning in adulthood even after controlling for nonverbal cognitive ability. Methods. Participants were 18- to 23-year-olds with FXS. Expressive language was assessed using the psychometrically validated Expressive Language Sampling (ELS) conversation and narration procedures. The language produced was transcribed and analyzed to yield measures of expressive vocabulary, syntax, and intelligibility. Parents concurrently completed questionnaires on the independent functioning of the participants with FXS. Results. All three ELS measures were significantly corelated with multiple measures of independence. The magnitudes of the correlations were reduced when nonverbal IQ was controlled through partial correlation. Nonetheless, many of the partial correlations were medium to large and several were statistically significant. Conclusions. Expressive language skills appear to contribute uniquely to the capacity for independence, although longitudinal data are needed to evaluate the possibility of a bidirectional relationship between these domains. Thus, language intervention may be a prerequisite for preparing youth with FXS for an independent adult life.</p>

                <p>Progressive multifocal encephalopathy (PML) is a severe demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS) caused by JC virus (JCV), which occurs in immunocompromised individuals. Management of PML relies on restoration of immunity within the CNS. However, when this restoration cannot be readily achieved, PML has a grim prognosis. Innovative strategies have shown promise in promoting anti-JCV immune responses, and include T-cell adoptive transfer or immune checkpoint inhibitor therapies. Conversely, management of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome, particularly in iatrogenic PML, remains a major challenge. In this paper, we review recent development in the treatment of PML.

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Generation of an Iba1-EGFP Transgenic Rat for the Study of Microglia in an Outbred Rodent Strain</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Neuroscience has been transformed by the ability to genetically modify inbred mice, including the ability to express fluorescent markers specific to cell types or activation states. This approach has been put to particularly good effect in the study of the innate immune cells of the brain, microglia. These specialized macrophages are exceedingly small and complex, but also highly motile and mobile. To date, there have been no tools similar to those in mice available for studying these fundamental cells in the rat brain, and we seek to fill that gap with the generation of the genetically modified Sprague Dawley rat line: <I>SD-Tg(Iba1-EGFP)Mmmc</I>. Using CRISPR-Cas/9 technology, we knocked in <I>EGFP</I> to the promoter of the gene <I>Iba1</I>. With four male and three female founders confirmed by quantitative PCR analysis to have appropriate and specific insertion, we established a breeding colony with at least three generations of backcrosses to obtain stable and reliable Iba1-EGFP expression. The specificity of EGFP expression to microglia was established by flow cytometry for CD45<sup>low</sup>/CD11b<sup>+</sup> cells and by immunohistochemistry. Microglial EGFP expression was detected in neonates and persisted into adulthood. Blood macrophages and monocytes were found to express low levels of EGFP, as expected. Last, we show that EGFP expression is suitable for live imaging of microglia processes in acute brain slices and via intravital two-photon microscopy.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Postdiction: When Temporal Regularity Drives Space Perception through Prestimulus Alpha Oscillations</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>In postdiction, the last stimulus of a sequence changes the perception of the preceding stimuli. Postdiction has been reported in all sensory modalities, but its neural underpinnings remain poorly understood. In the rabbit illusion, a sequence of nonequidistant stimuli presented isochronously is perceived as equidistantly spaced. This illusion might be driven by an internal prior favoring a constant-speed motion. Here, we hypothesized that prestimulus alpha oscillations (8&ndash;12 Hz), known to correlate with perceptual expectations and biases, would reflect the degree to which perceptual reports are influenced by a constant-speed prior. Human participants were presented with ambiguous visual sequences while being recorded simultaneously with MEG and EEG: the same sequences yielded an illusory perception in about half the trials, allowing contrasting brain responses elicited by identical sequences causing distinct percepts. As a proxy of an individual&rsquo;s prior, we used the percentage of perceived illusion and the detection criterion, assuming that a strong constant-speed prior would result in a higher rate of illusory percepts. We found that high frontoparietal alpha power was associated with perceiving the sequence according to the individual&rsquo;s prior: participants with high susceptibility to the illusion would report the illusion, while participants with low susceptibility would report the veridical sequence. Additionally, we found that prestimulus alpha phase in occipitoparietal regions dissociated illusion from no-illusion trials. We interpret our results as suggesting that alpha power reflects an individual&rsquo;s constant-speed prior, whereas alpha phase modulates sensory uncertainty.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation above the Medial Prefrontal Cortex Facilitates Decision-Making following Periods of Low Outcome Controllability</a></h4>

              
                <p>Recent studies suggest that choice behavior in reinforcement learning tasks is shaped by the level of outcome controllability. In particular, Pavlovian bias (PB) seems to be enhanced under low levels of control, manifesting in approach tendencies toward rewards and response inhibition when facing potential losses. The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) has been implicated both in evaluating outcome controllability and in the recruitment of cognitive control (CC) to suppress maladaptive PB during reinforcement learning. The current study tested whether high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) above the mPFC of healthy humans can influence PB, and counteract the previously documented, deleterious behavioral effects of low outcome controllability on decision-making. In a preregistered, between-group, double-blind study (<I>N</I> = 103 adults, both sexes), we tested the interaction between controllability and HD-tDCS on parameters of choice behavior in a Go/NoGo task. Relative to sham stimulation, HD-tDCS resulted in more robust performance improvement following reduced control, an effect that was more pronounced in appetitive trials. In addition, we found evidence for weaker PB when HD-tDCS was administered during low controllability over outcomes. Computational modeling revealed that parameter estimates of learning rate and choice randomness were modulated by controllability, HD-tDCS and their interaction. Overall, these results highlight the potential of our HD-tDCS protocol for interfering with choice arbitration under low levels of control, resulting in more adaptive behavior.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Modeling Neurodevelopmental Disorders and Epilepsy Caused by Loss of Function of kif2a in Zebrafish</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>In recent years there has been extensive research on malformations of cortical development (MCDs) that result in clinical features like developmental delay, intellectual disability, and drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE). Various studies highlighted the contribution of microtubule-associated genes (including tubulin and kinesin encoding genes) in MCD development. It has been reported that <I>de novo</I> mutations in <I>KIF2A</I>, a member of the <I>kinesin-13</I> family, are linked to brain malformations and DRE. Although it is known that KIF2A functions by regulating microtubule depolymerization via an ATP-driven process, <I>in vivo</I> implications of <I>KIF2A</I> loss of function remain partly unclear. Here, we present a novel <I>kif2a</I> knock-out zebrafish model, showing hypoactivity, habituation deficits, pentylenetetrazole-induced seizure susceptibility and microcephaly, as well as neuronal cell proliferation defects and increased apoptosis. Interestingly, <I>kif2a</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> larvae survived until adulthood and were fertile. Notably, our <I>kif2a</I> zebrafish knock-out model demonstrated many phenotypic similarities to <I>KIF2A</I> mouse models. This study provides valuable insights into the functional importance of <I>kif2a</I> in zebrafish and phenotypical hallmarks related to <I>KIF2A</I> mutations. Ultimately, this model could be used in a future search for more effective therapies that alleviate the clinical symptoms typically associated with MCDs.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Divergence in Population Coding for Space between Dorsal and Ventral CA1</a></h4>

              
                <p>Molecular, anatomic, and behavioral studies show that the hippocampus is structurally and functionally heterogeneous, with dorsal hippocampus implicated in mnemonic processes and spatial navigation and ventral hippocampus involved in affective processes. By performing electrophysiological recordings of large neuronal populations in dorsal and ventral CA1 in head-fixed mice navigating a virtual environment, we found that this diversity resulted in different strategies for population coding of space. Populations of neurons in dorsal CA1 showed more complex patterns of activity, which resulted in a higher dimensionality of neural representations that translated to more information being encoded, as compared ensembles in vCA1. Furthermore, a pairwise maximum entropy model was better at predicting the structure of these global patterns of activity in ventral CA1 as compared with dorsal CA1. Taken together, the different coding strategies we uncovered likely emerge from anatomic and physiological differences along the longitudinal axis of hippocampus and that may, in turn, underpin the divergent ethological roles of dorsal and ventral CA1.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">The Impact of SST and PV Interneurons on Nonlinear Synaptic Integration in the Neocortex</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Excitatory synaptic inputs arriving at the dendrites of a neuron can engage active mechanisms that nonlinearly amplify the depolarizing currents. This supralinear synaptic integration is subject to modulation by inhibition. However, the specific rules by which different subtypes of interneurons affect the modulation have remained largely elusive. To examine how inhibition influences active synaptic integration, we optogenetically manipulated the activity of the following two subtypes of interneurons: dendrite-targeting somatostatin-expressing (SST) interneurons; and perisomatic-targeting parvalbumin-expressing (PV) interneurons. In acute slices of mouse primary visual cortex, electrical stimulation evoked nonlinear synaptic integration that depended on NMDA receptors. Optogenetic activation of SST interneurons in conjunction with electrical stimulation resulted in predominantly divisive inhibitory gain control, reducing the magnitude of the supralinear response without affecting its threshold. PV interneuron activation, on the other hand, had a minimal effect on the supralinear response. Together, these results delineate the roles for SST and PV neurons in active synaptic integration. Differential effects of inhibition by SST and PV interneurons likely increase the computational capacity of the pyramidal neurons in modulating the nonlinear integration of synaptic output.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Dendrite Morphology Minimally Influences the Synaptic Distribution of Excitation and Inhibition in Retinal Direction-Selective Ganglion Cells</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Throughout the nervous system, the organization of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs within a neuron&rsquo;s receptive field shapes its output computation. In some cases, multiple motifs of synaptic organization can contribute to a single computation. Here, we compare two of these mechanisms performed by two morphologically distinct retinal direction-selective ganglion cells (DSGCs): directionally tuned inhibition and spatially offset inhibition. Using drifting stimuli, we found that DSGCs that have asymmetric dendrites exhibited stronger directionally tuned inhibition than symmetric DSGCs. Using stationary stimuli to map receptive fields, we found that DSGCs with both symmetric and asymmetric dendrites exhibited similar spatially offset inhibition. Interestingly, we observed that excitatory and inhibitory synapses for both cell types were locally correlated in strength. This result indicates that in the mouse retina, dendritic morphology influences the amount of tuned inhibition attained through asymmetric wiring but does not dictate the synaptic organization of excitation relative to inhibition.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Coordination through Inhibition: Control of Stabilizing and Updating Circuits in Spatial Orientation Working Memory</a></h4>

              
                <p>Spatial orientation memory plays a crucial role in animal navigation. Recent studies of tethered <I>Drosophila melanogaster</I> (fruit fly) in a virtual reality setting showed that the head direction is encoded in the form of an activity bump, i.e., localized neural activity, in the torus-shaped ellipsoid body (EB). However, how this system is involved in orientation working memory is not well understood. We investigated this question using free moving flies (<I>D. melanogaster</I>) in a spatial orientation memory task by manipulating two EB subsystems, C and P circuits, which are hypothesized for stabilizing and updating the activity bump, respectively. To this end, we suppressed or activated two types of inhibitory ring neurons (EIP and P) which innervate EB, and we discovered that manipulating the two inhibitory neuron types produced distinct behavioral deficits, suggesting specific roles of the inhibitory neurons in coordinating the stabilization and updating functions of the EB circuits. We further elucidate the neural mechanisms underlying such control circuits using a connectome-constrained spiking neural network model.</p>

                Background: One of the benefits of online education is the potential reduction in carbon emissions through the decrease in travel to attend a university in person. We estimated the savings in CO2 emissions of an international cohort of master’s students who studied fully online from their home countries, rather than travelling to the UK and living there while attending university. Methods: The city and country of residence of a cohort of students who first enrolled in the fully online Peoples-uni/Manchester Metropolitan University MPH programme between the second semester of 2011 and the first semester 2013 were recorded. We estimated the aviation emissions between Manchester, UK and the cities where students reside, and subtracted the per capita emissions for the country of origin from the per capita emissions for the UK over the time that the student would have spent in Manchester as a full-time student, based on the semester in which they first enrolled. Results: 128 students enrolled from 55 cities in 31 countries. 93 students were from a range of African countries and 18 from the Indian sub-continent. Flights to and from Manchester were estimated to have accounted for 114,553kg of CO2 and living in Manchester for the duration of their course compared with staying in the home country would have been equivalent to 854,904kg of CO2. The combined net savings was 969,457kg of CO2. Conclusions: A small cohort of overseas students, largely from Africa and India, studied online rather than attending university in the UK. The saving by this small cohort of nearly a million kg of CO2 emissions through not attending university in-person offers an indication of the potential environmental benefits of offering university education online to overseas students.

                Background: Though coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been designated as a global pandemic, its nature as a viral infection means that it is essentially a self-limiting disease. We studied the application of symptomatic, isolation, relaxation, nutrition and observation (SIRNO) therapy in patients with asymptomatic and mild symptoms of COVID-19 at a rescue hospital in Indonesia. Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study involving 2122 patients who were admitted to Indrapura Field Hospital in Surabaya from 28 May 2020 to 20 September 2020. We analyzed demographic data, clinical signs and symptoms, laboratory data, therapy and clinical outcomes. Result: The total sample of 2122 patients consisted of 1403 male patients (66.12%), and 719 female patients (33.88 %). The most common age range was 26-45 years, at 52.54% (1115 patients). The clinical symptoms of 1121 patients (52.8%) were asymptomatic, 977 patients (46%) had mild symptoms, and 24 patients (0.1%) had moderate symptoms. All patients received the SIRNO therapy method. From a total of 2122 patients, 1930 patients (90.9%) were cured, 181 patients (8.5%) are still being treated, seven patients (0.03%) were referred for indications of desaturation (SpO2 <94%), and four patients (0.01%) were moved to a referral hospital. Until 20 September 2020, the final date studied, there were no patient deaths. Conclusion: The SIRNO method provides excellent results in the management of COVID-19 at a rescue hospital for patients with asymptomatic and mild symptoms. Economic pharmacological research can initiate a follow-up study in order to objectively measure the effectiveness and efficiency of SIRNO treatment methods in patients with asymptomatic, mild symptoms of COVID-19, and the small number of 24 patients (0,.1%) with moderate symptoms.

                Background: We did a ‘study within a trial’ (SWAT), evaluating the effectiveness of the inclusion of a pen with a postal questionnaire, compared to no pen being included, on the retention rate in a large orthopaedic trial. Methods: The SWAT was embedded in the KReBS trial. The primary outcome was the proportion of 12-month questionnaires returned. Secondary outcomes were the proportion of questionnaires completed and time to questionnaire return. Binary data were analysed using logistic regression and time to return using Cox proportional hazards regression.  Odds ratios (OR) and hazard ratios (HR) are presented, with associated 95% confidence intervals and p-values. Results: In total, 2305 participants were randomised into the SWAT. In the pen group, 1020/1145 (89.1%) of participants returned a questionnaire, compared to 982/1147 (85.6%) in the no pen group. The absolute difference in questionnaire return rate was 3.5% (95% CI: 0.8% to 6.2%; p=0.01). There were statistically significant differences in questionnaire return rate (OR 1.36; 95% CI: 1.06 to 1.74; p=0.02), questionnaire completion rate (OR 1.40; 95% CI: 1.11 to 1.78; p<0.01) and time to questionnaire return (HR 1.17; 95% CI: 1.07 to 1.27; p<0.01) favouring the pen group. Conclusion: This SWAT adds to the growing evidence base for whether pens are effective as an incentive for retention, and indicates their potential effectiveness. Registration: KReBS trial registered on 20 February 2019, ID ISRCTN87127065; SWAT registered on 1 April 2019, ID SWAT92.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Perspectives on automated composition of workflows in the life sciences [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Scientific data analyses often combine several computational tools in automated pipelines, or workflows. Thousands of such workflows have been used in the life sciences, though their composition has remained a cumbersome manual process due to a lack of standards for annotation, assembly, and implementation. Recent technological advances have returned the long-standing vision of automated workflow composition into focus. This article summarizes a recent Lorentz Center workshop dedicated to automated composition of workflows in the life sciences. We survey previous initiatives to automate the composition process, and discuss the current state of the art and future perspectives. We start by drawing the “big picture” of the scientific workflow development life cycle, before surveying and discussing current methods, technologies and practices for semantic domain modelling, automation in workflow development, and workflow assessment. Finally, we derive a roadmap of individual and community-based actions to work toward the vision of automated workflow development in the forthcoming years. A central outcome of the workshop is a general description of the workflow life cycle in six stages: 1) scientific question or hypothesis, 2) conceptual workflow, 3) abstract workflow, 4) concrete workflow, 5) production workflow, and 6) scientific results. The transitions between stages are facilitated by diverse tools and methods, usually incorporating domain knowledge in some form. Formal semantic domain modelling is hard and often a bottleneck for the application of semantic technologies. However, life science communities have made considerable progress here in recent years and are continuously improving, renewing interest in the application of semantic technologies for workflow exploration, composition and instantiation. Combined with systematic benchmarking with reference data and large-scale deployment of production-stage workflows, such technologies enable a more systematic process of workflow development than we know today. We believe that this can lead to more robust, reusable, and sustainable workflows in the future.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Structural and energetic profiling of SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain antibody recognition and the impact of circulating variants</a></h4>

The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic highlights the need for a detailed molecular understanding of protective antibody responses. This is underscored by the emergence and spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants, including Alpha (B.1.1.7) and Delta (B.1.617.2), some of which appear to be less effectively targeted by current monoclonal antibodies and vaccines. Here we report a high resolution and comprehensive map of antibody recognition of the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor binding domain (RBD), which is the target of most neutralizing antibodies, using computational structural analysis. With a dataset of nonredundant experimentally determined antibody-RBD structures, we classified antibodies by RBD residue binding determinants using unsupervised clustering. We also identified the energetic and conservation features of epitope residues and assessed the capacity of viral variant mutations to disrupt antibody recognition, revealing sets of antibodies predicted to effectively target recently described viral variants. This detailed structure-based reference of antibody RBD recognition signatures can inform therapeutic and vaccine design strategies.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">ReFeaFi: Genome-wide prediction of regulatory elements driving transcription initiation</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Ramzan Umarov, Yu Li, Takahiro Arakawa, Satoshi Takizawa, Xin Gao, Erik Arner</p>

Regulatory elements control gene expression through transcription initiation (promoters) and by enhancing transcription at distant regions (enhancers). Accurate identification of regulatory elements is fundamental for annotating genomes and understanding gene expression patterns. While there are many attempts to develop computational promoter and enhancer identification methods, reliable tools to analyze long genomic sequences are still lacking. Prediction methods often perform poorly on the genome-wide scale because the number of negatives is much higher than that in the training sets. To address this issue, we propose a dynamic negative set updating scheme with a two-model approach, using one model for scanning the genome and the other one for testing candidate positions. The developed method achieves good genome-level performance and maintains robust performance when applied to other vertebrate species, without re-training. Moreover, the unannotated predicted regulatory regions made on the human genome are enriched for disease-associated variants, suggesting them to be potentially true regulatory elements rather than false positives. We validated high scoring “false positive” predictions using reporter assay and all tested candidates were successfully validated, demonstrating the ability of our method to discover novel human regulatory regions.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Using test positivity and reported case rates to estimate state-level COVID-19 prevalence and seroprevalence in the United States</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Weihsueh A. Chiu, Martial L. Ndeffo-Mbah</p>

Accurate estimates of infection prevalence and seroprevalence are essential for evaluating and informing public health responses and vaccination coverage needed to address the ongoing spread of COVID-19 in each United States (U.S.) state. However, reliable, timely data based on representative population sampling are unavailable, and reported case and test positivity rates are highly biased. A simple data-driven Bayesian semi-empirical modeling framework was developed and used to evaluate state-level prevalence and seroprevalence of COVID-19 using daily reported cases and test positivity ratios. The model was calibrated to and validated using published state-wide seroprevalence data, and further compared against two independent data-driven mathematical models. The prevalence of undiagnosed COVID-19 infections is found to be well-approximated by a geometrically weighted average of the positivity rate and the reported case rate. Our model accurately fits state-level seroprevalence data from across the U.S. Prevalence estimates of our semi-empirical model compare favorably to those from two data-driven epidemiological models. As of December 31, 2020, we estimate nation-wide a prevalence of 1.4% [Credible Interval (CrI): 1.0%-1.9%] and a seroprevalence of 13.2% [CrI: 12.3%-14.2%], with state-level prevalence ranging from 0.2% [CrI: 0.1%-0.3%] in Hawaii to 2.8% [CrI: 1.8%-4.1%] in Tennessee, and seroprevalence from 1.5% [CrI: 1.2%-2.0%] in Vermont to 23% [CrI: 20%-28%] in New York. Cumulatively, reported cases correspond to only one third of actual infections. The use of this simple and easy-to-communicate approach to estimating COVID-19 prevalence and seroprevalence will improve the ability to make public health decisions that effectively respond to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Ascension of Chlamydia is moderated by uterine peristalsis and the neutrophil response to infection</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Torrington Callan, Stephen Woodcock, Wilhelmina May Huston</p>

<i>Chlamydia trachomatis</i> is a common sexually transmitted infection that is associated with a range of serious reproductive tract sequelae including in women Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID), tubal factor infertility, and ectopic pregnancy. Ascension of the pathogen beyond the cervix and into the upper reproductive tract is thought to be necessary for these pathologies. However, <i>Chlamydia trachomatis</i> does not encode a mechanism for movement on its genome, and so the processes that facilitate ascension have not been elucidated. Here, we evaluate the factors that may influence chlamydial ascension in women. We constructed a mathematical model based on a set of stochastic dynamics to elucidate the moderating factors that might influence ascension of infections in the first month of an infection. In the simulations conducted from the stochastic model, 36% of infections ascended, but only 9% had more than 1000 bacteria ascend. The results of the simulations indicated that infectious load and the peristaltic contractions moderate ascension and are inter-related in impact. Smaller initial loads were much more likely to ascend. Ascension was found to be dependent on the neutrophil response. Overall, our results indicate that infectious load, menstrual cycle timing, and the neutrophil response are critical factors in chlamydial ascension in women.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Multiscale model of defective interfering particle replication for influenza A virus infection in animal cell culture</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Daniel Rüdiger, Lars Pelz, Marc D. Hein, Sascha Y. Kupke, Udo Reichl</p>

Cell culture-derived defective interfering particles (DIPs) are considered for antiviral therapy due to their ability to inhibit influenza A virus (IAV) production. DIPs contain a large internal deletion in one of their eight viral RNAs (vRNAs) rendering them replication-incompetent. However, they can propagate alongside their homologous standard virus (STV) during infection in a competition for cellular and viral resources. So far, experimental and modeling studies for IAV have focused on either the intracellular or the cell population level when investigating the interaction of STVs and DIPs. To examine these levels simultaneously, we conducted a series of experiments using highly different multiplicities of infections for STVs and DIPs to characterize virus replication in Madin-Darby Canine Kidney suspension cells. At several time points post infection, we quantified virus titers, viable cell concentration, virus-induced apoptosis using imaging flow cytometry, and intracellular levels of vRNA and viral mRNA using real-time reverse transcription qPCR. Based on the obtained data, we developed a mathematical multiscale model of STV and DIP co-infection that describes dynamics closely for all scenarios with a single set of parameters. We show that applying high DIP concentrations can shut down STV propagation completely and prevent virus-induced apoptosis. Interestingly, the three observed viral mRNAs (full-length segment 1 and 5, defective interfering segment 1) accumulated to vastly different levels suggesting the interplay between an internal regulation mechanism and a growth advantage for shorter viral RNAs. Furthermore, model simulations predict that the concentration of DIPs should be at least 10000 times higher than that of STVs to prevent the spread of IAV. Ultimately, the model presented here supports a comprehensive understanding of the interactions between STVs and DIPs during co-infection providing an ideal platform for the prediction and optimization of vaccine manufacturing as well as DIP production for therapeutic use.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Episome partitioning and symmetric cell divisions: Quantifying the role of random events in the persistence of HPV infections</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Thomas Beneteau, Christian Selinger, Mircea T. Sofonea, Samuel Alizon</p>

Human Papillomaviruses (HPV) are one of the most prevalent sexually transmitted infections (STI) and the most oncogenic viruses known to humans. The vast majority of HPV infections clear in less than 3 years, but the underlying mechanisms, especially the involvement of the immune response, are still poorly known. Building on earlier work stressing the importance of randomness in the type of cell divisions in the clearance of HPV infection, we develop a stochastic mathematical model of HPV dynamics that combines the previous aspect with an explicit description of the intracellular level. We show that the random partitioning of virus episomes upon stem cell division and the occurrence of symmetric divisions dramatically affect viral persistence. These results call for more detailed within-host studies to better understand the relative importance of stochasticity and immunity in HPV infection clearance.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Improved estimation of time-varying reproduction numbers at low case incidence and between epidemic waves</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Kris V. Parag</p>

We construct a recursive Bayesian smoother, termed EpiFilter, for estimating the effective reproduction number, R, from the incidence of an infectious disease in real time and retrospectively. Our approach borrows from Kalman filtering theory, is quick and easy to compute, generalisable, deterministic and unlike many current methods, requires no change-point or window size assumptions. We model R as a flexible, hidden Markov state process and exactly solve forward-backward algorithms, to derive R estimates that incorporate all available incidence information. This unifies and extends two popular methods, EpiEstim, which considers past incidence, and the Wallinga-Teunis method, which looks forward in time. We find that this combination of maximising information and minimising assumptions significantly reduces the bias and variance of R estimates. Moreover, these properties make EpiFilter more statistically robust in periods of low incidence, where several existing methods can become destabilised. As a result, EpiFilter offers improved inference of time-varying transmission patterns that are advantageous for assessing the risk of upcoming waves of infection or the influence of interventions, in real time and at various spatial scales.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Computational modeling of blood component transport related to coronary artery thrombosis in Kawasaki disease</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Noelia Grande Gutiérrez, Mark Alber, Andrew M. Kahn, Jane C. Burns, Mathew Mathew, Brian W. McCrindle, Alison L. Marsden</p>

Coronary artery thrombosis is the major risk associated with Kawasaki disease (KD). Long-term management of KD patients with persistent aneurysms requires a thrombotic risk assessment and clinical decisions regarding the administration of anticoagulation therapy. Computational fluid dynamics has demonstrated that abnormal KD coronary artery hemodynamics can be associated with thrombosis. However, the underlying mechanisms of clot formation are not yet fully understood. Here we present a new model incorporating data from patient-specific simulated velocity fields to track platelet activation and accumulation. We use a system of Reaction-Advection-Diffusion equations solved with a stabilized finite element method to describe the evolution of non-activated platelets and activated platelet concentrations [AP], local concentrations of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and poly-phosphate (PolyP). The activation of platelets is modeled as a function of shear-rate exposure and local concentration of agonists. We compared the distribution of activated platelets in a healthy coronary case and six cases with coronary artery aneurysms caused by KD, including three with confirmed thrombosis. Results show spatial correlation between regions of higher concentration of activated platelets and the reported location of the clot, suggesting predictive capabilities of this model towards identifying regions at high risk for thrombosis. Also, the concentration levels of ADP and PolyP in cases with confirmed thrombosis are higher than the reported critical values associated with platelet aggregation (ADP) and activation of the intrinsic coagulation pathway (PolyP). These findings suggest the potential initiation of a coagulation pathway even in the absence of an extrinsic factor. Finally, computational simulations show that in regions of flow stagnation, biochemical activation, as a result of local agonist concentration, is dominant. Identifying the leading factors to a pro-coagulant environment in each case—mechanical or biochemical—could help define improved strategies for thrombosis prevention tailored for each patient.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A Bayesian model based computational analysis of the relationship between bisulfite accessible single-stranded DNA in chromatin and somatic hypermutation of immunoglobulin genes</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Guojun Yu, Yingru Wu, Zhi Duan, Catherine Tang, Haipeng Xing, Matthew D. Scharff, Thomas MacCarthy</p>

The B cells in our body generate protective antibodies by introducing somatic hypermutations (SHM) into the variable region of immunoglobulin genes (IgVs). The mutations are generated by activation induced deaminase (AID) that converts cytosine to uracil in single stranded DNA (ssDNA) generated during transcription. Attempts have been made to correlate SHM with ssDNA using bisulfite to chemically convert cytosines that are accessible in the intact chromatin of mutating B cells. These studies have been complicated by using different definitions of “bisulfite accessible regions” (BARs). Recently, deep-sequencing has provided much larger datasets of such regions but computational methods are needed to enable this analysis. Here we leveraged the deep-sequencing approach with unique molecular identifiers and developed a novel Hidden Markov Model based Bayesian Segmentation algorithm to characterize the ssDNA regions in the IGHV4-34 gene of the human Ramos B cell line. Combining hierarchical clustering and our new Bayesian model, we identified recurrent BARs in certain subregions of both top and bottom strands of this gene. Using this new system, the average size of BARs is about 15 bp. We also identified potential G-quadruplex DNA structures in this gene and found that the BARs co-locate with G-quadruplex structures in the opposite strand. Using various correlation analyses, there is not a direct site-to-site relationship between the bisulfite accessible ssDNA and all sites of SHM but most of the highly AID mutated sites are within 15 bp of a BAR. In summary, we developed a novel platform to study single stranded DNA in chromatin at a base pair resolution that reveals potential relationships among BARs, SHM and G-quadruplexes. This platform could be applied to genome wide studies in the future.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">MicrobeTrace: Retooling molecular epidemiology for rapid public health response</a></h4>

Outbreak investigations use data from interviews, healthcare providers, laboratories and surveillance systems. However, integrated use of data from multiple sources requires a patchwork of software that present challenges in usability, interoperability, confidentiality, and cost. Rapid integration, visualization and analysis of data from multiple sources can guide effective public health interventions. We developed MicrobeTrace to facilitate rapid public health responses by overcoming barriers to data integration and exploration in molecular epidemiology. MicrobeTrace is a web-based, client-side, JavaScript application (https://microbetrace.cdc.gov) that runs in Chromium-based browsers and remains fully operational without an internet connection. Using publicly available data, we demonstrate the analysis of viral genetic distance networks and introduce a novel approach to minimum spanning trees that simplifies results. We also illustrate the potential utility of MicrobeTrace in support of contact tracing by analyzing and displaying data from an outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in South Korea in early 2020. MicrobeTrace is developed and actively maintained by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Users can email microbetrace@cdc.gov for support. The source code is available at https://github.com/cdcgov/microbetrace.

Electrical stimulation and block of peripheral nerves hold great promise for treatment of a range of disease and disorders, but promising results from preclinical studies often fail to translate to successful clinical therapies. Differences in neural anatomy across species require different electrodes and stimulation parameters to achieve equivalent nerve responses, and accounting for the consequences of these factors is difficult. We describe the implementation, validation, and application of a standardized, modular, and scalable computational modeling pipeline for biophysical simulations of electrical activation and block of nerve fibers within peripheral nerves. The ASCENT (Automated Simulations to Characterize Electrical Nerve Thresholds) pipeline provides a suite of built-in capabilities for user control over the entire workflow, including libraries for parts to assemble electrodes, electrical properties of biological materials, previously published fiber models, and common stimulation waveforms. We validated the accuracy of ASCENT calculations, verified usability in beta release, and provide several compelling examples of ASCENT-implemented models. ASCENT will enable the reproducibility of simulation data, and it will be used as a component of integrated simulations with other models (e.g., organ system models), to interpret experimental results, and to design experimental and clinical interventions for the advancement of peripheral nerve stimulation therapies.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Pathway analysis in metabolomics: Recommendations for the use of over-representation analysis</a></h4>

Over-representation analysis (ORA) is one of the commonest pathway analysis approaches used for the functional interpretation of metabolomics datasets. Despite the widespread use of ORA in metabolomics, the community lacks guidelines detailing its best-practice use. Many factors have a pronounced impact on the results, but to date their effects have received little systematic attention. Using five publicly available datasets, we demonstrated that changes in parameters such as the background set, differential metabolite selection methods, and pathway database used can result in profoundly different ORA results. The use of a non-assay-specific background set, for example, resulted in large numbers of false-positive pathways. Pathway database choice, evaluated using three of the most popular metabolic pathway databases (KEGG, Reactome, and BioCyc), led to vastly different results in both the number and function of significantly enriched pathways. Factors that are specific to metabolomics data, such as the reliability of compound identification and the chemical bias of different analytical platforms also impacted ORA results. Simulated metabolite misidentification rates as low as 4% resulted in both gain of false-positive pathways and loss of truly significant pathways across all datasets. Our results have several practical implications for ORA users, as well as those using alternative pathway analysis methods. We offer a set of recommendations for the use of ORA in metabolomics, alongside a set of minimal reporting guidelines, as a first step towards the standardisation of pathway analysis in metabolomics.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Comparing mutational pathways to lopinavir resistance in HIV-1 subtypes B versus C</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Susana Posada-Céspedes, Gert Van Zyl, Hesam Montazeri, Jack Kuipers, Soo-Yon Rhee, Roger Kouyos, Huldrych F. Günthard, Niko Beerenwinkel</p>

Although combination antiretroviral therapies seem to be effective at controlling HIV-1 infections regardless of the viral subtype, there is increasing evidence for subtype-specific drug resistance mutations. The order and rates at which resistance mutations accumulate in different subtypes also remain poorly understood. Most of this knowledge is derived from studies of subtype B genotypes, despite not being the most abundant subtype worldwide. Here, we present a methodology for the comparison of mutational networks in different HIV-1 subtypes, based on Hidden Conjunctive Bayesian Networks (H-CBN), a probabilistic model for inferring mutational networks from cross-sectional genotype data. We introduce a Monte Carlo sampling scheme for learning H-CBN models for a larger number of resistance mutations and develop a statistical test to assess differences in the inferred mutational networks between two groups. We apply this method to infer the temporal progression of mutations conferring resistance to the protease inhibitor lopinavir in a large cross-sectional cohort of HIV-1 subtype C genotypes from South Africa, as well as to a data set of subtype B genotypes obtained from the Stanford HIV Drug Resistance Database and the Swiss HIV Cohort Study. We find strong support for different initial mutational events in the protease, namely at residue 46 in subtype B and at residue 82 in subtype C. The inferred mutational networks for subtype B versus C are significantly different sharing only five constraints on the order of accumulating mutations with mutation at residue 54 as the parental event. The results also suggest that mutations can accumulate along various alternative paths within subtypes, as opposed to a unique total temporal ordering. Beyond HIV drug resistance, the statistical methodology is applicable more generally for the comparison of inferred mutational networks between any two groups.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">A systemic cell cycle block impacts stage-specific histone modification profiles during Xenopus embryogenesis</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Daniil Pokrovsky, Ignasi Forné, Tobias Straub, Axel Imhof, Ralph A. W. Rupp</p>

Forming an embryo from a zygote poses an apparent conflict for epigenetic regulation. On the one hand, the de novo induction of cell fate identities requires the establishment and subsequent maintenance of epigenetic information to harness developmental gene expression. On the other hand, the embryo depends on cell proliferation, and every round of DNA replication dilutes preexisting histone modifications by incorporation of new unmodified histones into chromatin. Here, we investigated the possible relationship between the propagation of epigenetic information and the developmental cell proliferation during <i>Xenopus</i> embryogenesis. We systemically inhibited cell proliferation during the G1/S transition in gastrula embryos and followed their development until the tadpole stage. Comparing wild-type and cell cycle–arrested embryos, we show that the inhibition of cell proliferation is principally compatible with embryo survival and cellular differentiation. In parallel, we quantified by mass spectrometry the abundance of a large set of histone modification states, which reflects the developmental maturation of the embryonic epigenome. The arrested embryos developed abnormal stage-specific histone modification profiles (HMPs), in which transcriptionally repressive histone marks were overrepresented. Embryos released from the cell cycle block during neurulation reverted toward normality on morphological, molecular, and epigenetic levels. These results suggest that the cell cycle block by HUA alters stage-specific HMPs. We propose that this influence is strong enough to control developmental decisions, specifically in cell populations that switch between resting and proliferating states such as stem cells.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">RhoA- and Cdc42-induced antagonistic forces underlie symmetry breaking and spindle rotation in mouse oocytes</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Benoit Dehapiot, Raphaël Clément, Bourdais Anne, Virginie Carrière, Huet Sébastien, Halet Guillaume</p>

Mammalian oocyte meiotic divisions are highly asymmetric and produce a large haploid gamete and 2 small polar bodies. This relies on the ability of the cell to break symmetry and position its spindle close to the cortex before anaphase occurs. In metaphase II–arrested mouse oocytes, the spindle is actively maintained close and parallel to the cortex, until fertilization triggers sister chromatid segregation and the rotation of the spindle. The latter must indeed reorient perpendicular to the cortex to enable cytokinesis ring closure at the base of the polar body. However, the mechanisms underlying symmetry breaking and spindle rotation have remained elusive. In this study, we show that spindle rotation results from 2 antagonistic forces. First, an inward contraction of the cytokinesis furrow dependent on RhoA signaling, and second, an outward attraction exerted on both sets of chromatids by a Ran/Cdc42-dependent polarization of the actomyosin cortex. By combining live segmentation and tracking with numerical modeling, we demonstrate that this configuration becomes unstable as the ingression progresses. This leads to spontaneous symmetry breaking, which implies that neither the rotation direction nor the set of chromatids that eventually gets discarded are biologically predetermined.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">The antiviral state has shaped the CpG composition of the vertebrate interferome to avoid self-targeting</a></h4>

Antiviral defenses can sense viral RNAs and mediate their destruction. This presents a challenge for host cells since they must destroy viral RNAs while sparing the host mRNAs that encode antiviral effectors. Here, we show that highly upregulated interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), which encode antiviral proteins, have distinctive nucleotide compositions. We propose that self-targeting by antiviral effectors has selected for ISG transcripts that occupy a less self-targeted sequence space. Following interferon (IFN) stimulation, the CpG-targeting antiviral effector zinc-finger antiviral protein (ZAP) reduces the mRNA abundance of multiple host transcripts, providing a mechanistic explanation for the repression of many (but not all) interferon-repressed genes (IRGs). Notably, IRGs tend to be relatively CpG rich. In contrast, highly upregulated ISGs tend to be strongly CpG suppressed. Thus, ZAP is an example of an effector that has not only selected compositional biases in viral genomes but also appears to have notably shaped the composition of host transcripts in the vertebrate interferome.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">High-throughput characterization of photocrosslinker-bearing ion channel variants to map residues critical for function and pharmacology</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Nina Braun, Søren Friis, Christian Ihling, Andrea Sinz, Jacob Andersen, Stephan A. Pless</p>

Incorporation of noncanonical amino acids (ncAAs) can endow proteins with novel functionalities, such as crosslinking or fluorescence. In ion channels, the function of these variants can be studied with great precision using standard electrophysiology, but this approach is typically labor intensive and low throughput. Here, we establish a high-throughput protocol to conduct functional and pharmacological investigations of ncAA-containing human acid-sensing ion channel 1a (hASIC1a) variants in transiently transfected mammalian cells. We introduce 3 different photocrosslinking ncAAs into 103 positions and assess the function of the resulting 309 variants with automated patch clamp (APC). We demonstrate that the approach is efficient and versatile, as it is amenable to assessing even complex pharmacological modulation by peptides. The data show that the acidic pocket is a major determinant for current decay, and live-cell crosslinking provides insight into the hASIC1a–psalmotoxin 1 (PcTx1) interaction. Further, we provide evidence that the protocol can be applied to other ion channels, such as P2X2 and GluA2 receptors. We therefore anticipate the approach to enable future APC-based studies of ncAA-containing ion channels in mammalian cells.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Language statistical learning responds to reinforcement learning principles rooted in the striatum</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Joan Orpella, Ernest Mas-Herrero, Pablo Ripollés, Josep Marco-Pallarés, Ruth de Diego-Balaguer</p>

Statistical learning (SL) is the ability to extract regularities from the environment. In the domain of language, this ability is fundamental in the learning of words and structural rules. In lack of reliable online measures, statistical word and rule learning have been primarily investigated using offline (post-familiarization) tests, which gives limited insights into the dynamics of SL and its neural basis. Here, we capitalize on a novel task that tracks the <i>online</i> SL of simple syntactic structures combined with computational modeling to show that online SL responds to reinforcement learning principles rooted in striatal function. Specifically, we demonstrate—on 2 different cohorts—that a temporal difference model, which relies on prediction errors, accounts for participants’ online learning behavior. We then show that the trial-by-trial development of predictions through learning strongly correlates with activity in both ventral and dorsal striatum. Our results thus provide a detailed mechanistic account of language-related SL and an explanation for the oft-cited implication of the striatum in SL tasks. This work, therefore, bridges the long-standing gap between language learning and reinforcement learning phenomena.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Data fusion based lane departure warning framework using fuzzy logic [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Lane detection is a difficult issue because of different lane circumstances. It plays an important part in advanced driver assistance systems, which give information about the centre of a host vehicle such as lane structure and lane position. Lane departure warning (LDW) is used to warn the driver about an unplanned lane exit from the original lane. The objective of this study was to develop a data-fusion LDW framework to improve the rate of detection of lane departure during daylight and at night. Methods: Vision-based LDW is a comprehensive framework based on vision-based lane detection with additional lateral offset ratio computations based on the detected X12 and X22 coordinates. The computed lateral offset ratio is used to detect lane departure based on predefined LDW identification criteria for vision-based LDW. Data fusion-based LDW was developed using a multi-input-single-output fuzzy logic controller. Data fusion involved lateral offset ratio and yaw acceleration response from the vision-based LDW and model-based vehicle dynamics frameworks. Real-life datasets were generated for simulation under the MATLAB Simulink platform. Results: Experimental results showed that fusion-based LDW achieved an average lane departure detection rate of 99.96% and 98.95% with false positive rates (FPR) of 0.04% and 1.05% using road footage clips #5–#27 in daytime and night-time, respectively. The average FPR using data fusion-based LDW reduced by 18.83% and 15.22% compared to vision-based LDW in daytime and night-time, respectively. Conclusions: The data fusion-based LDW is a novel way of reducing false lane departure detection by fusing two types of modalities to determine the correct lane departure information. The limitation is the constant warning threshold value used in the current implementation of LDW in the vision-based LDW framework. An adaptive mechanism of warning threshold taking various road structures into account could be developed to improve lane departure detection.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Molecular characterization and genetic diversity of four undescribed novel oleaginous Mortierella alpina strains from Libya [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: A large number of undiscovered fungal species still exist on earth, which can be useful for bioprospecting, particularly for single cell oil (SCO) production. Mortierella is one of the significant genera in this field and contains about hundred species. Moreover, M. alpina is the main single cell oil producer at commercial scale under this genus. Methods: Soil samples from four unique locations of North-East Libya were collected for the isolation of oleaginous Mortierella alpina strains by a serial dilution method. Morphological identification was carried out using light microscopy (Olympus, Japan) and genetic diversity of the isolated Mortierella alpina strains was assessed using conserved internal transcribed spacer (ITS) gene sequences available on the NCBI GenBank database for the confirmation of novelty. The nucleotide sequences reported in this study have been deposited at GenBank (accession no. MZ298831:MZ298835). The MultAlin program was used to align the sequences of closely related strains. The DNA sequences were analyzed for phylogenetic relationships by molecular evolutionary genetic analysis using MEGA X software consisting of Clustal_X v.2.1 for multiple sequence alignment. The neighbour-joining tree was constructed using the Kimura 2-parameter substitution model. Results: The present research study confirms four oleaginous fungal isolates from Libyan soil. These isolates (barcoded as MSU-101, MSU-201, MSU-401 and MSU-501) were discovered and reported for the first time from diverse soil samples of district Aljabal Al-Akhdar in North-East Libya and fall in the class: Zygomycetes; order: Mortierellales. Conclusions: Four oleaginous fungal isolates barcoded as MSU-101, MSU-201, MSU-401 and MSU-501 were identified and confirmed by morphological and molecular analysis. These fungal isolates showed highest similarity with Mortierella alpina species and can be potentialistic single cell oil producers. Thus, the present research study provides insight to the unseen fungal diversity and contributes to more comprehensive Mortierella alpina reference collections worldwide.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Isolation and characterization of a heavy metal- and antibiotic-tolerant novel bacterial strain from a contaminated culture plate of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, a green micro-alga. [version 2; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, a green micro-alga, is normally cultured in laboratories in Tris-Acetate Phosphate (TAP), a medium which contains acetate as the sole carbon source. Acetate in TAP can lead to occasional bacterial and fungal contamination. We isolated a yellow-pigmented bacterium from a Chlamydomonas TAP plate. It was named Clip185 based on the Chlamydomonas strain plate it was isolated from. In this article we present our work on the isolation, taxonomic identification and physiological and biochemical characterizations of Clip185. Methods: We measured sensitivities of Clip185 to five antibiotics and performed standard microbiological tests to characterize it. We partially sequenced the 16S rRNA gene of Clip185. We identified the yellow pigment of Clip185 by spectrophotometric analyses. We tested tolerance of Clip185 to six heavy metals by monitoring its growth on Lysogeny Broth (LB) media plates containing 0.5 mM -10 mM concentrations of six different heavy metals. Results: Clip185 is an aerobic, gram-positive rod, oxidase-negative, mesophilic, alpha-hemolytic bacterium. It can ferment glucose, sucrose and mannitol. It is starch hydrolysis-positive. It is very sensitive to vancomycin but resistant to penicillin and other bacterial cell membrane- and protein synthesis-disrupting antibiotics. Clip185 produces a C50 carotenoid, decaprenoxanthin, which is a powerful anti-oxidant with a commercial demand. Decaprenoxanthin production is induced in Clip185 under light. NCBI-BLAST analyses of the partial 16S rRNA gene sequence of Clip185 revealed a 99% sequence identity to that of Microbacterium binotii strain PK1-12M and Microbacterium sp. strain MDP6. Clip185 is able to tolerate toxic concentrations of six heavy metals. Conclusions: Our results show that Clip185 belongs to the genus Microbacterium. In the future, whole genome sequencing of Clip185 will clarify if Clip185 is a new Microbacterium species or a novel strain of Microbacterium binotii, and will reveal its genes involved in antibiotic-resistance, heavy-metal tolerance and regulation of decaprenoxanthin biosynthesis.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: A digital workflow in the treatment of bruxism in a young patient [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Bruxism is increasingly common in today's stressful world and affects mainly young patients. It is a combined disease that involves dentition and its supporting structures, muscles, ligaments and the temporomandibular joint (TMJ). Here we present a complete combined analog and digital clinical protocol in a patient with parafunction. A young patient sought help due to impaired aesthetics, as a result of abraded tooth surfaces and severe symptoms of TMJ. We implemented a therapeutic protocol of six stages: deprogramming of the muscles and determination of treatment position and digital optimization; realization of the morphological plan for the upper dentition; non-invasive repositioning of the lower jaw by splint therapy; splint placement and follow-up; morphological planning of the lower dentition and replacement of the splint with fixed prosthesis with follow-up; and completion of the case with ceramic restorations. The digitally modeled temporary constructions for the upper jaw were made of PMMA and placed in the patient's mouth together with the splint on the lower jaw, made of Ceramill Splintec. After an adaptation period, all restorations were replaced by permanent zirconia. We achieved restoration of the defects of the dental arches and hard dental tissues and recovery to normal height of the lower third of the face (vertical dimension occlusion), fixed a stable and balanced position of the lower jaw, and repaired the normal physiological position of the TMJ for the patient. Аfter a multi-stage treatment we received a result satisfying the patient, the dentist and the dental technician. Aesthetics and function were restored, and clinical symptoms were removed from the TMJ.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">C. elegans LIN-28 controls temporal cell fate progression by regulating LIN-46 expression via the 5′ UTR of lin-46 mRNA</a></h4>

              
                Ilbay et al. characterize the role of the 5′ UTR of lin-46, a heterochronic gene in C. elegans and the critical mRNA target of the widely conserved RNA-binding protein LIN-28, demonstrating the importance of the regulation of mRNAs by LIN-28 in vivo along with the conserved microRNA let-7.
