">Evidence for an efferent-based prediction contributing to implicit motor adaptation</a></h4>

              
                Models of sensorimotor adaptation have proposed that implicit adaptation is driven by error signals created by discrepancies between various sensory information sources. While proprioception has been suggested as a critical source for the error signals driving adaptation, the role of an efferent-based motor prediction has largely been neglected. In this study, we examined the effect of dissociating the afferent and efferent information available during implicit adaptation. Participants moved a visual cursor towards targets by applying horizontal forces to a stationary handle at a central home location. During perturbation trials, the cursor followed an invariant path rotated relative to the target. Participants were instructed to ignore this task-irrelevant cursor feedback and to isometrically "reach" towards the target. Participants implicitly adapted in the isometric task, even when the hand never actually moved to the target. Moreover, the level of adaptation surpassed that of a typical clamped reaching paradigm by nearly twofold. This was confirmed in a secondary experiment where participants performed actual reaching movements and demonstrated significantly less adaptation. Our findings suggest that while afferent proprioceptive feedback of hand position around the target most likely plays a role in adaptation, it is not necessary to induce adaptation.

	<p>Long-duration bedrest impairs upright postural and locomotor control, prompting the need for assessment tools to predict the effects of deconditioning on post-bedrest outcome measures. We developed a tilt board mounted vertically with a horizontal air-bearing sled as a potential supine assessment tool for a future bedrest study. The purpose of this pilot study was to examine the association between supine proprioceptive assessments on the tilt board and upright functional mobility. Seventeen healthy participants completed variations of a supine tilt board task and an upright functional mobility task (FMT), which is an established obstacle avoidance course. During the supine tasks, participants lay on the air-bearing sled with axial loading toward the tilt board. Participants tilted the board to capture virtual targets on an overhead monitor during 30 s trials. The tasks included two dynamic tasks (i.e., double-leg stance matching mediolateral tilt targets over &amp;amp;plusmn;3&amp;amp;deg; or &amp;amp;plusmn;9&amp;amp;deg; ranges) and two static tasks (i.e., single-leg stance maintaining a central target position). The performances during the dynamic tasks were significantly correlated with the FMT time to completion. The dominant-leg static task performance showed a moderate trend with the FMT time to completion. The results indicate that supine proprioceptive assessments may be associated with upright ambulation performance, and thus, support the proposed application in bedrest studies.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/11/7/ENEURO.0019-24.2024?rss=1">Pharmacological Elevation of Catecholamine Levels Improves Perceptual Decisions, But Not Metacognitive Insight</a></h4>

              
                <p>Perceptual decisions are often accompanied by a feeling of decision confidence. Where the parietal cortex is known for its crucial role in shaping such perceptual decisions, metacognitive evaluations are thought to additionally rely on the (pre)frontal cortex. Because of this supposed neural differentiation between these processes, perceptual and metacognitive decisions may be divergently affected by changes in internal (e.g., attention, arousal) and external (e.g., task and environmental demands) factors. Although intriguing, causal evidence for this hypothesis remains scarce. Here, we investigated the causal effect of two neuromodulatory systems on behavioral and neural measures of perceptual and metacognitive decision-making. Specifically, we pharmacologically elevated levels of catecholamines (with atomoxetine) and acetylcholine (with donepezil) in healthy adult human participants performing a visual discrimination task in which we gauged decision confidence, while electroencephalography was measured. Where cholinergic effects were not robust, catecholaminergic enhancement improved perceptual sensitivity, while at the same time leaving metacognitive sensitivity unaffected. Neurally, catecholaminergic elevation did not affect sensory representations of task-relevant visual stimuli but instead enhanced well-known decision signals measured over the centroparietal cortex, reflecting the accumulation of sensory evidence over time. Crucially, catecholaminergic enhancement concurrently impoverished neural markers measured over the frontal cortex linked to the formation of metacognitive evaluations. Enhanced catecholaminergic neuromodulation thus improves perceptual but not metacognitive decision-making.</p>

                <p>Early-life stressors can affect reproductive development and change responses to adult stress. We tested if resource scarcity in the form of limited bedding and nesting (LBN) from postnatal days (PND) 4 to 11 delayed sexual maturation in male and female mice and/or altered the response to an acute, layered, psychosocial stress (ALPS) in adulthood. Contrary to the hypotheses, age and mass at puberty were unaffected by the present application of LBN. Under basal conditions and after ALPS, corticosterone concentrations in males, diestrous females, and proestrous females reared in standard (STD) or LBN environments were similar. ALPS disrupts the luteinizing hormone (LH) surge in most mice when applied on the morning of proestrus; this effect was not changed by resource scarcity. In this study, the paucity of effects in the offspring may relate to a milder response of CBA dams to the paradigm. While LBN dams exited the nest more often and their offspring were smaller than STD-reared offspring on PND11, dam corticosterone concentrations were similar on PND11. To test if ALPS disrupts the LH surge by blunting the increase in excitatory GABAergic input to gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons on the afternoon of proestrus, we conducted whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings. The frequency of GABAergic postsynaptic currents in GnRH neurons was not altered by LBN, ALPS, or their interaction. It remains possible that ALPS acts at afferents of GnRH neurons, changes response of GnRH neurons to input, and/or alters pituitary responsiveness to GnRH and that a more pronounced resource scarcity would affect the parameters studied.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/11/7/ENEURO.0203-24.2024?rss=1">Impact of Unitary Synaptic Inhibition on Spike Timing in Ventral Tegmental Area Dopamine Neurons</a></h4>

              
                <p>Midbrain dopamine neurons receive convergent synaptic input from multiple brain areas, which perturbs rhythmic pacemaking to produce the complex firing patterns observed in vivo. This study investigated the impact of single and multiple inhibitory inputs on ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine neuron firing in mice of both sexes using novel experimental measurements and modeling. We first measured unitary inhibitory postsynaptic currents produced by single axons using both minimal electrical stimulation and minimal optical stimulation of rostromedial tegmental nucleus and ventral pallidum afferents. We next determined the phase resetting curve, the reversal potential for GABA<SUB>A</SUB> receptor-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs), and the average interspike membrane potential trajectory during pacemaking. We combined these data in a phase oscillator model of a VTA dopamine neuron, simulating the effects of unitary inhibitory postsynaptic conductances (uIPSGs) on spike timing and rate. The effect of a uIPSG on spike timing was predicted to vary according to its timing within the interspike interval or phase. Simulations were performed to predict the pause duration resulting from the synchronous arrival of multiple uIPSGs and the changes in firing rate and regularity produced by asynchronous uIPSGs. The model data suggest that asynchronous inhibition is more effective than synchronous inhibition, because it tends to hold the neuron at membrane potentials well positive to the IPSC reversal potential. Our results indicate that small fluctuations in the inhibitory synaptic input arriving from the many afferents to each dopamine neuron are sufficient to produce highly variable firing patterns, including pauses that have been implicated in reinforcement.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-844/v1?src=rss">Implementation of Chernobyl optimization algorithm based feature selection approach to predict software defects [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Software defects can have catastrophic consequences. Therefore, fixing these defects is crucial for the evolution of software. Software Defect Prediction (SDP) enables developers to investigate unscramble faults in the inaugural parts of the software progression mechanism. However, SDP faces many challenges, including the high magnitude of attributes in the datasets, which can degrade the prognostic performance of a defect forecasting model. Feature selection (FS), a compelling instrument for overcoming high dimensionality, selects only the relevant and best features while carefully discarding others. Over the years, several meta-heuristic algorithms such as the Genetic Algorithm (GA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Differential Evolution (DE), and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) have been used to develop defect prediction models. However, these models suffer from several drawbacks, such as high cost, local optima trap, lower convergence rate, and higher parameter tuning. To overcome the above shortcomings, this study aims to develop an innovative FS technique, namely, the Chernobyl Optimization Algorithm (FSCOA), to unwrap the most informative features that can produce a precise prediction model while minimizing errors. Methods The proposed FSCOA approach mimicked the process of nuclear radiation while attacking humans after an explosion. The proposed FSCOA approach was combined with four widely used classifiers, namely Decision Tree (DT), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), Naive Bayes (NB), and Quantitative Discriminant Analysis (QDA), to determine the finest attributes from the SDP datasets. Furthermore, the accuracy of the recommended FSCOA method is correlated with existing FS techniques, such as FSDE, FSPSO, FSACO, and FSGA. The statistical merit of the proposed measure was verified using Friedman and Holm tests. Results The experimental findings showed that the proposed FSCOA approach yielded the best accuracy in most cases and achieved an average rank of 1.75, followed by the other studied FS approaches. Furthermore, the Holm test showed that the p-value was lower than or equivalent to the value of α/(A-i), except for the FSCOA and FSGA and FSCOA and FSACO models. Conclusion The experimental findings showed that the prospective FSCOA procedure eclipsed alternative FS techniques with higher accuracy in almost all cases while selecting optimal features.

                Background Prediabetes, a reversible condition before the onset of diabetes, is a significant concern in healthcare globally. The global prediabetes epidemic has emerged and has considerably impacted health expenditures. Various risk factors play important roles in the progression of prediabetes to diabetes. Intensive lifestyle and pharmacological interventions can significantly reduce the risk of diabetes progression. Objective This study aimed to determine the prevalence, characteristics, and risk factors of prediabetes state of Medan in August 2023. Methods The sample consisted of 89 participants. This was an analytical cross-sectional study in the community that met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The determination of prediabetes is based on the results of blood tests, namely, the examination of fasting blood sugar levels (FBGL), 2-hour postprandial oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1C). Other examinations included lipid profiling (total cholesterol, HDL-C, LDL-C, and triglycerides). Data processing was performed using SPSS via univariate and bivariate analyses (chi-square test). Results Of the 89 participants, the prevalence of prediabetes based on HbA1c, FBGL and 2-hours OGTT levels was 28.1%, 50.6%, and 28.1%, respectively. 82% of the participants were female, and 53.9% were overweight or obese based on body mass index (BMI). The risk factors related to the prevalence of prediabetes were HbA1c level, impaired FBGL, and impaired 2-hours OGTT. Other risk factors such as age, sex, daily exercise, diet, BMI, waist-hip ratio, acanthosis nigricans, lipid profile, and blood pressure did not correlate significantly with the risk factors (p>0.05). Conclusion This study found that the prevalence of prediabetes was 67.4% in Medan, 82% of the participants were female, and more than 50% of participants were overweight or obese. HbA1c, FBGL, and 2-hour postprandial OGTT were the most important risk factors for prediabetes.

                Background Gingival recession is a concern in aesthetic and functional perspective. The tunneling technique (TT) is one of the effective root coverage treatments in some gingival recession defects and is associated with favorable outcomes. This paper aims to evaluate the effectiveness of platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) and connective tissue graft (CTG) in gingival recession treatment with TT. Methods This systematic review used the PRISMA method and electronic bibliographic searches were conducted on seven databases (Google Scholar, Wiley, Pubmed, Sage, Ovid Technologies, Quintessence Publishing, Springer) from December 2018 to January 2023. The search focused on randomized clinical trials (RCTs) that reported TT outcomes in the treatment of Miller class I and II recession with a minimum of six months follow-up. Results Three out of 399 studies met the inclusion criteria. The three selected studies presented PRF and CTG use in multiple gingival recessions to evaluate tissue condition and clinical parameters before and after the surgical procedure. The clinical parameters evaluated were probing pocket depth (PPD), recession width (RW), width of keratinized gingiva (WKG), and vertical depth of recession (VDR). TT with PRF and TT with CTG is effective in treating gingival recession. PRF is well accepted by patients with a less invasive procedure compared to the CTG procedure. However, TT with CTG showed better results in all parameters at follow-up. Conclusions TT with PRF can be used as an alternative to treat some gingival recession defects. However, TT with CTG produced better clinical results in recession closure.

                Background This article aims to study the research outcomes of five Nordic countries in terms of research publications, spend on R&D, outcomes and collaborations as these are important parameters to understand research thrust of the countries/regions, in addition to their innovation capability. Methods The research outcomes of the Nordic countries in terms of the total number of publications, coauthored publications, publications with corporate collaborators, citations, the Field Weighted Citation Index (FWCI) and publications in different subject areas were retrieved using Scopus and its associate SciVal. The research outcomes were extracted for five years from 2016-2020. In addition, total population, researcher population and research spend of these countries have been obtained from World Bank data available for the year 2021. Results The analysis showed that Sweden has the highest population and the highest number of researchers in this region. All countries have the highest number of coauthored publications with the United States, followed by the United Kingdom, except Iceland, which has the second highest number of coauthored publications with Sweden. Denmark, followed by Iceland, stands prominent with reference to having publications with corporate collaborations. Denmark and Sweden have a high percentage of articles in first quartile journals, which is above the average for Nordic countries. Iceland stands at the top with the highest citations, which is depicted by high FWCI. Across subject areas, the Nordic countries have maximum publications in life sciences. Other prominent subject areas include technology and natural sciences. Conclusion On analysing the research landscape of Nordic countries, maximum research output is in the field of life sciences and medicine, and most of the coauthored publications of these countries are with the United States. Denmark, with its exemplary research output, excels with maximum papers in top quartile journals and with maximum corporate collaborations and the highest FWCI.

                Background Since the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 outbreak a global pandemic and the global spread had created several challenges for the general public and the healthcare workers across the world, the primary aim of this study was to assess the psychological stress, sleep quality, and health-related quality of life (QoL) of individuals with multiple health issues during home quarantine caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods The study was conducted between 28th March to 30th April 2020. We recruited 50 individuals who have a history of chronic health issues, and 50 individuals with no health issues for this cross-sectional study. Three questionnaires were used to evaluate the mental health [depression anxiety stress scale (DASS-21)], sleep quality [Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI)], and QoL [short form of health-related questionnaire (SF-36)] of the participants. Statistical analysis was carried out with Student’s t-test, using SPSS software v16. Results Baseline demographic characteristics were homogenous for both groups of participants. Intergroup analysis revealed statistically significant differences in mental health (p<0.001), sleep quality (p<0.001), and QoL (p<0.001) between the two groups. The results showed high levels of depression, anxiety and stress; poor sleep quality and low health-related QoL in Group A as compared to Group B. Conclusion Our findings indicate that individuals with chronic health issues exhibit higher mental health problems, lower quality of sleep and have a lower health-related QoL. More research is required and also government should plan on taking care of those patients.

                <p>by Beth M. Tuschhoff, David A. Kennedy</p>

The presence of heterogeneity in susceptibility, differences between hosts in their likelihood of becoming infected, can fundamentally alter disease dynamics and public health responses, for example, by changing the final epidemic size, the duration of an epidemic, and even the vaccination threshold required to achieve herd immunity. Yet, heterogeneity in susceptibility is notoriously difficult to detect and measure, especially early in an epidemic. Here we develop a method that can be used to detect and estimate heterogeneity in susceptibility given contact by using contact tracing data, which is typically collected early in the course of an outbreak. This approach provides the capability, given sufficient data, to estimate and account for the effects of this heterogeneity before they become apparent during an epidemic. It additionally provides the capability to analyze the wealth of contact tracing data available for previous epidemics and estimate heterogeneity in susceptibility for disease systems in which it has never been estimated previously. The premise of our approach is that highly susceptible individuals become infected more often than less susceptible individuals, and so individuals not infected after appearing in contact networks should be less susceptible than average. This change in susceptibility can be detected and quantified when individuals show up in a second contact network after not being infected in the first. To develop our method, we simulated contact tracing data from artificial populations with known levels of heterogeneity in susceptibility according to underlying discrete or continuous distributions of susceptibilities. We analyzed this data to determine the parameter space under which we are able to detect heterogeneity and the accuracy with which we are able to estimate it. We found that our power to detect heterogeneity increases with larger sample sizes, greater heterogeneity, and intermediate fractions of contacts becoming infected in the discrete case or greater fractions of contacts becoming infected in the continuous case. We also found that we are able to reliably estimate heterogeneity and disease dynamics. Ultimately, this means that contact tracing data alone is sufficient to detect and quantify heterogeneity in susceptibility.

                <p>by Diogo Melo, Luisa F. Pallares, Julien F. Ayroles</p>

Finding communities in gene co-expression networks is a common first step toward extracting biological insight from these complex datasets. Most community detection algorithms expect genes to be organized into assortative modules, that is, groups of genes that are more associated with each other than with genes in other groups. While it is reasonable to expect that these modules exist, using methods that assume they exist a priori is risky, as it guarantees that alternative organizations of gene interactions will be ignored. Here, we ask: can we find meaningful communities without imposing a modular organization on gene co-expression networks, and how modular are these communities? For this, we use a recently developed community detection method, the weighted degree corrected stochastic block model (SBM), that does not assume that assortative modules exist. Instead, the SBM attempts to efficiently use all information contained in the co-expression network to separate the genes into hierarchically organized blocks of genes. Using RNA-seq gene expression data measured in two tissues derived from an outbred population of, we show that (a) the SBM is able to find ten times as many groups as competing methods, that (b) several of those gene groups are not modular, and that (c) the functional enrichment for non-modular groups is as strong as for modular communities. These results show that the transcriptome is structured in more complex ways than traditionally thought and that we should revisit the long-standing assumption that modularity is the main driver of the structuring of gene co-expression networks.

Collective alignment of cell populations is a commonly observed phenomena in biology. An important example are aligning fibroblasts in healthy or scar tissue. In this work we derive and simulate a mechanistic agent-based model of the collective behaviour of actively moving and interacting cells, with a focus on understanding collective alignment. The derivation strategy is based on energy minimisation. The model ingredients are motivated by data on the behaviour of different populations of aligning fibroblasts and include: Self-propulsion, overlap avoidance, deformability, cell-cell junctions and cytoskeletal forces. We find that there is an optimal ratio of self-propulsion speed and overlap avoidance that maximises collective alignment. Further we find that deformability aids alignment, and that cell-cell junctions by themselves hinder alignment. However, if cytoskeletal forces are transmitted via cell-cell junctions we observe strong collective alignment over large spatial scales.

                <p>by Matthieu Bouguéon, Vincent Legagneux, Octave Hazard, Jérémy Bomo, Anne Siegel, Jérôme Feret, Nathalie Théret</p>

Hepatic stellate cells (HSC) are the source of extracellular matrix (ECM) whose overproduction leads to fibrosis, a condition that impairs liver functions in chronic liver diseases. Understanding the dynamics of HSCs will provide insights needed to develop new therapeutic approaches. Few models of hepatic fibrosis have been proposed, and none of them include the heterogeneity of HSC phenotypes recently highlighted by single-cell RNA sequencing analyses. Here, we developed rule-based models to study HSC dynamics during fibrosis progression and reversion. We used the Kappa graph rewriting language, for which we used tokens and counters to overcome temporal explosion. HSCs are modeled as agents that present seven physiological cellular states and that interact with (TGF<i>β</i>1) molecules which regulate HSC activation and the secretion of type I collagen, the main component of the ECM. Simulation studies revealed the critical role of the HSC inactivation process during fibrosis progression and reversion. While inactivation allows elimination of activated HSCs during reversion steps, reactivation loops of inactivated HSCs (iHSCs) are required to sustain fibrosis. Furthermore, we demonstrated the model’s sensitivity to (TGF<i>β</i>1) parameters, suggesting its adaptability to a variety of pathophysiological conditions for which levels of (TGF<i>β</i>1) production associated with the inflammatory response differ. Using new experimental data from a mouse model of CCl4-induced liver fibrosis, we validated the predicted ECM dynamics. Our model also predicts the accumulation of iHSCs during chronic liver disease. By analyzing RNA sequencing data from patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) associated with liver fibrosis, we confirmed this accumulation, identifying iHSCs as novel markers of fibrosis progression. Overall, our study provides the first model of HSC dynamics in chronic liver disease that can be used to explore the regulatory role of iHSCs in liver homeostasis. Moreover, our model can also be generalized to fibroblasts during repair and fibrosis in other tissues.

                <p>by Chengxin Zhang, Lydia Freddolino</p>

Despite the increasing number of 3D RNA structures in the Protein Data Bank, the majority of experimental RNA structures lack thorough functional annotations. As the significance of the functional roles played by noncoding RNAs becomes increasingly apparent, comprehensive annotation of RNA function is becoming a pressing concern. In response to this need, we have developed FURNA (Functions of RNAs), the first database for experimental RNA structures that aims to provide a comprehensive repository of high-quality functional annotations. These include Gene Ontology terms, Enzyme Commission numbers, ligand-binding sites, RNA families, protein-binding motifs, and cross-references to related databases. FURNA is available at https://seq2fun.dcmb.med.umich.edu/furna/ to enable quick discovery of RNA functions from their structures and sequences.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Intellectual disability is often the outcome of neurodevelopmental disorders and is characterized by significant impairments in intellectual and adaptive functioning. X-linked intellectual disability (XLID) is a subset of these disorders caused by genetic defects on the X chromosome, affecting about 2 out of 1,000 males. In syndromic form, it leads to a broad range of cognitive, behavioral, ocular, and physical disabilities.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Employing exome or genome sequencing, here we identified 4 missense variants (c.475C &gt; G; p.H159D, c.1373C &gt; A; p.T458N, and c.1585G &gt; A; p.E529K, c.953C &gt; T; p.S318L) and a putative truncating variant (c.1413_1414del; p.Y471*) in the <i>SRPK3</i> gene in 9 XLID patients from 5 unrelated families. To validate <i>SRPK3</i> as a novel XLID gene, we established a knockout (KO) model of the <i>SRPK3</i> orthologue in zebrafish.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The 8 patients ascertained postnatally shared common clinical features including intellectual disability, agenesis of the corpus callosum, abnormal eye movement, and ataxia. A ninth case, ascertained prenatally, had a complex structural brain phenotype. Together, these data indicate a pathological role of <i>SRPK3</i> in neurodevelopmental disorders. In post-fertilization day 5 larvae (free swimming stage), KO zebrafish exhibited severe deficits in eye movement and swim bladder inflation, mimicking uncontrolled ocular movement and physical clumsiness observed in human patients. In adult KO zebrafish, cerebellar agenesis and behavioral abnormalities were observed, recapitulating human phenotypes of cerebellar atrophy and intellectual disability.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Overall, these results suggest a crucial role of <i>SRPK3</i> in the pathogenesis of syndromic X-linked intellectual disability and provide new insights into brain development, cognitive and ocular dysfunction in both humans and zebrafish. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96602">Drosophila HCN mediates gustatory homeostasis by preserving sensillar transepithelial potential in sweet environments</a></h4>

              
                Establishing transepithelial ion disparities is crucial for sensory functions in animals. In insect sensory organs called sensilla, a transepithelial potential, known as the sensillum potential (SP), arises through active ion transport across accessory cells, sensitizing receptor neurons such as mechanoreceptors and chemoreceptors. Because multiple receptor neurons are often co-housed in a sensillum and share SP, niche-prevalent overstimulation of single sensory neurons can compromise neighboring receptors by depleting SP. However, how such potential depletion is prevented to maintain sensory homeostasis remains unknown. Here, we find that the <i>Ih-</i>encoded hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channel bolsters the activity of bitter-sensing gustatory receptor neurons (bGRNs), albeit acting in sweet-sensing GRNs (sGRNs). For this task, HCN maintains SP despite prolonged sGRN stimulation induced by the diet mimicking their sweet feeding niche, such as overripe fruit. We present evidence that <i>Ih</i>-dependent demarcation of sGRN excitability is implemented to throttle SP consumption, which may have facilitated adaptation to a sweetness-dominated environment. Thus, HCN expressed in sGRNs serves as a key component of a simple yet versatile peripheral coding that regulates bitterness for optimal food intake in two contrasting ways: sweet-resilient preservation of bitter aversion and the previously reported sweet-dependent suppression of bitter taste.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96979">A genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screen identifies calreticulin as a selective repressor of ATF6α</a></h4>

              
                Activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) is one of three endoplasmic reticulum (ER) transmembrane stress sensors that mediate the unfolded protein response (UPR). Despite its crucial role in long-term ER stress adaptation, regulation of ATF6 alpha (α) signalling remains poorly understood, possibly because its activation involves ER-to-Golgi and nuclear trafficking. Here, we generated an ATF6α/Inositol-requiring kinase 1 (IRE1) dual UPR reporter CHO-K1 cell line and performed an unbiased genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis screen to systematically profile genetic factors that specifically contribute to ATF6α signalling in the presence and absence of ER stress. The screen identified both anticipated and new candidate genes that regulate ATF6α activation. Among these, calreticulin (CRT), a key ER luminal chaperone, selectively repressed ATF6α signalling: Cells lacking CRT constitutively activated a BiP::sfGFP ATF6α-dependent reporter, had higher BiP levels and an increased rate of trafficking and processing of ATF6α. Purified CRT interacted with the luminal domain of ATF6α <i>in vitro</i> and the two proteins co-immunoprecipitated from cell lysates. CRT depletion exposed a negative feedback loop implicating ATF6α in repressing IRE1 activity basally and overexpression of CRT reversed this repression. Our findings indicate that CRT, beyond its known role as a chaperone, also serves as an ER repressor of ATF6α to selectively regulate one arm of the UPR.

                The cerebellum contributes to a diverse array of motor conditions, including ataxia, dystonia, and tremor. The neural substrates that encode this diversity are unclear. Here, we tested whether the neural spike activity of cerebellar output neurons is distinct between movement disorders with different impairments, generalizable across movement disorders with similar impairments, and capable of causing distinct movement impairments. Using in vivo awake recordings as input data, we trained a supervised classifier model to differentiate the spike parameters between mouse models for ataxia, dystonia, and tremor. The classifier model correctly assigned mouse phenotypes based on single-neuron signatures. Spike signatures were shared across etiologically distinct but phenotypically similar disease models. Mimicking these pathophysiological spike signatures with optogenetics induced the predicted motor impairments in otherwise healthy mice. These data show that distinct spike signatures promote the behavioral presentation of cerebellar diseases.

">Hypersensitivity controlled by mir-9a modulates female receptivity of Drosophila melanogaster.</a></h4>

              
                Female Drosophila melanogaster undergo a complex behavioral transformation following mating, characterized by increased sensory sensitivity and altered reproductive behaviors. In this study, we investigated the role of miR-9a, a conserved microRNA, in regulating these post-mating changes. We found that miR-9a mutant females exhibited a hypersensitivity phenotype, with increased rejection of courting males, delayed onset of sexual receptivity, and abnormal mating termination behavior. This phenotype was associated with aberrant overgrowth of adult body wall sensory neurons, suggesting a link between neuronal hypersensitivity and reproductive behavior. To further elucidate the underlying mechanisms, we performed genetic interaction studies with sens and bru2, genes known to interact with miR-9a. We found that removing one copy of sens or bru2 in miR-9a mutant backgrounds rescued the female rejection phenotype and normalized neuronal morphology. This suggests that miR-9a regulates sensory neuron development and female receptivity by modulating the expression of target genes like sens and bru2. Our findings reveal a novel role for miR-9a in regulating sensory hypersensitivity and reproductive behaviors in Drosophila. This research provides valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying post-mating behavioral adaptations and neural development. Additionally, our findings highlight the potential of Drosophila as a model organism for investigating the role of miR-9 family members in neuronal specification and function, with implications for understanding sensory processing and neural plasticity in other organisms.

">Brown Adipose Tissue undergoes pathological perturbations and shapes C2C12 myoblast homeostasis in the SOD1-G93A mouse model of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.</a></h4>

              
                Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by the selective loss of motor neurons. While the contribution of peripheral organs remains incompletely understood, recent evidence suggests that brown adipose tissue (BAT) and its secreted extracellular vesicles (EVs) could play a role in diseased context as ALS. In this study, we employed a multi-omics approach, including RNA sequencing (GEO identifier GSE273052) and proteomics (ProteomeXchange identifier PXD054147), to investigate the alterations in BAT and its EVs in the SOD1-G93A mouse model of ALS. Our results revealed significant changes in the proteomic and transcriptomic profiles of BAT from SOD1-G93A mice, highlighting ALS-related features such as mitochondrial dysfunction and impaired differentiation capacity. Specifically, primary brown adipocytes (PBAs) from SOD1-G93A mice exhibited differentiation impairment, respiratory defects, and alterations in mitochondrial dynamics. Furthermore, the BAT-derived EVs from SOD1-G93A mice displayed distinct changes in size distribution and cargo content, which negatively impacted the differentiation and homeostasis of C2C12 murine myoblasts, as well as induced atrophy in C2C12-derived myotubes. These findings suggest that BAT undergoes pathological perturbations in ALS, contributing to skeletal muscle degeneration through the secretion of dysfunctional EVs. This study provides novel insights into the role of BAT in ALS pathogenesis and highlights potential therapeutic targets for mitigating muscle wasting in ALS patients.

">The connectional diaschisis and normalization of cortical language network dynamics after basal ganglia and thalamus stroke</a></h4>

              
                Stroke affecting the basal ganglia and thalamus can lead to language deficits. In addition to the lesion's direct impact on language processing, connectional diaschisis involving cortical-subcortical interactions also plays a critical role. This study investigated connectional diaschisis using the "dynamic meta-networking framework of language" in patients with basal ganglia and thalamus stroke, analyzing longitudinal resting-state fMRI data collected at 2 weeks (n = 32), 3 months (n = 19), and one year post-stroke (n = 23). As expected, we observed dynamic cortico-subcortical interactions between cortical language regions and subcortical regions in healthy controls (HC, n = 25). The cortical language network exhibited dynamic domain-segregation patterns in HCs, severely disrupted in the acute phase following stroke. The connectional diaschisis manifested as dual effects characterized by both hypo- and hyper-connectivity, which positively and negatively correlated with language deficits, respectively. State-specific changes in nodal and topological properties were also identified. Throughout language recovery, cortical language network dynamics gradually normalized toward sub-optimal domain-segregation patterns, accompanied by the normalization of nodal and topological properties. These findings underscore the crucial role of cortico-subcortical interactions in language processing.

                Introduction: African Americans (AA) are widely understudied in plasma biomarker studies for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and current diagnostic biomarker candidates do not reflect the heterogeneity of AD. Methods: Untargeted proteome measurements were obtained using the SomaScan 7k platform to identify novel plasma biomarkers for AD in a cohort of AA clinically diagnosed as AD dementia (n=183) or cognitively unimpaired (CU, n=145). Machine learning approaches were implemented to identify the set of plasma proteins that achieve the best classification accuracy. Results: A plasma protein panel achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.91 to classify AD dementia vs CU. The reproducibility of this finding was observed in the ANMerge plasma and AMP-AD Diversity brain datasets (AUC=0.83; AUC=0.94). Discussion: This study demonstrates the potential of biomarker discovery through untargeted plasma proteomics and machine learning approaches. Our findings also highlight the potential importance of the matrisome and cerebrovascular dysfunction in AD pathophysiology.

">Using DeepLabCut-Live to probe state dependent neural circuits of behavior with closed-loop optogenetic stimulation</a></h4>

              
                Background: Closed-loop behavior paradigms enable us to dissect the state-dependent neural circuits underlying behavior in real-time. However, studying context-dependent locomotor perturbations has been challenging due to limitations in molecular tools and techniques for real-time manipulation of spinal cord circuits. New Method: We developed a novel closed-loop optogenetic stimulation paradigm that utilizes DeepLabCut-Live pose estimation to manipulate primary sensory afferent activity at specific phases of the locomotor cycle in mice. A compact DeepLabCut model was trained to track hindlimb kinematics in real-time and integrated into the Bonsai visual programming framework. This allowed an LED to be triggered to photo-stimulate sensory neurons expressing channelrhodopsin at user-defined pose-based criteria, such as during the stance or swing phase. Results: Optogenetic activation of nociceptive TRPV1+ sensory neurons during treadmill locomotion reliably evoked paw withdrawal responses. Photoactivation during stance generated a brief withdrawal, while stimulation during swing elicited a prolonged response likely engaging stumbling corrective reflexes. Comparison with Existing Methods: This new method allows for high spatiotemporal precision in manipulating spinal circuits based on the phase of the locomotor cycle. Unlike previous approaches, this closed-loop system can control for the state-dependent nature of sensorimotor responses during locomotion. Conclusions: Integrating DeepLabCut-Live with optogenetics provides a powerful new approach to dissect the context-dependent role of sensory feedback and spinal interneurons in modulating locomotion. This technique opens new avenues for uncovering the neural substrates of state-dependent behaviors and has broad applicability for studies of real-time closed-loop manipulation based on pose estimation.

">Deliberative Behaviors and Prefrontal-Hippocampal Coupling are Disrupted in a Rat Model of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders</a></h4>

              
                Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) are characterized by a range of physical, cognitive, and behavioral impairments. Determining how temporally specific alcohol exposure (AE) affects neural circuits is crucial to understanding the FASD phenotype. Third trimester AE can be modeled in rats by administering alcohol during the first two postnatal weeks, which damages the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), thalamic nucleus reuniens, and hippocampus (HPC), structures whose functional interactions are required for working memory and executive function. Therefore, we hypothesized that AE during this period would impair working memory, disrupt choice behaviors, and alter mPFC-HPC oscillatory synchrony. To test this hypothesis, we recorded local field potentials from the mPFC and dorsal HPC as AE and sham intubated (SI) rats performed a spatial working memory task in adulthood and implemented algorithms to detect vicarious trial and errors (VTEs), behaviors associated with deliberative decision-making. We found that, compared to the SI group, the AE group performed fewer VTEs and demonstrated a disturbed relationship between VTEs and choice outcomes, while spatial working memory was unimpaired. This behavioral disruption was accompanied by alterations to mPFC and HPC oscillatory activity in the theta and beta bands, respectively, and a reduced prevalence of mPFC-HPC synchronous events. When trained on multiple behavioral variables, a machine learning algorithm could accurately predict whether rats were in the AE or SI group, thus characterizing a potential phenotype following third trimester AE. Together, these findings indicate that third trimester AE disrupts mPFC-HPC oscillatory interactions and choice behaviors.

">Lifespan Oscillatory Dynamics in Lexical Production: A Population-based MEG Resting-State Analysis</a></h4>

              
                Lexical production remains relatively preserved across the lifespan, but cognitive control demands increase with age to support efficient semantic access. It suggests a domain-general and a language-specific component. Current neurocognitive models suggest the Default Mode Network (DMN) may drive the interplay between these components, impacting the trajectory of production performance with a pivotal shift around midlife. However, the corresponding time-varying architecture still needs clarification. Here, we leveraged MEG resting-state data from healthy adults aged 18-88 from a CamCAN population-based sample. We found that DMN temporal dynamics shift from anterior-ventral to posterior-dorsal states until midlife to mitigate word-finding challenges. Similarly, sensorimotor integration along this posterior path enhances cross-talk with lower-level circuitry as the dynamic information flow with more anterior, higher-order cognitive states gets compromised. It suggests a bottom-up, exploitation-based form of cognitive control in the aging brain, highlighting the interplay between abstraction, control, and perceptive-motor systems in preserving lexical production.

">Monkey lateral prefrontal cortex subregions differentiate between perceptual exposure to visual stimuli</a></h4>

              
                In everyday life, humans must parse visual stimuli with highly variable amounts of perceptual experience, ranging from incredibly familiar to entirely new. Even when choosing a novel to buy at a bookstore, one is exposed to covers they have seen numerous times intermixed with recently released titles. Visual exposure to stimuli is known to have distinct neural correlates in the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) of nonhuman primates. However, it is currently unknown if this function may be localized to specific subregions within the LPFC. Specifically, we aimed to determine whether the posterior fundus of area 46 (p46f), an area that responds to deviations from a learned sequence, also responds to less frequently presented stimuli outside of the sequential context. We compare responses in p46f to the adjacent subregion, posterior ventral area 46 (p46v), which we propose may be more likely to show exposure-dependent responses due to its proximity to known novelty responsive regions. To test whether p46f or p46v represent perceptual exposure, we performed awake functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) on three male monkeys as they observed visual stimuli that varied in their number of daily presentations. Here we show that p46v, but not p46f, shows preferential activation to stimuli with low perceptual exposure, which further localizes exposure-dependent effects in monkey LPFC. These results align with previous research that has found novelty responses in ventral LPFC and are consistent with the designation of p46f as having a sequence-specific function. Further, they expand on our knowledge of the specific role of LPFC subregions and localize perceptual exposure processing within this broader brain region.

">Cognitive sequences in obsessive-compulsive disorder are supported by frontal cortex ramping activity and mediated by symptom severity</a></h4>

              
                Completing sequences is a part of everyday life. Many such sequences can be considered abstract - that is, defined by a rule that governs the order but not the identity of individual steps (e.g., getting dressed for work). Over-engagement in ritualistic and repetitive behaviors seen in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) suggests that abstract sequences may be disrupted in this disorder. Previous work has shown the necessity of the rostrolateral prefrontal cortex (RLPFC) for abstract sequence processing and that neural activity increases (ramps) in this region across sequences (Desrochers, Chatham, & Badre, 2015; Desrochers, Collins, & Badre, 2019). Neurobiological models of the cortico-striatal-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) loops describe prefrontal circuitry connected to RLPFC and that is believed to be dysfunctional in OCD. As a potential extension of these models, we hypothesized that neural dynamics of RLPFC could be disrupted in OCD during abstract sequence engagement. We found that neural dynamics in RLPFC did not differ between OCD and healthy controls (HCs), but that increased ramping in pregenual anterior cingulate cortex (pACC), and superior frontal sulcus (SFS) dissociates these two groups in an abstract sequence paradigm. Further, we found that anxiety and depression symptoms mediated the relationship between observed neural activity and behavioral differences observed in the task. This study highlights the importance of investigating ramping as a relevant neural dynamic during sequences and suggests expansion of current neurobiological models to include regions that support sequential behavior in OCD. Further, our results may point to novel regions to consider for neuromodulatory treatments of OCD in the future.

">From circuits to lifespan: translating mouse and human timelines with neuroimaging based tractography</a></h4>

              
                Age is a major predictor of developmental processes and disease risk, but humans and model systems (e.g., mice) differ substantially in the pace of development and aging. The timeline of human developmental circuits is well known. It is unclear how such timelines compare to those in mice. We lack age alignments across the lifespan of mice and humans. Here, we build upon our Translating Time resource, which is a tool that equates corresponding ages during development. We collected 477 time points (n=1,132 observations) from age-related changes in body, bone, dental, and brain processes to equate corresponding ages across humans and mice. We acquired high- resolution diffusion MR scans of mouse brains (n=12) at sequential stages of postnatal development (postnatal day 3, 4, 12, 21, 60) to trace the timeline of brain circuit maturation (e.g., olfactory association pathway, corpus callosum). We found heterogeneity in white matter pathway growth. The corpus callosum largely ceases to grow days after birth while the olfactory association pathway grows through P60. We found that a P3 mouse equates to a human at roughly GW24, and a P60 mouse equates to a human in teenage years. Therefore, white matter pathway maturation is extended in mice as it is in humans, but there are species-specific adaptations. For example, olfactory-related wiring is protracted in mice, which is linked to their reliance on olfaction. Our findings underscore the importance of translational tools to map common and species-specific biological processes from model systems to humans.

">Characterizing microglial signaling dynamics during inflammation using single-cell mass cytometry</a></h4>

              
                Microglia play a critical role in maintaining central nervous system (CNS) homeostasis and display remarkable plasticity in their response to inflammatory stimuli. However, the specific signaling profiles that microglia adopt during such challenges remain incompletely understood. Traditional transcriptomic approaches provide valuable insights, but fail to capture dynamic post-translational changes. In this study, we utilized time-resolved single-cell mass cytometry (CyTOF) to measure distinct signaling pathways activated in microglia upon exposure to bacterial and viral mimetics - lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (Poly(I:C)), respectively. Furthermore, we evaluated the immunomodulatory role of astrocytes on microglial signaling in mixed cultures. Microglia or mixed cultures derived from neonatal mice were treated with LPS or Poly(I:C) for 48 hrs. Cultures were stained with a panel of 33 metal-conjugated antibodies targeting signaling and identity markers. High-dimensional clustering analysis was used to identify emergent signaling modules. We found that LPS treatment led to more robust early activation of pp38, pERK, pRSK, and pCREB compared to Poly(I:C). Despite these differences, both LPS and Poly(I:C) upregulated the classical activation markers CD40 and CD86 at later time-points. Strikingly, the presence of astrocytes significantly blunted microglial responses to both stimuli, particularly dampening CD40 upregulation. Our studies demonstrate that single-cell mass cytometry effectively captures the dynamic signaling landscape of microglia under pro-inflammatory conditions. This approach may pave the way for targeted therapeutic investigations of various neuroinflammatory disorders. Moreover, our findings underscore the necessity of considering cellular context, such as astrocyte presence, in interpreting microglial behavior during inflammation.

">Differential Patterns of Gut and Oral Microbiomes in Hispanic Individuals with Cognitive Impairment</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) have been associated with alterations in both oral and gut microbiomes. While extensive research has focused on the role of gut dysbiosis in ADRD, the contribution of the oral microbiome remains relatively understudied. Furthermore, the potential synergistic interactions between oral and gut microbiomes in ADRD pathology are largely unexplored. This study aims to evaluate distinct patterns and potential synergistic effects of oral and gut microbiomes in a cohort of predominantly Hispanic individuals with cognitive impairment (CI) and without cognitive impairment (NC). We conducted 16S rRNA gene sequencing on stool and saliva samples from 32 participants (17 CI, 15 NC; 62.5% female, mean age = 70.4 {+/-} 6.2 years) recruited in San Antonio, Texas, USA. Correlation analysis through MaAslin2 assessed the relationship between participants' clinical measurements (e.g., fasting glucose and blood cholesterol) and their gut and saliva microbial contents. Differential abundance analysis evaluated taxa with significant differences between CI and NC groups, and alpha and beta diversity metrics assessed within-sample and group compositional differences. Our analyses revealed no significant differences between NC and CI groups in fasting glucose or blood cholesterol levels. However, a clear association was observed between gut microbiome composition and levels of fasting glucose and blood cholesterol. While alpha and beta diversity metrics showed no significant differences between CI and NC groups, differential abundance analysis revealed an increased presence of oral genera such as Dialister, Fretibacterium, and Mycoplasma in CI participants. Conversely, CI individuals exhibited a decreased abundance of gut genera, including Shuttleworthia, Holdemania, and Subdoligranulum, which are known for their anti-inflammatory properties. No evidence was found for synergistic contributions between oral and gut microbiomes in the context of ADRD. Our findings suggest that similar to the gut microbiome, the oral microbiome undergoes significant modifications as individuals transition from NC to CI. Notably, the identified oral microbes have been previously associated with periodontal diseases and gingivitis. These results underscore the necessity for further investigations with larger sample sizes to validate our findings and elucidate the complex interplay between oral and gut microbiomes in ADRD pathogenesis.

">Maintenance of taste receptor cell presynaptic sites requires gustatory nerve fibers</a></h4>

              
                The turnover and re-establishment of peripheral taste synapses is vital to maintain connectivity between the primary taste receptor cells and the gustatory neurons which relay taste information from the tongue to the brain. Despite the importance of neuron-taste cell reconnection, mechanisms governing synapse assembly and the specificity of synaptic connections is largely unknown. Here we use the expression of presynaptic proteins, CALHM1 and Bassoon, to probe whether nerve fiber connectivity is an initiating factor for the recruitment of presynaptic machinery in different populations of taste cells. Under homeostatic conditions, the vast majority (>90%) of presynaptic sites are directly adjacent to nerve fibers. In the days immediately following gustatory nerve transection and complete denervation, Bassoon and CALHM1 puncta are markedly reduced. This suggests that nerve fiber innervation is crucial for the recruitment and maintenance of presynaptic sites. In support of this, we find that expression of Bassoon and Calhm1 mRNA transcripts are significantly reduced after denervation. During nerve fiber regeneration into the taste bud, presynaptic sites begin to replenish, but are not as frequently connected to nerve fibers as intact controls (~50% compared to >90%). This suggests that gustatory neuron proximity, rather than direct contact, likely drives taste receptor cells to express and aggregate presynaptic proteins at the cell membrane. Together, these data support the idea that trophic factors secreted by gustatory nerve fibers prompt taste receptor cells to produce presynaptic specializations at the cell membrane, which in turn may guide neurons to form mature synapses. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms driving synaptogenesis and synaptic plasticity within the rapidly changing taste bud environment.

">Early life psychosocial stress increases binge-like ethanol consumption and alters microglia and brain macrophage population density in early adulthood</a></h4>

              
                As key regulators of brain homeostasis, microglia and brain macrophages are vital to development. However, early life stress (ELS) experiences, like bullying, can have lasting consequences on microglial function. During ELS, microglia and brain macrophages alter their engagement with cells and synapses. These alterations can result in lasting adaptations in circuit function that could lead to an increased risk to develop maladaptive drinking behaviors and alcohol use disorder (AUD) in adulthood. Whether microglia and brain macrophages truly mediate the relationship between ELS and AUD remains elusive. Here, we report: 1) a novel early life psychosocial stress exposure, PSS, increases binge-like ethanol consumption in early adulthood. 2) This increase in ethanol drinking is associated with alterations in microglia and brain macrophage populations in the ventral hippocampus and across other brain regions. 3) Inhibiting microglia and brain macrophages using a CSF1-r inhibitor, GW2580, results in a trend towards a reduction in binge-like ethanol consumption and normalizes microglia and brain macrophage populations. Therefore, our study suggests that acutely inhibiting microglia and brain macrophage function during periods of early life psychosocial stress may help reduce the risk to develop risky drinking behaviors and AUD.

">Fundamental limitations of kilohertz-frequency carriers in afferent fiber recruitment with transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation</a></h4>

              
                The use of kilohertz-frequency (KHF) waveforms has rapidly gained momentum in transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation (tSCS) to restore motor function after paralysis. However, the mechanisms by which these fast-alternating currents depolarize efferent and afferent fibers remain unknown. Our study fills this research gap by providing a hypothesis- and evidence-based investigation using peripheral nerve stimulation, lumbar tSCS, and cervical tSCS in 25 unimpaired participants together with computational modeling. Peripheral nerve stimulation experiments and computational modeling showed that KHF waveforms negatively impact the processes required to elicit action potentials, thereby increasing response thresholds and biasing the recruitment towards efferent fibers. While these results translate to tSCS, we also demonstrate that lumbar tSCS results in the preferential recruitment of afferent fibers, while cervical tSCS favors recruitment of efferent fibers. Given the assumed importance of proprioceptive afferents in motor recovery, our work suggests that the use of KHF waveforms should be reconsidered to maximize neurorehabilitation outcomes, particularly for cervical tSCS. We posit that careful analysis of the mechanisms that mediate responses elicited by novel approaches in tSCS is crucial to understanding their potential to restore motor function after paralysis.

">Evaluating phasic transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) with pupil dilation: the importance of stimulation intensity and sensory perception</a></h4>

              
                The efficacy of transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) as a non-invasive method to modulate physiological markers of noradrenergic activity of the Locus Coeruleus (LC), such as pupil dilation, is increasingly more discussed. However, taVNS studies show high heterogeneity of stimulation effects. Therefore, a taVNS setup was established here to test different frequencies (10 Hz and 25 Hz) and intensities (3 mA and 5 mA) during phasic stimulation (3 s) with time-synchronous recording of pupil dilation in younger adults. Specifically, phasic real taVNS and higher intensity led to increased pupil dilation, which is consistent with phasic invasive VNS studies in animals. The results also suggest that the influence of intensity on pupil dilation may be stronger than that of frequency. However, there was an attenuation of taVNS-induced pupil dilation when differences in perception of sensations were considered. Specifically, pupil dilation during phasic stimulation increased with perceived stimulation intensity. The extent to which the effect of taVNS induces pupil dilation and the involvement of sensory perception in the stimulation process are discussed here and require more extensive research. Additionally, it is crucial to strive for comparable stimulation sensations during systematic parameter testing in order to investigate possible effects of phasic taVNS on pupil dilation in more detail.

">Proliferative arrest induces neuron differentiation and innate immune responses in control and Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease agent infected rat septal neurons</a></h4>

              
                Rat post-mitotic septal (SEP) neurons, engineered to conditionally proliferate at 330C, differentiate when arrested at 37.50C and can be maintained for weeks without cytotoxic effects. Nine independent cDNA libraries were made to follow arrest-induced neural differentiation and innate immune responses in normal (Nl) uninfected and CJ agent infected SEP cells. Proliferating Nl versus latently infected (CJ-) cells showed few RNA-seq differences. However arrest induced major changes. Normal cells displayed a plethora of anti-proliferative transcripts. Additionally, known neuron differentiation transcripts, e.g., Agtr2, Neuregulin-1, GDF6, SFRP4 and Prnp were upregulated. These Nl neurons also displayed many activated IFN innate immune genes, e.g., OAS1, RTP4, ISG20, GTB4, CD80 and cytokines, complement, and clusterin (CLU) that binds to misfolded proteins. In contrast, arrested highly infectious CJ+ cells (10 logs/gm) downregulated many replication controls. Furthermore, arrested CJ+ cells suppressed neuronal differentiation transcripts, including Prnp which is essential for CJ agent infection. CJ+ cells also enhanced IFN stimulated pathways, and analysis of the 342 CJ+ unique transcripts revealed additional innate immune and anti-viral-linked transcripts (e.g., Il17, ISG15, and RSAD2 (viperin)). This data show: 1) innate immune transcripts are produced by normal neurons during differentiation; 2) CJ infection can enhance and expand anti-viral responses; 3) latent CJ infection epigenetically imprints many proliferative pathways to thwart complete arrest. CJ+ brain microglia, white blood cells and intestinal myeloid cells with shared transcripts may be stimulated to educe latent CJD infections that can be clinically silent for >30 years.

">Abnormal multisensory facilitation patterns relate to disorganized thinking severity and cognitive decline in schizophrenia</a></h4>

              
                Past research has demonstrated that patients with schizophrenia (SP) have visual processing and multisensory integration deficits. Additional studies report that sensory abnormalities are related to positive symptoms. To further understand how multisensory abnormalities relate to positive symptoms, we administered a multisensory integration task requiring the evaluation of perceived distance from auditory, visual, and multisensory stimuli with varying synchrony as well as clinical and neurocognitive assessments. Overall, patients had greater facilitation than healthy controls and the near synchronous condition had the most facilitation in comparison to other conditions. To further examine how multisensory facilitation relates to symptom severity, we performed a Ward cluster analysis that grouped participants by their multisensory facilitation profile. In contrast to what was expected, none of the Ward clusters were populated by a single group. Patients in cluster 3 had a significantly greater disorganization factor score than those in cluster 1. Our in-depth comparison between Ward clusters and neuropsychological tests reveal patients with greater multisensory facilitation experience the most cognitive deficits. Overall, our results demonstrate that multisensory integration is related to behavioral and cognitive deficits in complex ways. Further research is needed to understand the relationship between multisensory integration and schizophrenia symptomology.

                Synaptogyrin-3, a functionally obscure synaptic vesicle protein, interacts with vesicular monoamine and dopamine transporters, bringing together dopamine release and reuptake sites. Synaptogyrin-3 was reduced by chronic cocaine exposure in both humans and rats, and was inversely correlated with motivation to take cocaine in rats. Synaptogyrin-3 overexpression in dopamine neurons reduced cocaine self-administration, decreased anxiety-like behavior, and enhanced cognitive flexibility. Overexpression also enhanced nucleus accumbens dopamine signaling and prevented cocaine-induced deficits, suggesting a putative therapeutic role for synaptogyrin-3 in cocaine use disorder.

">Dopamine reveals adaptive learning of actions representation</a></h4>

              
                Efficient decision-making requires two key processes: learning values from actions and identifying a set of relevant actions to learn from in a given context. While dopamine (DA) is a well-known substrate for signaling reward prediction errors (RPEs) from selected actions to adjust behavior, the process of establishing and switching between action representations is still poorly understood. To address this gap, we used fiber photometry and computational modelling in a three-armed bandit task where mice learned to seek rewards delivered through three successive rule sets, displaying distinct strategies in each rule. We show that DA dynamically reflected RPEs computed from different task features, revealing context-specific internal representations. Our findings demonstrate that mice not only learned and updated action values but also action representations, adapting the features from which they learn across rules for flexible adjustment of their decision strategy.

">Encoding of antennal position and velocity by the Johnstons organ in hawkmoths</a></h4>

              
                Insect antennae function as versatile, multimodal sensory probes in diverse behavioural contexts. In addition to their primary role as olfactory organs, they serve essential mechanosensory functions across insects, including auditory perception, vestibular feedback, airflow detection, gravity sensing, and tactile sensation. These diverse functions are facilitated by the mechanosensory Johnstons organ (JO), located at the joint between the second antennal segment, known as the pedicel, and the flagellum. The pedicel-flagellum joint lacks muscles which means that the Johnstons organs can perceive only passive deflections of the flagellum. Earlier work which characterized the sensitivity and short response time of the sensory units of JO in hawkmoths, showed that their sensitivity to a broad frequency range is range-fractionated. This vastly expands the functional repertoire of the JO. However, it is not clear what components of antennal kinematics are encoded by the JO. Here, we conducted experiments to test the hypothesis that JO neurons encode the position and velocity of angular movements of the flagellum. We recorded intracellularly from the axons of primary sensory neurons of JO while stimulating it with ramp-and-hold stimuli in which antennal position or antennal angular velocity was maintained at various constant values. Our study shows that JO neurons encode angular velocity and position of the antenna in their response. We also characterized the neural adaptation of the responses to angular velocities and positions. A majority of neurons were sensitive to a movement in the ventrad direction, in the direction of gravity. The adaptation and the directional response properties give rise to a nonlinear hysteresis-like response. Together, these findings highlight the neurophysiological basis underlying the functional versatility of the JO.

">Imaging of developing human brains with ex vivo PSOCT and dMRI</a></h4>

              
                The human brain undergoes substantial developmental changes in the first five years of life. Particularly in the white matter, myelination of axons occurs near birth and continues at a rapid pace during the first 2 to 3 years. Diffusion MRI (dMRI) has revolutionized our understanding of developmental trajectories in white matter. However, the mm-resolution of in vivo techniques bears significant limitation in revealing the microstructure of the developing brain. Polarization sensitive optical coherence tomography (PSOCT) is a three-dimensional (3D) optical imaging technique that uses polarized light interferometry to target myelinated fiber tracts with micrometer resolution. Previous studies have shown that PSOCT contributes significantly to the elucidation of myelin content and quantification of fiber orientation in adult human brains. In this study, we utilized the PSOCT technique to study developing brains during the first 5 years of life in combination with ex vivo dMRI. The results showed that the optical properties of PSOCT quantitatively reveal the myelination process in young children. The imaging contrast of the optic axis orientation is a sensitive measure of fiber orientations in largely unmyelinated brains as young as 3-months-old. The micrometer resolution of PSOCT provides substantially enriched information about complex fiber networks and complements submillimeter dMRI. This new optical tool offers great potential to reveal the white matter structures in normal neurodevelopment and developmental disorders in unprecedented detail.

                How the brain reconciles dynamism with stability to balance learning and reliable memory storage has not yet been fully understood. To address the critical question, we longitudinally recorded place cells in the hippocampal dorsal CA1 region over 7 to 56 days, utilizing multiple goal-oriented navigation paradigms across various environments. We found that over 80% of place cells displayed multiple fields, undergoing complex evolution events including field disappearance, formation, and retention. Place fields from the same neuron showed limited coordination (~5%), with a preference for synchronized changes. We further uncovered the single field evolution rule: the longer a field remains active, the more likely it is to continue being active; conversely, the longer a field remains inactive, the less likely it is to recover the future fate of a place field depends on its past activity. Mathematical modeling revealed that this rule sufficiently demonstrates the growing stability of the dCA1 spatial representation at the population level.

">Selective Effects of Ongoing Alpha-Band Activity on Magno- and Parvo-Mediated Detection</a></h4>

              
                Spontaneous fluctuations in cortical excitability, as reflected in variation in occipital alpha-band activity (8-12 Hz), have been shown to explain trial-to-trial variability in perception. Specifically, observers typically report seeing a stimulus more often during states of weak alpha power, likely due to a shift in detection criterion. However, prior work has paid little attention to the specific stimulus properties mediating detection. In early vision, different stimulus properties are preferentially processed along the magnocellular (MC) and parvocellular (PC) pathways, which vary in their preference for spatial and temporal frequency content and chromatic information. The goal of this study was to understand how spontaneous alpha power affects the detection of stimuli which are preferentially processed by either the MC or PC pathway. To achieve this, we used the "Steady/Pulsed Paradigm" which presented a brief, near-threshold stimulus in two conditions intended to bias processing to one or the other pathway. Our results showed an interaction effect of pre-stimulus alpha power on detection between the two conditions. While weak alpha power was predictive of seeing the stimulus in the steady condition (MC-biased), no significant effect was found in the pulsed condition (PC-biased). This interaction was driven by a selective alpha-related criterion shift in the steady condition, with no effect of pre-stimulus alpha on sensitivity (d') in either condition. Our results imply that alpha oscillations may differentially regulate excitability in the MC and PC pathways.

">Context-dependence of deterministic and nondeterministic contributions to closed-loop steering control</a></h4>

              
                In natural circumstances, sensory systems operate in a closed loop with motor output, whereby actions shape subsequent sensory experiences. A prime example of this is the sensorimotor processing required to align one's direction of travel, or heading, with one's goal, a behavior we refer to as steering. In steering, motor outputs work to eliminate errors between the direction of heading and the goal, modifying subsequent errors in the process. The closed-loop nature of the behavior makes it challenging to determine how deterministic and nondeterministic processes contribute to behavior. We overcome this by applying a nonparametric, linear kernel-based analysis to behavioral data of monkeys steering through a virtual environment in two experimental contexts. In a given context, the results were consistent with previous work that described the transformation as a second-order linear system. Classically, the parameters of such second-order models are associated with physical properties of the limb such as viscosity and stiffness that are commonly assumed to be approximately constant. By contrast, we found that the fit kernels differed strongly across tasks in these and other parameters, suggesting context-dependent changes in neural and biomechanical processes. We additionally fit residuals to a simple noise model and found that the form of the noise was highly conserved across both contexts and animals. Strikingly, the fitted noise also closely matched that found previously in a human steering task. Altogether, this work presents a kernel-based analysis that characterizes the context-dependence of deterministic and non-deterministic components of a closed-loop sensorimotor task.

	<p>Transcranial electrical brain stimulation techniques like transcranial direct current (tDCS) and transcranial alternating current (tACS) have emerged as potential tools for treating neurological diseases by modulating cortical excitability. These techniques deliver small electric currents to the brain non-invasively through electrodes on the scalp. tDCS uses constant direct current which weakly alters the membrane voltage of cortical neurons, while tACS utilizes alternating current to target and enhance cortical oscillations, though the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood more specifically. To elucidate how tACS perturbs endogenous network dynamics, we simulated spiking neuron network models. We identified distinct roles of the depolarizing and hyperpolarizing phases in driving network activity towards and away from the strong nonlinearity provided by pyramidal neurons. Exploring resonance effects, we found matching tACS frequency to the network&amp;amp;rsquo;s endogenous resonance frequency creates greater entrainment. Based on this, we developed an algorithm to determine the network&amp;amp;rsquo;s endogenous frequency, phase, and amplitude, then deliver optimized tACS to entrain network oscillations. Together, these computational results provide mechanistic insight into the effects of tACS on network dynamics and could inform future closed-loop tACS systems that dynamically tune stimulation parameters to ongoing brain activity.</p>

	<p>The classification of a pre-processed fMRI dataset using functional connectivity (FC)-based features is considered a challenging task because of the set of high-dimensional FC features and the small dataset size. To tackle this specific set of FC high-dimensional features and a small-sized dataset, we propose here a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN)-based dataset augmenter to first train the cGAN on computed connectivity features of NYU dataset and use the trained cGAN to generate synthetic connectivity features per category. After obtaining a sufficient number of connectivity features per category, a Multi-Head attention mechanism is used as a head for the classification. We name our proposed approach &amp;amp;ldquo;ASD-GANNet&amp;amp;rdquo;, which is end-to-end and does not require hand-crafted features, as the Multi-Head attention mechanism focuses on the features that are more relevant. Moreover, we compare our results with the six available state-of-the-art techniques from the literature. Our proposed approach results using the &amp;amp;ldquo;NYU&amp;amp;rdquo; site as a training set for generating a cGAN-based synthetic dataset are promising. We achieve an overall 10-fold cross-validation-based accuracy of 82%, sensitivity of 82%, and specificity of 81%, outperforming available state-of-the art approaches. A sitewise comparison of our proposed approach also outperforms the available state-of-the-art, as out of the 17 sites, our proposed approach has better results in the 10 sites.</p>

	<p>Background: This longitudinal study aimed to evaluate whether prior engagement in a physical exercise program correlated with enhanced perceptions of quality-of-life components among older adults during the COVID-19 lockdown period. Methods: The cohort comprised elderly individuals (aged &amp;amp;ge; 65 years) who had previously partaken in a 12-week randomized controlled trial investigating the effects of a mixed aerobic&amp;amp;ndash;anaerobic, moderate-intensity exercise program. Participants&amp;amp;rsquo; health-related quality of life was assessed using the Short Form Health Survey-12 item (SF-12) at the beginning of the initial trial and, again, one year later during the COVID-19 lockdown. In the exercise group, 44 participants were included, while the control group consisted of 49 participants, with computer-based, double-blind randomization conducted in Cagliari, Italy. The differences in scores for each SF-12 item between the two groups from T0 to T1 were compared using one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni corrections. Data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 27. Results: No statistically significant differences were observed on average by age (exercise group vs. control group 72.20 &amp;amp;plusmn; 4,78 vs. 72.91 &amp;amp;plusmn; 4.77; F = 0513, p = 0.476). A decrease from T0 to T1 towards a better score on the SF-12 was observed in the exercise group compared to the control group in item 1 (F = 67.463, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001); in item 5 (F = 4.319, p = 0.041); item 8 (F = 4.269, p = 0.041); item 9 (F = 10.761, p = 0.001); item 10 (F = 170.433, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001); and item 11 (F = 4.075, p = 0.046). Conclusions: The results suggest that participation in a moderate physical exercise program one year prior may have equipped older adults with better coping mechanisms to navigate the stress and isolation imposed by the COVID-19 lockdown, as reflected by their enhanced scores on quality-of-life components pertaining to mental well-being. Exercise may confer a protective effect against the adverse psychological impacts of stressful events like the pandemic, even among older adults with chronic conditions. This study underscores the potential benefits of exercise interventions for promoting quality of life and preventing mood disorders in the elderly population.</p>

	<p>Rare side effects of immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are known as neurological immune-related adverse events (n-irAEs). Typically, n-irAEs affect the peripheral nervous system, primarily presenting as myositis, polyradiculoneuropathy, or cranial neuropathy. Less commonly, they impact the central nervous system, resulting in encephalitis, meningitis, or myelitis. High-grade n-irAEs managing and recognizing remains challenging, considering the risk of mortality and long-term disability. To date, strong scientific data are lacking to support the management of high-grade clinical forms. We performed a systematic literature search, selecting all articles describing high-grade steroid-resistance n-irAEs. and we reported them in a practical review. Specifically, current recommendations advise stopping ICI use and beginning corticosteroid treatment. Our findings highlighted that in steroid-resistant n-irAEs, it should be recommended to quickly escalate to plasma exchange (PLEX) and/or intravenously immunoglobulins (IVIg), usually in association with other immunosuppressants. Furthermore, newer evidence supports the use of drugs that may specifically block inflammation without reducing the anti-tumour effect of ICIs. In this practical review, we provide new evidence regarding the therapeutic approach of high-grade n-irAEs, particularly in steroid-resistant cases. We would also stress the importance of informing the scientific community of the discrepancy between current guidelines and clinical evidence in these rare forms of pathology.</p>

	<p>The cerebellum, a major feature of the hindbrain, lies posterior to the pons and medulla and inferior to the posterior part of the cerebrum. It lies beneath the tentorium cerebelli in the posterior cranial fossa and consists of two lateral hemispheres connected by the vermis. The cerebellum is primarily supplied by three arteries originating from the vertebrobasilar system: the superior cerebellar artery (SCA), the anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA), and the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA). However, variations of the cerebellar arteries may occur, such as duplication of the SCA, SCA creating a common trunk with the posterior cerebral artery, triplication of the AICA, and agenesis of PICA, amongst others. Knowledge of the arterial anatomy of the cerebellum is crucial, as inadequate blood supply to this region can result in diminished motor functioning, significantly impacting the quality of life for patients. The present study demonstrated the importance of adequate anatomical knowledge of the arteries supplying the cerebellum. The PubMed and Embase databases were searched to gather articles on the anatomical characteristics and variations of the arterial supply of the cerebellum. It is the most comprehensive and up-to-date review available in the literature. The possible variations of these vessels may be clinically silent or present with clinical symptoms such as neurovascular compression syndromes of the cranial nerves and aneurysms. With a comprehensive understanding of the cerebellar arterial system, physicians can enhance their diagnostic and treatment capabilities, ultimately leading to more effective management of cerebellar vascular-related issues and other neurological deficits.</p>

	<p>Revascularization surgery for the symptomatic hemisphere with hemodynamic impairment is effective for Moyamoya vasculopathy patients. However, careful patient selection is crucial and ideally supported by advanced quantitative hemodynamic imaging. Recently, blood oxygenation level-dependent cerebrovascular reactivity (BOLD-CVR) and quantitative magnetic resonance angiography with non-invasive optimal vessel analysis (qMRA-NOVA) have gained prominence in assessing these patients. This study aims to present the results of BOLD-CVR and qMRA-NOVA imaging along with the changes in cerebral hemodynamics and flow status following flow augmentation with superficial temporal artery&amp;amp;ndash;middle cerebral artery (STA-MCA) bypass in our Moyamoya vasculopathy patient cohort. Symptomatic patients with Moyamoya vasculopathy treated at the Clinical Neuroscience Center of the University Hospital Zurich who underwent hemodynamic and flow imaging (BOLD-CVR and qMRA-NOVA) before and after bypass were included in the analysis. Reduced hemispheric volume flow rates, as well as impaired BOLD-CVR, were measured in all 12 patients with Moyamoya vasculopathy before STA-MCA bypass surgery. Following the surgical procedure, post-operative BOLD-CVR demonstrated a non-significant increase in BOLD-CVR values within the revascularized, symptomatic middle cerebral artery territory and cerebral hemisphere. The results of the statistical tests should be viewed as indicative due to the small sample size. Additionally, post-operative qMRA-NOVA revealed a significant improvement in the hemispheric volume flow rate of the affected hemisphere due to the additional bypass flow rate. Our findings affirm the presence of hemodynamic and flow impairments in the symptomatic hemisphere of the Moyamoya vasculopathy patients. Bypass surgery proves effective in improving both BOLD-CVR impairment and the hemispheric volume flow rate in our patient cohort.</p>

	<p>Introduction: Intramedullary metastases to the conus medullaris spinalis (IMCM) pose a rare problem in neurosurgical oncology and are usually encountered as a complicated clinical scenario in the setting of advanced systemic malignancy with poor overall survival. Despite the progress in interdisciplinary oncological care, their management remains complicated. Research Question: We performed a PRISMA-guided literature search to achieve a pooled analysis of all previously reported IMCM cases that contained detailed clinical data on this problem to investigate the currently employed management options and respective outcomes. We obtained a clinical vignette and performed a comprehensive narrative review of IMCM management. Materials and Methods: The PubMed/MEDLINE/Google Scholar, Cochrane and Embase databases were systematically searched according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. All relevant publications retrieved were subjected to full-text analysis in detail and pertinent information was extracted. Results: The most common systemic primary tumor site as the origin of IMCM was the lung, followed by the breast. Overall, the pooled median survival was 6 months (range 0.5&amp;amp;ndash;36 months). Patients who received both surgery and radiation therapy had the longest overall survival (OS) (mean 9.9 months) and those who received no oncological treatment (neither surgery nor adjuvant therapy) had the shortest OS (mean 3.6 months). In cases where surgical resection was performed as part of the treatment plan for metastases, those with partial tumor resection had a more favorable neurological outcome than patients who underwent aggressive gross total resection. Conclusions: Based on the results of our analysis, we find that diligent microsurgical resection (subtotal or total) followed by radiation therapy appears as an effective and suitable treatment in select patients with IMCM. When surgery is not feasible as part of the treatment algorithm, radiation therapy alone (conventional or radiosurgery) also appears to be a suitable treatment option that confers a benefit to the patient.</p>

	<p>Upper motor neuron (UMN) dysfunction is an important feature of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) for the diagnosis and understanding of pathogenesis. The identification of UMN signs forms the basis of ALS diagnosis, although may be difficult to discern, especially in the setting of severe muscle weakness. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) techniques have yielded objective physiological biomarkers of UMN dysfunction in ALS, enabling the interrogation of cortical and subcortical neuronal networks with diagnostic, pathophysiological, and prognostic implications. Transcranial magnetic stimulation techniques have provided pertinent pathogenic insights and yielded novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. Cortical hyperexcitability, as heralded by a reduction in short interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) and an increase in short interval intracortical facilitation (SICF), has been associated with lower motor neuron degeneration, patterns of disease evolution, as well as the development of specific ALS clinical features including the split hand phenomenon. Reduction in SICI has also emerged as a potential diagnostic aid in ALS. More recently, physiological distinct inhibitory and facilitatory cortical interneuronal circuits have been identified, which have been shown to contribute to ALS pathogenesis. The triple stimulation technique (TST) was shown to enhance the diagnostic utility of conventional TMS measures in detecting UMN dysfunction. Resting-state EEG is a novel neurophysiological technique developed for directly interrogating cortical neuronal networks in ALS, that have yielded potentially useful physiological biomarkers of UMN dysfunction. The present review discusses physiological biomarkers of UMN dysfunction in ALS, encompassing conventional and novel TMS techniques developed to interrogate the functional integrity of the corticomotoneuronal system, focusing on pathogenic, diagnostic, and prognostic utility.</p>

	<p>Motor impairment is a common issue in stroke patients, often affecting the upper limbs. To this standpoint, robotic neurorehabilitation has shown to be highly effective for motor function recovery. Notably, Machine learning (ML) may be a powerful technique able to identify the optimal kind and intensity of rehabilitation treatments to maximize the outcomes. This retrospective observational research aims to assess the efficacy of robotic devices in facilitating the functional rehabilitation of upper limbs in stroke patients through ML models. Specifically, clinical scales, such as the Fugl-Meyer Assessment (A-D) (FMA), the Frenchay Arm Test (FAT), and the Barthel Index (BI), were used to assess the patients&amp;amp;rsquo; condition before and after robotic therapy. The values of these scales were predicted based on the patients&amp;amp;rsquo; clinical and demographic data obtained before the treatment. The findings showed that ML models have high accuracy in predicting the FMA, FAT, and BI, with R-squared (R2) values of 0.79, 0.57, and 0.74, respectively. The findings of this study suggest that integrating ML into robotic therapy may have the capacity to establish a personalized and streamlined clinical practice, leading to significant improvements in patients&amp;amp;rsquo; quality of life and the long-term sustainability of the healthcare system.</p>

">Single-nucleus and spatial transcriptomic analysis identified molecular features of neuronal heterogeneity and distinct glial responses in Parkinson's disease.</a></h4>

              
                The heterogeneity of Parkinson's disease (PD) is increasingly recognized as an important aspect of understanding the disorder. Among the factors contributing to this heterogeneity, ethnic differences are primary sources, significantly influencing the likelihood of PD developing and its initial symptoms' nature. While there have been numerous reports related to PD in East Asia, there has been a lack of contribution from single-cell (or nucleus) transcriptome studies, which have been making significant contributions to understanding PD. In this study, a total of 33,293 nuclei obtained from the substantia nigra (SN) of confirmed pathological PD and control patients in South Korea were profiled, revealing eight different cell types through cluster analysis. Monocle-based pseudotime analysis identified two disease-associated trajectories for each astrocyte and microglia and identified genes that differentiate them. Interestingly, we uncovered the inflammatory intervention in the early PD-associated transition in microglia and identified the molecular features of this intermediate state of microglia. In addition, gene regulatory networks (GRNs) based on TENET analysis revealed the detrimental effect of an HSPA5-led module in microglia and MSRB3- and HDAC8- led modules specifying the two different astrocyte trajectories. In SN neurons, we observed population changes, a decrease in dopaminergic and glutamatergic neurons and a proportional increase in GABAergic neurons. By deconvolution in spatial transcriptome obtained the PD sample, we confirmed spatiotemporal heterogeneity of neuronal subpopulations and PD-associated progressive gliosis specific to dopaminergic nuclei, SN and ventral tegmental areas (VTAs). In conclusion, our approach has enabled us to identify the genetic and spatial characterization of neurons and to demonstrate different glial fates in PD. These findings advance our molecular understanding of cell type-specific changes in the progression of Korean PD, providing an important foundation for predicting and validating interventions or drug effects for future treatments.

">Spatial dynamics of mammalian brain development and neuroinflammation by multimodal tri-omics mapping</a></h4>

              
                The ability to spatially map multiple layers of the omics information over different time points allows for exploring the mechanisms driving brain development, differentiation, arealization, and alterations in disease. Herein we developed and applied spatial tri-omic sequencing technologies, DBiT ARP-seq (spatial ATAC-RNA-Protein-seq) and DBiT CTRP-seq (spatial CUT&Tag-RNA-Protein-seq) together with multiplexed immunofluorescence imaging (CODEX) to map spatial dynamic remodeling in brain development and neuroinflammation. A spatiotemporal tri-omic atlas of the mouse brain was obtained at different stages from postnatal day P0 to P21, and compared to the regions of interest in the human developing brains. Specifically, in the cortical area, we discovered temporal persistence and spatial spreading of chromatin accessibility for the layer-defining transcription factors. In corpus callosum, we observed dynamic chromatin priming of myelin genes across the subregions. Together, it suggests a role for layer specific projection neurons to coordinate axonogenesis and myelination. We further mapped the brain of a lysolecithin (LPC) neuroinflammation mouse model and observed common molecular programs in development and neuroinflammation. Microglia, exhibiting both conserved and distinct programs for inflammation and resolution, are transiently activated not only at the core of the LPC lesion, but also at distal locations presumably through neuronal circuitry. Thus, this work unveiled common and differential mechanisms in brain development and neuroinflammation, resulting in a valuable data resource to investigate brain development, function and disease.

">Characterization of Eye and Adnexal Tissues in Dogs and Wolves: A Histological and Lectin-Histochemical Approach</a></h4>

              
                This study explores the ocular anatomy and glandular components of domestic dogs compared to their ancestor, the wolf, with the aim of identifying evolutionary changes due to domestication and their implications for ocular pathologies. Utilizing histological and histochemical techniques, including hematoxylin-eosin, PAS, Alcian Blue, and lectins, this research conducts a detailed analysis of the canine and wolf ocular systems, particularly focusing on the eyelids, tarsal glands, and conjunctival tissues. Results indicate significant histological differences between the two species, particularly in the thickness and secretion levels of the conjunctival epithelia and the structure of the tarsal glands. Dogs exhibit a thicker epithelium with greater PAS and Alcian Blue positive secretion, suggesting enhanced ocular protection and lubrication adapted to domestic environments. Conversely, wolves display more concentrated glandular secretions and a predominance of acidic mucopolysaccharides, aligning with their adaptation to natural habitats. This study also highlights the translational value of dogs as models for human ocular diseases, given their anatomical and physiological similarities with humans. Such comparisons are essential as they provide insights that can lead to advancements in medical research and clinical applications, especially in the development of treatments for ocular surface disorders.

	<p>Flexible pulse-by-pulse regulation of sensorimotor synchronization is crucial for voluntarily showing rhythmic behaviors synchronously with external cueing; however, the underpinning neurophysiological mechanisms remain unclear. We hypothesized that the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) plays a key role by coordinating both proactive and reactive motor outcomes based on contextual mental imagery. To test our hypothesis, a missing-oddball task in finger-tapping paradigms was conducted in 33 healthy young volunteers. The dynamic properties of the dACC were evaluated by event-related deep-brain activity (ER-DBA), supported by event-related potential (ERP) analysis and behavioral evaluation based on signal detection theory. We found that ER-DBA activation/deactivation reflected a strategic choice of motor control modality in accordance with mental imagery. Reverse ERP traces, as omission responses, confirmed that the imagery was contextual. We found that mental imagery was updated only by environmental changes via perceptual evidence and response-based abductive reasoning. Moreover, stable on-pulse tapping was achievable by maintaining proactive control while creating an imagery of syncopated rhythms from simple beat trains, whereas accuracy was degraded with frequent erroneous tapping for missing pulses. We conclude that the dACC voluntarily regulates rhythmic sensorimotor synchronization by utilizing contextual mental imagery based on experience and by creating novel rhythms.</p>

                The Neuroscientist, Ahead of Print. <br/>High-grade gliomas (HGGs) are the commonest primary brain cancers. They are characterized by a pattern of aggressive growth and diffuse infiltration of the host brain that severely limits the efficacy of conventional treatments and patient outcomes, which remain generally poor. Recent work has described a suite of mechanisms via which HGGs interact, predominantly bidirectionally, with various cell types in the host brain including neurons, glial cells, immune cells, and vascular elements to drive tumor growth and invasion. These insights have the potential to inspire novel approaches to HGG therapy that are critically needed. This review explores HGG–host brain interactions and considers whether and how they might be exploited for therapeutic gain.

">The intersection of endocrine signaling and neuroimmune communication regulates neonatal nociception</a></h4>

              
                Neonatal pain is a significant clinical issue but the mechanisms by which pain is produced early in life are poorly understood. Our recent work has linked the transcription factor serum response factor downstream of local growth hormone (GH) signaling to incision-related hypersensitivity in neonates. However, it remains unclear if similar mechanisms contribute to inflammatory pain in neonates. We found that local GH treatment inhibited neonatal inflammatory myalgia but appeared to do so through a unique signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) dependent pathway within sensory neurons. The STAT1 transcription factor appeared to regulate peripheral inflammation itself by modulation of monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP1) release from sensory neurons. Data suggests that STAT1 upregulation, downstream of GH signaling, contributes to neonatal nociception during muscle inflammation through a novel neuroimmune loop involving cytokine release from primary afferents. Results could uncover new ways to treat muscle pain and inflammation in neonates.

	<p>Background: Neural efficiency refers to the brain&amp;amp;rsquo;s ability to function with reduced resource expenditure while maintaining high performance levels. Previous research has demonstrated that table tennis athletes have greater neural efficiency at the conscious level. However, it is unknown whether they exhibit greater neural efficiency at the unconscious level. Therefore, this study aims to investigate unconscious perceptual processing and neural efficiency in elite table tennis athletes through tasks involving the judgment of spin serves. Methods: Fifty healthy, right-handed individuals participated in this study, including 25 elite table tennis athletes and 25 control participants without professional training experience. To evaluate the unconscious perceptual characteristics of both groups, we used a combination of masked priming paradigm and event-related potential techniques. Results: The behavioral results reveal that, compared to the control group, the table tennis athletes displayed reduced reaction times (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) and increased priming effects (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) under unconscious conditions. The electrophysiological findings indicated that both groups elicited N1, N2, and P2 components. Notably, compared to the control group, the table tennis athletes exhibited significantly lower amplitude responses at the occipital lobe electrodes PO3, POz, PO4, O1, Oz, and O2 (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Conclusion: These results further support the neural efficiency hypothesis, indicating that prolonged professional training enhances athletes&amp;amp;rsquo; capacities for specialized unconscious cognitive processing.</p>

	<p>The main goal of the current work was to assess the age sensitivity of a novel battery of cool and hot Executive Function (EF) tasks developed for the middle childhood period: the Executive Brain Battery (EBB). To this end, we carried out a first study in which the EBB was administered to six age groups ranging from 6 to 11. Additionally, in a second study, we compared children at the end of middle childhood (age 11 years) and adult performance in the EBB. Results showed that tasks included in the EBB were suitable for all age groups, with more age-related changes being found in cool than hot EF tasks. Moreover, at the end of middle childhood, children reach an adult-like performance in most of these cool and hot tasks. The present findings extend previous research suggesting that cool and hot EFs exhibit different patterns of age-related growth in middle childhood. Additionally, the EEB could become a useful tool for research on EFs during middle childhood that could be adapted for a wide range of populations.</p>

	<p>Patients with substance use disorders (SUDs) often suffer from cognitive dysfunction (CD), affecting their quality of life and daily functioning. Current treatments, including pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy, have limited efficacy and notable side effects. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a non-invasive technique that modulates cortical activity, shows promise in improving cognitive function with minimal side effects and low cost, and could potentially serve as a valuable adjunct to existing therapies. This systematic review aims to evaluate the literature on the effectiveness of tDCS for CD in SUD patients to inform clinical practice and future research. Following PRISMA guidelines, the review includes studies that used tDCS for SUD-related CD. The criteria for inclusion encompassed participants aged 18 and older with a diagnosis of SUD, the use of tDCS (either conventional or high-definition), control groups receiving sham stimulation or no intervention, and cognitive outcome measures for substance-related cognitive function using validated tools. Databases searched were Ovid MEDLINE, PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Scopus, and PsycINFO, with specific keywords. Twenty-two studies met the criteria, suggesting tDCS can improve cognitive functions in SUD patients, though results varied. Effectiveness may depend on the brain area targeted, stimulation parameters, task requirements, and individual differences. tDCS shows potential in treating SUD-related CD, but further research is needed to optimize stimulation protocols and address study variability. Future studies should use functional magnetic resonance imaging to explore the brain mechanisms by which tDCS improves cognitive function in SUDs and focus on larger, long-term trials to confirm efficacy and refine tDCS treatment parameters.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-841/v1?src=rss">A scoping review of health models for the community mental health needs of the United Arab Emirates: Nurturing the social determinants of mental health through social prescribing in the Middle East [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Despite the growing interest in social prescribing the diversification of health and social care strategies to support the well-being of patients has remained entrenched with a focus on the hospital setting within the Middle East. The United Arab Emirates has commenced progressing community mental health care to lead changes in how care and treatment are delivered within the United Arab Emirates. The authors adopted the use of the framework of Arksey and O’Malley (2005) to provide a systematic approach to searching the literature and creating a comprehensive foundation to guide the review. This scoping review provides a better understanding of the compatibility, content and outcomes of a selection of health models. The scoping review findings will inform the proposed use of social prescribing as an actionable approach to create a focus on the need to include and empower the social determinants of mental health. This article proposes an evidence-based health strategy that supports and enhances recent additions to national legislation on the inclusion of the Mental Health Law within the United Arab Emirates to meditate and prevent inequities in addressing the mental health needs of citizens and residents within the nation’s diverse communities.

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/11/7/ENEURO.0228-24.2024?rss=1">Reading Reshapes Stimulus Selectivity in the Visual Word Form Area</a></h4>

              
                <p>Reading depends on a brain region known as the "visual word form area" (VWFA) in the left ventral occipitotemporal cortex. This region's function is debated because its stimulus selectivity is not absolute, it is modulated by a variety of task demands, and it is inconsistently localized. We used fMRI to characterize the combination of sensory and cognitive factors that activate word-responsive regions that we precisely localized in 16 adult humans (4 male). We then presented three types of character strings: English words, pseudowords, and unfamiliar characters with matched visual features. Participants performed three different tasks while viewing those stimuli: detecting real words, detecting color in the characters, and detecting color in the fixation mark. There were three primary findings about the VWFA's response: (1) It preferred letter strings over unfamiliar characters even when the stimuli were ignored during the fixation task. (2) Compared with those baseline responses, engaging in the word reading task enhanced the response to words but suppressed the response to unfamiliar characters. (3) Attending to the stimuli to judge their color had little effect on the response magnitudes. Thus, the VWFA is uniquely modulated by a cognitive signal that is specific to voluntary linguistic processing and is not additive. Functional connectivity analyses revealed that communication between the VWFA and a left frontal language area increased when the participant engaged in the linguistic task. We conclude that the VWFA is inherently selective for familiar orthography, but it falls under control of the language network when the task demands it.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/11/7/ENEURO.0270-23.2024?rss=1">A Vestibular Challenge Combined with Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide (CGRP) Promotes Anxiety-Like Behaviors</a></h4>

              
                <p>Motion-induced anxiety and agoraphobia are more frequent symptoms in patients with vestibular migraine (VM) than migraine without vertigo. The neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is a therapeutic target for migraine and VM, but the link between motion hypersensitivity, anxiety, and CGRP is relatively unexplored, especially in preclinical mouse models. To further examine this link, we tested the effects of systemic CGRP and off-vertical axis rotation (OVAR) on elevated plus maze (EPM) and rotarod performance in male and female C57BL/6J mice. Rotarod ability was assessed using two different dowel diameters: mouse dowel (<I>r</I> = 1.5&nbsp;cm) versus rat dowel (<I>r</I> = 3.5&nbsp;cm). EPM results indicate that CGRP alone or OVAR alone did not increase anxiety indices. However, the combination of CGRP and OVAR did elicit anxiety-like behavior. On the rotarod, CGRP reduced performance in both sexes on a mouse dowel but had no effect on a rat dowel, whereas OVAR had a significant effect on the rat dowel. These results suggest that only the combination of CGRP with vestibular stimulation induces anxiety-like behavior and that CGRP affects the dynamic balance function in mice depending on the type of challenge presented. These findings suggest that anxiety-like behaviors can be teased out from imbalance behaviors in a mouse model of "migraine." Future studies are aimed to determine if CGRP receptor antagonists that have been effective treating migraineurs and mouse "migraine" models may also reduce the anxiety observed in migraine.</p>

                Background Endodontic treatment is the most common method for resolving pulpal and periapical pathology. However, various studies have reported that almost 11%–13% of all teeth that undergo extraction after endodontic treatment show the presence of cracks, craze lines, and vertical root fractures. Teeth with inadequate post endodontic restoration are more prone to fracture and coronal leakage, resulting in the diffusion of oral fluids, bacteria, bacterial products, and possibly root canal treatment failure. Furthermore, studies have advocated the use of endodontically treated teeth with restorative materials that have a similar or higher elastic modulus than the tooth for providing stiffness against forces that cause root fracture. Intraorifice barriers made of restorative materials that can bond to radicular dentin could thus be used to reinforce the radicular dentin while also preventing coronal microleakage. Although the sealing ability of intraorifice barriers has been widely compared in the literature, there have been few studies on the strengthening effect of the materials used in the study as intraorifice barriers when placed into the root canal. As a result, the current in vitro study aims to assess the effect of various materials as intraorifice barriers (Cention N, Resin modified glass ionomer cement, and short fiber reinforced flowable composite) on the force required fracture teeth after root canal treatment. Methods This in vitro study will be done on extracted human mandibular premolars with single root canal where after doing root canal treatment 2-3 mm obturating material would be replaced by intra orifice barriers (Cention N, resin modified glass ionomer cement [RMGIC], and short fiber reinforced flowable composite). The force required to fracture teeth will be calculated using universal testing machine.

                Background: The protein interaction between the viral surface S-glycoprotein and the host angiotensin converting enzyme-2 receptor (ACE2) is key to the virulent nature of SARS-CoV-2. The potential role that effective drug repurposing strategies may have to help stem the impact of future outbreaks has been brought to light in the recent COVID-19 pandemic. This study outlines a comprehensive approach towards in-silico drug discovery which aims to identify hit agents that can be suitably translated into a clinical setting. Methods: We use two different computational platforms to analyze the viral S-glycoprotein in its bound conformational state to the ACE2 receptor. We employed a comprehensive screening approach to shortlist compounds capable of binding to the viral target interface and corroborated these findings using both Schrödinger’s Glide and AutoDock Vina. Molecular dynamic simulation studies further verified the stability of the interaction at the viral-host protein interface. Results: Lymecycline, pentagalloylglucose, polydatin, and hexoprenaline were identified as prime candidates for further studies given the robust and stable nature of their interaction at the viral-host interface and relevance for clinical testing. These agents were shown in a 100-nanosecond simulation trajectory to favorably disrupt key binding interactions at the viral-host interface and may potentially inhibit viral entry into host cells. In all hit molecules it was observed that inhibiting the interaction with the following key viral binding residues: Lys17, Gly496, Tyr 505, and key host residues: His34, Asp38, Lys353, played a critical role toward the inhibition of the viral-host protein interaction. Conclusions: Our study is unique in its comprehensive approach to identify agents that can bind to the S-glycoprotein-ACE2 interface using multiple computational platforms. Among the hit compounds shortlisted in this study, both lymecycline and hexoprenaline may be considered as candidates for preliminarily clinical studies to assess their therapeutic potential in the management of COVID-19 infections.

                Background Systemic hypertension is a global non-communicable disease that creates an essential need for alternate forms of lifestyle modifications, including exercise, to lower elevated blood pressure. Mat Pilates, a feasible form of mind-body coordinated exercise, may provide benefits with limited resources. Objective This randomized controlled trial aimed to assess the efficacy of Mat Pilates on resting blood pressure and health-related quality of life in individuals with systemic hypertension. Methods A two-arm, single-blinded, block randomized controlled trial will be recruited with120 participants into control and experimental groups (1:1 ratio). Mat Pilates will be administered to the experimental group and standard care to the control group for 12 weeks. Resting and central blood pressure, health-related quality of life, and echocardiographic parameters will be measured before and after the trial. We hypothesized that Pilates may not be beneficial in lowering resting blood pressure in hypertensive patients. A repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) will test the within- and between-group effects of Mat Pilates on various outcomes. Ethics and Dissemination The trial was approved by the Institutional Research Committee, Manipal College of Health Professions, Manipal Academy of Higher Education, Kasturba Medical College, and Kasturba Hospital Institutional Ethics Committee, Manipal. Written informed consent will be obtained from all the participants. All stakeholders and committees will communicate key findings regarding the implementation of mind-body association exercises as a measure of lifestyle modification in individuals with systemic hypertension.

                Background Dietary supplements (DS) use among Lebanese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) increased widely due to the country’s economic and financial situation. This study was conducted (1) to estimate the prevalence of DS use among persons with T2DM amid the escalating economic crisis in Lebanon; (2) to explore the knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) of DS use; and (3) to determine any significant association between socio-economic and socio-demographic factors and the use of DS modality Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted during the worst episode of the economic crisis between October and April 2022 on 460 adult patients with T2DM of both sexes. Patients were interviewed using a pre-tested questionnaire. Results Almost 4 out of 10 patients with T2DM in our study were found to be using DS, where 27.6% take multivitamins frequently. One-third of the participants agreed that nutritional supplements are necessary to control diabetes symptoms and complications. Around 41.1% of the participants complained about hypoglycemia and used DS to control their blood sugar levels (56.4%), while the rest used it to improve their health (35.5%) and control their diet (2.2%). The predictors of DS usage were the patient’s level of education [OR=3.9, CI=1.5-10, p=0.003), self-monitoring of blood sugars (OR=4.9, CI=1.68-14.6; p=0.004) and reading the nutrition label [OR=59.3, CI=6.3-55.8, p=0.000]. Conclusion This study estimated the prevalence of DS use and abuse, among persons with diabetes type II and found three significant predictors of DS use among patients with T2DM. Public health experts should encourage healthy discussions and awareness with their patients to comprehend their views regarding DS use.

                Background Blastoid mantle cell lymphoma (B-MCL) is a rare aggressive lymphoma. It is characterized by blastoid morphology with high proliferation and inconsistent immunohistochemistry (IHC), making it a diagnostic challenge for the pathologist. Methods This is a retrospective analytical cohort study. We reviewed biopsy confirmed cases of B-MCL diagnosed over a period of 10 years (January 2012 to December 2022). The clinical presentation, histopathological and IHC findings, treatment received, and survival outcomes were studied. Randomly selected cases of classic MCL (n=12), diagnosed during the same period served as controls. Results A total of 12 cases were studied. Four cases were transformed from previously diagnosed MCL; 8 cases arose de novo. Mean age was 61.17 years and the male: female ratio was 5:1. Half of the cases showed extra nodal extension and 81.8% had bone marrow involvement. Gastrointestinal tract was the most common site of extra nodal involvement. Histopathological examination showed diffuse involvement of the lymph node with medium sized cells. On immunohistochemistry, one of the cases showed loss of CD5 expression while the other had aberrant CD10 expression. Mean Ki-67 index was 58.09% in the cases and 16.33% in controls and was statistically significant (p=0.005). The median overall survival (OS) for cases was 2 years vs 8 years in controls. The p53 over expression (>30% nuclear positivity) was seen in 66.6% cases (4/6). Conclusion There are several factors that contribute to the aggressiveness of B-MCL, and new treatment approaches might be required to improve patient outcomes.

Access to treatment and medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD) is essential in reducing opioid use and associated behavioral risks, such as syringe sharing among persons who inject drugs (PWID). Syringe sharing among PWID carries high risk of transmission of serious infections such as hepatitis C and HIV. MOUD resources, such as methadone provider clinics, however, are often unavailable to PWID due to barriers like long travel distance to the nearest methadone provider and the required frequency of clinic visits. The goal of this study is to examine the uncertainty in the effects of travel distance in initiating and continuing methadone treatment and how these interact with different spatial distributions of methadone providers to impact co-injection (syringe sharing) risks. A baseline scenario of spatial access was established using the existing locations of methadone providers in a geographical area of metropolitan Chicago, Illinois, USA. Next, different counterfactual scenarios redistributed the locations of methadone providers in this geographic area according to the densities of both the general adult population and according to the PWID population per zip code. We define different reasonable methadone access assumptions as the combinations of short, medium, and long travel distance preferences combined with three urban/suburban travel distance preference. Our modeling results show that when there is a low travel distance preference for accessing methadone providers, distributing providers near areas that have the greatest need (defined by density of PWID) is best at reducing syringe sharing behaviors. However, this strategy also decreases access across suburban locales, posing even greater difficulty in regions with fewer transit options and providers. As such, without an adequate number of providers to give equitable coverage across the region, spatial distribution cannot be optimized to provide equitable access to all PWID. Our study has important implications for increasing interest in methadone as a resurgent treatment for MOUD in the United States and for guiding policy toward improving access to MOUD among PWID.

Adaptive Immune Receptor Repertoire sequencing (AIRR-seq) is a valuable experimental tool to study the immune state in health and following immune challenges such as infectious diseases, (auto)immune diseases, and cancer. Several tools have been developed to reconstruct B cell and T cell receptor sequences from AIRR-seq data and infer B and T cell clonal relationships. However, currently available tools offer limited parallelization across samples, scalability or portability to high-performance computing infrastructures. To address this need, we developed nf-core/airrflow, an end-to-end bulk and single-cell AIRR-seq processing workflow which integrates the Immcantation Framework following BCR and TCR sequencing data analysis best practices. The Immcantation Framework is a comprehensive toolset, which allows the processing of bulk and single-cell AIRR-seq data from raw read processing to clonal inference. nf-core/airrflow is written in Nextflow and is part of the nf-core project, which collects community contributed and curated Nextflow workflows for a wide variety of analysis tasks. We assessed the performance of nf-core/airrflow on simulated sequencing data with sequencing errors and show example results with real datasets. To demonstrate the applicability of nf-core/airrflow to the high-throughput processing of large AIRR-seq datasets, we validated and extended previously reported findings of convergent antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 by analyzing 97 COVID-19 infected individuals and 99 healthy controls, including a mixture of bulk and single-cell sequencing datasets. Using this dataset, we extended the convergence findings to 20 additional subjects, highlighting the applicability of nf-core/airrflow to validate findings in small in-house cohorts with reanalysis of large publicly available AIRR datasets.

                Introduction Amid changing social dynamics, the world of higher education faces, among other challenges, the growing impact on the mental health of students. In this scenario, the Self-Determination Theory (SDT) highlights the important role of autonomy support as it generates positive effects on students' motivation and well-being. Methods The present study tests the predictive capacity of the teacher’s interpersonal style of autonomy support in a higher education institution, in relation to the satisfaction of basic psychological needs, autonomous motivation and depressive symptoms. A sample composed of 356 Spanish university students of which 237 were male (66.57%) from different grades and courses, aged between 17 and 57 years (M = 20.83; SD = 3.44), from middle socioeconomic strata, was used, and selected through purposive sampling. Results After the analysis of structural equations, the results showed that the teacher’s interpersonal style of autonomy support positively predicted the satisfaction of basic psychological needs and this the autonomous motivation; but negatively depressive symptoms. Conclusions The model describes the possible importance of promoting the teacher’s interpersonal style of autonomy support in higher education as a protective factor for well-being and mental health. These findings highlight the importance of motivational strategies that higher education teachers must implement to promote student motivation and well-being.

                Background Renal blood flow (RBF) is regulated by an autonomic nervous system and is reduced in older adults. Massage has been previously found to increase blood flow. Objective This two-armed double-blind, randomized controlled trial aimed to investigate the immediate effects of Thai foot massage (TFM) on RBF, psychological stress, and heart rate variability (HRV) in older adult persons. Material and Methods The 26 healthy older adult volunteers were recruited and randomly assigned to the TFM group (13 persons) and the control group (13 persons). The TFM group received a 15-minute Thai foot massage, and the control group received a 15-minute bed rest. Primary outcomes – RBF parameters [peak systolic velocity (PSV), end-diastolic velocity (EDV), resistive index (RI), volumetric arterial blood flow (VF)] and secondary outcomes – HRV parameters [standard deviation of the normal-to-normal intervals (SDNN), root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD), high frequency (HF), low frequency (LF), and low frequency per high frequency (LF/HF)] were measured after each intervention. Results Results showed that the VF significantly increased after TFM (P < 0.05) but not in control. Meanwhile, the stress index significantly reduced after TFM (P < 0.05). SDNN and RMSSD, the proxies of parasympathetic activity, also significantly increased in the TFM group (p < 0.05). Only RMSSD was significantly enhanced in the control group. No side effects were observed. Conclusion The TFM could increase RBF and alleviate psychological stress through parasympathetic activity actuation. Therefore, this intervention might improve RBF and relieve stress in the older population. Further study should be carried out on a larger population.

                COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in a global pandemic with a rapidly developing global health and economic crisis. Variations in the disease have been observed and have been associated with the genomic sequence of either the human host or the pathogen. Worldwide scientists scrambled initially to recruit patient cohorts to try and identify risk factors. A resource that presented itself early on was the UK Biobank (UKBB), which is investigating the respective contributions of genetic predisposition and environmental exposure to the development of disease. To enable COVID-19 studies, UKBB is now receiving COVID-19 test data for their participants every two weeks. In addition, UKBB is delivering more frequent updates of death and hospital inpatient data (including critical care admissions) on the UKBB Data Portal. This frequently changing dataset requires a tool that can rapidly process and analyse up-to-date data. We developed an R package specifically for the UKBB COVID-19 data, which summarises COVID-19 test results, performs association tests between COVID-19 susceptibility/severity and potential risk factors such as age, sex, blood type, comorbidities and generates input files for genome-wide association studies (GWAS). By applying the R package to data released in April 2021, we found that age, body mass index, socioeconomic status and smoking are positively associated with COVID-19 susceptibility, severity, and mortality. Males are at a higher risk of COVID-19 infection than females. People staying in aged care homes have a higher chance of being exposed to SARS-CoV-2. By performing GWAS, we replicated the 3p21.31 genetic finding for COVID-19 susceptibility and severity. The ability to iteratively perform such analyses is highly relevant since the UKBB data is updated frequently. As a caveat, users must arrange their own access to the UKBB data to use the R package.

[version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Hemodialysis patients are frequently colonized by Staphylococcus aureus, leading to severe infections with high mortality rates. However, little is known about transition from non-colonization to colonization or bacteremia over time. The aim was to analyze the behavior of S. aureus colonization, identifying the probability of transition from non-colonized to colonized state or bacteremia, and the influence of some covariates. Methods The study was conducted in a dialysis unit associated with a high complexity hospital in Medellín between October 2017 and October 2019. An initial measurement was taken to evaluate S. aureus colonization, and follow-up measurements were performed 2 and 6 months later. Bacteremia evolution was monitored for 12 months. A two-state recurrent continuous-time Markov model was constructed to model transition dynamics from non-colonization to S. aureus colonization in hemodialysis patients. Subsequently, the model was applied to a third state of bacteremia. Results Of 178 patients on hemodialysis, 30.3% were colonized by S. aureus. Transition intensity from non-colonization to colonization was three times higher (0.21; CI: 0.14-0.29) than from colonization to non-colonization (0.07; CI: 0.05-0.11). The colonization risk increased in patients with previous infections (HR: 2.28; CI: 0.78-6.68), hospitalization (HR: 1.29; CI: 0.56-2.99) and antibiotics consumption (HR: 1.17; CI: 0.53-2.58). Mean non-colonized state duration was 10.9 months, while in the colonized state was 5.2 months. In the 3-state model, it was found that patients colonized were more likely to develop S. aureus infection (13.9%). Conclusion A more likely transition from non-colonization to colonization was found, which increases with factors such as previous infection. In addition, the development of bacteremia was more likely in colonized than in non-colonized patients. These results underline the importance of surveillance and proper management of S. aureus colonization to prevent serious complications, such as bacteremia, and improve prognosis in this vulnerable population.

                Background The micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) play a pivotal role in the Latin America economy, creating jobs, boosting local economic activity and contribute to the socio-economic development of the region. The purpose is to reflect on the current costs management prices, the common challenges faced by SMEs in the region, and effective strategies to improve the profitability and sustainability of these companies. Methods it is addressed as a review study of type reflective, which used the dialectic as a method for the construction of the speech, based on techniques of triangulation of information. Result in order to obtain the results, these study topics were pre-selected: (a) determinants of the costs of production in the SMES, b) strategies for the reduction and control of production costs, and c) impact of production costs on the profitability of SMES. Conclusion the present research article delves into the pivotal factors influencing production costs within microenterprises and small businesses situated in the Latin American context. This study posits that the determinants underpinning these costs encompass a spectrum of elements including but not limited to labor, raw materials and supplies, energy and utilities, infrastructure and logistics, regulatory frameworks, and administrative intricacies. Furthermore, the intricate interplay of technology adoption and innovative capabilities is also recognized as a crucial facet in this cost determination paradigm. The overarching understanding underscores the direct and substantial influence of these multifaceted determinants on the operational expenditure of microenterprises and small businesses.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27039?af=R">Correlations of Socioeconomic and Clinical Determinants with United States County‐Level Stroke Prevalence</a></h4>

              
                <p>Socioeconomic status (SES) is a multi-faceted theoretical construct associated with stroke risk and outcomes. Knowing which SES measures best correlate with population stroke metrics would improve its accounting in observational research and inform interventions. Using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) Population Level Analysis and Community Estimates (PLACES) and other publicly available databases, we conducted an ecological study comparing correlations of different United States county-level SES, health care access and clinical risk factor measures with age-adjusted stroke prevalence. The prevalence of adults living below 150% of the federal poverty level most strongly correlated with stroke prevalence compared to other SES and non-SES measures (correlation coefficient = 0.908, <i>R</i>
<sup>2</sup> = 0.825; adjusted partial correlation coefficient: 0.589, <i>R</i>
<sup>2</sup> = 0.347). ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27043?af=R">Diagnostic MRI Score to Differentiate Susac Syndrome from Primary Angiitis of the Central Nervous System and Multiple Sclerosis</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Susac syndrome (SuS), multiple sclerosis (MS), and primary angiitis of the central nervous system (PACNS) present diagnostic challenges due to overlapping clinical features. We aimed to enhance diagnostic precision by developing the SPAMS (SuS, PACNS, MS) score, a practical radiological tool.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This multicenter study included 99 patients (43 SuS, 37 MS, 19 PACNS) from South American countries. Relevant MRI features were identified through an elastic-net model determined key variables.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The SPAMS score assigned 2 points for snowball lesions, 1 point for spokes-like lesions, or if there are more than 4 lesions in the corpus callosum, corpus callosum involvement, or cerebellar involvement. It subtracted 1 point if gadolinium-enhancing lesions or 4 points if Dawson's fingers are present. Bootstrapping validated the optimal cutoff at 2 points, exhibiting a diagnostic performance of area under the curve = 0.931, sensitivity = 88%, specificity = 89%, positive predictive value = 88%, negative predictive value = 89%, and accuracy = 88%.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>When specific MRI findings coexisted, the SPAMS score differentiated SuS from MS and PACNS. Access to MRI and standard protocol sequences makes it a valuable tool for timely diagnosis and treatment, potentially preventing disability progression and severe clinical outcomes.

                Frisbie et al. demonstrate that stromal-to-tumor cell mitochondrial transfer drives ovarian cancer metastasis and clonal heterogeneity. Carcinoma-associated mesenchymal stem cells donate mitochondria to vulnerable tumor cells, enhancing tumor cell proliferation, chemoresistance, and respiratory capacity and triggering ANGPTL3 secretion to further promote tumor growth. These findings offer a potential therapeutic target for ovarian cancer.

                Dopamine axons are the only axons known to grow during adolescence. Here, using rodent models, we examined how two proteins, Netrin-1 and its receptor, UNC5C, guide dopamine axons toward the prefrontal cortex and shape behaviour. We demonstrate in mice (<i>Mus musculus</i>) that dopamine axons reach the cortex through a transient gradient of Netrin-1-expressing cells – disrupting this gradient reroutes axons away from their target. Using a seasonal model (Siberian hamsters; <i>Phodopus sungorus</i>) we find that mesocortical dopamine development can be regulated by a natural environmental cue (daylength) in a sexually dimorphic manner – delayed in males, but advanced in females. The timings of dopamine axon growth and UNC5C expression are always phase-locked. Adolescence is an ill-defined, transitional period; we pinpoint neurodevelopmental markers underlying this period.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91114">SPAG7 deletion causes intrauterine growth restriction, resulting in adulthood obesity and metabolic dysfunction</a></h4>

              
                From a forward mutagenetic screen to discover mutations associated with obesity, we identified mutations in the <i>Spag7</i> gene linked to metabolic dysfunction in mice. Here, we show that SPAG7 KO mice are born smaller and develop obesity and glucose intolerance in adulthood. This obesity does not stem from hyperphagia, but a decrease in energy expenditure. The KO animals also display reduced exercise tolerance and muscle function due to impaired mitochondrial function. Furthermore, SPAG7-deficiency in developing embryos leads to intrauterine growth restriction, brought on by placental insufficiency, likely due to abnormal development of the placental junctional zone. This insufficiency leads to loss of SPAG7-deficient fetuses in utero and reduced birth weights of those that survive. We hypothesize that a ‘thrifty phenotype’ is ingrained in SPAG7 KO animals during development that leads to adult obesity. Collectively, these results indicate that SPAG7 is essential for embryonic development and energy homeostasis later in life.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89986">Cholinergic input to mouse visual cortex signals a movement state and acutely enhances layer 5 responsiveness</a></h4>

              
                Acetylcholine is released in visual cortex by axonal projections from the basal forebrain. The signals conveyed by these projections and their computational significance are still unclear. Using two-photon calcium imaging in behaving mice, we show that basal forebrain cholinergic axons in the mouse visual cortex provide a binary locomotion state signal. In these axons, we found no evidence of responses to visual stimuli or visuomotor prediction errors. While optogenetic activation of cholinergic axons in visual cortex in isolation did not drive local neuronal activity, when paired with visuomotor stimuli, it resulted in layer-specific increases of neuronal activity. Responses in layer 5 neurons to both top-down and bottom-up inputs were increased in amplitude and decreased in latency, whereas those in layer 2/3 neurons remained unchanged. Using opto- and chemogenetic manipulations of cholinergic activity, we found acetylcholine to underlie the locomotion-associated decorrelation of activity between neurons in both layer 2/3 and layer 5. Our results suggest that acetylcholine augments the responsiveness of layer 5 neurons to inputs from outside of the local network, possibly enabling faster switching between internal representations during locomotion.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91030">RAG1 and RAG2 non-core regions are implicated in leukemogenesis and off-target V(D)J recombination in BCR-ABL1-driven B-cell lineage lymphoblastic leukemia</a></h4>

              
                The evolutionary conservation of non-core RAG regions suggests significant roles that might involve quantitative or qualitative alterations in RAG activity. Off-target V(D)J recombination contributes to lymphomagenesis and is exacerbated by RAG2’ C-terminus absence in <i>Tp53<sup>−/−</sup></i> mice thymic lymphomas. However, the genomic stability effects of non-core regions from both <i>Rag1<sup>c/c</sup></i> and <i>Rag2<sup>c/c</sup></i> in <i>BCR-ABL1</i><sup>+</sup> B-lymphoblastic leukemia (<i>BCR-ABL1</i><sup>+</sup> B-ALL), the characteristics, and mechanisms of non-core regions in suppressing off-target V(D)J recombination remain unclear. Here, we established three mouse models of <i>BCR-ABL1</i><sup>+</sup> B-ALL in mice expressing full-length RAG (Rag<sup>f/f</sup>), core RAG1 (Rag1<sup>c/c</sup>), and core RAG2 (Rag2<sup>c/c</sup>). The <i>Rag<sup>c/c</sup></i> (<i>Rag1<sup>c/c</sup></i> and <i>Rag2<sup>c/c</sup></i>) leukemia cells exhibited greater malignant tumor characteristics compared to <i>Rag<sup>f/f</sup></i> cells. Additionally, <i>Rag<sup>c/c</sup></i> cells showed higher frequency of off-target V(D)J recombination and oncogenic mutations than <i>Rag<sup>f/f</sup></i>. We also revealed decreased RAG cleavage accuracy in <i>Rag<sup>c/c</sup></i> cells and a smaller recombinant size in <i>Rag1<sup>c/c</sup></i> cells, which could potentially exacerbate off-target V(D)J recombination in <i>Rag<sup>c/c</sup></i> cells. In conclusion, these findings indicate that the non-core RAG regions, particularly the non-core region of RAG1, play a significant role in preserving V(D)J recombination precision and genomic stability in <i>BCR-ABL1</i><sup>+</sup> B-ALL.

	<p>To ensure survival, the visual system must rapidly extract the most important elements from a large stream of information. This necessity clashes with the computational limitations of the human brain, so a strong early data reduction is required to efficiently process information in fast vision. A theoretical early vision model, recently developed to preserve maximum information using minimal computational resources, allows efficient image data reduction by extracting simplified sketches containing only optimally informative, salient features. Here, we investigate the neural substrates of this mechanism for optimal encoding of information, possibly located in early visual structures. We adopted a flicker adaptation paradigm, which has been demonstrated to specifically impair the contrast sensitivity of the magnocellular pathway. We compared flicker-induced contrast threshold changes in three different tasks. The results indicate that, after adapting to a uniform flickering field, thresholds for image discrimination using briefly presented sketches increase. Similar threshold elevations occur for motion discrimination, a task typically targeting the magnocellular system. Instead, contrast thresholds for orientation discrimination, a task typically targeting the parvocellular system, do not change with flicker adaptation. The computation performed by this early data reduction mechanism seems thus consistent with magnocellular processing.</p>

	<p>The present study aimed to elucidate the neural mechanisms underpinning the visual recognition of morphologically complex verbs in Korean, a morphologically rich, agglutinative language with inherent polymorphemic characteristics. In an fMRI experiment with a lexical decision paradigm, we investigated whether verb inflection types (base, regular, and irregular) are processed through separate mechanisms or a single system. Furthermore, we explored the semantic influence in processing inflectional morphology by manipulating the semantic ambiguity (homonymous vs. unambiguous) of inflected verbs. The results showed equivalent activation levels in the left inferior frontal gyrus for both regular and irregular verbs, challenging the dichotomy between the two. Graded effects of verb regularity were observed in the occipitotemporal regions, with regular inflections eliciting increased activation in the fusiform and lingual gyri. In the middle occipital gyrus, homonyms showed decreased activation relative to that of unambiguous words, specifically for base and irregular forms. Furthermore, the angular gyrus exhibited significant modulation with all verb types, indicating a semantic influence during morphological processing. These findings support single-system theories and the connectionist framework, challenging the assumptions of purely orthographic morphological decomposition and dual-mechanism accounts. Furthermore, they provide evidence for a semantic influence during morphological processing, with differential reliance on semantic activation for regular and irregular inflections.</p>

	<p>Music is integrated into daily life when listening to it, playing it, and singing, uniquely modulating brain activity. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), celebrated for its ecological validity, has been used to elucidate this music&amp;amp;ndash;brain interaction. This scoping review synthesizes 22 empirical studies using fNIRS to explore the intricate relationship between music and brain function. This synthesis of existing evidence reveals that diverse musical activities, such as listening to music, singing, and playing instruments, evoke unique brain responses influenced by individual traits and musical attributes. A further analysis identifies five key themes, including the effect of passive and active music experiences on relevant human brain areas, lateralization in music perception, individual variations in neural responses, neural synchronization in musical performance, and new insights fNIRS has revealed in these lines of research. While this review highlights the limited focus on specific brain regions and the lack of comparative analyses between musicians and non-musicians, it emphasizes the need for future research to investigate the complex interplay between music and the human brain.</p>

	<p>An efficient mode of evaluation for eye movements is the use of objective eye tracking systems combined with subjective tests (NSUCO or DEM), which are easily applicable across all age groups and in eye care clinical settings. The objective of this study was to characterize fixations during reading in two groups: a group of children with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDG, 24 children, age: 6&amp;amp;ndash;12 years) and a group of children with oculomotor anomalies but without NDD (OAG, 24 children, age: 6&amp;amp;ndash;12 years). The results obtained were compared with those from a control group (CG, 20 children, age: 6&amp;amp;ndash;12 years). Specifically, the outcomes obtained with two subjective score systems, the Northeastern State University College of Optometry&amp;amp;rsquo;s Oculomotor (NSUCO) test and the Developmental Eye Movement (DEM) test, were compared with the objective analysis obtained through a commercially available eye tracker (Tobii Eye X, Tobii, Stockholm, Sweden). Specialized analysis software, namely Clinical Eye Tracker 2020 (Thomson Software Solutions, Welham Green, UK), was used. It was found that children with NDD had impaired oculomotor skills. A higher number of regressions, more fixations, and longer durations of fixations appear to be characteristic signs of this population group. Additionally, children with NDD took longer to complete the DEM test, as well as exhibiting more errors. The use of objective videoculographic systems for eye tracking and subjective tests like the NSUCO or DEM are good tools to assess saccadic movements, allowing the detection of oculomotor abnormalities in children with NDD.</p>

	<p>The purpose of the present study was to examine whether spatial or temporal prediction of the tactile stimulus contributes to tactile sensitivity. To investigate the effect of spatial prediction on tactile sensitivity, electrical stimuli were provided for the digit nerve in one of five fingers, and advanced notice of the stimulating finger was provided before the stimulus in some trials but not in others. There was no significant effect of spatial prediction on the intensity at the perceptual threshold of the digit nerve stimulus. This indicates that spatial prediction of the tactile stimulus does not influence tactile sensitivity. To examine the effect of temporal prediction, an auditory warning cue was provided 0, 1, or 10 s before the electrical stimulus to the digit nerve. The stimulus intensity at the perceptual threshold in the trials with the 1 s warning cue was lower than those with the 0 s warning cue. This indicates that temporal prediction enhances tactile sensitivity. The stimulus intensity at the perceptual threshold in the trials with the 1 s warning cue was lower than those with the 10 s warning cue. This means that the contribution of temporal prediction to the tactile sensitivity is greater as the warning cue is closer to the time of the stimulus. This finding may be explained by a defense mechanism activated when humans predict that a tactile stimulus is coming soon.</p>

	<p>(1) Background: Tinnitus involves the conscious awareness of a tonal or composite noise for which there is no identifiable corresponding external acoustic source. For many people, tinnitus is a disorder associated with symptoms of emotional distress, cognitive dysfunction, autonomic arousal, behavioural changes, and functional disability. Many symptoms can be addressed effectively using education or cognitive behavioural therapy. However, there is no treatment that effectively reduces or alters tinnitus-related neurophysiological activity and thus the tinnitus percept. In this systematic review, we evaluated the effectiveness of neuromodulation therapies for tinnitus that explicitly target pathological synchronous neural activity. (2) Methods: Multiple databases were searched for randomised controlled trials of neuromodulation interventions for tinnitus in adults, with 24 trials included. The risk of bias was assessed, and where appropriate, meta-analyses were performed. (3) Results: Few trials used acoustic, vagal nerve, or transcranial alternating current stimulation, or bimodal stimulation techniques, with limited evidence of neuromodulation or clinical effectiveness. Multiple trials of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) were identified, and a synthesis demonstrated a significant improvement in tinnitus symptom severity in favour of tDCS versus control, although heterogeneity was high. (4) Discussion: Neuromodulation for tinnitus is an emerging but promising field. Electrical stimulation techniques are particularly interesting, given recent advances in current flow modelling that can be applied to future studies.</p>

                <p>The role of gamma rhythm (30&ndash;80&nbsp;Hz) in visual processing is debated; stimuli like gratings and hue patches generate strong gamma, but many natural images do not. Could image gamma responses be predicted by approximating images as gratings or hue patches? Surprisingly, this question remains unanswered, since the joint dependence of gamma on multiple features is poorly understood. We recorded local field potentials and electrocorticogram from two female monkeys while presenting natural images and parametric stimuli varying along several feature dimensions. Gamma responses to different grating/hue features were separable, allowing for a multiplicative model based on individual features. By fitting a hue patch to the image around the receptive field, this simple model could predict gamma responses to chromatic images across scales with reasonably high accuracy. Our results provide a simple "baseline" model to predict gamma from local image properties, against which more complex models of natural vision can be tested.</p>

                <p>Chronic neuropathic pain can result from nervous system injury and can persist in the absence of external stimuli. Although ongoing pain characterizes the disorder, in many individuals, the intensity of this ongoing pain fluctuates dramatically. Previously, it was identified that functional magnetic resonance imaging signal covariations between the midbrain periaqueductal gray (PAG) matter, rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM), and spinal trigeminal nucleus are associated with moment-to-moment fluctuations in pain intensity in individuals with painful trigeminal neuropathy (PTN). Since this brainstem circuit is modulated by higher brain input, we sought to determine which cortical sites might be influencing this brainstem network during spontaneous fluctuations in pain intensity. Over 12&nbsp;min, we recorded the ongoing pain intensity in 24 PTN participants and classified them as fluctuating (<I>n</I> = 13) or stable (<I>n</I> = 11). Using a PAG seed, we identified connections between the PAG and emotional-affective sites such as the hippocampal and posterior cingulate cortices, the sensory-discriminative posterior insula, and cognitive-affective sites such as the dorsolateral prefrontal (dlPFC) and subgenual anterior cingulate cortices that were altered dependent on spontaneous high and low pain intensity. Additionally, sliding-window functional connectivity analysis revealed that the dlPFC&ndash;PAG connection anticorrelated with perceived pain intensity over the entire 12&nbsp;min period. These findings reveal cortical systems underlying moment-to-moment changes in perceived pain in PTN, which likely cause dysregulation in the brainstem circuits previously identified, and consequently alter the appraisal of pain across time.</p>

                Fondrakö is the local wisdom of the Nias ethnic community and has two functions. First are the oral religious holy book teaching ancestors' values and philosophy. Second is the highest consensus institution of the traditional society formulating and making decisions on the socio-religious law to guarantee the order of the community. This paper explains that social differentiation has happened in the modern era; philosophical values of fondrakö remain to live up to this day and experience the proliferation of rites. The argumentation built through this paper is that primitive culture will not simply disappear in the modern community just because it experiences accommodation and the decrease of emotional intensity into new forms. Social laws of primitive religion are not always contradictory and can run parallel with civilization.

                Background A holistic architectural education is the culmination of learning knowledge, skills, attitudes, and values, which eventually reflects in the quality of graduates. Even though different schools of thought have made various kinds of qualitative contributions towards the evolution of architectural education in India, it has largely been dominated by the quantitative and technical aspects of its regulating framework. Architects engage with the demanding contradictions between responsibilities of an ethical nature, the dynamic challenges of practice, and the intricacies of architectural imagination. The aesthetical and imaginative foundations of the field make it incumbent upon the architects to possess a balance of ecumenical proficiencies for accountability and personalization. The purpose of the study is to identify relevant attributes of Competency Based Education (CBE) that can be adopted for architectural education in India. Methods This research follows a narrative review approach and a descriptive-analytic method to broadly understand the attributes of CBE and its potential relevance to architectural education in India. 313 articles were searched on various search strings based on their relevance to the inquiry. 66 documents written in English language were included and appraised through the Scale of the Assessment for Narrative Review Articles (SANRA) tool to avoid any risk of bias. The PRISMA 2020 checklist and flow diagram has been used to report the findings of this narrative review Result The study identifies eight critical parameters of CBE with respect to its definitions, origins, transitions, regulatory environment, characteristics, approaches and implications on teaching-learning, frameworks and models of assessment; and challenges, which makes a case for the relevance of CBE for architectural education in India, which hasn’t been explored yet. Conclusion The broader expectations of ‘being competent’ can be addressed through a conscious adoption of strategies of relevant attributes of CBE which can encourage building attitudes and temperament for life-long learning

                Background: Edible films intended for food packaging have been produced from hydrocolloids, lipids, resins, and composites, including gelatin. Gelatin is known to have a good filming ability and has been suggested as an alternative to non-biodegradable plastics. Naturally active compounds incorporated into film packaging may not only protect the food product from oxidation and microbial contamination, but they may also alter the physicochemical properties of the film. Silver nanoparticles have been used in food packaging as active agents due to their antibacterial and antifungal properties. The addition may affect the characteristics of the packaging. Therefore, this study aims to determine the effect of the addition of silver nanoparticles on the physicochemical characteristics of edible film from Pangasius sp. skin gelatin. Methods: Mangrove extract of Bruguiera gymnorrhiza was used to synthesize silver into nanoparticle size. In this study, silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) with different concentrations (0, 2, 4 and 8%) were added into gelatin-based edible film. The edible films produced were observed for their physicochemical characteristics, including thickness, tensile strength, elongation, water vapour transmission, moisture content, pH, and colour. Results: AgNPs affected the colour of the fish-gelatin-based edible film, as an increased concentration of AgNPs resulted in a darker film. Nevertheless, the addition of AgNPs showed no significant effect on the thickness (145–216 µm), tensile strength (14.58–19.72 MPa), elongation (21.86–54.19%), water vapour transmission (30.91–42.55 g/m2/day), moisture content (9.57–11.16%) or pH (5.92–6.01) of the fish-gelatin-based edible film. Conclusions: The addition of AgNPs has no significant effect on gelatin-based edible film physicochemical properties except colour. Therefore, the incorporated edible film has the potential to be developed further.

                Foreign bodies (FB) in the aerodigestive tract are common, especially in children. The type of foreign body in the esophagus can vary and include magnets. A magnet that lodges in the esophagus should be extracted within 24 hours to prevent complications due to associated chemical reactions. In rural areas, there are several limitations to extracting FBs from the esophagus. We report a case of a magnetic FB that lodged in the esophagus of a three-year-old boy. The extraction was successfully done by esophagoscopy with the modification of a hook that was attached to the endoscope. This innovation may help physician all over the world, especially in rural areas. In the future, this innovation could be produced on an industrial scale.

                Background Fluid resuscitation is an essential component for sepsis treatment. Although several studies demonstrated that dynamic variables were more accurate than static variables for prediction of fluid responsiveness, fluid resuscitation guidance by dynamic variables is not standard for treatment. The objectives were to determine the effects of dynamic inferior vena cava (IVC)-guided versus (vs.) static central venous pressure (CVP)-guided fluid resuscitation in septic patients on mortality; and others, i.e., resuscitation targets, shock duration, fluid and vasopressor amount, invasive respiratory support, length of stay and adverse events. Methods A single-blind randomized controlled trial was conducted at Thammasat University Hospital between August 2016 and April 2020. Septic patients were stratified by acute physiologic and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II) <25 or ≥25 and randomized by blocks of 2 and 4 to fluid resuscitation guidance by dynamic IVC or static CVP. Results Of 124 patients enrolled, 62 were randomized to each group, and one of each was excluded from mortality analysis. Baseline characteristics were comparable. The 30-day mortality rates between dynamic IVC vs. static CVP groups were not different (34.4% vs. 45.9%, p=0.196). Relative risk for 30-day mortality of dynamic IVC group was 0.8 (95%CI=0.5-1.2, p=0.201). Different outcomes were median (interquartile range) of shock duration (0.8 (0.4-1.6) vs. 1.5 (1.1-3.1) days, p=0.001) and norepinephrine (NE) dose (6.8 (3.9–17.8) vs. 16.1 (7.6–53.6) milligrams, p=0.008 and 0.1 (0.1-0.3) vs. 0.3 (0.1-0.8) milligram⋅kilogram−1, p=0.017). Others were not different. Conclusions Dynamic IVC-guided fluid resuscitation does not affect mortality of septic patients. However, this may reduce shock duration and NE dose, compared with static CVP guidance.

                Background SARS-CoV-2 first appeared in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Looking at the prevalence data in the world and in Indonesia, the highest mortality rate due to COVID-19 involves age, gender and comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus.

Results Out of 8711 literatures that were traced from various search sources, there were 46 literatures that were included in this study. The results of the analysis on age showed the Standardized Mean Difference (SMD) value of 0.45 and P <0.0001 (95% CI: 0.23–0.68), the gender analysis showed an Odds Ratio (OR) value of 3.28 and P = 0.01 (95% CI: 1.26–8.52) and the prothrombin time analysis showed SMD values of 0.41 and P = 0.07 (95%CI = -0.03–0.85). Conclusion Older and male COVID-19 patients have a higher risk of having diabetes compared to younger and female COVID-19 patients. As diabetes is a comorbidity in COVID-19, it can be concluded that old age and male sex are associated with a more severe disease.

                <p>by Patrick Bryant, Frank Noé</p>

Structure prediction of protein complexes has improved significantly with AlphaFold2 and AlphaFold-multimer (AFM), but only 60% of dimers are accurately predicted. Here, we learn a bias to the MSA representation that improves the predictions by performing gradient descent through the AFM network. We demonstrate the performance on seven difficult targets from CASP15 and increase the average MMscore to 0.76 compared to 0.63 with AFM. We evaluate the procedure on 487 protein complexes where AFM fails and obtain an increased success rate (MMscore>0.75) of 33% on these difficult targets. Our protocol, AFProfile, provides a way to direct predictions towards a defined target function guided by the MSA. We expect gradient descent over the MSA to be useful for different tasks.

                <p>by David Moreau, Kristina Wiebels</p>

Open science principles are revolutionizing the transparency, reproducibility, and accessibility of research. Meta-analysis has become a key technique for synthesizing data across studies in a principled way; however, its impact is contingent on adherence to open science practices. Here, we outline 9 quick tips for open meta-analyses, aimed at guiding researchers to maximize the reach and utility of their findings. We advocate for outlining preregistering clear protocols, opting for open tools and software, and the use of version control systems to ensure transparency and facilitate collaboration. We further emphasize the importance of reproducibility, for example, by sharing search syntax and analysis scripts, and discuss the benefits of planning for dynamic updating to enable living meta-analyses. We also recommend publication in open-access formats, as well as open data, open code, and open access publication. We close by encouraging active promotion of research findings to bridge the gap between complex syntheses and public discourse, and provide a detailed submission checklist to equip researchers, reviewers and journal editors with a structured approach to conducting and reporting open meta-analyses.

<i>Streptomyces</i> are renowned for their prolific production of specialized metabolites with applications in medicine and agriculture. These multicellular bacteria present a sophisticated developmental cycle and play a key role in soil ecology. Little is known about the impact of <i>Streptomyces</i> phage on bacterial physiology. In this study, we investigated the conditions governing the expression and production of “Samy,” a prophage found in <i>Streptomyces ambofaciens</i> ATCC 23877. This siphoprophage is produced simultaneously with the activation of other mobile genetic elements. Remarkably, the presence and production of Samy increases bacterial dispersal under in vitro stress conditions. Altogether, this study unveiled a new property of a bacteriophage infection in the context of multicellular aggregate dynamics.

                <p>by Thi Tuong Vi Dang, Corinne Maufrais, Jessie Colin, Frédérique Moyrand, Isabelle Mouyna, Jean-Yves COPPEE, Chinaemerem U. Onyishi, Joanna Lipecka, Ida Chiara Guerrera, Robin C. May, Guilhem Janbon</p>

Alternative transcription start site (TSS) usage regulation has been identified as a major means of gene expression regulation in metazoans. However, in fungi, its impact remains elusive as its study has thus far been restricted to model yeasts. Here, we first re-analyzed TSS-seq data to define genuine TSS clusters in 2 species of pathogenic <i>Cryptococcu</i>s. We identified 2 types of TSS clusters associated with specific DNA sequence motifs. Our analysis also revealed that alternative TSS usage regulation in response to environmental cues is widespread in <i>Cryptococcus</i>, altering gene expression and protein targeting. Importantly, we performed a forward genetic screen to identify a unique transcription factor (TF) named Tur1, which regulates alternative TSS (altTSS) usage genome-wide when cells switch from exponential phase to stationary phase. ChiP-Seq and DamID-Seq analyses suggest that at some loci, the role of Tur1 might be direct. Tur1 has been previously shown to be essential for virulence in <i>C</i>. <i>neoformans</i>. We demonstrated here that a <i>tur1Δ</i> mutant strain is more sensitive to superoxide stress and phagocytosed more efficiently by macrophages than the wild-type (WT) strain.

                Background Stool consistency is an important outcome measure to evaluate in the investigation of several gastrointestinal diseases. The Bristol Stool Scale (BSS) is one of the most commonly used tools for evaluation of stool consistency. BSS ranges from 1-7 and each score is assigned to a given consistency of the feces. Self-reported characterizations can differ from an expert evaluation, and the reliability of BSS is unclear. We aimed to evaluate the reliability of BSS by comparing patient scores with expert scores. Methods Patients with inflammatory bowel disease collected stool samples throughout a 3-year follow-up. The stool´s consistency was evaluated with BSS by the patients and matched with an expert score. Agreement between patient and expert scores was assessed using Cohen’s kappa. Results BSS scores from 2280 fecal samples collected from 992 patients at up to five time points were included. When all samples were compared, there was good to substantial agreement between patient and expert scores (Cohen’s weighted kappa: 0.66-0.72). When the BSS scores were simplified and categorized as 1 (scores 1-2), 2 (scores 3-5) or 3 (scores 6-7), the agreement improved slightly (Cohen’s weighted kappa: 0.73-0.77). When the scores from the first sample per patient were compared, the experts were more likely to assign higher scores compared to the patient. The proportion of the lowest assigned scores (1-2) was 12.1% for patients and 8.1% for experts. Conclusions The agreement between patient and expert BSS scores is good to substantial, especially when the BSS scores are simplified into three categories.

<br/>
<p>Despite therapeutic suppression of relapses, multiple sclerosis (MS) patients often experience subtle deterioration, which extends beyond the definition of “progression independent of relapsing activity.” We propose the concept of smouldering-associated-worsening (SAW), encompassing physical and cognitive symptoms, resulting from smouldering pathological processes, which remain unmet therapeutic targets. We provide a consensus-based framework of possible pathological substrates and manifestations of smouldering MS, and we discuss clinical, radiological, and serum/cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers for potentially monitoring SAW. Finally, we share considerations for optimizing disease surveillance and implications for clinical trials to promote the integration of smouldering MS into routine practice and future research efforts.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96041">Spatiotemporal changes in Netrin/Dscam1 signaling dictate axonal projection direction in Drosophila small ventral lateral clock neurons</a></h4>

              
                Axon projection is a spatial- and temporal-specific process in which the growth cone receives environmental signals guiding axons to their final destination. However, the mechanisms underlying changes in axonal projection direction without well-defined landmarks remain elusive. Here, we present evidence showcasing the dynamic nature of axonal projections in <i>Drosophila</i>’s small ventral lateral clock neurons (s-LNvs). Our findings reveal that these axons undergo an initial vertical projection in the early larval stage, followed by a subsequent transition to a horizontal projection in the early-to-mid third instar larvae. The vertical projection of s-LNv axons correlates with mushroom body calyx expansion, while the s-LNv-expressed Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule (Dscam1) interacts with Netrins to regulate the horizontal projection. During a specific temporal window, locally newborn dorsal clock neurons secrete Netrins, facilitating the transition of axonal projection direction in s-LNvs. Our study establishes a compelling in vivo model to probe the mechanisms of axonal projection direction switching in the absence of clear landmarks. These findings underscore the significance of dynamic local microenvironments in the complementary regulation of axonal projection direction transitions.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93077">A syngeneic spontaneous zebrafish model of tp53-deficient, EGFRvIII, and PI3KCAH1047R-driven glioblastoma reveals inhibitory roles for inflammation during tumor initiation and relapse in vivo</a></h4>

              
                High-throughput vertebrate animal model systems for the study of patient-specific biology and new therapeutic approaches for aggressive brain tumors are currently lacking, and new approaches are urgently needed. Therefore, to build a patient-relevant in vivo model of human glioblastoma, we expressed common oncogenic variants including activated human EGFR<sup>vIII</sup> and PI3KCA<sup>H1047R</sup> under the control of the radial glial-specific promoter <i>her4.1</i> in syngeneic <i>tp53</i> loss-of-function mutant zebrafish. Robust tumor formation was observed prior to 45 days of life, and tumors had a gene expression signature similar to human glioblastoma of the mesenchymal subtype, with a strong inflammatory component. Within early stage tumor lesions, and in an in vivo and endogenous tumor microenvironment, we visualized infiltration of phagocytic cells, as well as internalization of tumor cells by <i>mpeg1.1</i>:EGFP+ microglia/macrophages, suggesting negative regulatory pressure by pro-inflammatory cell types on tumor growth at early stages of glioblastoma initiation. Furthermore, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene targeting of master inflammatory transcription factors <i>irf7</i> or <i>irf8</i> led to increased tumor formation in the primary context, while suppression of phagocyte activity led to enhanced tumor cell engraftment following transplantation into otherwise immune-competent zebrafish hosts. Altogether, we developed a genetically relevant model of aggressive human glioblastoma and harnessed the unique advantages of zebrafish including live imaging, high-throughput genetic and chemical manipulations to highlight important tumor-suppressive roles for the innate immune system on glioblastoma initiation, with important future opportunities for therapeutic discovery and optimizations.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89367">Temporally resolved early bone morphogenetic protein-driven transcriptional cascade during human amnion specification</a></h4>

              
                Amniogenesis, a process critical for continuation of healthy pregnancy, is triggered in a collection of pluripotent epiblast cells as the human embryo implants. Previous studies have established that bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling is a major driver of this lineage specifying process, but the downstream BMP-dependent transcriptional networks that lead to successful amniogenesis remain to be identified. This is, in part, due to the current lack of a robust and reproducible model system that enables mechanistic investigations exclusively into amniogenesis. Here, we developed an improved model of early amnion specification, using a human pluripotent stem cell-based platform in which the activation of BMP signaling is controlled and synchronous. Uniform amniogenesis is seen within 48 hr after BMP activation, and the resulting cells share transcriptomic characteristics with amnion cells of a gastrulating human embryo. Using detailed time-course transcriptomic analyses, we established a previously uncharacterized BMP-dependent amniotic transcriptional cascade, and identified markers that represent five distinct stages of amnion fate specification; the expression of selected markers was validated in early post-implantation macaque embryos. Moreover, a cohort of factors that could potentially control specific stages of amniogenesis was identified, including the transcription factor TFAP2A. Functionally, we determined that, once amniogenesis is triggered by the BMP pathway, TFAP2A controls the progression of amniogenesis. This work presents a temporally resolved transcriptomic resource for several previously uncharacterized amniogenesis states and demonstrates a critical intermediate role for TFAP2A during amnion fate specification.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/84532">Hippo pathway-mediated YAP1/TAZ inhibition is essential for proper pancreatic endocrine specification and differentiation</a></h4>

              
                The Hippo pathway plays a central role in tissue development and homeostasis. However, the function of Hippo in pancreatic endocrine development remains obscure. Here, we generated novel conditional genetically engineered mouse models to examine the roles of Hippo pathway-mediated YAP1/TAZ inhibition in the development stages of endocrine specification and differentiation. While YAP1 protein was localized to the nuclei in bipotent progenitor cells, Neurogenin 3 expressing endocrine progenitors completely lost YAP1 expression. Using genetically engineered mouse models, we found that inactivation of YAP1 requires both an intact Hippo pathway and Neurogenin 3 protein. Gene deletion of Lats1 and 2 kinases (<i>Lats1&amp;2</i>) in endocrine progenitor cells of developing mouse pancreas using <i>Neurog3<sup>Cre</sup></i> blocked endocrine progenitor cell differentiation and specification, resulting in reduced islets size and a disorganized pancreas at birth. Loss of <i>Lats1&amp;2</i> in Neurogenin 3 expressing cells activated YAP1/TAZ transcriptional activity and recruited macrophages to the developing pancreas. These defects were rescued by deletion of <i>Yap1/Wwtr1</i> genes, suggesting that tight regulation of YAP1/TAZ by Hippo signaling is crucial for pancreatic endocrine specification. In contrast, deletion of <i>Lats1&amp;2</i> using β-cell-specific Ins1<i><sup>CreER</sup></i> resulted in a phenotypically normal pancreas, indicating that <i>Lats1&amp;2</i> are indispensable for differentiation of endocrine progenitors but not for that of β-cells. Our results demonstrate that loss of YAP1/TAZ expression in the pancreatic endocrine compartment is not a passive consequence of endocrine specification. Rather, Hippo pathway-mediated inhibition of YAP1/TAZ in endocrine progenitors is a prerequisite for endocrine specification and differentiation.

	<p>Background: Psoriasis and atopic dermatitis are chronic skin diseases found all over the world that cause a lot of suffering to patients. Objectives: The aim of this study was to answer the following questions: whether people suffering from psoriasis and AD have greater problems with recognizing emotions, the effectiveness of attention and memory processes, and whether they use different strategies of coping with stress than healthy people. Methods: This study involved 90 patients, including 30 patients with psoriasis, 30 patients with AD and 30 healthy patients, aged 21 to 63 years, including 54 women and 36 men. This study used a battery of the CANTAB Cognitive Tests, Mini-COPE Questionnaire Inventory, Toronto Alexithymia Scale TAS Questionnaire, Psoriasis Area and Severity Index, and Eczema Area and Severity Index. Results: People with psoriasis and AD had higher total scores on the alexithymia scale and had greater difficulty in identifying and verbalizing emotions. People with psoriasis and AD are less likely to choose the correct stimulus and achieve a shorter length of the sequence that should be remembered. Psoriasis patients with more severe symptoms are less likely to use the strategy of a sense of humor in stressful situations. AD patients with more severe symptoms are less likely to use strategies of operative thinking, denial and self-blame, and the strategy of seeking instrumental support is used more often. Conclusions: Patients with psoriasis and AD require a holistic approach; in addition to dermatological treatment, psychological support, psychotherapeutic support and possible psychiatric treatment are recommended.</p>
