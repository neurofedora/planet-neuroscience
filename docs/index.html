              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A critical discourse analysis of the Quebec media’s portrayal of older adults in residences and long-term care homes pre- and peri-COVID-19 [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: How we discuss older adults can influence our perceptions of aging and age-related policies, particularly during times of crisis. Ageist discourse in the media impacts how society views older adults and how older adults view themselves. Negative stereotypes have been associated with negative health outcomes and can exacerbate the adverse events faced by older adults during a pandemic. This study examined the Quebec media’s portrayal of older adults living in long-term care (LTC) homes before and during the first wave of COVID-19. Methods: The first confirmed COVID-19 case in Quebec was on 27 February 2020. The Factiva database was searched for newspaper articles that were published three months before (pre) and three months after (peri) the first confirmed case. Articles had to include the terms: older adults, LTC, and/or residence. Articles were excluded if they did not discuss direct or indirect impacts in the lives of people living in LTC (i.e., only discussed statistics of COVID-19 cases). After screening, 208 articles were retained, and critical discourse analysis was conducted. Results: The media discourse regarding older adults in LTC homes revealed a lack of resources (i.e., insufficient staff) and negative health outcomes for older adults (i.e., bed sores) in both the pre- and peri-COVID-19 articles. Negative and positive elements emerged from the peri-COVID-19 discourse, including increased social isolation of those in LTC, government action and advocacy (by health care practitioners and family) to support those in LTC homes. Conclusions: Existing systemic problems were exacerbated by the pandemic and this impacted older adults in LTC homes negatively. Despite this, the peri-COVID-19 discourse suggests meaningful change at the societal and policy levels to improve outcomes for future generations of older adults who reside in LTC homes.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Bayesian parameter estimation for dynamical models in systems biology</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Nathaniel J. Linden, Boris Kramer, Padmini Rangamani</p>

Dynamical systems modeling, particularly via systems of ordinary differential equations, has been used to effectively capture the temporal behavior of different biochemical components in signal transduction networks. Despite the recent advances in experimental measurements, including sensor development and ‘-omics’ studies that have helped populate protein-protein interaction networks in great detail, modeling in systems biology lacks systematic methods to estimate kinetic parameters and quantify associated uncertainties. This is because of multiple reasons, including sparse and noisy experimental measurements, lack of detailed molecular mechanisms underlying the reactions, and missing biochemical interactions. Additionally, the inherent nonlinearities with respect to the states and parameters associated with the system of differential equations further compound the challenges of parameter estimation. In this study, we propose a comprehensive framework for Bayesian parameter estimation and complete quantification of the effects of uncertainties in the data and models. We apply these methods to a series of signaling models of increasing mathematical complexity. Systematic analysis of these dynamical systems showed that parameter estimation depends on data sparsity, noise level, and model structure, including the existence of multiple steady states. These results highlight how focused uncertainty quantification can enrich systems biology modeling and enable additional quantitative analyses for parameter estimation.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Stochastic dynamics of Type-I interferon responses</a></h4>

Interferon (IFN) activates the transcription of several hundred of IFN stimulated genes (ISGs) that constitute a highly effective antiviral defense program. Cell-to-cell variability in the induction of ISGs is well documented, but its source and effects are not completely understood. The molecular mechanisms behind this heterogeneity have been related to randomness in molecular events taking place during the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. Here, we study the sources of variability in the induction of the IFN-alpha response by using MxA and IFIT1 activation as read-out. To this end, we integrate time-resolved flow cytometry data and stochastic modeling of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. The complexity of the IFN response was matched by fitting probability distributions to time-course flow cytometry snapshots. Both, experimental data and simulations confirmed that the MxA and IFIT1 induction circuits generate graded responses rather than all-or-none responses. Subsequently, we quantify the size of the intrinsic variability at different steps in the pathway. We found that stochastic effects are transiently strong during the ligand-receptor activation steps and the formation of the ISGF3 complex, but negligible for the final induction of the studied ISGs. We conclude that the JAK-STAT signaling pathway is a robust biological circuit that efficiently transmits information under stochastic environments.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">MetaLP: An integrative linear programming method for protein inference in metaproteomics</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Shichao Feng, Hong-Long Ji, Huan Wang, Bailu Zhang, Ryan Sterzenbach, Chongle Pan, Xuan Guo</p>

Metaproteomics based on high-throughput tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) plays a crucial role in characterizing microbiome functions. The acquired MS/MS data is searched against a protein sequence database to identify peptides, which are then used to infer a list of proteins present in a metaproteome sample. While the problem of protein inference has been well-studied for proteomics of single organisms, it remains a major challenge for metaproteomics of complex microbial communities because of the large number of degenerate peptides shared among homologous proteins in different organisms. This challenge calls for improved discrimination of true protein identifications from false protein identifications given a set of unique and degenerate peptides identified in metaproteomics. MetaLP was developed here for protein inference in metaproteomics using an integrative linear programming method. Taxonomic abundance information extracted from metagenomics shotgun sequencing or 16s rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, was incorporated as prior information in MetaLP. Benchmarking with mock, human gut, soil, and marine microbial communities demonstrated significantly higher numbers of protein identifications by MetaLP than ProteinLP, PeptideProphet, DeepPep, PIPQ, and Sipros Ensemble. In conclusion, MetaLP could substantially improve protein inference for complex metaproteomes by incorporating taxonomic abundance information in a linear programming model.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Comprehensive characterization of the Hsp70 interactome reveals novel client proteins and interactions mediated by posttranslational modifications</a></h4>

Hsp70 interactions are critical for cellular viability and the response to stress. Previous attempts to characterize Hsp70 interactions have been limited by their transient nature and the inability of current technologies to distinguish direct versus bridged interactions. We report the novel use of cross-linking mass spectrometry (XL-MS) to comprehensively characterize the <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> (budding yeast) Hsp70 protein interactome. Using this approach, we have gained fundamental new insights into Hsp70 function, including definitive evidence of Hsp70 self-association as well as multipoint interaction with its client proteins. In addition to identifying a novel set of direct Hsp70 interactors that can be used to probe chaperone function in cells, we have also identified a suite of posttranslational modification (PTM)-associated Hsp70 interactions. The majority of these PTMs have not been previously reported and appear to be critical in the regulation of client protein function. These data indicate that one of the mechanisms by which PTMs contribute to protein function is by facilitating interaction with chaperones. Taken together, we propose that XL-MS analysis of chaperone complexes may be used as a unique way to identify biologically important PTMs on client proteins.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">The rearing environment persistently modulates mouse phenotypes from the molecular to the behavioural level</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Ivana Jaric, Bernhard Voelkl, Melanie Clerc, Marc W. Schmid, Janja Novak, Marianna Rosso, Reto Rufener, Vanessa Tabea von Kortzfleisch, S. Helene Richter, Manuela Buettner, André Bleich, Irmgard Amrein, David P. Wolfer, Chadi Touma, Shinichi Sunagawa, Hanno Würbel</p>

The phenotype of an organism results from its genotype and the influence of the environment throughout development. Even when using animals of the same genotype, independent studies may test animals of different phenotypes, resulting in poor replicability due to genotype-by-environment interactions. Thus, genetically defined strains of mice may respond differently to experimental treatments depending on their rearing environment. However, the extent of such phenotypic plasticity and its implications for the replicability of research findings have remained unknown. Here, we examined the extent to which common environmental differences between animal facilities modulate the phenotype of genetically homogeneous (inbred) mice. We conducted a comprehensive multicentre study, whereby inbred C57BL/6J mice from a single breeding cohort were allocated to and reared in 5 different animal facilities throughout early life and adolescence, before being transported to a single test laboratory. We found persistent effects of the rearing facility on the composition and heterogeneity of the gut microbial community. These effects were paralleled by persistent differences in body weight and in the behavioural phenotype of the mice. Furthermore, we show that environmental variation among animal facilities is strong enough to influence epigenetic patterns in neurons at the level of chromatin organisation. We detected changes in chromatin organisation in the regulatory regions of genes involved in nucleosome assembly, neuronal differentiation, synaptic plasticity, and regulation of behaviour. Our findings demonstrate that common environmental differences between animal facilities may produce facility-specific phenotypes, from the molecular to the behavioural level. Furthermore, they highlight an important limitation of inferences from single-laboratory studies and thus argue that study designs should take environmental background into account to increase the robustness and replicability of findings.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">GBPL3 localizes to the nuclear pore complex and functionally connects the nuclear basket with the nucleoskeleton in splants</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yu Tang, Man Ip Ho, Byung-Ho Kang, Yangnan Gu</p>

The nuclear basket (NB) is an essential structure of the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and serves as a dynamic and multifunctional platform that participates in various critical nuclear processes, including cargo transport, molecular docking, and gene expression regulation. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are not completely understood, particularly in plants. Here, we identified a guanylate-binding protein (GBP)-like GTPase (GBPL3) as a novel NPC basket component in <i>Arabidopsis</i>. Using fluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy, we found that GBPL3 localizes to the nuclear rim and is enriched in the nuclear pore. Proximity labeling proteomics and protein-protein interaction assays revealed that GBPL3 is predominantly distributed at the NPC basket, where it physically associates with NB nucleoporins and recruits chromatin remodelers, transcription apparatus and regulators, and the RNA splicing and processing machinery, suggesting a conserved function of the NB in transcription regulation as reported in yeasts and animals. Moreover, we found that GBPL3 physically interacts with the nucleoskeleton via disordered coiled-coil regions. Simultaneous loss of <i>GBPL3</i> and 1 of the 4 <i>Arabidopsis</i> nucleoskeleton genes <i>CRWN</i>s led to distinct development- and stress-related phenotypes, ranging from seedling lethality to lesion development, and aberrant transcription of stress-related genes. Our results indicate that GBPL3 is a bona fide component of the plant NPC and physically and functionally connects the NB with the nucleoskeleton, which is required for the coordination of gene expression during plant development and stress responses.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Differences in temporal processing speeds between the right and left auditory cortex reflect the strength of recurrent synaptic connectivity</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Demetrios Neophytou, Diego M. Arribas, Tushar Arora, Robert B. Levy, Il Memming Park, Hysell V. Oviedo</p>

Brain asymmetry in the sensitivity to spectrotemporal modulation is an established functional feature that underlies the perception of speech and music. The left auditory cortex (ACx) is believed to specialize in processing fast temporal components of speech sounds, and the right ACx slower components. However, the circuit features and neural computations behind these lateralized spectrotemporal processes are poorly understood. To answer these mechanistic questions, we use mice, an animal model that captures some relevant features of human communication systems. In this study, we screened for circuit features that could subserve temporal integration differences between the left and right ACx. We mapped excitatory input to principal neurons in all cortical layers and found significantly stronger recurrent connections in the superficial layers of the right ACx compared to the left. We hypothesized that the underlying recurrent neural dynamics would exhibit differential characteristic timescales corresponding to their hemispheric specialization. To investigate, we recorded spike trains from awake mice and estimated the network time constants using a statistical method to combine evidence from multiple weak signal-to-noise ratio neurons. We found longer temporal integration windows in the superficial layers of the right ACx compared to the left as predicted by stronger recurrent excitation. Our study shows substantial evidence linking stronger recurrent synaptic connections to longer network timescales. These findings support speech processing theories that purport asymmetry in temporal integration is a crucial feature of lateralization in auditory processing.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Plasmodium knowlesi infection in East Kalimantan, Indonesia [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Plasmodium knowlesi is the fifth species of plasmodium infecting humans and the infection was first discovered in Southeast Asia in 2004. The incidence has been increasingly reported from almost all Southeast Asian countries, including Indonesia. Although the global incidence of malaria has decreased around 50% in the last decade, the increase of knowlesi malaria infection which can cause severe malaria is of concern. During the period of 2018 to 2021, there were seven newfound cases of knowlesi malaria infection in patients treated at hospital in Samarinda, East Kalimantan, Indonesia. The clinical manifestations and laboratory examinations of these patients are described here. All patients were male and worked in mining and palm oil plantations in the forest in several districts in East, North, and South Kalimantan. The diagnosis was based on microscopic examination of Giemsa-stained thin blood smear and confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. Antimalarial treatment was artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) / dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHP) fixed-dose combination via oral administration for three days with the doses were based on body weight. All knowlesi malaria patients in this report were presented as uncomplicated cases with great response to ACT after 2-3 days of administration without any adverse effects. Besides fever, gastrointestinal symptoms were major symptoms. Anemia was rare, leukocyte count was normal, however thrombocytopenia was found in all patients. P. knowlesi infection has been discovered in East Kalimantan Province and recently the incidence might be higher than the reported cases, making it resemble an iceberg phenomenon. Therefore, we should build awareness of the rapid increasing of knowlesi malaria cases and its prevention.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Epidemiology of pediatric schistosomiasis in hard-to-reach areas and populations: A scoping review protocol [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Schistosomiasis is a neglected tropical disease (NTD) that affects millions of people. Children are the most vulnerable group to developing overt disease. An estimated 779 million people are at risk of schistosomiasis and 50 million preschool-age children (PSAC) need treatment. PSAC are not currently targeted by national chemotherapy campaigns due to a lack of suitable pediatric formulations of praziquantel. The Pediatric Praziquantel Consortium has developed an orally dispersible praziquantel formulation (arpraziquantel) and is facilitating its adoption for schistosomiasis control by endemic countries through the ADOPT program – an implementation research program that paves the way for the large-scale delivery of the child-friendly formulation to treat schistosomiasis in preschool-aged children in endemic countries. A key challenge for comprehensive NTD control including schistosomiasis is reaching all at-risk populations, including those hard to reach. Main access barriers include geographic, social and economic conditions. Objective: This scoping literature review aims to document the epidemiology of schistosomiasis in children under 6 years of age living in hard-to-reach areas and populations. Methods: This review will adopt the five-stage scoping review process of identifying the research question, identifying relevant studies, study selection, charting data and collating, summarizing and reporting results. Electronic databases including Medline, Web of Science, Embase (Ovid), LILACS and African Journals OnLine (AJOL) will be searched for relevant articles. Two independent reviewers will screen identified articles using a two-stage approach of reviewing the title/abstract and then the full text of provisionally retained articles. Relevant literatures will be downloaded into EndNote X9 to maintain and manage citation and facilitate the overall review process. A meta-analysis will be conducted if indicated. Relevance: The results will provide insights into the burden of schistosomiasis among marginalized PSAC, aiming to produce evidence on the need for inclusion of this population when designing the expansion of preventive chemotherapy programs.

                The dorsal striatum integrates prior and current information to guide appropriate decision-making. Chronic stress and stimulant exposure interferes with decision-making, and can confer similar cognitive and behavioral inflexibilities. This review examines the literature on acute and chronic regulation of the epigenome by stress and stimulants. Recent evidence suggests that exposures to stress and stimulants share similarities in the manners in which they regulate the dorsal striatum epigenome through DNA methylation, transposable element activity, and histone post-translational modifications.

                The correlation coefficient gauges linear association between two variables. However, interpreting its value depends on the question at hand. This article argues that relying on the correlation coefficient may be irrelevant for many neuroscience research tasks. When the experimental dataset is contextually suitable for binning-averaging, other indicators of statistical association could prove more suitable.

                Echolocating bats are among the only mammals capable of powered flight, and they rely on active sensing to find food and steer around obstacles in 3D environments. These natural behaviors depend on neural circuits that support 3D auditory localization, audio-motor integration, navigation, and flight control, which are modulated by spatial attention and action selection.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">COVID-19 cluster size and transmission rates in schools from crowdsourced case reports</a></h4>

              
                The role of schools in the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is controversial, with some claiming they are an important driver of the pandemic and others arguing that transmission in schools is negligible. School cluster reports that have been collected in various jurisdictions are a source of data about transmission in schools. These reports consist of the name of a school, a date, and the number of students known to be infected. We provide a simple model for the frequency and size of clusters in this data, based on random arrivals of index cases at schools who then infect their classmates with a highly variable rate, fitting the overdispersion evident in the data. We fit our model to reports from four Canadian provinces, providing estimates of mean and dispersion for cluster size, as well as the distribution of the instantaneous transmission parameter β, whilst factoring in imperfect ascertainment. According to our model with parameters estimated from the data, in all four provinces i) more than 65% of non-index cases occur in the 20% largest clusters, and ii) reducing instantaneous transmission rate and the number of contacts a student has at any given time are effective in reducing the total number of cases, whereas strict bubbling (keeping contacts consistent over time) does not contribute much to reduce cluster sizes. We predict strict bubbling to be more valuable in scenarios with substantially higher transmission rates.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Landscape of epithelial mesenchymal plasticity as an emergent property of coordinated teams in regulatory networks</a></h4>

              
                Elucidating the design principles of regulatory networks driving cellular decision-making has fundamental implications in mapping and eventually controlling cell-fate decisions. Despite being complex, these regulatory networks often only give rise to a few phenotypes. Previously, we identified two 'teams' of nodes in a small cell lung cancer regulatory network that constrained the phenotypic repertoire and aligned strongly with the dominant phenotypes obtained from network simulations (Chauhan et al., 2021). However, it remained elusive whether these 'teams' exist in other networks, and how do they shape the phenotypic landscape. Here, we demonstrate that five different networks of varying sizes governing epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity comprised of two 'teams' of players - one comprised of canonical drivers of epithelial phenotype and the other containing the mesenchymal inducers. These 'teams' are specific to the topology of these regulatory networks and orchestrate a bimodal phenotypic landscape with the epithelial and mesenchymal phenotypes being more frequent and dynamically robust to perturbations, relative to the intermediary/hybrid epithelial/ mesenchymal ones. Our analysis reveals that network topology alone can contain information about corresponding phenotypic distributions, thus obviating the need to simulate them. We propose 'teams' of nodes as a network design principle that can drive cell-fate canalization in diverse decision-making processes.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Augmin prevents merotelic attachments by promoting proper arrangement of bridging and kinetochore fibers</a></h4>

              
                The human mitotic spindle is made of microtubules nucleated at centrosomes, at kinetochores, and from pre-existing microtubules by the augmin complex. However, it is unknown how the augmin-mediated nucleation affects distinct microtubule classes and thereby mitotic fidelity. Here we use superresolution microscopy to analyze the previously indistinguishable microtubule arrangements within the crowded metaphase plate area and demonstrate that augmin is vital for the formation of uniformly arranged parallel units consisting of sister kinetochore fibers connected by a bridging fiber. This ordered geometry helps both prevent and resolve merotelic attachments. Whereas augmin-nucleated bridging fibers prevent merotelic attachments by creating a nearly parallel and highly bundled microtubule arrangement unfavorable for creating additional attachments, augmin-nucleated k-fibers produce robust force required to resolve errors during anaphase. STED microscopy revealed that bridging fibers were impaired twice as much as k-fibers following augmin depletion. The complete absence of bridging fibers from a significant portion of kinetochore pairs, especially in the inner part of the spindle, resulted in the specific reduction of the interkinetochore distance. Taken together, we propose a model where augmin promotes mitotic fidelity by generating assemblies consisting of bridging and kinetochore fibers that align sister kinetochores to face opposite poles, thereby preventing erroneous attachments.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Vinculin recruitment to α-catenin halts the differentiation and maturation of enterocyte progenitors to maintain homeostasis of the Drosophila intestine</a></h4>

              
                Mechanisms communicating changes in tissue stiffness and size are particularly relevant in the intestine because it is subject to constant mechanical stresses caused by peristalsis of its variable content. Using the <i>Drosophila</i> intestinal epithelium, we investigate the role of vinculin, one of the best characterised mechanoeffectors, which functions in both cadherin and integrin adhesion complexes. We discovered that vinculin regulates cell fate decisions, by preventing precocious activation and differentiation of intestinal progenitors into absorptive cells. It achieves this in concert with α-catenin at sites of cadherin adhesion, rather than as part of integrin function. Following asymmetric division of the stem cell into a stem cell and an enteroblast (EB), the two cells initially remain connected by adherens junctions, where vinculin is required, only on the EB side, to maintain the EB in a quiescent state and inhibit further divisions of the stem cell. By manipulating cell tension, we show that vinculin recruitment to adherens junction regulates EB activation and numbers. Consequently, removing vinculin results in an enlarged gut with improved resistance to starvation. Thus, mechanical regulation at the contact between stem cells and their progeny is used to control tissue cell number.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A tug of war between filament treadmilling and myosin induced contractility generates actin ring</a></h4>

              
                In most eukaryotic cells, actin filaments assemble into a shell-like actin cortex under the plasma membrane, controlling cellular morphology, mechanics, and signaling. The actin cortex is highly polymorphic, adopting diverse forms such as the ring-like structures found in podosomes, axonal rings, and immune synapses. The biophysical principles that underlie the formation of actin rings and cortices remain unknown. Using a molecular simulation platform, called MEDYAN, we discovered that varying the filament treadmilling rate and myosin concentration induces a finite size phase transition in actomyosin network structures. We found that actomyosin networks condense into clusters at low treadmilling rates or high myosin concentration but form ring-like or cortex-like structures at high treadmilling rates and low myosin concentration. This mechanism is supported by our corroborating experiments on live T cells, which exhibit ring-like actin networks upon activation by stimulatory antibody. Upon disruption of filament treadmilling or enhancement of myosin activity, the pre-existing actin rings are disrupted into actin clusters or collapse towards the network center respectively. Our analyses suggest that the ring-like actin structure is a preferred state of low mechanical energy, which is, importantly, only reachable at sufficiently high treadmilling rates.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">An inhibitory circuit from central amygdala to zona incerta drives pain-related behaviors in mice</a></h4>

              
                Central amygdala neurons expressing protein kinase C-delta (CeA-PKCδ) are sensitized following nerve injury and promote pain-related responses in mice. The neural circuits underlying modulation of pain-related behaviors by CeA-PKCδ neurons, however, remain unknown. In this study, we identified a neural circuit that originates in CeA-PKCδ neurons and terminates in the ventral region of the zona incerta (ZI), a subthalamic structure previously linked to pain processing. Behavioral experiments show that chemogenetic inhibition of GABAergic ZI neurons induced bilateral hypersensitivity in uninjured mice and contralateral hypersensitivity after nerve injury. In contrast, chemogenetic activation of GABAergic ZI neurons reversed nerve injury-induced hypersensitivity. Optogenetic manipulations of CeA-PKCδ axonal terminals in the ZI further showed that inhibition of this pathway reduces nerve injury-induced hypersensitivity whereas activation of the pathway produces hypersensitivity in the uninjured paws. Altogether, our results identify a novel nociceptive inhibitory efferent pathway from CeA-PKCδ neurons to the ZI that bidirectionally modulates pain-related behaviors in mice.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">KAT2-mediated acetylation switches the mode of PALB2 chromatin association to safeguard genome integrity</a></h4>

              
                The tumour suppressor PALB2 stimulates RAD51-mediated homologous recombination (HR) repair of DNA damage, whilst its steady-state association with active genes protects these loci from replication stress. Here, we report that the lysine acetyltransferases 2A and 2B (KAT2A/2B, also called GCN5/PCAF), two well-known transcriptional regulators, acetylate a cluster of seven lysine residues (7K-patch) within the PALB2 chromatin association motif (ChAM) and, in this way, regulate context-dependent PALB2 binding to chromatin. In unperturbed cells, the 7K-patch is targeted for KAT2A/2B-mediated acetylation, which in turn enhances the direct association of PALB2 with nucleosomes. Importantly, DNA damage triggers a rapid deacetylation of ChAM and increases the overall mobility of PALB2. Distinct missense mutations of the 7K-patch render the mode of PALB2 chromatin binding, making it either unstably chromatin-bound (7Q) or randomly bound with a reduced capacity for mobilisation (7R). Significantly, both of these mutations confer a deficiency in RAD51 foci formation and increase DNA damage in S phase, leading to the reduction of overall cell survival. Thus, our study reveals that acetylation of the ChAM 7K-patch acts as a molecular switch to enable dynamic PALB2 shuttling for HR repair while protecting active genes during DNA replication.

                Semantic cognition is central to communication and our understanding of the world. It is usually well preserved in healthy aging. However, semantic control processes, which guide semantic access and retrieval, decline with age. The present study explored the potential of intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) to enhance semantic cognition in healthy middle-aged to older adults. Using an individualized stimulation approach, we applied iTBS to the pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA) and assessed task-specific effects on semantic judgments in functional neuroimaging. We found increased activation after effective relative to sham stimulation only for the semantic task in visual and dorsal attention networks. Further, iTBS increased functional connectivity in domain-general executive networks. Notably, stimulation-induced changes in activation and connectivity related differently to behavior: While increased activation of the parietal dorsal attention network was linked to poorer semantic performance, its enhanced coupling with the pre-SMA was associated with more efficient semantic processing. Our findings indicate differential effects of iTBS on activity and connectivity. We show that iTBS modulates networks in a task-dependent manner and generates remote network effects. Stimulating the pre-SMA was linked to more efficient but not better performance, indicating a role in domain-general semantic control processes distinct to domain-specific semantic control.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Parsing brain-behavior heterogeneity in very preterm born children using integrated similarity networks</a></h4>

              
                Very preterm birth (VPT; [&le;] 32 weeks gestation) is associated with altered brain development and cognitive and behavioral difficulties across the lifespan. However, heterogeneity in outcomes among individuals born VPT makes it challenging to identify those most vulnerable to neurodevelopmental sequelae. Here, we aimed to stratify VPT children into distinct behavioral subgroups and explore between-subgroup differences in neonatal brain structure and function. 198 VPT children (98 females) previously enrolled in the Evaluation of Preterm Imaging study (EudraCT 2009-011602-42) underwent Magnetic Resonance Imaging at term-equivalent age and neuropsychological assessments at 4-7 years. Using an integrative clustering approach, we combined neonatal socio-demographic, clinical factors and childhood socio-emotional and executive function outcomes, to identify distinct subgroups of children based on their similarity profiles in a multidimensional space. We characterized resultant subgroups using domain-specific outcomes (temperament, psychopathology, IQ and cognitively stimulating home environment) and explored between-subgroup differences in neonatal brain volumes (voxel-wise Tensor-Based-Morphometry), functional connectivity (voxel-wise degree centrality) and structural connectivity (Tract-Based-Spatial-Statistics). Results showed two- and three-cluster data-driven solutions. The two-cluster solution comprised a "resilient" subgroup (lower psychopathology and higher IQ, executive function and socio-emotional outcomes) and an "at-risk" subgroup (poorer behavioral and cognitive outcomes). The three-cluster solution showed an additional third "intermediate" subgroup displaying behavioral and cognitive outcomes intermediate between the resilient and at-risk subgroups. The resilient subgroup had the most cognitively stimulating home environment and the at-risk subgroup showed the highest neonatal clinical risk, while the intermediate subgroup showed the lowest clinical but the highest socio-demographic risk. Compared to the intermediate subgroup, the resilient subgroup displayed larger neonatal insular and orbitofrontal volumes and stronger orbitofrontal functional connectivity, while the at-risk group showed widespread white matter microstructural alterations. These findings suggest that risk stratification following VPT birth is feasible and could be used translationally to guide personalized interventions aimed at promoting children's resilience.

                Outcome binding has long been understood as an illusion of timing perception, in which an action-effect is perceived as occurring earlier than it actually does. This illusion has been heavily investigated over the past two decades with regards to the mechanisms behind and potential applications. Here we present evidence in favour of understanding outcome binding as a spatial attentional effect, at least in part. In a series of 3 experiments, it was shown that an action-effect was preceded by a predictive attention shift in the classic Libet clock paradigm. The magnitude of attention shift predicted the size of outcome binding. When the attention shift was controlled for, binding also disappeared. Our study also calls for a reassessment of results obtained from the clock-like method in mental chronometry dating back to Wundt, as attention may well be a critical confounding factor in the interpretation of the results from these studies.

                The formation of long-term memories requires changes in the transcriptional program and de novo protein synthesis. One of the critical regulators for long-term memory (LTM) formation and maintenance is the transcription factor CREB. Genetic studies have dissected the requirement of CREB activity within memory circuits, however less is known about the genetic mechanisms acting downstream of CREB and how they may contribute defining LTM phases. To better understand the downstream mechanisms, we here used a targeted DamID approach (TaDa). We generated a CREB-Dam fusion protein using the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster as model. Expressing CREB-Dam in the mushroom bodies (MBs), a brain center implicated in olfactory memory formation, we identified genes that are differentially expressed between paired and unpaired appetitive training paradigm. Of those genes we selected candidates for an RNAi screen in which we identified genes causing increased or decreased LTM.

                Appropriate modulation of escape behaviors in response to potentially damaging stimuli is essential for survival. Although nociceptive circuitry has been studied, it is poorly understood how genetic contexts affect the relevant escape responses. Using an unbiased genome-wide association analysis, we identified a Ly6/-neurotoxin family protein, Belly roll (Bero), which negatively regulates Drosophila nociceptive escape behavior. We show that Bero is expressed in abdominal leucokinin-producing neurons (ABLK neurons) and bero knockdown in ABLK neurons resulted in enhanced escape behavior. Furthermore, we demonstrated that ABLK neurons responded to the activation of nociceptors and initiated the behavior. Notably, bero knockdown reduced the persistent neuronal activity and increased the evoked nociceptive responses in ABLK neurons. Our findings reveal that Bero modulates an escape response by regulating distinct neuronal activities in ABLK neurons.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Converging pathways direct synapse elimination through the homeodomain transcriptional regulator DVE-1</a></h4>

              
                An important step in brain development is the remodeling of juvenile neural circuits to establish mature connectivity. The elimination of juvenile synapses is a critical step in this process; however, the molecular mechanisms directing synapse elimination processes and their timing are not fully understood. We identify here a conserved transcriptional regulator, DVE-1, that directs the elimination of juvenile synaptic inputs onto remodeling C. elegans GABAergic neurons. Dorsally localized juvenile acetylcholine receptor clusters and apposing presynaptic sites are eliminated during maturation of wild type GABAergic neurons but persist into adulthood in dve-1 mutants. The persistence of juvenile synapses in dve-1 mutants does not impede synaptic growth during GABAergic remodeling and therefore results in heightened motor connectivity, producing a turning bias during movement. DVE-1 is localized to GABAergic nuclei prior to remodeling and DVE-1 nuclear localization is required for synapse elimination to proceed. Synaptic remodeling is antagonized by the expression of the Ig domain protein OIG-1. Premature synapse elimination in oig-1 mutants is reversed by dve-1 mutation, while precocious synaptic growth is unaffected, indicating a functional separation of synapse destruction and growth during remodeling. Together, our findings demonstrate a novel strategy for sculpting mature connectivity through the coordination of parallel DVE-1-regulated pro-degenerative processes and temporally regulated maintenance mechanisms.

                Spatial memory requires an intact hippocampus. Hippocampal function during epochs of locomotion and quiet rest (e.g., grooming and reward consumption) have been the target of extensive study. However, during navigation rats frequently rear up on to their hind legs and the importance of hippocampal activity during these periods of attentive sampling for spatial memory is unknown. To address this, we tested the necessity of dorsal hippocampal activity during rearing epochs in the study phase of a delayed win-shift task for memory performance in the subsequent test phase. Hippocampal activity was manipulated with closed-loop, bilateral, optogenetic inactivation. Spatial memory accuracy was significantly and selectively reduced when the dorsal hippocampus was inactivated during rearing epochs at encoding. These data show that hippocampal activity during periods of rearing can be important for spatial memory, revealing a novel link between hippocampal function during epochs of rearing and spatial memory.

                Conductance-based models have played an important role in the development of modern neuroscience. These mathematical models are powerful 'tools' that enable theoretical explorations in experimentally untenable situations, and can lead to the development of novel hypotheses and predictions. With advances in cell imaging and computational power, multi-compartment models with morphological accuracy are becoming common practice. However, as more biological details are added, they make extensive explorations and analyses more challenging largely due to their huge computational expense. Here, we focus on oriens-lacunosum/moleculare (OLM) cell models. OLM cells can contribute to functionally relevant theta rhythms in the hippocampus by virtue of their ability to express spiking resonance at theta frequencies, but what characteristics underlie this is far from clear. We converted a previously developed detailed multi-compartment OLM cell model into a reduced single compartment model that retained biophysical fidelity with its underlying ion currents. We showed that the reduced OLM cell model can capture complex output that includes spiking resonance in in vivo-like scenarios as previously obtained with the multi-compartment model. Using the reduced model, we were able to greatly expand our in vivo-like scenarios. Applying spike-triggered average analyses, we were thus able to to determine that it is a combination of hyperpolarization-activated cation and muscarinic type potassium currents that specifically allow OLM cells to exhibit spiking resonance at theta frequencies. Further, we developed a robust Kalman Filtering (KF) method to estimate parameters of the reduced model in real-time. We showed that it may be possible to directly estimate conductance parameters from experiments since this KF method can reliably extract parameter values from model voltage recordings. Overall, our work showcases how the contribution of cellular biophysical current details could be determined and assessed for spiking resonance. As well, our work shows that it may be possible to directly extract these parameters from current clamp voltage recordings.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Inherent envelope fluctuations in forward masking: Effects of age and hearing loss</a></h4>

              
                Forward masking is generally greater for Gaussian noise (GN) than for low-fluctuation noise (LFN) maskers for listeners with and without sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). Because older age and SNHL may affect recovery from masker envelope fluctuations differently, the current study explored which of these two factors contributed more substantially to the persistence of GN disruption. GN disruption was measured using three masker-signal delays (25, 75, and 150 ms) for three adult participant groups: younger listeners with normal hearing (YNH), older participants with normal, or near-normal, hearing (ONH), and older participants with sensorineural hearing loss (OSNHL). The role of underlying mechanisms was tested using a computational model for midbrain neurons. The primary result suggests that older listeners with normal or near normal hearing may be more susceptible to the deleterious effects of masker-envelope fluctuations than younger listeners with normal hearing. Results from the computational model propose that there may be a larger influence of efferent feedback and saturation of inner hair cells on GN disruption than previously expected.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The line bisection bias stems from left-side underawareness, not from right-side hyperattention</a></h4>

              
                It is still a matter of scientific debate whether the line bisection bias frequently observed in patients with spatial neglect is due to attentional underawareness of the left end of the line, attentional hyperattention towards the right end, or a logarithmically compressed perception of the line. To address this question, neglect patients who showed a line bisection bias were administered additional tasks involving horizontal lines (e.g., number line estimation tasks). Their performance was compared to neglect patients not showing a line bisection bias, patients with right hemisphere damage without neglect, and healthy controls. Results indicated that patients with a line bisection bias tended to overestimate lefthand segments when they had to dissect lines into three or four equal parts. This is congruent with both the notions of an underawareness of lefthand segments as well as a logarithmic compression of the line. However, when these patients had to imagine the lines as bounded fraction number lines ranging from 0-1, the results were mixed. When the number lines ranged from 0-10, these patients showed rightward overestimation biases for the numbers 4 and 5. Additionally, all patient groups, but not healthy controls, tended to place number 1 too far to the left and number 9 too far to the right, suggesting a general bias towards endpoints. In sum, this seems more congruent with attentional accounts than a perceptual one. Spatial-numerical associations could be ruled out, as all participants showed a verbal number bisection bias towards smaller numbers (i.e., the "left" of the mental number line). Therefore, these findings seem to indicate that the line bisection bias is most likely due to underawareness of the left end rather than hyperattention towards the right or a logarithmic perception of the line.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A novel method for measuring the priming effect of rewarding brain stimulation</a></h4>

              
                Receipt of an intense reward boosts motivation to work for more of that reward. This phenomenon is called the priming effect of rewards. Previous research on the priming effect of electrical brain stimulation utilized a runway paradigm in which running speed serves as the measure of motivation. One goal of the present study was to develop a method for measuring the priming effect of electrical brain stimulation in conventional operant-conditioning chambers. The speed with which a two-lever response chain was executed serves as the measure of motivation. Using this new paradigm, we document how the priming effect depends on both the strength and cost of the reward. In a second experiment, we assessed a modification of the new method that entails self-administered priming stimulation and alternating blocks of primed and unprimed trials. Reliable, consistent priming effects of substantial magnitude were obtained in the modified paradigm, which is closely analogous to the runway paradigm. The modified paradigm can be readily implemented in the standard operant-conditioning chambers available in most behavioral neuroscience laboratories.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Intrathecal administration of bone marrow stromal cells and TGF-β1 alleviate chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain in male mice</a></h4>

              
                Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is the de facto clinical side effect that limits the administration of anti-cancer treatments. Recently, we reported that intrathecally injected bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) reduced nerve trauma-induced neuropathic pain in male mice via TGF-{beta}1 signaling. In this study, we examined sex-dependent pain relief mediated by intrathecally delivered BMSCs and TGF-{beta}1 in paclitaxel (PTX)-induced CIPN. BMSCs were prepared from primary cultures of male or female mice separately. A single intrathecal injection of BMSCs, prepared from male donors, completely prevented the development of PTX-evoked mechanical allodynia in male mice. However, female mice showed no analgesic response to either male or female BMSCs. Additionally, male mice did not demonstrate an analgesic response to BMSCs from female donors. Intrathecal injection of TGF-{beta}1 neutralizing antibody reversed the analgesic action of BMSCs. Interestingly, spinal administration of TGF-{beta}1 reduced mechanical allodynia in male mice but not in female mice. Ex vivo patch-clamp recordings in spinal cord slices revealed that TGF-{beta}1 inhibited PTX-induced synaptic plasticity, i.e. increase in spontaneous excitatory synaptic currents (sEPsCs), in spinal cord neurons from male mice only. Intrathecal TGF-{beta}1 increased the paw withdrawal threshold in von Frey testing in naive mice of males but not females, and the antinociceptive effect of TGF-{beta}1 in males was blocked by orchiectomy-induced androgen deficiency. Together, these findings reveal sex dimorphism in BMSC control of mechanical pain through spinal TGF-{beta}1 signaling.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Hippocampal gamma oscillations form complex ensembles modulated by behavior and learning</a></h4>

              
                The hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex display a rich oscillatory activity, believed to support neural information processing in key cognitive functions. In the hippocampal region CA1, a slow gamma rhythm (30-80 Hz) generated in CA3 would support memory retrieval whereas a medium gamma rhythm (60-120 Hz) generated in the entorhinal cortex would support memory encoding. However, descriptions involving discrete gamma sub-bands can only partially account for the haphazard diversity of oscillatory behaviors observed in individual recordings during spatial navigation behavior. Here, we stress that transient gamma oscillatory episodes at any frequency or phase relative to the ongoing theta (4-12 Hz) rhythm can be recorded at any layer within CA1. Eventually, the commonly reported averages are dominated by a minority of very strong power events overshadowing gamma heterogeneity. Nevertheless, we show that such gamma diversity can be naturally explained by a simple mechanistic model, and that behavior-related information (position within a maze) can be decoded from most individual gamma events, despite their low power and erratic-like nature. Our results indicate that behavior specifically shapes ensembles of irregular hippocampal gamma oscillations, in a way which evolves with learning, depends on the hippocampal layer and is hard to reconcile with the hypothesis of rigid, narrowly tuned gamma sub-bands. Beyond randomness, the pervasive gamma diversity may thus reflect complexity at the "fringe-of-synchrony" likely functional but invisible to classic average-based analyses.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Naturally occurring Alzheimer's disease in rhesus monkeys</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease. To date, its cause is unclear and there are no effective treatments or preventive measures. Despite there are accumulating evidences for the existence of AD pathological hallmarks in the brain of aging rhesus monkeys, it remains a mainstream notion that monkeys do not develop AD naturally. This is an important issue because it will determine how we use monkeys in AD studies. To settle down this issue, a group (n=10) of aged rhesus monkeys 26 years old or above went through a systematic AD screening procedure in this study. Three of these monkeys showed severe memory impairments (SMI) after evaluated with a classic working memory test. Further behavioral testing revealed that the SMI monkeys also exhibited apathy-like behavior, which is another core AD clinical symptom. In addition to the cognitive deficits, two of the three SMI monkeys developed all of the three AD pathological hallmarks, including neurofibrillary tangles, senile plaques and neuronal loss. According to the diagnostic criteria of human AD, the two SMI monkeys were clearly naturally occurring AD monkeys. These results suggest that AD is not a uniquely human disease and monkeys have great potential for the development of much needed etiological AD models, which are vital for better understanding of developmental process of AD and the base of identification of early diagnostic biomarkers and effective therapeutic targets of AD.

                Huntington disease (HD) is an adult-onset neurodegenerative disorder that is caused by a trinucleotide CAG repeat expansion in the HTT gene that codes for the protein huntingtin (HTT or Htt in mice). HTT is a multi-functional, ubiquitously expressed protein that is essential for embryonic survival, normal neurodevelopment, and adult brain function. The ability of wild-type HTT to protect neurons against various forms of death raises the possibility that loss of normal HTT function may worsen disease progression in HD. Huntingtin-lowering therapeutics are being evaluated in clinical trials for HD, but concerns have been raised that decreasing wild-type HTT levels may have adverse effects. Here we show that Htt levels modulate the occurrence of an idiopathic seizure disorder that spontaneously occurs in FVB/N mice. These abnormal FVB/N mice demonstrate various cardinal features of mouse models of epilepsy including spontaneous seizures, astrocytosis, neuronal hypertrophy, upregulation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and sudden seizure-related death. Interestingly, decreasing wild-type Htt levels increased the frequency of this disorder, while over-expression of HTT completely prevented it. Examination of the mechanism underlying huntingtin's ability to modulate the frequency of this seizure disorder indicated that over-expression of full length HTT can promote neuronal survival following seizures. Overall, our results demonstrate a protective role for huntingtin in this form of epilepsy and provide a plausible explanation for the observation of seizures in the juvenile form of HD, Lopes-Maciel-Rodan syndrome, and Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome. Adverse effects caused by altering huntingtin levels has ramifications related to Huntingtin-lowering therapies in development to treat HD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Training stochastic stabilized supralinear networks by dynamics-neutral growth</a></h4>

              
                There continues to be a trade-off between the biological realism and performance of neural networks. Contemporary deep learning techniques allow neural networks to be trained to perform challenging computations at (near) human-level, but these networks typically violate key biological constraints. More detailed models of biological neural networks can incorporate many of these constraints but typically suffer from subpar performance and trainability. Here, we narrow this gap by developing an effective method for training a canonical model of cortical neural circuits, the stabilized supralinear network (SSN), that in previous work had to be constructed manually or trained with undue constraints. SSNs are particularly challenging to train for the same reasons that make them biologically realistic: they are characterized by strongly-connected excitatory cells and expansive firing rate non-linearities that together make them prone to dynamical instabilities unless stabilized by appropriately tuned recurrent inhibition. Our method avoids such instabilities by initializing a small network and gradually increasing network size via the dynamics-neutral addition of neurons during training. We first show how SSNs can be trained to perform typical machine learning tasks by training an SSN on MNIST classification. We then demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by training an SSN on the challenging task of performing amortized Markov chain Monte Carlo-based inference under a Gaussian scale mixture generative model of natural image patches with a rich and diverse set of basis functions - something that was not possible with previous methods. These results open the way to training realistic cortical-like neural networks on challenging tasks at scale.

                Associative memory is the ability to encode and retrieve relations between different stimuli. To better understand its neural basis, we investigated whether associative memory involves precisely timed spiking of neurons in the medial temporal lobes that exhibit stimulus-specific tuning. Using single-neuron recordings from epilepsy patients performing an associative object-location memory task, we identified the object- and place-specific neurons that encoded the separate elements of each memory. When patients encoded and retrieved particular memories, the relevant object- and place-specific neurons activated synchronously during hippocampal ripples. This ripple-locked coactivity of stimulus-specific neurons emerged over time as the patients' associative learning progressed. Our results suggest a cellular account of associative memory, in which hippocampal ripples coordinate the activity of specialized cellular populations to facilitate links between stimuli.

                Mated females reallocate resources to offspring production, causing changes in nutritional requirements and challenges to energy homeostasis. Although observed in most species, the neural and endocrine mechanisms that regulate the nutritional needs of mated females are not well understood. Here, we investigate the neural circuitry that regulates sugar appetite in mated Drosophila melanogaster females. During copulation, a male-derived sex peptide is transferred to females, silencing the mating status circuit to elicit many postmating behavioral changes1-3. We find that increased sucrose consumption is a postmated female behavior and show that it is mediated by the mating status circuit. We discovered that sexually dimorphic insulin receptor (Lgr3) neurons integrate mating status and nutritional state signals to adjust sucrose consumption. Lgr3+ cells receive inhibitory input from the mating status circuit via female specific pdC2 neurons. In mated females, the inhibition of Lgr3 cells from pdC2 is attenuated, transforming the mated signal into a long-term hunger signal that promotes sugar intake. Our results thus demonstrate that the mating circuit alters nutrient sensing centers in females to promote sugar consumption, providing a mechanism to increase intake in anticipation of the energetic costs associated with reproduction.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Consolidation-dependent behavioral integration of sequences related to mPFC neural overlap and hippocampal-cortical connectivity</a></h4>

              
                Systems consolidation theories propose two mechanisms that enable the behavioral integration of related memories: coordinated reactivation between hippocampus and cortex, and the emergence of cortical traces that reflect overlap across memories. However, there is limited empirical evidence that links these mechanisms to the emergence of behavioral integration over time. In two experiments, participants implicitly encoded sequences of objects with overlapping structure. Assessment of behavioral integration showed that response times during a recognition task reflected behavioral priming between objects that never occurred together in time but belonged to overlapping sequences. This priming was consolidation-dependent and only emerged for sequences learned 24 hours prior to the test. Critically, behavioral integration was related to changes in neural pattern similarity in the medial prefrontal cortex and increases in post-learning rest connectivity between the posterior hippocampus and lateral occipital cortex. These findings suggest that memories with a shared predictive structure become behaviorally and neurally integrated through a consolidation-related restructuring of the learned sequences, providing insight into the relationship between different consolidation mechanisms that support behavioral integration.

                Neuropathic pain is a common health problem, resulting in exacerbated response to noxious and non noxious stimuli, as well as impaired emotional and cognitive responses. Unfortunately, neuropathic pain is also one of the most difficult pain syndromes to manage, highlighting the importance of better understanding of the brain regions and neuromodulatory mechanisms involved in its regulation. Among the many interconnected brain areas which process pain, the amygdala is known to play an important role in the integration of sensory and emotional pain signals. Here, we questioned the ability of a recently identified neuromodulatory mechanisms associated to the metabotropic glutamate receptors mGlu4 in the amygdala to modulate neuropathic pain. In a murine model of peripheral mononeuropathy induced by a chronic constriction of the sciatic nerve, we demonstrate that pharmacological activation of amygdala mGlu4 receptors efficiently alleviates sensory and depressive-like symptoms in both male and female mice. Moreover, we reveal a differential modulation of those symptoms, activating mGlu4 receptors in the controlateral amygdala, relatively to the side of the mononeuropathy, is necessary and sufficient to relieve both sensory and depressive-like symptoms while ipsilateral activation solely reduces depressive-like symptoms. Furthermore, using photopharmacology, a recent strategy allowing a precise spatiotemporal photocontrol of deep brain endogenous targets, we further demonstrate the rapid and reversible action of mGlu4-mediated neuromodulation on neuropathic pain symptoms. Finally, coupling photopharmacology and analgesic conditioned place preference, we show an important pain-reducing effect of mGlu4 activation. Taken together, these data highlight the analgesic potential of enhancing amygdala mGlu4 activity to counteract neuropathy in the hope of improving existing treatments.

                Parkinson's disease (PD), characterized by degeneration of dopaminergic neurons, share pathogenic features with obesity, including mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress. Paraoxonase 2 (PON2) is an inner mitochondrial membrane protein that is highly expressed in dopaminergic neurons and is involved in the regulation of mitochondrial oxidative stress. However, no drug targeting PON2 has ever been developed for the treatment of PD. Here, we show that vutiglabridin, a clinical phase 2-stage drug for the treatment of obesity, has therapeutic effects in PD models, targeting mitochondrial PON2. Vutiglabridin penetrates into the brain, binds to PON2, and restores 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+)-induced mitochondrial dysfunction in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. Knockdown of PON2 by lentiviral shRNA infection abolished the effects of vutiglabridin on mitochondria. In mice, vutiglabridin significantly alleviated motor impairments and damage to dopaminergic neurons in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD model, and these effects were also abolished in PON2-knockdown mice, suggesting that vutiglabridin is neuroprotective via PON2. Extensive in vitro and in vivo assessment of potential neurotoxicity showed vutiglabridin to be safe. Overall, these findings provide support for the clinical development of vutiglabridin as a novel PON2 modulator for the treatment of PD.

                Cell-specific pharmaceutical technologies promise mechanistic insight into clinical drugs[-]those that treat, and often define, human disease. In particular, DART (drug acutely restricted by tethering) achieves genetically programmable control of drug concentration over cellular dimensions. The method is compatible with clinical pharmaceuticals and amenable to studies in behaving animals. Here, we describe DART.2, comprising three advances. First, we improve the efficiency of chemical capture, enabling cell-specific accumulation of drug to ~3,000-times the ambient concentration in 15 min. Second, we develop tracer reagents, providing a behavior- independent measure of cellular target engagement in each animal. Third, we extend the method to positive allosteric modulators and outline design principles for this clinically significant class. We showcase the platform with four pharmaceuticals[-]two that weaken excitatory (AMPAR) or inhibitory (GABAAR) chemical neurotransmission, and two that strengthen these forms of synaptic communication. Across four labs, we tested reagents in the mouse cerebellum, basal ganglia, visual cortex, and retina. Collectively, we demonstrate robust, bidirectional editing of chemical neurotransmission. We provide for distribution of validated reagents, community design principles, and synthetic building blocks for application to diverse pharmaceuticals.

                Receipt of an intense reward boosts motivation to work for more of that reward. This phenomenon is called the priming effect of rewards. A previous study demonstrated that the priming effect of rewarding medial forebrain bundle stimulation was remarkably resilient following administration of medium-high doses of pimozide. Here, we used the operant-chamber paradigm described in the preceding paper to assess the dependence of the priming effect on D2-like dopamine receptors. We found that the priming effect also proved resilient to the effect of eticlopride, a selective D2-like receptor antagonist. The results are discussed within the framework of a new model of brain reward circuitry in which non-dopaminergic medial forebrain bundle fibers and dopamine axons provide parallel inputs to the final common paths for reward and incentive motivation.

                Microglia, the innate immune cells of the brain, are essential determinants of late-onset Alzheimer Disease (LOAD) neuropathology. Here, we developed an integrative computational systems biology approach to construct causal network models of genetic regulatory programs for microglia in Alzheimer Disease (AD). This model enabled us to identify novel key driver (KDs) genes for microglial functions that can be targeted for AD pharmacotherapy. We prioritized FCER1G, HCK, LAPTM5, ITGB2, SLC1A2, PAPLN, GSAP, NTRK2, and CIRBP as KDs of microglial phagocytosis promoting neuroprotection and/or neural repair. In vitro, shRNA knockdown of each KD significantly reduced microglial phagocytosis. We repurposed riluzole, an FDA-approved ALS drug that upregulates SLC1A2 activity, and discovered that it stimulated phagocytosis of A{beta}1-42 in human primary microglia and decreased hippocampal amyloid plaque burden/phosphorylated tau levels in the brain of aged 3xTg-AD mice. Taken together, these data emphasize the utlility of our integrative approach for repurposing drugs for AD therapy.

                Background: Using task-dependent neuroimaging techniques, recent studies discovered a fraction of patients with disorders of consciousness (DOC) who had no command-following behaviors but showed a clear sign of awareness, which was defined as cognitive motor dissociation (CMD). Although many efforts were made to identify the CMD, existing task-dependent approaches might fail when patients had multiple cognitive function (e.g., attention, memory) impairments, and thus lead to false-negative findings. However, recent advances in resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) analysis allow investigation of the dynamic change of spontaneous brain activity, which might be a powerful tool to test the patient's cognitive functions, while its capacity in identifying CMD was unclear. Methods: The rs-fMRI study included 119 participants from three independent research sites. A sliding-window approach was used to investigate the dynamic functional connectivity of the brain in two aspects: the global and regional temporal stability, which measures how stable the brain functional architecture is across time. The temporal stability was compared in the first dataset (36/16 DOC/controls), and then a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier was built to discriminate DOC patients from controls. Furthermore, the generalizability of the SVM classifier was tested in the second independent dataset (35/21 DOC/controls). Finally, the SVM classifier was applied to the third independent dataset where patients underwent an rs-fMRI and brain-computer interface assessment (4/7 CMD/potential non-CMD), to test its performance in identifying CMD. Results: Our results showed that the global and regional temporal stability were impaired in DOC patients, especially in regions from the cingulo-opercular task control, default mode, fronto-parietal task control, and salience network. Using the temporal stability as features, the SVM model not only showed a good performance in the first dataset (accuracy = 90 %), but a good generalizability in the second dataset (accuracy = 82 %). Most importantly, the SVM model generalized well in identifying CMD in the third dataset (accuracy = 91 %). Conclusion: The current findings suggested that rs-fMRI could be a potential tool to assist in diagnosing CMD. Furthermore, the temporal stability investigated in this study also contributed to a deeper understanding of the neural mechanism of the consciousness.

                Although sleeve gastrectomy (SG) is the most commonly performed bariatric surgery in the US, its mechanistic underpinnings have not been fully determined. Thus, we set out to investigate whether changes in the peripheral sympathetic system could mediate the metabolic effects of SG. The celiac-superior mesenteric ganglia (CSMG) lie juxtaposed to the stomach and supply the sympathetic innervation of the stomach, as well as to numerous other intra-abdominal organs. Here we investigated the effects of SG on the CSMG. SG led to the degeneration of neurons in the CSMG, as evidenced by chromatolysis, which was not found in control mice. Furthermore, CSMG ablation (CGX) completely recapitulated the glycemic and weight loss effects of SG, promoting weight loss at the expense of fat mass. Norepinephrine tissue content measurement by high performance liquid chromatography revealed that liver, duodenum, and ileum were organs where both SG and CGX displayed evidence of significant sympathetic denervation. Both SG and CGX were associated with increased levels of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and high free fatty acid content in the stools. In conclusion, CSMG neuronal degeneration caused by SG may be a partial mediator of the metabolic effects of this type of bariatric surgery.

                The rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) is a crucial experimental animal that shares many genetic, brain organizational, and behavioral characteristics with humans. A macaque brain atlas that identifies anatomically and functionally distinct regions is fundamental to biomedical and evolutionary research. However, even though connectivity information is vital for understanding brain functions, a connectivity-based whole-brain atlas of the macaque has not previously been made. In this study, we created a new whole-brain map, the Macaque Brainnetome Atlas, based on the anatomical connectivity profile provided by high-resolution angular and spatial diffusion MRI data. The new atlas consists of 248 cortical and 56 subcortical regions as well as their structural and resting-state functional connections. We systematically evaluated the parcellations and connections using multi-site and multi-modal datasets to ensure reproducibility and reliability. The resulting resource, which is downloadable from http://atlas.brainnetome.org, includes (1) the thoroughly delineated Macaque Brainnetome Atlas (MacBNA), (2) the multi-modal connections, (3) the largest postmortem high resolution macaque dMRI dataset, and (4) ex vivo MRI, block-face, and Nissl-stained images obtained from a different macaque. We provide an exemplar use of the resource with a joint multi-modal and multi-scale utilization of MRI and Nissl data with our atlas as a reference system. The goals of the resource are not only to provide a backbone of the mesoscopic connectivity and a multi-omics (such as transcriptomes and proteomes) atlas but also to facilitate translational medicine, cross-species comparisons, and computational modelling, enriching the collaborative resource platform of nonhuman primate data.

                Beta oscillations are involved in a variety of cognitive functions beyond their traditional sensorimotor role. Based on prior findings of content-specific beta synchronization during working memory and decision making, we hypothesized that beta activity supports the activation and reactivation of cortical representations by mediating neural ensemble formation within and between brain regions. We here found that beta activity in monkey dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and in pre-supplementary motor area (preSMA) reflects the content of a stimulus in relation to the task context, regardless of its objective properties. In multiple versions of a categorization task, we changed the boundary between categories from one block of trials to the next, such that a stimulus which belonged to one of two categories during one block could belong to the other category during the next one. During a delay in which monkeys had to hold their categorical decision in mind, we found that two distinct beta-band frequencies were consistently associated with the same two relative categories, and that activity in these respective bands predicted the animals' responses. We characterized beta at these frequencies as transient bursts with distinct temporal profiles. We further showed that dlPFC and preSMA are connected via these distinct frequency channels, with dlPFC driving the frequency separation, a result supported by Granger causality and spike-field coherence analyses. In sum, these results provide support for the role of beta in forming neural ensembles, and further show that such ensembles synchronize at different beta frequencies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Actigraphic Correlates of Neuropsychiatric Disability in Adult Patients with Focal Epilepsy</a></h4>

              
                Disability in patients with epilepsy (PWE) is multifactorial: beyond seizure frequency/severity, PWE are prone to a range of neuropsychiatric, cognitive, and somatic comorbidities that significantly impact quality of life. In this study, we explored how variations in epilepsy severity and the burden of self-reported somatic/neuropsychiatric symptoms are associated with disruptions to 24h activity patterns (rest-activity rhythms, RARs), determined through wrist accelerometry/actigraphy. Continuous multiday recordings were obtained from 59 adult patients with focal epilepsy (44% male, ages 18-72), who contemporaneously provided responses to a range of validated psychometric instruments to measure the burden of anxiety, depression, sleepiness, and somatic symptoms. As a comparator, we conducted a similar psychometric-actigraphic correlation in 1761 subjects of Hispanic origin (35% male, ages 18-65) from the Study of Latinos (SOL) Sueno Ancillary Study. RARs were analyzed via a sigmoidally-transformed cosine model (quantifying RAR amplitude, steepness, acrophase and robustness) and non-parametric measures to estimate RAR stability, fragmentation, and sleep. Compared with age- and sex-matched SOL subjects, RARs from PWE subjects featured a significantly diminished amplitude, a wider rest phase and significantly more total daily sleep. Within PWE, similar RAR distortions were associated with seizure intractability and/or anticonvulsant polytherapy. In contrast, high anxiety, depression, and somatic symptom scores were associated with diminished RAR robustness and a delayed acrophase. We applied the complete SOL Sueno database to train logistic regression models to dichotomously classify anxiety, depression and sleepiness symptoms using age, sex, body mass index and a range of non-collinear RAR parameters. When tested on PWE, these models predicted prevalent anxiety and depression symptoms with modest success (accuracy ~70%) but failed to predict subjective sleepiness. Together, these results demonstrate that RAR features may vary with depression and anxiety symptoms in ambulatory patients with focal epilepsy, potentially offering a set of objective wearable-derived endpoints to adjunct routine clinical care and drug/device treatment trials. With larger actigraphic-psychometric datasets in PWE, we may identify RAR signatures that can more precisely distinguish between variations in seizure risk, the burden of anticonvulsant therapy and prevalent mood/anxiety symptoms.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural Representation of The Self</a></h4>

              
                Knowledge about one's personality, the self-concept, shapes human experience. Social cognitive neuroscience has made strides addressing the question of where and how the self is represented in the brain. The answer, however, remains elusive. We conducted two functional magnetic resonance imaging experiments (with the second being preregistered) employing a self-reference task with a broad range of attributes and carrying out a searchlight representational similarity analysis. The importance of attributes to self-identity was represented in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), whereas mPFC activation was unrelated both to self-descriptiveness of attributes (Experiments 1-2) and importance of attributes to a friend's self-identity (Experiment 2). Our research provides a comprehensive answer to the abovementioned question: The self-concept is conceptualized in terms of self-importance and represented in the mPFC.

	<p>The menstrual cycle affects women&amp;amp;rsquo;s emotional states, with estrogen and progesterone having predominant roles. However, it remains unclear whether the phases of the menstrual cycle also affect women&amp;amp;rsquo;s motivational behaviors. In this study, the main aim was to investigate how the menstrual cycle influences approach&amp;amp;ndash;avoidance behavior under conditions of conscious versus unconscious processing of emotions. Briefly, after recruitment by advertisement and screening with a menstrual cycle survey questionnaire, 27 naturally cycling, healthy women participated in an improved &amp;amp;ldquo;manikin task&amp;amp;rdquo; and were presented both positive and negative emotional stimuli during early follicular, late follicular, and mid-luteal phases. Estrogen and progesterone levels were measured. Women in the late follicular phase exhibited the shortest response times for approaching positive stimuli, while women in the mid-luteal phase exhibited the shortest response times for avoiding negative stimuli. Estrogen and progesterone levels significantly correlated with the speed of the approach&amp;amp;ndash;avoidance responses observed for the women, indicating the important role that sex hormones have in mediating emotionally motivated behavior. Overall, these findings suggest that the menstrual cycle has strong and specific influences on women&amp;amp;rsquo;s approach&amp;amp;ndash;avoidance behaviors that are in part mediated by estrogen and progesterone. By identifying characteristics of these behaviors in the late follicular and mid-luteal phases, greater insight can be provided to women regarding the physiological influences of the menstrual cycle on their personal growth and security.</p>

	<p>The principal reason for measuring mental workload is to quantify the cognitive cost of performing tasks to predict human performance. Unfortunately, a method for assessing mental workload that has general applicability does not exist yet. This is due to the abundance of intuitions and several operational definitions from various fields that disagree about the sources or workload, its attributes, the mechanisms to aggregate these into a general model and their impact on human performance. This research built upon these issues and presents a novel method for mental workload modelling from EEG data employing deep learning. This method is self-supervised, employing a continuous brain rate, an index of cognitive activation, and does not require human declarative knowledge. The aim is to induce models automatically from data, supporting replicability, generalisability and applicability across fields and contexts. This specific method is a convolutional recurrent neural network trainable with spatially preserving spectral topographic head-maps from EEG data, aimed at fitting a novel brain rate variable. Findings demonstrate the capacity of the convolutional layers to learn meaningful high-level representations from EEG data since within-subject models had, on average, a test Mean Absolute Percentage Error of around 11%. The addition of a Long-Short Term Memory layer for handling sequences of high-level representations was not significant, although it did improve their accuracy. These findings point to the existence of quasi-stable blocks of automatically learnt high-level representations of cognitive activation because they can be induced through convolution and seem not to be dependent on each other over time, intuitively matching the non-stationary nature of brain responses. Additionally, across-subject models, induced with data from an increasing number of participants, thus trained with data containing more variability, obtained a similar accuracy to the within-subject models. This highlights the potential generalisability of the induced high-level representations across people, suggesting the existence of subject-independent cognitive activation patterns. This research contributes to the body of knowledge by providing scholars with a novel computational method for mental workload modelling that aims to be generally applicable and does not rely on ad hoc human crafted models.</p>

	<p>Purpose: Target temperature management (TTM) is often used in patients after cardiac arrest, but the effects of cooling on cerebral microcirculation, oxygenation and metabolism are poorly understood. We studied the time course of these variables in a healthy swine model.Methods: Fifteen invasively monitored, mechanically ventilated pigs were allocated to sham procedure (normothermia, NT; n = 5), cooling (hypothermia, HT, n = 5) or cooling with controlled oxygenation (HT-Oxy, n = 5). Cooling was induced by cold intravenous saline infusion, ice packs and nasal cooling to achieve a body temperature of 33&amp;amp;ndash;35 &amp;amp;deg;C. After 6 h, animals were rewarmed to baseline temperature (within 5 h). The cerebral microvascular network was evaluated (at baseline and 2, 7 and 12 h thereafter) using sidestream dark-field (SDF) video-microscopy. Cerebral blood flow (laser Doppler MNP100XP, Oxyflow, Oxford Optronix, Oxford, UK), oxygenation (PbtO2, Licox catheter, Integra Lifesciences, USA) and lactate/pyruvate ratio (LPR) using brain microdialysis (CMA, Stockholm, Sweden) were measured hourly. Results: In HT animals, cerebral functional capillary density (FCD) and proportion of small-perfused vessels (PSPV) significantly decreased over time during the cooling phase; concomitantly, PbtO2 increased and LPR decreased. After rewarming, all microcirculatory variables returned to normal values, except LPR, which increased during the rewarming phase in the two groups subjected to HT when compared to the group maintained at normothermia. Conclusions: In healthy animals, TTM can be associated with alterations in cerebral microcirculation during cooling and altered metabolism at rewarming.</p>

	<p>Delayed diagnosis and a lack of adequate care for people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are related to worse outcomes and quality of life. This study aimed to identify the profile of service use, barriers to access care, and factors related to those barriers in Brazilian families with children with ASD. A total of 927 families with children with ASD (3&amp;amp;ndash;17 years) from five Brazilian regions completed an online version of the Caregivers Needs Survey. Results showed that the most used services were behavioral interventions and pharmacotherapy, while the most used professionals were neurologists, nutritionists, speech therapists, psychiatrists, psychologists, and pediatricians. The main barriers included waiting lists, costs, and the absence of services or treatment. Service use varied according to age, the region of residence, type of health care system used, and the parents/caregivers&amp;amp;rsquo; education. Access to behavioral interventions was more frequent among users of the private system/health insurance and families whose caregivers had higher education. The absence of specialized services/treatments was less frequent among residents of state capitals and families whose caregivers had higher levels of education. This study highlights how families with children/adolescents with ASD in Brazil face significant barriers to access care related to sociodemographic factors.</p>

	<p>Action observation (AO) combined with motor imagery (MI) was verified as more effective in improving limb function than AO or MI alone, while the underlying mechanism of swallowing was ambiguous. The study aimed at exploring the efficacy of AO combined with MI in swallowing. In this study, twelve subjects performed the motor imagery of swallowing (MI-SW) during magnetoencephalography (MEG) scanning, and trials were divided into three groups: the non-induced group (control group, CG), male AO-induced group (M-AIG), and female AO-induced group (F-AIG). We used event-related spectral perturbations (ERSPs) and phase locking value (PLV) to assess the degree of activation and connectivity of the brain regions during MI-SW in the three groups. The results showed that compared to CG, F-AIG and M-AIG significantly activated more brain regions in the frontoparietal, attention, visual, and cinguloopercular systems. In addition, M-AIG significantly activated the sensorimotor cortex compared to CG and F-AIG. For the brain network, F-AIG and M-AIG increased the diffusion of non-hub hot spots and cold hubs to the bilateral hemispheres which enhanced interhemispheric functional connectivity and information transmission efficiency in the MI-SW task. This study provided supporting evidence that AO induction could enhance the effect of MI-SW and supported the application of AO-induced MI-SW in clinical rehabilitation.</p>

	<p>Background: The recent introduction of near-infrared spectroscopy has enabled the monitoring of cerebral blood flow in real-time. Previous studies have shown that blood flow velocity is a predictor of cardiovascular disease. We hypothesized that cerebral oxygenation with a change in posture is a predictor for cerebral infarction. We designed a cross-sectional study to investigate the relationship between postural-related changes in cerebral oxygenation and a history of chronic cerebral infarction. Methods: A total of 100 consecutive participants were enrolled in this study. We evaluated changes in cerebral oxygenation with a change in posture from the supine to the upright position in the bilateral forehead. The association between a decline in cerebral oxygenation and chronic cerebral infarction was analyzed with multiple logistic regression adjusted for covariates. Results: Cerebral blood oxygenation increased in 52 participants and decreased in 48 participants with a postural change. The prevalence of decreased cerebral oxygenation was 76.3% in participants with chronic cerebral infarction. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that a decline in cerebral oxygenation upon a postural change was strongly associated with chronic cerebral infarction (adjusted odds ratio: 3.42, p = 0.025). Conclusions: Cerebral blood oxygenation upon a postural change could be a useful predictor for cerebral infarction.</p>

	<p>Sound-induced flash illusion (SiFI) is typical auditory dominance phenomenon in multisensory illusion. Although a number of studies have explored the SiFI in terms of age-related effects, the reasons for the enhanced SiFI in older adults are still controversial. In the present study, older and younger adults with equal visual discrimination were selected to explore age differences in SiFI effects, and to explore the neural indicators by resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) signals. A correlation analysis was calculated to examine the relationship between regional homogeneity (ReHo) and the SiFI. The results showed that both younger and older adults experienced significant fission and fusion illusions, and fission illusions of older adults were greater than that of younger adults. In addition, our results showed ReHo values of the left middle frontal gyrus (MFG), the right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and right superior frontal gyrus (SFG) were significantly positively correlated with the SiFI in older adults. More importantly, the comparison between older and younger adults showed that ReHo values of the right superior temporal gyrus (STG) decreased in older adults, and this was independent of the SiFI. The results indicated that when there was no difference in unisensory ability, the enhancement of multisensory illusion in older adults may not always be explained by compensation mechanisms.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Trends in authorship demographics for manuscripts published in endocrine journals - A 70-year analysis [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Over the previous few decades, trends in author demographics have significantly changed. Such trends have already been studied for many sub-specialties but endocrinology is among the few branches that are yet to see an analysis of such trends. This paper aims to fill this gap.  Methods: Journal of Endocrinology and General & Comparative Endocrinology are two landmark journals that publish articles from around the world. Each decade during the 70-year period from 1961 to 2021 has been examined in this study. Funding source, first author – senior author gender, their demographics and proportion of papers with at least one female author were the parameters considered while studying each publication. It was predicted that the number of female authors per paper would increase with time, as would the range of degrees held by the authors, demographical variations in authorship, and the funding source. The aim was also to determine the distribution of female first authors and senior authors in endocrinology journals over a 70-year period, as well as to check the gender combinations using the Punnett square. Results: Female first authors rose from 7% to 29.6% (p<0.0006) between 1961 and 2021, whereas female senior authors rose from 15.6% to 22.2%. Despite women's small contributions to first and senior authors, female participation rose from 17.48% (25/143) to 70% (170/250) between 1961 and 2021. Male-Female and Female-Male combinations rose with Chi-Square = 124.6, (p<0.0001). Europe and the Americas had the most female academic medical contributors (p<0.0001) Regardless of author status, female participation rose from 17.48% in 1961 to 68% in 2021.  Conclusion: In papers published in endocrinology journals, there was a rising trend in female contributions to academic medicine. Even with the large growth of female endocrinologists, there is still a disparity in why the increase in female authors is comparably fewer.

                Background: Pinang yaki has bioactive compounds that have potential as a new herbal supplement, but their metabolites profil is lack of data. A better understanding of the bioactive compounds of pinang yaki using untargeted metabolomic profiling studies will provide clearer insight into the health benefits of pinang yaki in further.   Methods: Fresh samples of pinang yaki (Areca vestiaria) are obtained from forests in North Sulawesi Province, Indonesia. Samples were used for untargeted metabolomics analysis by UHPLC-MS.   Results: Based on an untargeted metabolomic profiling study of pinang yaki, 2504 compounds in ESI- and 2645 compounds in ESI+ were successfully obtained. After the analysis, 356 compounds in ESI- and 543 compounds in ESI+ were identified successfully. Major compounds Alpha-Chlorohydrin (PubChem ID: 7290) and Tagatose (PubChem ID: 439312) were found in ESI+ and ESI-.   Discussion: The 10 metabolites from pinang yaki extract (ESI+) also have been indicated in preventing viral infection and have exhibited good neuroprotective immunity. Benzothiazole (PubChem ID: 7222), L-isoleucine (PubChem ID: 6306), D-glucono-delta-lactone (PubChem ID: 736), Diethylpyrocarbonate (PubChem ID: 3051), Bis(2-Ethylhexyl) amine (PubChem ID: 7791), Cinnamic acid (PubChem ID: 444539), and Trigonelline (PubChem ID: 5570) also had potential effects as an antiviral and anti-inflammatory. Conclusion: Untargeted metabolomic profiling showed many bioactive compounds contained in pinang yaki (Areca vestiaria) extract. The top 10 compounds capable to ionize well have been identified and explored for their potential benefits as antiviral supplement products by literature study. This is a preliminary study which still needs further research such as in vitro, preclinical, and clinical trials.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Returning to work at school during the COVID -19 pandemic, is it stressful for schoolteachers? Assessment of immediate psychological effects: a cross sectional study [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The adoption of remote classes for students has been in vogue since the onset of the pandemic. Schools reopened in a phased manner after the second wave of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in India. Reverting to the regular face-to-face teaching for students became a challenge to the teachers and students, especially at times when there was an impending third wave on the way. The study aimed to assess the presence of symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress in teachers who attended reopened schools in the scenario of face-to-face classes. In addition, we studied the association of psychological symptoms with teachers' age groups, gender, school boards, and school institution type. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted between October to December 2021 after schools had reopened. Data was collected using Google Form questionnaires in 124 schoolteachers. The Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale - 21 Items (DASS-21) questionnaire assessed the psychological symptoms. Results: Of 124 schoolteachers, 108(87.1%) were female, 112 (90.3%) were from private institutions, and 70(56.5%) were from Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) school boards. The prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress in teachers was 30.6%, 45.2%, and 20.2%, respectively. Nearly 80% of the female teachers expressed depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms. Amongst all the age groups, symptoms were higher in 40-49 group. We found anxiety to be statistically significant when compared with gender (p-0.042). We found no statistically significant differences concerning age groups, school boards, or school institutions with any psychological symptoms. Conclusions: The prevalence of psychological symptoms was high among schoolteachers after schools reopened for regular face-to-face teaching. Gender was associated with anxiety in teachers. We agree that identifying teachers' symptoms and providing adequate psychological counseling/support would improve their mental health status and thereby the quality of teaching to students.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Mulberroside A could serve as a pan inhibitor for the tyrosine kinase domains of the HER family [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Numerous medicines were authorized for their targeting of the tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) of human epidermal receptors (HER). However, it has been demonstrated that these TKDs exhibit persistent resistance, necessitating the development of additional inhibitors with different modes of action. A single pharmacophore can be manipulated to create a pan-inhibitor where the binding site of these receptors has been highly conserved. The development of anti-cancer agents and the introduction of synergistic action to increase the efficacy of current medications have both recently benefited from the use of medicinal plants and herbal extracts as a reliable source. The binding affinity to the TKDs was predicted by molecular docking, followed by molecular dynamic simulation to examine the changes in the motion of the enzymes, with a focus on the components responsible for catalytic activity (C α-helix), activation (activation loop), and autophosphorylation (C-terminal loop). According to the ∆G value provided by Autodock Vina (-40.54, -40.12, -37.20, -37.62 kJ/mol for HER1, HER2, HER3, and HER4, respectively) and MM/PBSA, which indicates a strong affinity for the TKDs, the outcomes are undeniably positive. Root mean square deviation (RMSD), root mean square fluctuation (RMSF), radius of gyration (Rg), solvent accessible surface area (SASA), and the principal component analysis (PCA) detected significant dynamic changes in the TKDs, particularly in the C α-helix and the activation loop for all TKDs, suggesting that mulberroside A may alter the function of these enzymes. This study will expand our understanding of the dynamics of the TKDs and shed light on the anticancer potential of the polyphenolic compounds.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Green campus universities: case studies on problems and prospects [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Sustainability is a crucial social issue. In recent years, many scholars have suggested that the issue should be tackled at universities because they act as leaders in education, research and innovation. Universities are in a good position to foster progressive action towards global issues within current and future generations. As universities seek to create sustainable campuses, the green campus approach can create opportunities for a cultural paradigm shift, where universities become global leaders in sustainability. There have been various studies related to sustainability issues that include how universities can seek to create sustainable campuses. However, there are some gaps in the research on the “green campus approach” as a way to create sustainable campuses. This paper intends to examine the problems and prospects of creating a green campus university.   Methods: Data collection was conducted using the qualitative method. Structured interviews and observations were conducted via visits to the selected case-study universities as well as panels and discussions with experts in respective ministry and government agencies. All collected data were transcribed before being analysed using the NVivo software and thematic coding.  Results: Most universities in Malaysia have plans toward sustainability and the green campus approach. The awareness of going green and creating sustainability on university campuses has gradually increased. A strategic framework is needed as a guideline for creating green campuses in the higher education setting of Malaysia.  Conclusions: This study offers new insights into creating green campus universities in Malaysia as a means to create sustainability in higher education settings. The study involved three of the oldest universities in Malaysia. Future research may expand into other universities in Malaysia or internationally.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Isolation and identification of fluoride sensitive and fluoride resistant Streptococcus mutans strains from dental carries of diabetic patients using conventional methods in Sudan. [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Dental caries also known as cavities are the most predominant disease today. Streptococcus mutans can form a biofilm on the tooth surface, produce high levels of lactic acid following fermentation of dietary sugars, and are resistant to the adverse effects of low pH, properties which are essential for oral micro biota. The aim of this study was to isolate S. mutans and characterize their antimicrobial properties against sodium fluoride. Fresh dental caries samples were collected from diabetic patients. The isolates were identified based on their acidogenic, biochemical test, and antimicrobial properties. Methods The socio-demographic data collected through a structure designated questionnaire and the biological data collected through sterile cotton swabs. For analysis of data, Statistical Package for Social Sciences software, version 23.0 (IBM SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) was used. Results Only 32 of the 80 samples (40%) gave a positive growth for S. mutans on MSBA (mitis salivarius bacitracin agar). The sensitivity of the isolates against sodium fluoride was tested by preparing NaF of four different concentrations (80, 125, 250, and 500) mg\L. Fifty percent of isolates were found to be resistant to NaF at a concentration of 80 mg/L, while 28% were resistant to 125 mg/L NaF, 16%   to 250 mg/L and 3% to 500mg/L NaF. The majority of the participants were aged between 51–60 years (33%), were female (54%), had type II diabetes mellitus (64%), and the duration of their diabetes was less than five years (35%). Conclusions By using the information in this study, we were able to discover strains of S. mutans that are resistant to fluoride. This study can be used as an essential key to study the genetic mutation that occurred.

                Background: Malnutrition is the imbalance between intake and nutritional needs, resulting in a decrease in body weight, composition, and physical function. Malnutrition causes infertility due to intestinal and liver degeneration,which may progress to testicular and ovarian degeneration. Methods: An infertile female rat model with a degenerative ovary was induced with malnutrition through a 5-day food fasting but still had drinking water. The administration of (T1) 30% (v/v) and (T2) 50% (v/v) forest honey (Apis dorsata) were performed for ten consecutive days, whereas the (T+) group was fasted and not administered forest honey and the (T−) group has not fasted and not administered forest honey. Superoxide dismutase, malondialdehyde, IL-13 and TNF-α cytokine expressions, and ovarian tissue regeneration were analyzed. Results: Superoxide dismutase was significantly different (p<0.05) in T1 (65.24±7.53), T2 (74.16±12.3), and T− (65.09±6.56) compared with T+ (41.76±8.51). Malondialdehyde was significantly different (p<0.05) in T1 (9.71±1.53), T2 (9.23±0.96), and T− (9.83±1.46) compared with T+ (15.28±1.61). Anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-13) expression was significantly different (p<0.05) in T1 (5.30±2.31), T2 (9.80±2.53), and T− (0.30±0.48) compared with T+ (2.70±1.57). Pro-inflammatory cytokine (TNF-α) expression was significantly different (p<0.05) in T1 (4.40±3.02), T2 (2.50±1.65), and T− (0.30±0.48) compared with T+ (9.50±1.78). Ovarian tissue regeneration was significantly different (p<0.05) in T− (8.6±0.69) and T2 (5.10±0.99) compared with T1 (0.7±0.95) and T+ (0.3±0.67). Conclusion: The 10-day administration of 50% (v/v) forest honey can be an effective therapy for ovarian failure that caused malnutrition in the female rat model.

                Background: The volatilome of fermented food products are essential metabolites that significantly contribute to such foods’ overall composition and sensorial quality. The dataset presented herein represents the volatilome of raw and fermented maize flour samples. Methods: Maize grains were milled and naturally fermented at 35°C into sourdough at different periods (24, 48 and 72 h) and, at each point, the profile of the volatiles was investigated. Samples at the different fermentation periods were analyzed using solid phase microextraction coupled with a gas chromatography-high resolution time of flight-mass spectrometry (SPME-GC-HRTOF-MS). Results: Data obtained were classified into different compound groups such as alcohols, aldehydes, aromatic compounds, esters, organic acids, terpenes, ketones, among others and their characteristics such as the retention time, observed mass, molecular formular, mean peak areas and mass spectra also presented. Conclusion: These datasets of fermented maize volatilome can be used as biomarkers for maize fermentation.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Global and gene-specific translational regulation in Escherichia coli across different conditions</a></h4>

How well mRNA transcript levels represent protein abundances has been a controversial issue. Particularly across different environments, correlations between mRNA and protein exhibit remarkable variability from gene to gene. Translational regulation is likely to be one of the key factors contributing to mismatches between mRNA level and protein abundance in bacteria. Here, we quantified genome-wide transcriptome and relative translation efficiency (RTE) under 12 different conditions in <i>Escherichia coli</i>. By quantifying the mRNA-RTE correlation both across genes and across conditions, we uncovered a diversity of gene-specific translational regulations, cooperating with transcriptional regulations, in response to carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphate (P) limitations. Intriguingly, we found that many genes regulating translation are themselves subject to translational regulation, suggesting possible feedbacks. Furthermore, a random forest model suggests that codon usage partially predicts a gene’s cross-condition variability in translation efficiency; such cross-condition variability tends to be an inherent quality of a gene, independent of the specific nutrient limitations. These findings broaden the understanding of translational regulation under different environments and provide novel strategies for the control of translation in synthetic biology. In addition, our data offers a resource for future multi-omics studies.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Deep mendelian randomization: Investigating the causal knowledge of genomic deep learning models</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Stephen Malina, Daniel Cizin, David A. Knowles</p>

Multi-task deep learning (DL) models can accurately predict diverse genomic marks from sequence, but whether these models learn the causal relationships between genomic marks is unknown. Here, we describe Deep Mendelian Randomization (DeepMR), a method for estimating causal relationships between genomic marks learned by genomic DL models. By combining Mendelian randomization with <i>in silico</i> mutagenesis, DeepMR obtains local (locus specific) and global estimates of (an assumed) linear causal relationship between marks. In a simulation designed to test recovery of pairwise causal relations between transcription factors (TFs), DeepMR gives accurate and unbiased estimates of the ‘true’ global causal effect, but its coverage decays in the presence of sequence-dependent confounding. We then apply DeepMR to examine the global relationships learned by a state-of-the-art DL model, BPNet, between TFs involved in reprogramming. DeepMR’s causal effect estimates validate previously hypothesized relationships between TFs and suggest new relationships for future investigation.

                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>To explore gene expression profile of primary CNS vasculitis (PCNSV).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Brain specimens of 4 patients with granulomatous vasculitis (GV), 5 with lymphocytic vasculitis (LV), 4 with amyloid β-related angiitis (ABRA) and 4 normal controls were studies. RNA-sequencing was performed using Illumina® Hiseq-4,000 platform and the Illumina® TruSeq® Total-RNA library. Student's t-test and false discovery rate tests were performed for each of the differentially expressed transcripts. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis® was used for the pathway expression analysis. CIBERSORT was used to esteem the abundances of different immune cell subsets in the tissues based on gene expression data.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Transcripts differentially expressed between PCNSV and normal brain indicated that endosomal, mitochondrial and ribosome dysfunction, alterations in protein synthesis and non-coding RNAs might be involved in PCNSV. Pathway analysis revealed the activation of dendritic cell maturation and antigen processing as well as neuroinflammation in PCNSV <i>versus</i> normal brain, while oxidative phosphorylation was inhibited. CIBERSORT estimation of immune cell subsets suggested that activated NK cells, M1 macrophages, memory B cells and follicular helper T cells were likely more prevalent in PCNSV samples. Naïve CD4 T cells and monocytes were mainly estimated to be present in GV and ABRA. Plasma cell and γδ T cell signatures were mainly found in LV and normal brain. GV showed higher levels of genes associated with macrophage activities and T cells. ABRA showed higher levels of long non-coding RNAs and miR-616. LV showed higher levels of genes encoding immunoglobulins.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>RNA sequencing confirmed PCNSV heterogeneity.</p>

                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a potentially harmful, often overlooked sleep disorder affecting up to 70% of Parkinson's disease patients. Current diagnosis relies on nocturnal video-polysomnography, which is an expensive and cumbersome examination requiring specific clinical expertise. Here, we explored the use of wrist actigraphy to enable automatic RBD diagnoses in home settings.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A total of 26 Parkinson's disease patients underwent 2-week home wrist actigraphy, followed by two in-laboratory evaluations. Patients were classified as RBD versus non-RBD based on dream enactment history and video-polysomnography. We comprehensively characterized patients' movement patterns during sleep using actigraphic signals. We then trained machine learning classification algorithms to discriminate patients with or without RBD using the most relevant features. Classification performance was quantified with respect to clinical diagnosis, separately for in-laboratory and at-home recordings. Performance was further validated in a control group of non-Parkinson's disease patients with other sleep conditions.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>To characterize RBD, actigraphic features extracted from both (1) individual movement episodes and (2) global nocturnal activity were critical. RBD patients were more active overall, and showed movements that were shorter, of higher magnitude, and more scattered in time. Using these features, our classification algorithms reached an accuracy of 92.9 ± 8.16% during in-clinic tests. When validated on home recordings in Parkinson's disease patients, accuracy reached 100% over a 2-week window, and was 94.4% in non-Parkinson's disease control patients. Features showed robustness across tests and conditions.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These results open new perspectives for faster, cheaper, and more regular screening of sleep disorders, both for routine clinical practice and clinical trials. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

<p>In this study, we propose that the resilience of structural hub disruption compensated by functional connectivity in the DMN underlies the stable disability compensating by the aging of RRMS.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory and demyelinating disease which leads to impairment in several functional systems including cognition. Alteration of brain networks is linked to disability and its progression. However, results are mostly cross-sectional and yet contradictory as putative adaptive and maladaptive mechanisms were found. Here, we aimed to explore longitudinal reorganization of brain networks over 2-years by combining diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), resting-state functional MRI (fMRI), magnetoencephalography (MEG), and a comprehensive neuropsychological-battery. In 37 relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) and 39 healthy-controls, cognition remained stable over-time. We reconstructed network models based on the three modalities and analyzed connectivity in relation to the hierarchical topology and functional subnetworks. Network models were compared across modalities and in their association with cognition using linear-mixed-effect-regression models. Loss of hub connectivity and global reduction was observed on a structural level over-years (<i>p</i> &lt; .010), which was similar for functional MEG-networks but not for fMRI-networks. Structural hub connectivity increased in controls (<i>p</i> = .044), suggesting a physiological mechanism of healthy aging. Despite a general loss in structural connectivity in RRMS, hub connectivity was preserved (<i>p</i> = .002) over-time in default-mode-network (DMN). MEG-networks were similar to DTI and weakly correlated with fMRI in MS (<i>p</i> &lt; .050). Lower structural (<i>β</i> between .23–.33) and both lower (<i>β</i> between .40–.59) and higher functional connectivity (<i>β</i> = −.54) in DMN was associated with poorer performance in attention and memory in RRMS (<i>p</i> &lt; .001). MEG-networks involved no association with cognition. Here, cognitive stability despite ongoing neurodegeneration might indicate a resilience mechanism of DMN hubs mimicking a physiological reorganization observed in healthy aging.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Enriched dietary saturated fatty acids induce trained immunity via ceramide production that enhances severity of endotoxemia and clearance of infection</a></h4>

              
                Trained immunity is an innate immune memory response that is induced by primary microbial or sterile stimuli that sensitizes monocytes and macrophages to a secondary pathogenic challenge, reprogramming the host response to infection and inflammatory disease. Nutritional components, such as dietary fatty acids, can act as inflammatory stimuli, but it is unknown if they can act as the primary stimuli in the context of innate immune memory. Here we find mice fed a diet enriched exclusively in saturated fatty acids (SFAs; ketogenic diet; KD) confer a hyper-inflammatory response to systemic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and increased mortality, independent of diet-induced microbiome and glycemic modulation. We find KD mediates the composition of the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) compartment, and macrophages derived from the bone marrow of mice fed KD do not have altered baseline inflammation, but enhanced responses to a secondary inflammatory challenge. Lipidomics identified enhanced free palmitic acid (PA) and PA-associated lipids in KD-fed mice serum. We found pre-treatment with physiologically relevant concentrations of PA alone reprograms macrophages to induce a hyper-inflammatory response to secondary challenge with LPS. This response was found to be dependent on the synthesis of ceramide, and reversible when treated with a ceramide synthase inhibitor. <i>In vivo</i>, we found systemic PA confers enhanced inflammation and mortality during an acute inflammatory response to systemic LPS, and this phenotype was not reversible for up to 7 days post-PA-exposure. While PA-treatment is harmful for endotoxemia outcome, we find PA exposure enhanced clearance of <i>Candida albicans</i> in <i>Rag1</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice. Further, we show that oleic acid (OA), a mono-unsaturated FA that depletes intracellular ceramide, reverses the PA-induced hyper-inflammatory response shown in macrophages treated with LPS, and reduces severity and mortality of LPS endotoxin stimulation, highlighting the plasticity of SFA-dependent enhanced endotoxemia severity <i>in vivo. </i>These are the first data to implicate enriched dietary SFAs, and specifically PA, in the induction of long-lived innate immune memory that is detrimental during an acute inflammatory response, but beneficial for clearance of pathogens.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Neural underpinning of a respiration-associated resting-state fMRI network</a></h4>

              
                Respiration can induce motion and CO<sub>2 </sub>fluctuation during resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI) scans, which will lead to non-neural artifacts in the rsfMRI signal. In the meantime, as a crucial physiologic process, respiration that can directly drive neural activity change in the brain, and may thereby modulate the rsfMRI signal. Nonetheless, this potential neural component in the respiration-fMRI relationship is largely unexplored. To elucidate this issue, here we simultaneously recorded the electrophysiology, rsfMRI and respiration signals in rats. Our data show that respiration is indeed associated with neural activity changes, evidenced by a phase-locking relationship between slow respiration variations and the gamma-band power of the electrophysiologic signal recorded in the anterior cingulate cortex. Intriguingly, slow respiration variations are also linked to a characteristic rsfMRI network, which is mediated by gamma-band neural activity. In addition, this respiration-related brain network disappears when brain-wide neural activity is silenced at an iso-electrical state, while the respiration is maintained, further confirming the necessary role of neural activity in this network. Taken together, this study identifies a respiration-related brain network underpinned by neural activity, which represents a novel component in the respiration-rsfMRI relationship that is distinct from respiration-related rsfMRI artifacts. It opens a new avenue for investigating the interactions between respiration, neural activity and resting-state brain networks in both healthy and diseased conditions.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A novel monocyte differentiation pattern in pristane-induced lupus with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage</a></h4>

              
                Pristane causes chronic peritoneal inflammation resulting in lupus, which in C57BL/6 mice is complicated by lung microvascular injury and diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH). Mineral oil (MO) also causes inflammation, but not lupus or DAH. Since monocyte depletion prevents DAH, we examined the role of monocytes in the disease. Impaired bone marrow (BM) monocyte egress in <i>Ccr2−</i>/− mice abolished DAH, confirming the importance of monocyte recruitment to the lung. Circulating Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes from pristane-treated mice exhibited increased annexin-V staining in comparison with MO-treated controls without evidence of apoptosis, suggesting that pristane alters the distribution of phosphatidylserine in the plasma membrane before or shortly after monocyte egress from the BM. Plasma membrane asymmetry also was impaired in Nr4a1-regulated Ly6C<sup>lo/−</sup> ‘patrolling’ monocytes, which are derived from Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> precursors. Patrolling Ly6C<sup>lo/−</sup> monocytes normally promote endothelial repair, but their phenotype was altered in pristane-treated mice. In contrast to MO-treated controls, Nr4a1-regulated Ly6C<sup>lo/−</sup> monocytes from pristane-treated mice were CD138<sup>+</sup>, expressed more TremL4, a protein that amplifies TLR7 signaling, and exuberantly produced TNFα in response to TLR7 stimulation. TremL4 expression on these novel CD138<sup>+</sup> monocytes was regulated by Nr4a1. Thus, monocyte CD138, high TremL4 expression, and annexin-V staining may define an activated/inflammatory subtype of patrolling monocytes associated with DAH susceptibility. By altering monocyte development, pristane exposure may generate activated Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> and Ly6C<sup>lo/−</sup> monocytes, contributing to lung microvascular endothelial injury and DAH susceptibility.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">In situ X-ray assisted electron microscopy staining for large biological samples</a></h4>

              
                Electron microscopy of biological tissue has recently seen an unprecedented increase in imaging throughput moving the ultrastructural analysis of large tissue blocks such as whole brains into the realm of the feasible. However, homogeneous, high quality electron microscopy staining of large biological samples is still a major challenge. To date, assessing the staining quality in electron microscopy requires running a sample through the entire staining protocol end-to-end, which can take weeks or even months for large samples, rendering protocol optimization for such samples to be inefficient. Here we present an <i>in situ</i> time-lapsed X-ray assisted staining procedure that opens the 'black box' of electron microscopy staining and allows observation of individual staining steps in real time. Using this novel method we measured the accumulation of heavy metals in large tissue samples immersed in different staining solutions. We show that the measured accumulation of osmium in fixed tissue obeys empirically a quadratic dependence between the incubation time and sample size. We found that potassium ferrocyanide, a classic reducing agent for osmium tetroxide, clears the tissue after osmium staining and that the tissue expands in osmium tetroxide solution, but shrinks in potassium ferrocyanide reduced osmium solution. X-ray assisted staining gave access to the <i>in situ</i> staining kinetics and allowed us to develop a diffusion-reaction-advection model that accurately simulates the measured accumulation of osmium in tissue. These are first steps towards <i>in silico</i> staining experiments and simulation-guided optimization of staining protocols for large samples. Hence, X-ray assisted staining will be a useful tool for the development of reliable staining procedures for large samples such as entire brains of mice, monkeys or humans.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Molecular mechanism of Afadin substrate recruitment to the receptor phosphatase PTPRK via its pseudophosphatase domain</a></h4>

              
                Protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor-type kappa (PTPRK) is a transmembrane receptor that links extracellular homophilic interactions to intracellular catalytic activity. Previously we showed that PTPRK promotes cell-cell adhesion by selectively dephosphorylating several cell junction regulators including the protein Afadin (Fearnley et al., 2019). Here we demonstrate that Afadin is recruited for dephosphorylation by directly binding to the PTPRK D2 pseudophosphatase domain. We mapped this interaction to a putative coiled coil (CC) domain in Afadin that is separated by more than 100 amino acids from the substrate pTyr residue. We identify the residues that define PTP specificity, explaining how Afadin is selectively dephosphorylated by PTPRK yet not by the closely related receptor tyrosine phosphatase PTPRM. Our work demonstrates that PTP substrate specificity can be determined by protein-protein interactions distal to the active site. This explains how PTPRK and other PTPs achieve substrate specificity despite a lack of specific sequence context at the substrate pTyr. Furthermore, by demonstrating that these interactions are phosphorylation-independent and mediated via binding to a non-catalytic domain, we highlight how receptor PTPs could function as intracellular scaffolds in addition to catalyzing protein dephosphorylation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Structure and flexibility of the yeast NuA4 histone acetyltransferase complex</a></h4>

              
                The NuA4 protein complex acetylates histones H4 and H2A to activate both transcription and DNA repair. We report the 3.1 Å-resolution cryo-electron microscopy structure of the central hub of NuA4, which flexibly tethers the HAT and TINTIN modules. The hub contains the large Tra1 subunit and a core that includes Swc4, Arp4, Act1, Eaf1 and the C-terminal region of Epl1. Eaf1 stands out as the primary scaffolding factor that interacts with the Tra1, Swc4 and Epl1 subunits and contributes the conserved HSA helix to the Arp module. Using nucleosome binding assays, we find that the HAT module, which is anchored to the core through Epl1, recognizes H3K4me3 nucleosomes with hyperacetylated H3 tails, while the TINTIN module, anchored to the core via Eaf1, recognizes nucleosomes that have hyperacetylated H2A and H4 tails. Together with the known interaction of Tra1 with site-specific transcription factors, our data suggests a model in which Tra1 recruits NuA4 to specific genomic sites then allowing the flexible HAT and TINTIN modules to select nearby nucleosomes for acetylation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Caveolae couple mechanical stress to integrin recycling and activation</a></h4>

              
                Cells are subjected to multiple mechanical inputs throughout their lives. Their ability to detect these environmental cues is called mechanosensing, a process in which integrins play an important role. During cellular mechanosensing, plasma membrane (PM) tension is adjusted to mechanical stress through the buffering action of caveolae; however, little is known about the role of caveolae in early integrin mechanosensing regulation. Here, we show that Cav1KO fibroblasts increase adhesion to FN-coated beads when pulled with magnetic tweezers, as compared to wild type fibroblasts. This phenotype is Rho-independent and mainly derived from increased active b1-integrin content on the surface of Cav1KO fibroblasts. FRAP analysis and endocytosis/recycling assays revealed that active b1-integrin is mostly endocytosed through the CLIC/GEEC pathway and is more rapidly recycled to the PM in Cav1KO fibroblasts, in a Rab4 and PM tension-dependent manner. Moreover, the threshold for PM tension-driven b1-integrin activation is lower in Cav1KO MEFs than in wild type MEFs, through a mechanism dependent on talin activity. Our findings suggest that caveolae couple mechanical stress to integrin cycling and activation, thereby regulating the early steps of the cellular mechanosensing response.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Didemnin B and ternatin-4 differentially inhibit conformational changes in eEF1A required for aminoacyl-tRNA accommodation into mammalian ribosomes</a></h4>

              
                Rapid and accurate mRNA translation requires efficient codon-dependent delivery of the correct aminoacyl-tRNA (aa-tRNA) to the ribosomal A site. In mammals, this fidelity-determining reaction is facilitated by the GTPase elongation factor-1 alpha (eEF1A), which escorts aa-tRNA as an eEF1A(GTP)-aa-tRNA ternary complex into the ribosome. The structurally unrelated cyclic peptides didemnin B and ternatin-4 bind to the eEF1A(GTP)-aa-tRNA ternary complex and inhibit translation but have different effects on protein synthesis in vitro and in vivo. Here, we employ single-molecule fluorescence imaging and cryogenic electron microscopy to determine how these natural products inhibit translational elongation on mammalian ribosomes. By binding to a common site on eEF1A, didemnin B and ternatin-4 trap eEF1A in an intermediate state of aa-tRNA selection, preventing eEF1A release and aa-tRNA accommodation on the ribosome. We also show that didemnin B and ternatin-4 exhibit distinct effects on the dynamics of aa-tRNA selection that inform on observed disparities in their inhibition efficacies and physiological impacts. These integrated findings underscore the value of dynamics measurements in assessing the mechanism of small-molecule inhibition and highlight potential of single-molecule methods to reveal how distinct natural products differentially impact the human translation mechanism.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Structure of SARS-CoV-2 M protein in lipid nanodiscs</a></h4>

              
                SARS-CoV-2 encodes four structural proteins incorporated into virions, spike (S), envelope (E), nucleocapsid (N), and membrane (M). M plays an essential role in viral assembly by organizing other structural proteins through physical interactions and directing them to sites of viral budding. As the most abundant protein in the viral envelope and a target of patient antibodies, M is a compelling target for vaccines and therapeutics. Still, the structure of M and molecular basis for its role in virion formation are unknown. Here, we present the cryo-EM structure of SARS-CoV-2 M in lipid nanodiscs to 3.5 Å resolution. M forms a 50 kDa homodimer that is structurally related to the SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a viroporin, suggesting a shared ancestral origin. Structural comparisons reveal how intersubunit gaps create a small, enclosed pocket in M and large open cavity in ORF3a, consistent with a structural role and ion channel activity, respectively. M displays a strikingly electropositive cytosolic surface that may be important for interactions with N, S, and viral RNA. Molecular dynamics simulations show a high degree of structural rigidity in a simple lipid bilayer and support a role for M homodimers in scaffolding viral assembly. Together, these results provide insight into roles for M in coronavirus assembly and structure.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">scRNA-sequencing reveals subtype-specific transcriptomic perturbations in DRG neurons of PirtEGFPf mice in neuropathic pain condition</a></h4>

              
                Functionally distinct subtypes/clusters of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons may play different roles in nerve regeneration and pain. However, details about their transcriptomic changes under neuropathic pain conditions remain unclear. Chronic constriction injury (CCI) of the sciatic nerve represents a well-established model of neuropathic pain, and we conducted single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) to characterize subtype-specific perturbations of transcriptomes in lumbar DRG neurons on day 7 post-CCI. By using <i>Pirt<sup>EGFPf</sup></i> mice that selectively express an enhanced <i>green fluorescent protein</i> in DRG neurons, we established a highly efficient purification process to enrich neurons for scRNA-seq. We observed the emergence of four prominent CCI-induced clusters and a loss of marker genes in injured neurons. Importantly, a portion of injured neurons from several clusters were spared from injury-induced identity loss, suggesting subtype-specific transcriptomic changes in injured neurons. Moreover, uninjured neurons, which are necessary for mediating the evoked pain, also demonstrated cell-type-specific transcriptomic perturbations in these clusters, but not in others. Notably, male and female mice showed differential transcriptomic changes in multiple neuronal clusters after CCI, suggesting transcriptomic sexual dimorphism in DRG neurons after nerve injury. Using <i>Fgf3</i> as a proof-of-principle, RNAscope study provided further evidence of increased <i>Fgf3</i> in injured neurons after CCI, supporting scRNA-seq analysis, and calcium imaging study unraveled a functional role of <i>Fgf3</i> in neuronal excitability. These findings may contribute to the identification of new target genes and the development of DRG neuron cell-type-specific therapies for optimizing neuropathic pain treatment and nerve regeneration.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Alternative splicing of apoptosis genes promotes human T cell survival</a></h4>

              
                Alternative splicing occurs in the vast majority of human genes, giving rise to distinct mRNA and protein isoforms. We, and others, have previously identified hundreds of genes that change their isoform expression upon T cell activation via alternative splicing; however, how these changes link activation input with functional output remains largely unknown. Here we investigate how costimulation of T cells through the CD28 receptor impacts alternative splicing in T cells activated through the T cell receptor (CD3) and find that while CD28 signaling alone has minimal impact on splicing, it enhances the extent of change for up to 20% of TCR-induced alternative splicing events. Interestingly, a set of CD28-enhanced splicing events occur within genes encoding key components of the apoptotic signaling pathway; namely caspase-9, Bax and Bim. Using both CRISPR-edited cells and antisense oligos to force expression of specific isoforms, we show for all three of these genes that the isoform induced by CD3/CD28 costimulation promotes resistance to apoptosis, and that changes in all three genes together function combinatorially to further promote cell viability. Finally, we show that the JNK signaling pathway, induced downstream of CD3/CD28 costimulation, is required for each of these splicing events, further highlighting their co-regulation. Together these findings demonstrate that alternative splicing is a key mechanism by which costimulation of CD28 promotes viability of activated T cells.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Molecular basis of FAAH-OUT-associated human pain insensitivity</a></h4>

              
                Chronic pain affects millions of people worldwide. Studying pain insensitive individuals helps to identify novel analgesic strategies. Here we report how the recently discovered FAAH-OUT lncRNA-encoding gene, which was found from studying a pain insensitive patient with reduced anxiety and fast wound healing, regulates the adjacent key endocannabinoid system gene FAAH, which encodes the anandamide-degrading fatty acid amide hydrolase enzyme. We demonstrate that the disruption in FAAH-OUT lncRNA transcription leads to DNMT1-dependent DNA methylation within the FAAH promoter. In addition, FAAH-OUT contains a conserved regulatory element, FAAH-AMP, that acts as an enhancer for FAAH expression. Furthermore, using transcriptomic analyses we have uncovered a network of genes that are dysregulated from disruption of the FAAH-FAAH-OUT axis, thus providing a coherent mechanistic basis to understand the human phenotype observed and a platform for development of future gene and small molecule therapies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Inference of Presynaptic Connectivity from Temporally Blurry Spike Trains by Supervised Learning</a></h4>

              
                Reconstruction of neural network connectivity is a central focus of neuroscience. The ability to use neuronal connection information to predict activity at single unit resolution and decipher its effect on whole systems can provide critical information about behavior and cognitive processing. Neuronal sensing modalities come in varying forms, but there is yet to exist a modality that can deliver readouts that sufficiently address the spatiotemporal constraints of biological nervous systems. This necessitates supplementary approaches that rely on mathematical models to mitigate physical limitations and decode network features. Here, we introduce a simple proof-of-concept model that addresses temporal constraints by reconstructing presynaptic connections from temporally blurry data. We use a variation of the perceptron algorithm to process firing rate information at multiple time constraints for a heterogenous feed-forward network of excitatory, inhibitory, and unconnected presynaptic units. We evaluate the performance of the algorithm under these conditions and determine the optimal learning rate, firing rate, and the ability to reconstruct single unit spikes for a given degree of temporal blur. We then test our method on a physiologically relevant configuration by sampling network subpopulations of leaky integrate-and-fire neuronal models displaying bursting firing patterns and find comparable learning rates for optimized reconstruction of network connectivity. Our method provides a recipe for reverse engineering neural networks based on limited data quality that can be extended to more complicated readouts and connectivity distributions relevant to multiple brain circuits.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Associations of Cumulative Paternal and Maternal Childhood Maltreament Exposure with Neonate Brain Anatomy</a></h4>

              
                Background: Childhood maltreatment exposure (CME) can lead to adverse long term consequences for the exposed individual. Emerging evidence suggests that the long term effect of CME may be transmitted across generations, starting already during prenatal development. Methods: In this study, we measured brain grey and white matter volumes from MR images in 62 healthy neonates at 2 to 5 weeks of gestation corrected age and obtained Trauma and Distress Scale (TADS) questionnaire data from both parents. Results: We found that paternal CME associated positively with neonate supratentorial grey matter volumes while the association for the maternal TADS scores was not statistically significant. Maternal prepregnancy BMI associated with supratentorial white matter volumes, but not with parental CME. Conclusions: We are the first to report that paternal CME is linked with variation in newborn grey matter volume. Our results imply an intergenerational transmission of paternal CME to offspring. Elucidating the later relevance of these associations and mechanisms involved remains an enticing avenue for future studies.

                Fluorescence imaging is widely used for the mesoscopic mapping of neuronal connectivity. However, neurite reconstruction is challenging, especially when neurons are densely labelled. Here we report a strategy for the fully automated reconstruction of densely labelled neuronal circuits. Firstly, we established stochastic super-multicolour labelling with up to seven different fluorescent proteins using the Tetbow method. With this method, each neuron was labelled with a unique combination of fluorescent proteins, which were then imaged and separated by linear unmixing. We also established an automated neurite reconstruction pipeline based on the quantitative analysis of multiple dyes (QDyeFinder). To classify colour combinations, we used a newly developed unsupervised clustering algorithm, dCrawler, in which data points in multi-dimensional space were clustered based on a given threshold distance. Our new strategy allows for the reconstruction of neurites for up to hundreds of neurons at a millimetre scale without manual tracing.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Bridging the gap between presynaptic hair cell function and neural sound encoding</a></h4>

              
                Neural diversity can expand the encoding capacity of a circuitry. A striking example of diverse structure and function is presented by the afferent synapses between inner hair cells (IHCs) and spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) in the cochlea. Synapses at the pillar IHC-side activate at lower voltages than those of the modiolar side, which show larger active zones and Ca2+-channel clusters. At the postsynapse, SGNs differ in their spontaneous firing rates, sound thresholds and operating ranges. While it is tempting to speculate about a causal relationship between synaptic heterogeneity and neural response diversity, direct experimental evidence is lacking. Here, we bridged this gap by ex-vivo paired recordings of IHCs and postsynaptic boutons with stimuli and conditions aimed to mimic those of in-vivo SGN-characterization. Synapses with high spontaneous rate (SR) were found predominantly on the pillar side of the IHC. These high SR synapses had larger spontaneous EPSCs, lower voltage-thresholds, shorter response latencies and higher initial release rates. This study indicates that synaptic heterogeneity in IHCs can account for functional response diversity of spontaneous and sound-evoked SGN.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Granule cells affect dendritic tree selection in purkinje cells during cerebellar development</a></h4>

              
                This study investigates the interrelationship between primary dendrite selection of Purkinje cells and migration of their pre-synaptic partner granule cells during cerebellar development. During development of the cerebellar cortex, each Purkinje cell grows more than three dendritic trees, from which a primary tree is selected to develop further, whereas the others completely retract. Experimental studies suggest that this selection process is coordinated by physical and synaptic interactions with granule cells. However, technical limitations hinder a continuous experimental observation of multiple populations. To reveal the mechanism underlying this selection process, we constructed a computational model of dendritic developments and granule cell migrations, using a new computational framework, NeuroDevSim. Comparisons of the resulting morphologies from the model demonstrate the roles of the selection stage in regulating the growth of the selected primary trees. The study presents the first computational model that simultaneously simulates growing Purkinje cells and the dynamics of granule cell migrations, revealing the role of physical and synaptic interactions upon dendritic selection. The model provides new insights about the distinct planar morphology of Purkinje cell dendrites and about roles of the dendritic selection process during the cerebellar development. The model also supports the hypothesis that synaptic interactions by granule cells are likely to be involved in the selection procedure.

	<p>Female-specific risk factors for stroke have gradually received attention. The relationship between ischemic stroke and adenomyosis, a benign uterine disorder commonly present in parous women, is underrecognized. We aimed to provide an overview of the epidemiology, pathophysiological mechanisms, clinical characteristics, diagnostic considerations, and potential therapeutic strategies of adenomyosis-associated ischemic stroke. We shared our experience with the diagnosis and management of a patient, and summarized current findings and knowledge gaps of this disease based on previous literature. The relevant studies were searched in English and Chinese databases up to April 2022 using the keywords &amp;amp;ldquo;ischemic stroke&amp;amp;rdquo;, &amp;amp;ldquo;cerebral infarction&amp;amp;rdquo; and &amp;amp;ldquo;adenomyosis&amp;amp;rdquo;. Then, we provided a narrative review of the retrieved articles. Finally, the data of 32 cases were analyzed. We found that increased levels of carbohydrate antigen 125 and D-dimer and decreased level of hemoglobin are biomarkers of adenomyosis-associated ischemic stroke. In addition, hypercoagulability might be a key mechanism leading to thromboembolism in the cerebrovascular system. Additional studies are needed to find optimal prevention strategies for the disease. A better understanding of this &amp;amp;ldquo;rare&amp;amp;rdquo; pathogenesis of ischemic stroke may inform a more precise diagnosis and effective prevention strategy in middle-aged women with embolic stroke of undetermined source.</p>

	<p>This study pursued two goals: (1) to establish range of motion (ROM) demand tiers (i.e., low, moderate, high) specific to the jaw (J), lower lip (LL), posterior tongue (PT), and anterior tongue (AT) for multisyllabic words based on the articulatory performance of neurotypical talkers and (2) to identify demand- and disease-specific articulatory performance characteristics in talkers with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD). J, LL, PT, and AT movements of 12 talkers with ALS, 12 talkers with PD, and 12 controls were recorded using electromagnetic articulography. Vertical ROM, average speed, and movement duration were measured. Results showed that in talkers with PD, J and LL ROM were already significantly reduced at the lowest tier whereas PT and AT ROM were only significantly reduced at moderate and high tiers. In talkers with ALS, J ROM was significantly reduced at the moderate tier whereas LL, PT, and AT ROM were only significantly reduced at the highest tier. In both clinical groups, significantly reduced J and LL speeds could already be observed at the lowest tier whereas significantly reduced AT speeds could only be observed at the highest tier. PT speeds were already significantly reduced at the lowest tier in the ALS group but not until the moderate tier in the PD group. Finally, movement duration, but not ROM or speed performance, differentiated between ALS and PD even at the lowest tier. Results suggest that articulatory deficits vary with stimuli-specific motor demands across articulators and clinical groups.</p>

	<p>Purpose: The effect of scinderin (SCIN) on cancer progression has been studied, but its role in glioma remains unknown. This study describes the value of SCIN for the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of glioma. Methods: The expression of SCIN was analyzed using the GEPIA, Oncomine, cBioPortal, and CGGA databases. GO/KEGG enrichment analysis of similar genes to SCIN were performed using the R software package, and the protein&amp;amp;ndash;protein interaction (PPI) network was analyzed by the STRING and GeneMANIA databases. The correlations of mRNA expression between SCIN and MMP2/9 were analyzed by TCGA glioma. Simultaneously, the TISIDB and TIMER databases were used to analyze the correlation between SCIN and immune infiltration. Finally, SCIN and MMP2/9 protein expression among different grades of glioma was performed and the results were obtained via immunohistochemistry and Western blot assays. We used the Kaplan&amp;amp;ndash;Meier method and Cox proportional hazards model to assess the impact of SCIN and MMP2/9 on glioma patients&amp;amp;rsquo; survival. The correlations between SCIN and MMP2/9 were analyzed by immunohistochemistry and Western blot assays. Results: SCIN was upregulated in glioma patients with a poor prognosis. The GO and KEGG enrichment analysis showed the functional relationship between SCIN and the immune cell activation and regulation. In addition, the expression of SCIN was related to MMP2/9 in glioma. The correlation analysis showed that SCIN expression was associated with tumor purity and immune infiltration. SCIN and MMP2/9 are negative prognostic factors resulting in worsening glioma patients&amp;amp;rsquo; survival. Conclusion: Our studies demonstrated that SCIN expression was associated with MMP2/9, immune infiltration, and a poor prognosis in glioma. SCIN may serve as a potential prognostic marker and an immune therapy target for glioma.</p>

	<p>Several studies have revealed defects in autophagy in neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). SQSTM1/p62 plays a key role in the autophagic machinery and may serve as a marker for autophagic flux in vivo. We investigated the role of p62 in neurodegeneration, analyzing its concentrations in the CSF of AD and FTD patients. We recruited 76 participants: 22 patients with AD, 28 patients with FTD, and 26 controls. CSF p62 concentrations were significantly increased in AD and FTD patients when compared to controls, which persisted after adjusting for age (p = 0.01 and p = 0.008, respectively). In female FTD patients, p62 positively correlated with the neurodegenerative biomarkers t-Tau and p-Tau. A significant correlation between CSF p62 concentrations and several clinical features of AD was found. Our data show that p62 is increased in CSF of AD and FTD patients, suggesting a key role of autophagy in these two disorders. The levels of p62 in CSF may reflect an altered autophagic flux, and p62 could represent a potential biomarker of neurodegeneration.</p>

	<p>Multi-site resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data can facilitate learning-based approaches to train reliable models on more data. However, significant data heterogeneity between imaging sites, caused by different scanners or protocols, can negatively impact the generalization ability of learned models. In addition, previous studies have shown that graph convolution neural networks (GCNs) are effective in mining fMRI biomarkers. However, they generally ignore the potentially different contributions of brain regions- of-interest (ROIs) to automated disease diagnosis/prognosis. In this work, we propose a multi-site rs-fMRI adaptation framework with attention GCN (A2GCN) for brain disorder identification. Specifically, the proposed A2GCN consists of three major components: (1) a node representation learning module based on GCN to extract rs-fMRI features from functional connectivity networks, (2) a node attention mechanism module to capture the contributions of ROIs, and (3) a domain adaptation module to alleviate the differences in data distribution between sites through the constraint of mean absolute error and covariance. The A2GCN not only reduces data heterogeneity across sites, but also improves the interpretability of the learning algorithm by exploring important ROIs. Experimental results on the public ABIDE database demonstrate that our method achieves remarkable performance in fMRI-based recognition of autism spectrum disorders.</p>

	<p>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neuromuscular disease, characterized by the progressive degeneration of the upper and lower motor neurons in the cortex and spinal cord. Although the pathogenesis of ALS remains unclear, evidence concerning the role of the clonotypic immune system is growing. Adaptive immunity cells often appear changed in number, or in terms of their activation profiles, both peripherally and centrally; however, their role in ALS appears conflictive. Data from human and animal model studies, which are currently reported in the literature, show that each subset of lymphocytes and their mediators may mediate a protective or toxic mechanism in ALS, affecting both its progression and risk of death. In the present review, an attempt is made to shed light on the actual role of cellular clonotypic immunity in ALS by integrating recent clinical studies and experimental observations.</p>

	<p>Our ability to perform voluntary actions and make choices is shaped by the motivation from having control over the resulting effects (agency) and positive outcomes (reward). We offer an overview of distinct and common behavioral and neural signatures of agency and reward. We discuss their typical and atypical developmental trajectories, focusing on autism spectrum disorder (ASD), which is characterized by neurodiverse processes underlying action selection. We propose that reduced sensitivity to agency and reward in ASD may be related to atypical multisensory processes and motor planning, with potential for understanding restricted and repetitive behaviors. We emphasize the limitations of the existing literature, and prospects for future research. Understanding the neurocognitive processes that shape the way people with ASD select actions and perceive outcomes is essential to support not only learning, but also volition and self-determination.</p>

     alt="Comparative analysis of astrocytes in the prefrontal cortex of primates: Insights into the evolution of human brain energetics"/>
<p>We quantified astrocytes expressing glial fibrillary acidic protein in human and nonhuman primates. We report that astrocyte density, soma volume, and ratio of astrocytes to total glia cells in layer I of Brodmann.s area 9 increased significantly with brain size enlargement and was greatest in humans. Roman numerals denote cortical layer. Scale bars = 25 µm.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Astrocytes are the main homeostatic cell of the brain involved in many processes related to cognition, immune response, and energy expenditure. It has been suggested that the distribution of astrocytes is associated with brain size, and that they are specialized in humans. To evaluate these, we quantified astrocyte density, soma volume, and total glia density in layer I and white matter in Brodmann's area 9 of humans, chimpanzees, baboons, and macaques. We found that layer I astrocyte density, soma volume, and ratio of astrocytes to total glia cells were highest in humans and increased with brain size. Overall glia density in layer I and white matter were relatively invariant across brain sizes, potentially due to their important metabolic functions on a per volume basis. We also quantified two transporters involved in metabolism through the astrocyte-neuron lactate shuttle, excitatory amino acid transporter 2 (EAAT2) and glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1). We expected these transporters would be increased in human brains due to their high rate of metabolic consumption and associated gene activity. While humans have higher EAAT2 cell density, GLUT1 vessel volume, and GLUT1 area fraction compared to baboons and chimpanzees, they did not differ from macaques. Therefore, EAAT2 and GLUT1 are not related to increased energetic demands of the human brain. Taken together, these data provide evidence that astrocytes play a unique role in both brain expansion and evolution among primates, with an emphasis on layer I astrocytes having a potentially significant role in human-specific metabolic processing and cognition.</p>

     alt="3D-atlas of the brain of the cockroach Rhyparobia maderae"/><p>Cockroaches are model organisms for research on olfaction, spatial orientation and circadian control of behavior. To facilitate further studies on these topics, we provide a detailed 3D atlas of brain neuropils, fiber tracts, and commissures of the cockroach <i>Rhyparobia maderae</i>, which reveals novel insights into the organization of the cockroach brain.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The Madeira cockroach <i>Rhyparobia maderae</i> is a nocturnal insect and a prominent model organism for the study of circadian rhythms. Its master circadian clock, controlling circadian locomotor activity and sleep–wake cycles, is located in the accessory medulla of the optic lobe. For a better understanding of brain regions controlled by the circadian clock and brain organization of this insect in general, we created a three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of all neuropils of the cerebral ganglia based on anti-synapsin and anti-γ-aminobutyric acid immunolabeling of whole mount brains. Forty-nine major neuropils were identified and three-dimensionally reconstructed. Single-cell dye fills complement the data and provide evidence for distinct subdivisions of certain brain areas. Most neuropils defined in the fruit fly <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> could be distinguished in the cockroach as well. However, some neuropils identified in the fruit fly do not exist as distinct entities in the cockroach while others are lacking in the fruit fly. In addition to neuropils, major fiber systems, tracts, and commissures were reconstructed and served as important landmarks separating brain areas. Being a nocturnal insect, <i>R. maderae</i> is an important new species to the growing collection of 3D insect brain atlases and only the second hemimetabolous insect, for which a detailed 3D brain atlas is available. This atlas will be highly valuable for an evolutionary comparison of insect brain organization and will greatly facilitate addressing brain areas that are supervised by the circadian clock.</p>

<p>Development of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding proteins in the PGN of the cat.

<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The thalamic reticular nucleus receives axons from the thalamic sensory nuclei and the cerebral cortex. The visual part of this nucleus in carnivores is the perigeniculate nucleus located dorsal to the lateral geniculate nucleus. The perigeniculate nucleus participates in the modulation of visual processing and in the transition of synchronized slow rhythmicity during sleep into desynchronized high-frequency activity during arousal and consists of inhibitory neurons. The main neurochemical markers for perigeniculate neurons are glutamic acid decarboxylase and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding protein parvalbumin. Previous studies of postnatal development focused on the morphological features of the perigeniculate nucleus; however, its neurochemistry remains poorly understood. In this study, we focused on the postnatal development of perigeniculate neurons using immunohistochemical labeling of parvalbumin, two related Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding proteins (calretinin and calbindin), glutamic acid decarboxylase, and a common neuronal protein, NeuN, in kittens that were 0–123 days old and in adult cats. In parallel with the well-known dominant neuronal populations expressing parvalbumin and GAD67 and persisting until adulthood, transient populations expressing calretinin and calbindin were observed. The calbindin-positive neurons were similar to the main perigeniculate population and showed close morphological features and parvalbumin coexpression. In contrast, the calretinin-positive neurons differed in their morphological characteristics and did not express GAD67, thus distinguishing them from the majority of perigeniculate neurons. A possible link between these populations was revealed, and the development of thalamocortical processing is discussed.</p>

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Neuropeptide S (NPS) increases wakefulness. A small number of neurons in the brainstem express <i>Nps</i>. These neurons are located in or near the parabrachial nucleus (PB), but we know very little about their ontogeny, connectivity, and function. To identify <i>Nps</i>-expressing neurons within the molecular framework of the PB region, we used in situ hybridization, immunofluorescence, and Cre-reporter labeling in mice. The primary concentration of <i>Nps</i>-expressing neurons borders the lateral lemniscus at far-rostral levels of the lateral PB. Caudal to this main cluster, <i>Nps</i>-expressing neurons scatter through the PB and form a secondary concentration medial to the locus coeruleus (LC). Most <i>Nps</i>-expressing neurons in the PB region are <i>Atoh1</i>-derived, <i>Foxp2</i>-expressing, and mutually exclusive with neurons expressing <i>Calca</i> or <i>Lmx1b</i>. Among <i>Foxp2</i>-expressing PB neurons, those expressing <i>Nps</i> are distinct from intermingled subsets expressing <i>Cck</i> or <i>Pdyn</i>. Examining <i>Nps</i> Cre-reporter expression throughout the brain identified novel populations of neurons in the nucleus incertus, anterior hypothalamus, and lateral habenula. This information will help focus experimental questions about the connectivity and function of NPS neurons.</p>

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Quantitative data of biological systems provide valuable baseline information for understanding pathology, experimental perturbations, and computational modeling. In mouse colon, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is expressed by myenteric neurons with multiaxonal (Dogiel type II) morphology, characteristic of intrinsic primary afferent neurons (IPANs). Analogous neurons in other species and gut regions represent 5–35% of myenteric neurons. We aimed to quantify proportions of CGRP-immunopositive (CGRP+) myenteric neurons. Colchicine-treated wholemount preparations of proximal, mid, and distal colon were labeled for HuC/D, CGRP, nitric oxide synthase (NOS), and peripherin (Per). The pan-neuronal markers (Hu+/Per+) co-labeled 94% of neurons. Hu+/Per– neurons comprised ∼6%, but Hu-/Per+ cells were rare. Thus, quantification was based on Hu+ myenteric neurons (8576 total; 1225 ± 239 per animal, <i>n</i> = 7). CGRP+ cell bodies were significantly larger than the average of all Hu+ neurons (329 ± 13 vs. 261 ± 12 μm<sup>2</sup>, <i>p</i> &lt; .0001). CGRP+ neurons comprised 19% ± 3% of myenteric neurons without significant regional variation. NOS+ neurons comprised 42% ± 2% of myenteric neurons overall, representing a lower proportion in proximal colon, compared to mid and distal colon (38% ± 2%, 44% ± 2%, and 44% ± 3%, respectively). Peripherin immunolabeling revealed cell body and axonal morphology in some myenteric neurons. Whether all CGRP+ neurons were multiaxonal could not be addressed using peripherin immunolabeling. However, of 118 putatively multiaxonal neurons first identified based on peripherin immunoreactivity, all were CGRP+ (<i>n</i> = 4). In conclusion, CGRP+ myenteric neurons in mouse colon were comprehensively quantified, occurring within a range expected of a putative IPAN marker. All Per+ multiaxonal neurons, characteristic of Dogiel type II/IPAN morphology, were CGRP+.</p>

     alt="Tonotopic differentiation of presynaptic neurotransmitter-releasing machinery in the auditory brainstem during the prehearing period and its selective deficits in Fmr1 knockout mice"/>
<p>We identified protein-specific and age-dependent tonotopic distributions of five key presynaptic proteins in the developing auditory brainstem and their selective alterations in <i>Fmr1</i> KO mice. The tonotopic maturation of the presynaptic machinery may provide a potential mechanism for tonotopic differentiation of neurotransmission during normal and abnormal development of auditory circuits.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Tonotopic organization is a fundamental feature of the auditory system. In the developing auditory brainstem, the ontogeny and maturation of neurotransmission progress from high to low frequencies along the tonotopic axis. To explore the underlying mechanism of this tonotopic development, we aim to determine whether the presynaptic machinery responsible for neurotransmitter release is tonotopically differentiated during development. In the current study, we examined vesicular neurotransmitter transporters and calcium sensors, two central players responsible for loading neurotransmitter into synaptic vesicles and for triggering neurotransmitter release in a calcium-dependent manner, respectively. Using immunocytochemistry, we characterized the distribution patterns of vesicular glutamate transporters (VGLUTs) 1 and 2, vesicular gamma-aminobutyric acid transporter (VGAT), and calcium sensor synaptotagmin (Syt) 1 and 2 in the developing mouse medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB). We identified tonotopic gradients of VGLUT1, VGAT, Syt1, and Syt2 in the first postnatal week, with higher protein densities in the more medial (high-frequency) portion of the MNTB. These gradients gradually flattened before the onset of hearing. In contrast, VGLUT2 was distributed relatively uniformly along the tonotopic axis during this prehearing period. In mice lacking Fragile X mental retardation protein, an mRNA-binding protein that regulates synaptic development and plasticity, progress to achieve the mature-like organization was altered for VGLUT1, Syt1, and Syt2, but not for VGAT. Together, our results identified novel organization patterns of selective presynaptic proteins in immature auditory synapses, providing a potential mechanism that may contribute to tonotopic differentiation of neurotransmission during normal and abnormal development.</p>

     alt="Diversity in spatial frequency, temporal frequency, and speed tuning across mouse visual cortical areas and layers"/>
<p>Using extracellular electrophysiology and two-photon calcium imaging genetically targeted to different layer 5 cell classes, we characterize the spatial frequency (SF), temporal frequency (TF), and speed tuning of deep (layer 5/6) cortical neurons in mouse primary visual cortex (V1) and higher visual cortical areas anterolateral (AL) and posteromedial (PM). We find that deep-layer neurons, like superficial layer neurons, are functionally specialized for different spatial and temporal frequencies in different visual areas. However, we also found a larger range of preferred SFs and TFs than previously reported in superficial cortical layers. We also find that direction tuning is much more prominent for layer 5 extratelencephalically than layer 5 intratelencephalically projecting neurons in multiple visual areas.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The mouse visual system consists of several visual cortical areas thought to be specialized for different visual features and/or tasks. Previous studies have revealed differences between primary visual cortex (V1) and other higher visual areas, namely, anterolateral (AL) and posteromedial (PM), and their tuning preferences for spatial and temporal frequency. However, these differences have primarily been characterized using methods that are biased toward superficial layers of cortex, such as two-photon calcium imaging. Fewer studies have investigated cell types in deeper layers of these areas and their tuning preferences. Because superficial versus deep-layer neurons and different types of deep-layer neurons are known to have different feedforward and feedback inputs and outputs, comparing the tuning preferences of these groups is important for understanding cortical visual information processing. In this study, we used extracellular electrophysiology and two-photon calcium imaging targeted toward two different layer 5 cell classes to characterize their tuning properties in V1, AL, and PM. We find that deep-layer neurons, similar to superficial layer neurons, are also specialized for different spatial and temporal frequencies, with the strongest differences between AL and V1, and AL and PM, but not V1 and PM. However, we note that the deep-layer neuron populations preferred a larger range of SFs and TFs compared to previous studies. We also find that extratelencephalically projecting layer 5 neurons are more direction selective than intratelencephalically projecting layer 5 neurons.</p>

                <img src="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/99e3d1d8-4dc2-422d-a29b-17bd78248eef/cne25413-gra-0001-m.png"
     alt="Quantitative spatial analysis reveals that the local axons of lamina I projection neurons and interneurons exhibit distributions that predict distinct roles in spinal sensory processing"/>
<p>Quantitative analyses of spinal lamina I projection neurons (PNs) and interneurons (INs) revealed almost identical dendritic patterns but local axon collateral distribution patterns that are distinct. INs mostly establish connections within the superficial dorsal horn and may bridge its medial and lateral halves. PNs also relay their input locally, to deeper laminae of the spinal gray matter and may link other ascending systems and participate directly in the nociceptive withdrawal reflex.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Our knowledge about the detailed wiring of neuronal circuits in the spinal dorsal horn (DH), where initial sensory processing takes place, is still very sparse. While a substantial amount of data is available on the somatodendritic morphology of DH neurons, the laminar and segmental distribution patterns and consequential function of individual axons are much less characterized. In the present study, we fully reconstructed the axonal and dendritic processes of 10 projection neurons (PNs) and 15 interneurons (INs) in lamina I of the rat, to reveal quantitative differences in their distribution. We also performed whole-cell patch-clamp recordings to test the predicted function of certain axon collaterals. In line with our earlier qualitative description, we found that lamina I INs in the lateral aspect of the superficial DH send axon collaterals toward the medial part and occupy mostly laminae I–III, providing anatomical basis for a lateromedial flow of information within the DH. Local axon collaterals of PNs were more extensively distributed including dorsal commissural axon collaterals that might refer to those reported earlier linking the lateral aspect of the left and right DHs. PN collaterals dominated the dorsolateral funiculus and laminae IV–VI, suggesting propriospinal and ventral connections. Indeed, patch-clamp recordings confirmed the existence of a dorsoventral excitatory drive upon activation of neurokinin-1 receptors that, although being expressed in various lamina I neurons, are specifically enriched in PNs. In summary, lamina I PNs and INs have almost identical dendritic input fields, while their segmental axon collateral distribution patterns are distinct. INs, whose somata reside in lamina I, establish local connections, may show asymmetry, and contribute to bridging the medial and lateral halves of the DH. PNs, on the other hand, preferably relay their integrated dendritic input to deeper laminae of the spinal gray matter where it might be linked to other ascending pathways or the premotor network, resulting in a putative direct contribution to the nociceptive withdrawal reflex.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">HDAC6 Inhibition Reverses Cisplatin-Induced Mechanical Hypersensitivity via Tonic Delta Opioid Receptor Signaling</a></h4>

              
                <p>Peripheral neuropathic pain induced by the chemotherapeutic cisplatin can persist for months to years after treatment. Histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) inhibitors have therapeutic potential for cisplatin-induced neuropathic pain since they persistently reverse mechanical hypersensitivity and spontaneous pain in rodent models. Here, we investigated the mechanisms underlying reversal of mechanical hypersensitivity in male and female mice by a 2 week treatment with an HDAC6 inhibitor, administered 3 d after the last dose of cisplatin. Mechanical hypersensitivity in animals of both sexes treated with the HDAC6 inhibitor was temporarily reinstated by a single injection of the neutral opioid receptor antagonist 6&beta;-naltrexol or the peripherally restricted opioid receptor antagonist naloxone methiodide. These results suggest that tonic peripheral opioid ligand-receptor signaling mediates reversal of cisplatin-induced mechanical hypersensitivity after treatment with an HDAC6 inhibitor. Pointing to a specific role for  opioid receptors (DORs), <I>Oprd1</I> expression was decreased in DRG neurons following cisplatin administration, but normalized after treatment with an HDAC6 inhibitor. Mechanical hypersensitivity was temporarily reinstated in both sexes by a single injection of the DOR antagonist naltrindole. Consistently, HDAC6 inhibition failed to reverse cisplatin-induced hypersensitivity when DORs were genetically deleted from advillin<sup>+</sup> neurons. Mechanical hypersensitivity was also temporarily reinstated in both sexes by a single injection of a neutralizing antibody against the DOR ligand met-enkephalin. In conclusion, we reveal that treatment with an HDAC6 inhibitor induces tonic enkephalin-DOR signaling in peripheral sensory neurons to suppress mechanical hypersensitivity.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Over one-fourth of cancer survivors suffer from intractable painful chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN), which can last for months to years after treatment ends. HDAC6 inhibition is a novel strategy to reverse CIPN without negatively interfering with tumor growth, but the mechanisms responsible for persistent reversal are not well understood. We built on evidence that the endogenous opioid system contributes to the spontaneous, apparent resolution of pain caused by nerve damage or inflammation, referred to as latent sensitization. We show that blocking the  opioid receptor or its ligand enkephalin unmasks CIPN in mice treated with an HDAC6 inhibitor (latent sensitization). Our work provides insight into the mechanisms by which treatment with an HDAC6 inhibitor apparently reverses CIPN.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">A Gap-Junction Mutation Reveals That Outer Hair Cell Extracellular Receptor Potentials Drive High-Frequency Cochlear Amplification</a></h4>

              
                <p>Cochlear amplification enables the enormous dynamic range of hearing through amplifying cochlear responses to low- to moderate-level sounds and compressing them to loud sounds. Amplification is attributed to voltage-dependent electromotility of mechanosensory outer hair cells (OHCs) driven by changing voltages developed across their cell membranes. At low frequencies, these voltage changes are dominated by intracellular receptor potentials (RPs). However, OHC membranes have electrical low-pass filter properties that attenuate high-frequency RPs, which should potentially attenuate amplification of high-frequency cochlear responses and impede high-frequency hearing. We made <I>in vivo</I> intracellular and extracellular electrophysiological measurements from the organ of Corti of male and female mice of the CBA/J strain, with excellent high-frequency hearing, and from the CD-1 mouse strain, which has sensitive hearing below 12 kHz but loses high-frequency hearing within a few weeks postpartum. The CD-1 mouse strain was transfected with an A88V mutation of the connexin 30 gap-junction protein. By blocking the action of the GJ protein to reduce input resistance, the mutation increased the OHC extracellular RP (ERP) magnitude and rescued high-frequency hearing. However, by increasing the organ of Corti resistance, the mutation rescued high-frequency hearing through preserving the OHC extracellular RP (ERP) magnitude. We measured the voltage developed across the basolateral membranes of OHCs, which controls their electromotility, for low- to high-frequency sounds in male and female mice of the CD-1 strain that expressed the A88V mutation. We demonstrate that ERPs, not RPs, drive OHC motility and cochlear amplification at high frequencies because at high frequencies, ERPs are not frequency attenuated, exceed RPs in magnitude, and are appropriately timed to provide cochlear amplification.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Cochlear amplification, which enables the enormous dynamic range of hearing, is attributed to voltage-dependent electromotility of the mechanosensory outer hair cells (OHCs) driven by sound-induced voltage changes across their membranes. OHC intracellular receptor potentials are electrically low-pass filtered, which should hinder high-frequency hearing. We measured the intracellular and extracellular voltages that control OHC electromotility <I>in vivo</I> in a mouse strain with impaired high-frequency hearing. A gap-junction mutation of the strain rescued high-frequency hearing, increased organ of Corti resistance, and preserved large OHC extracellular receptor potentials but reduced OHC intracellular receptor potentials and impaired low-frequency hearing. We concluded intracellular potentials drive OHC motility at low frequencies and extracellular receptor potentials drive OHC motility and cochlear amplification at high frequencies.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Somatotopy of Mouse Spinothalamic Innervation and the Localization of a Noxious Stimulus Requires Deleted in Colorectal Carcinoma Expression by Phox2a Neurons</a></h4>

              
                <p>Anterolateral system (AS) neurons transmit pain signals from the spinal cord to the brain. Their morphology, anatomy, and physiological properties have been extensively characterized and suggest that specific AS neurons and their brain targets are concerned with the discriminatory aspects of noxious stimuli, such as their location or intensity, and their motivational/emotive dimension. Among the recently unraveled molecular markers of AS neurons is the developmentally expressed transcription factor Phox2a, providing us with the opportunity to selectively disrupt the embryonic wiring of AS neurons to gain insights into the logic of their adult function. As mice with a spinal-cord-specific loss of the netrin-1 receptor deleted in colorectal carcinoma (DCC) have increased AS neuron innervation of ipsilateral brain targets and defective noxious stimulus localization or topognosis, we generated mice of either sex carrying a deletion of <I>Dcc</I> in Phox2a neurons. Such <I>Dcc<sup>Phox2a</sup></I> mice displayed impaired topognosis along the rostrocaudal axis but with little effect on left-right discrimination and normal aversive responses. Anatomical tracing experiments in <I>Dcc<sup>Phox2a</sup></I> mice revealed defective targeting of cervical and lumbar AS axons within the thalamus. Furthermore, genetic labeling of AS axons revealed their expression of DCC on their arrival in the brain, at a time when many of their target neurons are being born and express <I>Ntn1</I>. Our experiments suggest a postcommissural crossing function for netrin-1:DCC signaling during the formation of somatotopically ordered maps and are consistent with a discriminatory function of some of the Phox2a AS neurons.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> How nociceptive (pain) signals are relayed from the body to the brain remains an important question relevant to our understanding of the basic physiology of pain perception. Previous studies have demonstrated that the AS is a main effector of this function. It is composed of AS neurons located in the spinal cord that receive signals from nociceptive sensory neurons that detect noxious stimuli. In this study, we generate a genetic miswiring of mouse AS neurons that results in a decreased ability to perceive the location of a painful stimulus. The precise nature of this defect sheds light on the function of different kinds of AS neurons and how pain information may be organized.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Activity-Induced Cortical Glutamatergic Neuron Nascent Proteins</a></h4>

              
                <p>Neuronal activity initiates signaling cascades that culminate in diverse outcomes including structural and functional neuronal plasticity, and metabolic changes. While studies have revealed activity-dependent neuronal cell type-specific transcriptional changes, unbiased quantitative analysis of cell-specific activity-induced dynamics in newly synthesized proteins (NSPs) synthesis <I>in vivo</I> has been complicated by cellular heterogeneity and a relatively low abundance of NSPs within the proteome in the brain. Here we combined targeted expression of mutant MetRS (methionine tRNA synthetase) in genetically defined cortical glutamatergic neurons with tight temporal control of treatment with the noncanonical amino acid, azidonorleucine, to biotinylate NSPs within a short period after pharmacologically induced seizure in male and female mice. By purifying peptides tagged with heavy or light biotin-alkynes and using direct tandem mass spectrometry detection of biotinylated peptides, we quantified activity-induced changes in cortical glutamatergic neuron NSPs. Seizure triggered significant changes in ~300 NSPs, 33% of which were decreased by seizure. Proteins mediating excitatory and inhibitory synaptic plasticity, including SynGAP1, Pak3, GEPH1, Copine-6, and collybistin, and DNA and chromatin remodeling proteins, including Rad21, Smarca2, and Ddb1, are differentially synthesized in response to activity. Proteins likely to play homeostatic roles in response to activity, such as regulators of proteastasis, intracellular ion control, and cytoskeleton remodeling proteins, are activity induced. Conversely, seizure decreased newly synthetized NCAM, among others, suggesting that seizure induced degradation. Overall, we identified quantitative changes in the activity-induced nascent proteome from genetically defined cortical glutamatergic neurons as a strategy to discover downstream mediators of neuronal plasticity and generate hypotheses regarding their function.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Activity-induced neuronal and synaptic plasticity are mediated by changes in the protein landscape, including changes in the activity-induced newly synthesized proteins; however, identifying neuronal cell type-specific nascent proteome dynamics in the intact brain has been technically challenging. We conducted an unbiased proteomic screen from which we identified significant activity-induced changes in ~300 newly synthesized proteins in genetically defined cortical glutamatergic neurons within 20 h after pharmacologically induced seizure. Bioinformatic analysis of the dynamic nascent proteome indicates that the newly synthesized proteins play diverse roles in excitatory and inhibitory synaptic plasticity, chromatin remodeling, homeostatic mechanisms, and proteasomal and metabolic functions, extending our understanding of the diversity of plasticity mechanisms.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Visual Deprivation Selectively Reduces Thalamic Reticular Nucleus-Mediated Inhibition of the Auditory Thalamus in Adults</a></h4>

              
                <p>Sensory loss leads to widespread cross-modal plasticity across brain areas to allow the remaining senses to guide behavior. While multimodal sensory interactions are often attributed to higher-order sensory areas, cross-modal plasticity has been observed at the level of synaptic changes even across primary sensory cortices. In particular, vision loss leads to widespread circuit adaptation in the primary auditory cortex (A1) even in adults. Here we report using mice of both sexes in which cross-modal plasticity occurs even earlier in the sensory-processing pathway at the level of the thalamus in a modality-selective manner. A week of visual deprivation reduced inhibitory synaptic transmission from the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) to the primary auditory thalamus (MGBv) without changes to the primary visual thalamus (dLGN). The plasticity of TRN inhibition to MGBv was observed as a reduction in postsynaptic gain and short-term depression. There was no observable plasticity of the cortical feedback excitatory synaptic transmission from the primary visual cortex to dLGN or TRN and A1 to MGBv, which suggests that the visual deprivation-induced plasticity occurs predominantly at the level of thalamic inhibition. We provide evidence that visual deprivation-induced change in the short-term depression of TRN inhibition to MGBv involves endocannabinoid CB1 receptors. TRN inhibition is considered critical for sensory gating, selective attention, and multimodal performances; hence, its plasticity has implications for sensory processing. Our results suggest that selective disinhibition and altered short-term dynamics of TRN inhibition in the spared thalamic nucleus support cross-modal plasticity in the adult brain.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Losing vision triggers adaptation of the brain to enhance the processing of the remaining senses, which can be observed as better auditory performance in blind subjects. We previously found that depriving vision of adult rodents produces widespread circuit reorganization in the primary auditory cortex and enhances auditory processing at a neural level. Here we report that visual deprivation-induced plasticity in adults occurs much earlier in the auditory pathway, at the level of thalamic inhibition. Sensory processing is largely gated at the level of the thalamus via strong cortical feedback inhibition mediated through the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN). We found that TRN inhibition of the auditory thalamus is selectively reduced by visual deprivation, thus playing a role in adult cross-modal plasticity.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Cortical Ripples during NREM Sleep and Waking in Humans</a></h4>

              
                <p>Hippocampal ripples index the reconstruction of spatiotemporal neuronal firing patterns essential for the consolidation of memories in the cortex during non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREM). Recently, cortical ripples in humans have been shown to enfold the replay of neuron firing patterns during cued recall. Here, using intracranial recordings from 18 patients (12 female), we show that cortical ripples also occur during NREM in humans, with similar density, oscillation frequency (~90 Hz), duration, and amplitude to waking. Ripples occurred in all cortical regions with similar characteristics, unrelated to putative hippocampal connectivity, and were less dense and robust in higher association areas. Putative pyramidal and interneuron spiking phase-locked to cortical ripples during NREM, with phase delays consistent with ripple generation through pyramidal&ndash;interneuron feedback. Cortical ripples were smaller in amplitude than hippocampal ripples but were similar in density, frequency, and duration. Cortical ripples during NREM typically occurred just before the upstate peak, often during spindles. Upstates and spindles have previously been associated with memory consolidation, and we found that cortical ripples grouped cofiring between units within the window of spike timing-dependent plasticity. Thus, human NREM cortical ripples are as follows: ubiquitous and stereotyped with a tightly focused oscillation frequency; similar to hippocampal ripples; associated with upstates and spindles; and associated with unit cofiring. These properties are consistent with cortical ripples possibly contributing to memory consolidation and other functions during NREM in humans.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> In rodents, hippocampal ripples organize replay during sleep to promote memory consolidation in the cortex, where ripples also occur. However, evidence for cortical ripples in human sleep is limited, and their anatomic distribution and physiological properties are unexplored. Here, using human intracranial recordings, we demonstrate that ripples occur throughout the cortex during waking and sleep with highly stereotyped characteristics. During sleep, cortical ripples tend to occur during spindles on the down-to-upstate transition, and thus participate in a sequence of sleep waves that is important for consolidation. Furthermore, cortical ripples organize single-unit spiking with timing optimal to facilitate plasticity. Therefore, cortical ripples in humans possess essential physiological properties to support memory and other cognitive functions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Retrosplenial and Hippocampal Synchrony during Retrieval of Old Memories in Macaques</a></h4>

              
                <p>Memory for events from the distant past relies on multiple brain regions, but little is known about the underlying neural dynamics that give rise to such abilities. We recorded neural activity in the hippocampus and retrosplenial cortex of two female rhesus macaques as they visually selected targets in year-old and newly acquired object-scene associations. Whereas hippocampal activity was unchanging with memory age, the retrosplenial cortex responded with greater magnitude alpha oscillations (10&ndash;15 Hz) and greater phase locking to memory-guided eye movements during retrieval of old events. A similar old-memory enhancement was observed in the anterior cingulate cortex but in a beta2/gamma band (28&ndash;35 Hz). In contrast, remote retrieval was associated with decreased gamma-band synchrony between the hippocampus and each neocortical area. The increasing retrosplenial alpha oscillation and decreasing hippocampocortical synchrony with memory age may signify a shift in frank memory allocation or, alternatively, changes in selection among distributed memory representations in the primate brain.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Memory depends on multiple brain regions, whose involvement is thought to change with time. Here, we recorded neuronal population activity from the hippocampus and retrosplenial cortex as nonhuman primates searched for objects embedded in scenes. These memoranda were either newly presented or a year old. Remembering old material drove stronger oscillations in the retrosplenial cortex and led to a greater locking of neural activity to search movements. Remembering new material revealed stronger oscillatory synchrony between the hippocampus and retrosplenial cortex. These results suggest that with age, memories may come to rely more exclusively on neocortical oscillations for retrieval and search guidance and less on long-range coupling with the hippocampus.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Structure-Function Dissociations of Human Hippocampal Subfield Stiffness and Memory Performance</a></h4>

              
                <p>Aging and neurodegenerative diseases lead to decline in thinking and memory ability. The subfields of the hippocampus (HCsf) play important roles in memory formation and recall. Imaging techniques sensitive to the underlying HCsf tissue microstructure can reveal unique structure&ndash;function associations and their vulnerability in aging and disease. The goal of this study was to use magnetic resonance elastography (MRE), a noninvasive MR imaging-based technique that can quantitatively image the viscoelastic mechanical properties of tissue to determine the associations of HCsf stiffness with different cognitive domains across the lifespan. Eighty-eight adult participants completed the study (age 23&ndash;81 years, male/female 36/51), in which we aimed to determine which HCsf regions most strongly correlated with different memory performance outcomes and if viscoelasticity of specific HCsf regions mediated the relationship between age and performance. Our results revealed that both interference cost on a verbal memory task and relational memory task performance were significantly related to cornu ammonis 1&ndash;2 (CA1&ndash;CA2) stiffness (<I>p</I> = 0.018 and <I>p</I> = 0.011, respectively), with CA1&ndash;CA2 stiffness significantly mediating the relationship between age and interference cost performance (<I>p</I> = 0.031). There were also significant associations between delayed free verbal recall performance and stiffness of both the dentate gyrus&ndash;cornu ammonis 3 (DG&ndash;CA3; <I>p</I> = 0.016) and subiculum (SUB; <I>p</I> = 0.032) regions. This further exemplifies the functional specialization of HCsf in declarative memory and the potential use of MRE measures as clinical biomarkers in assessing brain health in aging and disease.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Hippocampal subfields are cytoarchitecturally unique structures involved in distinct aspects of memory processing. Magnetic resonance elastography is a technique that can noninvasively image tissue viscoelastic mechanical properties, potentially serving as sensitive biomarkers of aging and neurodegeneration related to functional outcomes. High-resolution <I>in vivo</I> imaging has invigorated interest in determining subfield functional specialization and their differential vulnerability in aging and disease. Applying MRE to probe subfield-specific cognitive correlates will indicate that measures of subfield stiffness can determine the integrity of structures supporting specific domains of memory performance. These findings will further validate our high-resolution MRE method and support the potential use of subfield stiffness measures as clinical biomarkers in classifying aging and disease states.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">History of Previous Midlife Estradiol Treatment Permanently Alters Interactions of Brain Insulin-like Growth Factor-1 Signaling and Hippocampal Estrogen Synthesis to Enhance Cognitive Aging in a Rat Model of Menopause</a></h4>

              
                <p>Across species, including humans, elevated levels of brain estrogen receptor (ER) &alpha; are associated with enhanced cognitive aging, even in the absence of circulating estrogens. In rodents, short-term estrogen treatment, such as that commonly used in the menopausal transition, results in long-term increases in ER&alpha; levels in the hippocampus, leading to enhanced memory long after termination of estrogen treatment. However, mechanisms by which increased levels of brain ER&alpha; enhances cognitive aging remain unclear. Here we demonstrate in aging female rats that insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), which can activate ER via ligand-independent mechanisms, requires concomitant synthesis of brain-derived neuroestrogens to phosphorylate ER&alpha; via MAPK signaling, ultimately resulting in enhanced memory. In a rat model of menopause involving long-term ovarian hormone deprivation, hippocampal neuroestrogen activity decreases, altering IGF-1 activity and resulting in impaired memory. However, this process is reversed by short-term estradiol treatment. Forty days of estradiol exposure following ovariectomy results in maintenance of neuroestrogen levels that persist beyond the period of hormone treatment, allowing for continued interactions between IGF-1 and neuroestrogen signaling, elevated levels of hippocampal ER&alpha;, and ultimately enhanced memory. Collectively, results demonstrate that short-term estradiol use following loss of ovarian function has long-lasting effects on hippocampal function and memory by dynamically regulating cellular mechanisms that promote activity of ER&alpha; in the absence of circulating estrogens. Translational impacts of these findings suggest lasting cognitive benefits of short-term estrogen use near menopause and highlight the importance of hippocampal ER&alpha;, independent from the role of circulating estrogens, in regulating memory in aging females.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Declines in ovarian hormones following menopause coincide with increased risk of cognitive decline. Because of potential health risks, current recommendations are that menopausal estrogen therapy be limited to a few years. Long-term consequences for the brain and memory of this short-term midlife estrogen therapy are unclear. Here, in a rodent model of menopause, we determined mechanisms by which short-term midlife estrogen exposure can enhance hippocampal function and memory with cognitive benefits and molecular changes enduring long after termination of estrogen exposure. Our model indicates long-lasting benefits of maintaining hippocampal estrogen receptor function in the absence of ongoing estrogen exposure and suggests potential strategies for combating age-related cognitive decline.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">CBP Is Required for Establishing Adaptive Gene Programs in the Adult Mouse Brain</a></h4>

              
                <p>Environmental factors and life experiences impinge on brain circuits triggering adaptive changes. Epigenetic regulators contribute to this neuroadaptation by enhancing or suppressing specific gene programs. The paralogous transcriptional coactivators and lysine acetyltransferases CREB binding protein (CBP) and p300 are involved in brain plasticity and stimulus-dependent transcription, but their specific roles in neuroadaptation are not fully understood. Here we investigated the impact of eliminating either CBP or p300 in excitatory neurons of the adult forebrain of mice from both sexes using inducible and cell type-restricted knock-out strains. The elimination of CBP, but not p300, reduced the expression and chromatin acetylation of plasticity genes, dampened activity-driven transcription, and caused memory deficits. The defects became more prominent in elderly mice and in paradigms that involved enduring changes in transcription, such as kindling and environmental enrichment, in which CBP loss interfered with the establishment of activity-induced transcriptional and epigenetic changes in response to stimulus or experience. These findings further strengthen the link between CBP deficiency in excitatory neurons and etiopathology in the nervous system.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> How environmental conditions and life experiences impinge on mature brain circuits to elicit adaptive responses that favor the survival of the organism remains an outstanding question in neurosciences. Epigenetic regulators are thought to contribute to neuroadaptation by initiating or enhancing adaptive gene programs. In this article, we examined the role of CREB binding protein (CBP) and p300, two paralogous transcriptional coactivators and histone acetyltransferases involved in cognitive processes and intellectual disability, in neuroadaptation in adult hippocampal circuits. Our experiments demonstrate that CBP, but not its paralog p300, plays a highly specific role in the epigenetic regulation of neuronal plasticity gene programs in response to stimulus and provide unprecedented insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying neuroadaptation.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Peripheral Auditory Nerve Impairment in a Mouse Model of Syndromic Autism</a></h4>

              
                <p>Dysfunction of the peripheral auditory nerve (AN) contributes to dynamic changes throughout the central auditory system, resulting in abnormal auditory processing, including hypersensitivity. Altered sound sensitivity is frequently observed in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), suggesting that AN deficits and changes in auditory information processing may contribute to ASD-associated symptoms, including social communication deficits and hyperacusis. The MEF2C transcription factor is associated with risk for several neurodevelopmental disorders, and mutations or deletions of <I>MEF2C</I> produce a haploinsufficiency syndrome characterized by ASD, language, and cognitive deficits. A mouse model of this syndromic ASD (<I>Mef2c</I>-Het) recapitulates many of the <I>MEF2C</I> haploinsufficiency syndrome-linked behaviors, including communication deficits. We show here that <I>Mef2c</I>-Het mice of both sexes exhibit functional impairment of the peripheral AN and a modest reduction in hearing sensitivity. We find that MEF2C is expressed during development in multiple AN and cochlear cell types; and in <I>Mef2c</I>-Het mice, we observe multiple cellular and molecular alterations associated with the AN, including abnormal myelination, neuronal degeneration, neuronal mitochondria dysfunction, and increased macrophage activation and cochlear inflammation. These results reveal the importance of MEF2C function in inner ear development and function and the engagement of immune cells and other non-neuronal cells, which suggests that microglia/macrophages and other non-neuronal cells might contribute, directly or indirectly, to AN dysfunction and ASD-related phenotypes. Finally, our study establishes a comprehensive approach for characterizing AN function at the physiological, cellular, and molecular levels in mice, which can be applied to animal models with a wide range of human auditory processing impairments.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> This is the first report of peripheral auditory nerve (AN) impairment in a mouse model of human <I>MEF2C</I> haploinsufficiency syndrome that has well-characterized ASD-related behaviors, including communication deficits, hyperactivity, repetitive behavior, and social deficits. We identify multiple underlying cellular, subcellular, and molecular abnormalities that may contribute to peripheral AN impairment. Our findings also highlight the important roles of immune cells (e.g., cochlear macrophages) and other non-neuronal elements (e.g., glial cells and cells in the stria vascularis) in auditory impairment in ASD. The methodological significance of the study is the establishment of a comprehensive approach for evaluating peripheral AN function and impact of peripheral AN deficits with minimal hearing loss.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Loss of Activity-Induced Mitochondrial ATP Production Underlies the Synaptic Defects in a Drosophila Model of ALS</a></h4>

              
                <p>Mutations in the gene encoding vesicle-associated membrane protein B (VAPB) cause a familial form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Expression of an ALS-related variant of <I>vapb</I> (<I>vapb<sup>P58S</sup></I>) in <I>Drosophila</I> motor neurons results in morphologic changes at the larval neuromuscular junction (NMJ) characterized by the appearance of fewer, but larger, presynaptic boutons. Although diminished microtubule stability is known to underlie these morphologic changes, a mechanism for the loss of presynaptic microtubules has been lacking. By studying flies of both sexes, we demonstrate the suppression of <I>vapb<sup>P58S</sup></I>-induced changes in NMJ morphology by either a loss of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca<sup>2+</sup> release channels or the inhibition Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin (CaM)-activated kinase II (CaMKII). These data suggest that decreased stability of presynaptic microtubules at <I>vapb<sup>P58S</sup></I> NMJs results from hyperactivation of CaMKII because of elevated cytosolic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]. We attribute the Ca<sup>2+</sup> dyshomeostasis to delayed extrusion of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Suggesting that this defect in Ca<sup>2+</sup> extrusion arose from an insufficient response to the bioenergetic demand of neural activity, depolarization-induced mitochondrial ATP production was diminished in <I>vapb<sup>P58S</sup></I> neurons. These findings point to bioenergetic dysfunction as a potential cause for the synaptic defects in <I>vapb<sup>P58S</sup></I>-expressing motor neurons.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Whether the synchrony between the rates of ATP production and demand is lost in degenerating neurons remains poorly understood. We report that expression of a gene equivalent to an amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)-causing variant of vesicle-associated membrane protein B (VAPB) in fly neurons decouples mitochondrial ATP production from neuronal activity. Consequently, levels of ATP in mutant neurons are unable to keep up with the bioenergetic burden of neuronal activity. Reduced rate of Ca<sup>2+</sup> extrusion, which could result from insufficient energy to power Ca<sup>2+</sup> ATPases, results in the accumulation of residual Ca<sup>2+</sup> in mutant neurons and leads to alterations in synaptic vesicle (SV) release and synapse development. These findings suggest that synaptic defects in a model of ALS arise from the loss of activity-induced ATP production.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">SARS-CoV-2 and the role of airborne transmission: a systematic review [version 3; peer review: 1 approved with reservations, 2 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Airborne transmission is the spread of an infectious agent caused by the dissemination of droplet nuclei (aerosols) that remain infectious when suspended in the air. We carried out a systematic review to identify, appraise and summarise the evidence from studies of the role of airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Methods: We searched LitCovid, MedRxiv, Google Scholar and the WHO Covid-19 database from 1 February 2020 to 30 May 2022 and included studies on airborne transmission. Data were dual extracted, and we assessed quality using a modified QUADAS 2 risk of bias tool. Results: We included 128 primary studies and 29 reviews on airborne SARS-CoV-2. Of the 128 primary studies, 105 (82%) reported data on RT-PCR from air samples, 28 (22%) report cycle threshold values and 36 (28%) copies per sample volume. All primary studies were observational. The research often lacked standard methods, standard sampling sizes and reporting items. We found 69 descriptions of different air samplers deployed. Of the 80 in-hospital studies that reported binary RT-PCR tests, 362/3079 air samples from 75 studies conducted in hospital ward environments were positive (median 8%, IQR=0 to 23%); 23 studies reported 74/703 RT-PCR positive air samples in the ICU setting (median 17%, IQR=0% to 38%) Thirty-eight studies reported potential air transmission in the outdoors or in the community. Twenty-six studies attempted viral culture, none of which definitively demonstrated that replication-competent SARS-CoV-2 could be recovered in the air. Conclusion:  SARS-CoV-2 RNA is detectable intermittently in the air in various settings. Standardized guidelines for conducting and reporting research on airborne transmission are needed. The lack of recoverable viral culture of SARS-CoV-2 from air samples prevents firm conclusions about the definitive role of airborne transmission in SARS-CoV-2.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Hypoxic preconditioning promotes survival of human adipose derived mesenchymal stem cell via expression of prosurvival and proangiogenic biomarkers [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Contributing factors for improved survival of human adipose derived mesenchymal stem cells (h-AMSCs) cultured through hypoxia preconditioning, in example apoptosis inhibition involving BCL2 and HSP27 expression, trigger signal expression (VEGF), SCF expression, OCT-4 expression, and CD44+ expression. The objective if this study was to explain the mechanism and role of hypoxic preconditioning and the optimal duration of hypoxic preconditioning exposure to improve survival of h-AMSCs. Methods: An experimental laboratory explorative study (in vitro) with hypoxic preconditioning in h-AMSCs cultures. This research was conducted through four stages. First, isolation of h-AMSCs culture from adipose tissue of patients. Second, the characterization of h-AMSCs from adipose tissue by phenotype (flowcytometry) through CD44+, CD90+ and CD45-expression before being pre-conditioned for hypoxic treatment. Third, the hypoxic preconditioning in h-AMSCs culture (in vitro) was performed with an oxygen concentration of 1% for 24, 48 and 72 hours. Fourth, observation of survival from h-AMSCs culture was tested on the role of CD44+, VEGF, SCF, OCT-4, BCL2, HSP27 with Flowcytometry and apoptotic inhibition by Tunnel Assay method. Results: The result of regression test showed that time difference had an effect on VEGF expression (p<0.001;β=-0.482) and hypoxia condition also influenced VEGF expression (p<0.001;β=0.774). The result of path analysis showed that SCF had effect on OCT-4 expression (p<0.001; β=0.985). The regression test results showed that time effects on HSP27 expression (p<0.001; β=0.398) and hypoxia precondition also affects HSP27 expression (p<0.001; β=0.847). Pathway analysis showed that BCL2 expression inhibited apoptosis (p=0.030; β=-0.442) and HSP27 expression also inhibited apoptosis (p<0,001;β=-0.487). Conclusion: Hypoxic preconditioning of h-AMSC culture has proven to increase the expression of VEGF, SCF, OCT-4, and BCL2 and HSP27. This study demonstrated and explained the existence of a new mechanism of increased h-AMSC survival in cultures with hypoxic preconditioning (O2 1%) via VEGF, SCF, OCT-4, BCL2, and HSP 27.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The effect of the scale of grant scoring on ranking accuracy [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                In this study we quantify the accuracy of scoring the quality of research grants using a finite set of distinct categories (1, 2, …., k), when the unobserved grant score is a continuous random variable comprising a true quality score and measurement error, both normally distributed. We vary the number of categories, the number of assessors that score the same grant and a signal-to-noise ratio parameter. We show that the loss of information of scoring a small number of categories (k > 5) compared to scoring on a continuous scale is very small, so that increasing the number of scoring categories is unlikely to lead to an improvement in the outcomes of scoring systems. In addition, we model the effect of grant assessors scoring too close to the mean and show that this results in only a very small reduction in the accuracy of scoring.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Chemical equilibrium model comprising calcaneus bone mineral density, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and physical work capacity in premenopausal women [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: During menopause, bone density decreases, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) rapidly increases; a decrease in the estrogen level is a common factor in these phenomena. Methods: In this study, we focused on the fact that menopause is a spontaneous process, and aimed to derive the conditions that mitigate the decline in the osteo sono-assessment index (OSI), an index of bone mineral density (BMD), using a chemical equilibrium model. We attempted to establish the relationship between variables related to female hormone secretion (OSI, LDL-C) and a variable related to work capacity (physical work capacity [PWC] at 75% of maximal heart rate) by analogy, using the fact that Gibbs free energy, a thermodynamic variable related to spontaneous change, is related by three variables. Results: Consequently, if linearity is established between PWC and OSI when LDL-C is used as the standard, then the analogy of chemical equilibrium can be established between the deviation values of these three variables, with equilibrium constant K. Finally, the theoretically determined equilibrium model with constant K was applied to data obtained from the Sports Program Service (SPS) of the Yokohama Sports Medical Center. Conclusions: The present study suggests that the decrease in bone density could be alleviated by promoting an increase in LDL-C or by mitigating the decrease in PWC. In discussing personal health, mitigating bone density loss and maintaining a high work capacity are important components, which should also take into account the appropriate levels of LDL-C.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">DPCfam: Unsupervised protein family classification by Density Peak Clustering of large sequence datasets</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Elena Tea Russo, Federico Barone, Alex Bateman, Stefano Cozzini, Marco Punta, Alessandro Laio</p>

Proteins that are known only at a sequence level outnumber those with an experimental characterization by orders of magnitude. Classifying protein regions (domains) into homologous families can generate testable functional hypotheses for yet unannotated sequences. Existing domain family resources typically use at least some degree of manual curation: they grow slowly over time and leave a large fraction of the protein sequence space unclassified. We here describe automatic clustering by Density Peak Clustering of UniRef50 v. 2017_07, a protein sequence database including approximately 23M sequences. We performed a radical re-implementation of a pipeline we previously developed in order to allow handling millions of sequences and data volumes of the order of 3 TeraBytes. The modified pipeline, which we call DPCfam, finds ∼ 45,000 protein clusters in UniRef50. Our automatic classification is in close correspondence to the ones of the Pfam and ECOD resources: in particular, about 81% of medium-large Pfam families and 80% of ECOD families can be mapped to clusters generated by DPCfam. In addition, our protocol finds more than 14,000 clusters constituted of protein regions with no Pfam annotation, which are therefore candidates for representing novel protein families. These results are made available to the scientific community through a dedicated repository.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Integrated experimental-computational analysis of a HepaRG liver-islet microphysiological system for human-centric diabetes research</a></h4>

Microphysiological systems (MPS) are powerful tools for emulating human physiology and replicating disease progression <i>in vitro</i>. MPS could be better predictors of human outcome than current animal models, but mechanistic interpretation and <i>in vivo</i> extrapolation of the experimental results remain significant challenges. Here, we address these challenges using an integrated experimental-computational approach. This approach allows for <i>in silico</i> representation and predictions of glucose metabolism in a previously reported MPS with two organ compartments (liver and pancreas) connected in a closed loop with circulating medium. We developed a computational model describing glucose metabolism over 15 days of culture in the MPS. The model was calibrated on an experiment-specific basis using data from seven experiments, where HepaRG single-liver or liver-islet cultures were exposed to both normal and hyperglycemic conditions resembling high blood glucose levels in diabetes. The calibrated models reproduced the fast (i.e. hourly) variations in glucose and insulin observed in the MPS experiments, as well as the long-term (i.e. over weeks) decline in both glucose tolerance and insulin secretion. We also investigated the behaviour of the system under hypoglycemia by simulating this condition in <i>silico</i>, and the model could correctly predict the glucose and insulin responses measured in new MPS experiments. Last, we used the computational model to translate the experimental results to humans, showing good agreement with published data of the glucose response to a meal in healthy subjects. The integrated experimental-computational framework opens new avenues for future investigations toward disease mechanisms and the development of new therapies for metabolic disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Ab initio predictions for 3D structure and stability of single- and double-stranded DNAs in ion solutions</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Zi-Chun Mu, Ya-Lan Tan, Ben-Gong Zhang, Jie Liu, Ya-Zhou Shi</p>

The three-dimensional (3D) structure and stability of DNA are essential to understand/control their biological functions and aid the development of novel materials. In this work, we present a coarse-grained (CG) model for DNA based on the RNA CG model proposed by us, to predict 3D structures and stability for both dsDNA and ssDNA from the sequence. Combined with a Monte Carlo simulated annealing algorithm and CG force fields involving the sequence-dependent base-pairing/stacking interactions and an implicit electrostatic potential, the present model successfully folds 20 dsDNAs (≤52nt) and 20 ssDNAs (≤74nt) into the corresponding native-like structures just from their sequences, with an overall mean RMSD of 3.4Å from the experimental structures. For DNAs with various lengths and sequences, the present model can make reliable predictions on stability, e.g., for 27 dsDNAs with/without bulge/internal loops and 24 ssDNAs including pseudoknot, the mean deviation of predicted melting temperatures from the corresponding experimental data is only ~2.0°C. Furthermore, the model also quantificationally predicts the effects of monovalent or divalent ions on the structure stability of ssDNAs/dsDNAs.

                Background: The academic environment is critical for advancing knowledge through research and training of students who will serve as researchers, advocates, and leaders in the future, yet there is limited data on how the higher institution-based research enterprise is being impacted by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The current study examines the perceived and expected impact of COVID-19 on engaging in a higher education institution setting, particularly focusing on student engagement in research and conduct of human subject research (HSR). Method: The authors collected an online survey with faculty and staff in a large US university system focused on education, research, and service (6/8/2020-7/10/2020; N=709). The authors performed bivariate and multivariable logistic regression models to examine the differences in research impact by HSR. Results: The majority of survey respondents (i.e., faculty and staff from a large US university system) perceived and expected at least some impact of COVID-19 on research and reported the impact to be negative. Researchers reported increased challenges in recruiting students for research activities and providing research-related learning opportunities for students. While COVID-19 impacted both HSR and non-HSR, HSR investigators have been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic. Conclusions: Efforts are needed to further understand and overcome research challenges so that the university-based research environment can flourish for all researchers across disciplines and overcome the potentially lost learning opportunities for students. Lessons learned will help address future challenges to academic research activities and providing student research training.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=10974547&type=etoc&feed=rss">Arithmetic in the signing brain: Differences and similarities in arithmetic processing between deaf signers and hearing non‐signers</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Deaf signers and hearing non-signers have previously been shown to recruit partially different brain regions during simple arithmetic. In light of the triple code model, the differences were interpreted as relating to stronger recruitment of the verbal system of numerical processing, that is, left angular and inferior frontal gyrus, in hearing non-signers, and of the quantity system of numerical processing, that is, right horizontal intraparietal sulcus, for deaf signers. The main aim of the present study was to better understand similarities and differences in the neural correlates supporting arithmetic in deaf compared to hearing individuals. Twenty-nine adult deaf signers and 29 hearing non-signers were enrolled in an functional magnetic resonance imaging study of simple and difficult subtraction and multiplication. Brain imaging data were analyzed using whole-brain analysis, region of interest analysis, and functional connectivity analysis. Although the groups were matched on age, gender, and nonverbal intelligence, the deaf group performed generally poorer than the hearing group in arithmetic. Nevertheless, we found generally similar networks to be involved for both groups, the only exception being the involvement of the left inferior frontal gyrus. This region was activated significantly stronger for the hearing compared to the deaf group but showed stronger functional connectivity with the left superior temporal gyrus in the deaf, compared to the hearing, group. These results lend no support to increased recruitment of the quantity system in deaf signers. Perhaps the reason for performance differences is to be found in other brain regions not included in the original triple code model.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Fewer COVID‐19 neurological complications with dexamethasone and remdesivir</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To assess the impact of treatment with dexamethasone, remdesivir or both on neurological complications in acute COVID-19.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We used observational data from the International Severe Acute and emerging Respiratory Infection Consortium (ISARIC) WHO Clinical Characterisation Protocol UK (CCP-UK). Hospital inpatients aged ≥18 years with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection admitted between 31 January 2020 and 29 June 2021 were included. Treatment allocation was non-blinded and performed by reporting clinicians. A propensity scoring methodology was used to minimize confounding. Treatment with remdesivir, dexamethasone or both was assessed against standard of care. The primary outcome was a neurological complication occurring at the point of death, discharge, or resolution of the COVID-19 clinical episode.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Out of 89,297 hospital inpatients, 64,088 had severe COVID-19 and 25,209 had non-hypoxic COVID-19. Neurological complications developed in 4.8% and 4.5% respectively. In both groups, neurological complications associated with increased mortality, ICU admission, worse self-care on discharge and time to recovery. In severe COVID-19, treatment with dexamethasone (n=21,129), remdesivir (n=1,428) and both combined (n=10,846) associated with a lower frequency of neurological complications: OR=0.76 (95% CI=0.69-0.83), OR 0.69 (95% CI=0.51-0.90) and OR=0.54, (95% CI=0.47-0.61) respectively. In non-hypoxic COVID-19, dexamethasone (n=2,580) associated with less neurological complications (OR=0.78, 95% CI 0.62-0.97), while the dexamethasone/remdesivir combination (n=460) showed a similar trend (OR=0.63, 95% CI=0.31-1.15).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Treatment with dexamethasone, remdesivir or both in patients hospitalised with COVID-19 associated with a lower frequency of neurological complications in an additive manner, such that the greatest benefit was observed in patients who received both drugs together.</p>
