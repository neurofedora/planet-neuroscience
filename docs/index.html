<p>p75NTR expression in the brain of the basal vertebrate <i>Scyliorhinus canicula</i> revealed its conservation across species. Functional conservation among vertebrates was demonstrated (i) by performing the canonical PC-12 differentiation assay with the <i>S. canicula</i> NGF and (ii) by complementing the p75NTR absence in a PC-12 p75NTR<sup>−</sup>/<sup>−</sup> knock-out clone with the <i>S. canicula</i> p75NTR.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The p75NTR receptor, a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor superfamily, can participate in signaling pathways either by forming heteromeric complexes with other receptors, such as the Trk family (tropomyosin receptor kinases), or by functioning independently. p75NTR was investigated prevalently in the brain and retina of mammals, whereas almost nothing is known about its conservation among species. Here, we reconstructed the phylogenetic arb of p75NTR and described for the first time the p75NTR expression in the brain of the basal vertebrate Chondrichthyan <i>Scyliorhinus canicula</i> (<i>S. canicula</i>), uncovering the existing parallelism between ancient vertebrates and mammals. p75NTR functional conservation among vertebrates was further investigated by cloning the <i>S. canicula</i> nerve growth factor (NGF) and performing the canonical posterior commissure (PC)-12 differentiation assay, which results in standard neurite-like production. We then investigated the <i>S. canicula</i> p75NTR, which proves to be capable of complementing a specific clone of PC-12 lacking p75NTR (PC-12 p75NTR<sup>−</sup>/<sup>−</sup>). All together, our results highlighted the expression and functional conservation of p75NTR among vertebrates during the evolution.</p>

                Liu et al. reveal the functional and prognostic significance of THBS2, showing that THBS2 secreted by mCAFs binds to CD47 on tumor cells and activates MAPK-ERK5 signaling to drive tumor aggressiveness. They also identify CREB3L1 as a key regulator in the transformation of fibroblasts into THBS2-producing mCAFs.

                Objective: Digital representations of Purkinje cells from turtle cerebellum, which have long been to study cellular transmission dynamics and neuroplasticity, are necessary to conduct simulations of neuromodulation methods, including Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS). Methods: Data collected using microCT with 0.6 um isometric resolution are processed, segmented, and arranged to enable high resolution simulation via the Boundary Element Fast Multipole Method. Results: Fully computer aided design compatible, manifold triangular surface meshes were generated from microCT data and used to simulate cellular electromagnetic response to TMS. Conclusion: Accurate Purkinje cells may be readily generated and manipulated to create representative models of turtle cerebellum. Significance: The techniques employed herein may be used to generate accurate surface mesh of Purkinje cells which can enable computational electromagnetics code verification and serve as the basis for skeletal models used for bidomain biophysical simulations in tools such as NEURON to study neurostimulation dynamics and neuromodulation.

">A ketogenic diet mitigates hippocampal astrogliosis in epileptic brain</a></h4>

              
                The ketogenic diet (KD) is an established treatment for patients with medically intractable epilepsy and is chiefly characterized by high fat/low-carbohydrate intake and the production of ketone bodies (KB) such as {beta}-hydroxybutyrate (BHB). However, after more than a century of clinical use, the mechanisms underlying its efficacy remain unclear. While prior investigations have examined the effects of the KD and its metabolic substrates on synaptic transmission, few studies have explored a potential connection between astrocytic ion channels and seizure genesis. One essential function of astrocytes is spatial potassium buffering which influences passive potassium conductance (PPC), and when impaired, can result in neuronal hyperexcitability. In the present study, we demonstrate that the KD can mitigate hippocampal astrogliosis in the Kcna1-null (KO) mouse model of developmental epilepsy. Specifically, we observed a significant increase in GFAP expression in KO mice fed a control diet compared to wild-type (WT) mice, and that the KD prevented this change. Furthermore, we noted a reduction in hippocampal astrocytic PPC in epileptic mice, whereas KD-treated KO animals exhibited nearly normal passive conductance levels. In this regard, we found that while Kir4.1, TREK-1 and TWIK-1 RNA expression levels were not significantly altered by KD treatment in either WT or KO mice, BHB appeared to only minimally affect Kir4.1-mediated currents in transfected HEK cells. Furthermore, bulk RNA-seq analysis of the various treatment groups revealed KD-induced down-regulation of factors linked to hippocampal astrogliosis. Our findings indicate that the KD protects against epilepsy-associated astrogliosis and astrocytic PPC changes, underscoring a novel mechanism of action, and implicate extracellular potassium in its anti-seizure effects.

                <p>A decline in cognitive abilities is associated with the aging process, affecting nearly 33% of US adults over the age of 70, and is a risk factor for the development of dementia and Alzheimer's disease. Several studies have reported age-related alterations in the transcriptome in the hippocampus, a major site of memory storage that is among the first regions impacted with age, dementia, and Alzheimer's disease. However, much remains unknown about why these transcriptional changes exist in the aged hippocampus and how this impacts memory late in life. Here, we show that monoubiquitination of histone H2B (H2Bubi), an epigenetic mechanism recently reported to be major regulator of the epigenome and transcriptome during memory formation in the young adult brain, decreases with age in the hippocampus of male rats. In vivo CRISPR-dCas9&ndash;mediated upregulation of <I>Rnf20</I>, the only ubiquitin E3 ligase for H2B, in the hippocampus significantly improved memory retention in aged rats. Remarkably, RNA-seq analysis revealed that in addition to the 18 genes typically upregulated in the aged rat hippocampus following contextual fear conditioning, <I>Rnf20</I> upregulation caused learning-related increases and decreases in 40 and 11 unique genes, respectively, suggesting that these 51 genes may be among those most critical for improving memory in advanced age. Together, these data suggest that H2B monoubiquitination is a significant regulator of age-related dysregulation of the transcriptome and impairments in memory.</p>

                <p>Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor and nonmotor symptoms. Its pathological hallmarks include the accumulation of misfolded alpha-synuclein (&alpha;-Syn) in Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites. Phosphorylation of &alpha;-Syn is a prominent feature of these inclusions, but its role in disease pathogenesis remains unclear. To identify the role of &alpha;-Syn phosphorylation in synucleinopathy, we generated two <I>Snca</I> knock-in (KI) mouse models carrying phosphomimetic mutations at SncaY39 or SncaS129 (<I>Snca<sup>Y39E</sup></I> or <I>Snca<sup>S129D</sup></I>) which manipulated epitopes phosphorylated in the PD brain. Both <I>Snca<sup>Y39E</sup></I> and <I>Snca<sup>S129D</sup></I> KI mice displayed increased &alpha;-Syn phosphorylation, enhanced oligomer formation, and a shift of &alpha;-Syn localization from membrane-bound to cytoplasm. However, neurodegeneration in the substantia nigra was not observed up to 24&nbsp;months of age. These findings demonstrate that mimicking the phosphorylation of Y39 or S129 can induce endogenous &alpha;-Syn phosphorylation. Still, a single phosphomimetic mutation alone is insufficient to induce PD-like behavior and pathology in the mouse's lifespan. Overall, our study provides a mouse model for investigating the role of phosphorylation at Y39 and S129 &alpha;-Syn epitopes in vivo.</p>

                <p>by Jin Ke, Hayoung Song, Zihan Bai, Monica D. Rosenberg, Yuan Chang Leong</p>

Human affective experience varies along the dimensions of valence (positivity or negativity) and arousal (high or low activation). It remains unclear how these dimensions are represented in the brain and whether the representations are shared across different individuals and diverse situational contexts. In this study, we first utilized two publicly available functional MRI datasets of participants watching movies to build predictive models of moment-to-moment emotional arousal and valence from dynamic functional brain connectivity. We tested the models by predicting emotional arousal and valence both within and across datasets. Our results revealed a generalizable arousal representation characterized by the interactions between multiple large-scale functional networks. The arousal representation generalized to two additional movie-watching datasets with different participants viewing different movies. In contrast, we did not find evidence of a generalizable valence representation. Taken together, our findings reveal a generalizable representation of emotional arousal embedded in patterns of dynamic functional connectivity, suggesting a common underlying neural signature of emotional arousal across individuals and situational contexts. We have made our model and analysis scripts publicly available to facilitate its use by other researchers in decoding moment-to-moment emotional arousal in novel datasets, providing a new tool to probe affective experience using fMRI.

                <p>by Sander W Keemink, Mark CW van Rossum</p>

Throughout the brain information is coded in the activity of multiple neurons at once, so called population codes. Population codes are a robust and accurate way of coding information. One can evaluate the quality of population coding by trying to read out the code with a decoder, and estimate the encoded stimulus. In particular when neurons are noisy, coding accuracy has extensively been evaluated in terms of the trial-to-trial variation in the estimate. While most decoders yield unbiased estimators if neurons are actived, when only a few neurons are active, biases readily emerge. That is, even after averaging, a systematic difference between the true stimulus and its estimate remains. We characterize the shape of this bias for different encoding models (rectified cosine tuning and von Mises functions), show that it can be both attractive or repulsive for different stimulus values. Biases appear for maximum likelihood and Bayesian decoders. The biases have a non-trivial dependence on noise. We also introduce a technique to estimate the bias and variance of Bayesian least square decoders. The work is of interest to those studying neural populations with a few active neurons.

Epilepsy is a prevalent brain disorder, characterized by sudden, abnormal brain activity, making it difficult to live with. One-third of people with epilepsy do not respond to anti-epileptic drugs. Drug-resistant epilepsy is treated with brain surgery. Successful surgical treatment relies on identifying brain regions responsible for seizure onset, known as epileptogenic zones (EZ). Despite various methods for EZ estimation, evaluating their efficacy remains challenging due to a lack of ground truth for empirical data. To address this, we generated and evaluated a cohort of 30 virtual epilepsy patients, using patient-specific anatomical and functional data from 30 real drug-resistant epilepsy patients. This personalized modeling, based on the patient’s brain data, is called a virtual brain twin. For each virtual patient, we provided data that included anatomically parcellated brain regions, structural connectivity, reconstructed intracranial electrodes, simulated brain activity at both the brain region and electrode levels, and key parameters of the virtual brain twin. These key parameters, which include the EZ hypothesis, serve as the ground-truth for simulated brain activity. For each virtual brain twin, we generated synthetic spontaneous seizures, stimulation-induced seizures and interictal activity. We systematically evaluated these simulated brain signals by quantitatively comparing them against their corresponding empirical intracranial recordings. Simulated signals based on patient-specific EZ captured spatio-temporal seizure generation and propagation. Through in-silico exploration of stimulation parameters, we also demonstrated the role of patient-specific stimulation location and amplitude in reproducing empirically stimulated seizures. The virtual epileptic cohort is openly available, and can be directly used to systematically evaluate methods for the estimation of EZ or source localization using ground truth EZ parameters and source signals.

Phylodynamic analyses infer epidemiological parameters from pathogen genome sequences for enhanced genomic surveillance in public health. Pathogen genome sequences and their associated sampling dates are the essential data in every analysis. However, sampling dates are usually associated with hospitalisation or testing and can sometimes be used to identify individual patients, posing a threat to patient confidentiality. To lower this risk, sampling dates are often given with reduced date-resolution to the month or year, which can potentially bias inference. Here, we introduce a practical guideline on when date-rounding biases the inference of epidemiologically important parameters across a diverse range of empirical and simulated datasets. We show that the direction of bias varies for different parameters, datasets, and tree priors, while compounding with lower date-resolution and higher substitution rates. We also find that bias decreases for datasets with longer sampling intervals, implying that our guideline is most applicable to emerging datasets. We conclude by discussing future solutions that prioritise patient confidentiality and propose a method for safer sharing of sampling dates that translates them them uniformly by a random number.

                <p>by Hoyon Kim, Jamie C. Little, Jiashen Li, Bryna Patel, Daniel Kalderon</p>

Hedgehog (Hh) proteins elicit dose-dependent transcriptional responses by binding Patched receptors to activate transmembrane Smoothened (Smo) proteins. Activated Smo inhibits Ci/Gli transcription factor phosphorylation by Protein Kinase A and consequent proteolytic processing to repressor forms; it also promotes nuclear transport and activity of full-length Ci/Gli proteins to induce Hh target genes. Smo-activated Fused (Fu) kinase drives Ci activation in <i>Drosophila</i>, while Suppressor of Fused (Su(fu)) counters full-length Ci/Gli activity and stabilizes full-length Ci/Gli by direct binding to at least three surfaces. Here, we used CRISPR-generated designer <i>ci</i> alleles to investigate alterations to Fu phosphorylation sites and to regions around Ci–Su(fu) interfaces under physiological conditions in <i>Drosophila</i> imaginal wing discs. Surprisingly, we identified alterations that activate Ci without significant loss of stabilization by Su(fu) and contributions of multiple Fu target sites to Ci activation in the absence of Su(fu), suggesting that the affected sites mediate Ci activation by regulating Ci–Ci, rather than Ci–Su(fu) interactions. We propose that those interactions maintain full-length Ci in a closed conformation that also facilitates, and is stabilized by, cooperative Ci–Su(fu) binding. Access to binding partners necessary for Ci activation is promoted through phosphorylation of at least four Fu sites on Ci, likely by directly disrupting Ci–Ci contacts and one Ci–Su(fu) interface without substantial Ci–Su(fu) dissociation, contrary to previous proposals. We also found that the Ci binding partner, Costal 2 (Cos2), which silences Ci in the absence of Hh, can facilitate Ci activation by Fu kinase.

Multiple myeloma (MM) arises through oncogenic transformation of immunoglobulin-secreting plasma cells. MM often co-opts the central endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-stress mitigator, inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1), to sustain malignant growth. While certain MMs require enzymatic IRE1-dependent activation of the transcription factor XBP1s, others display a nonenzymatic IRE1 dependency that is not yet mechanistically understood. Here we identify interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4), which stimulates genes that promote immune-cell proliferation, as a key conduit for IRE1’s nonenzymatic control of cell-cycle progression in MM. IRE1 silencing increased inhibitory S114/S270 phosphorylation on IRF4, disrupting IRF4’s chromatin-binding and transcriptional activity. IRF4 knockdown recapitulated, whereas IRF4 repletion reversed the anti-proliferative phenotype of IRE1 silencing. Furthermore, phospho-deficient, but not phospho-mimetic, IRF4 mutants rescued proliferation under IRE1 silencing. Functional studies revealed that IRF4 engages the <i>E2F1</i> and <i>CDC25A</i> genes and promotes CDK2 activation to drive cell-cycle progression. Our results advance mechanistic understanding of IRE1 and IRF4 in MM.

Regulatory T cell (Treg) heterogeneity exists in lymphoid and non-lymphoid tissues, but we have limited understanding of context-dependent functions and spatiotemporal regulators of heterogenous Treg states, especially during perinatal life when immune tolerance is established. Here, we revealed that the class III PI3K Vps34 orchestrates effector Treg (eTreg) transitional heterogeneity during perinatal life. We found that loss of Vps34 reduced terminal eTreg accumulation in lymphoid tissues, associated with decreased Treg generation in non-lymphoid tissues and development of an early-onset autoimmune-like disease. After perinatal life, Vps34-deficient eTreg accumulation was further impaired due to reduced cell survival, highlighting temporal regulation of eTreg heterogeneity and maintenance by Vps34. Accordingly, inhibition of Vps34 in mature Tregs disrupted immune homeostasis but boosted anti-tumor immunity. Mechanistically, multiomics profiling approaches uncovered that Vps34-orchestrated transcriptional and epigenetic remodeling promotes terminal eTreg programming. Further, via genetic deletion of the Vps34-interacting proteins Atg14 or Uvrag in Tregs, we established that Atg14 but not Uvrag was required for the overall survival, but not terminal differentiation, of eTregs, suggesting that autophagy but not endocytosis partly contributed to Vps34-dependent effects. Accordingly, mice with Treg-specific loss of Atg14, but not Uvrag, had moderately disrupted immune homeostasis and reduced tumor growth, with Vps34- or Atg14-dependent gene signatures also being elevated in intratumoral Tregs from human cancer patients. Collectively, our study reveals distinct Vps34-orchestrated signaling events that regulate eTreg heterogeneity and functional adaptation and the pathophysiological consequences on autoimmunity versus anti-tumor immunity.

                <p><i>UNC13A</i> (rs12608932-CC) is associated with both amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and shortens survival in ALS.

Survival analyses were performed using Cox proportional hazard models in a recessive manner. Homozygosity for rs12608932-C in <i>UNC13A</i> was associated with a shorter survival compared with other genotypes (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.28, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.02–1.60, <i>p</i> = 0.033), which has implications for patient counselling and trial design.

                Background/Objectives The relation between TMD and posterior tooth loss is still up for debate and is a topic of constant discussion. The present study aimed to find a correlation between posterior teeth loss and TMJ disorder symptoms in adult patients. Methods A total of fifty patients were selected for the study. First, intra-oral dental examination recorded all missing posterior teeth, the teeth numbers, type of missing teeth (except third molars). All existing teeth are examined during the clinical examination to identify any odontogenic causes for pain if present. Second, patients were asked to fill in the Arabic-translated form of the DC/TMD Axis I symptom questionnaire. Third, the DC/TMD Axis II protocol was applied to each patient and the examination form was completed by the examiner during the clinical examination. Results Disc displacement with reduction is more likely to cause headache, pain, and clicking. A statistically significant positive correlation was found between age and the number of missing teeth. Furthermore, a statistically significant negative correlation was found between age and maximum unassisted mouth opening, and the number of missing teeth and maximum unassisted mouth opening. Logistics regression analysis showed clicking was significantly associated and 13.8 (OR) times more likely to have TMD. Conclusions The current study reported that patients with TMD are more likely to have pain, headache, clicking, and a decrease in maximum mouth opening. There was a correlation between clicking and TMJ disorder, and the number of tooth loss and TMJ disorder.

                Background The loss of cultural identity in the rural architecture of Rumicruz, Chimborazo, is a consequence of the adoption of generic models and unsustainable modern materials, which has affected thermal comfort and the connection with local traditions. This research proposes sustainable housing that combines vernacular and modern techniques, respecting both the environment and the community's needs. Method Based on a mixed approach (qualitative and quantitative), the architectural, social, and environmental context was analyzed through a field diagnosis, literature review and critical observation. During this process, problems related to thermal comfort, housing deterioration, and the use of inadequate materials were identified. The proposal includes the use of mudbrick, stone, and concrete blocks, complemented with solar heating systems and energy efficiency, significantly improving thermal comfort compared to traditional housing. Conclusions It is concluded that the proposal integrates cultural identity and sustainability, adapting traditional techniques to current demands. The bioclimatic analysis and design support the thermal comfort values, highlighting the relevance of designs adapted to the local context.

                Stroke disrupts brain structure, leading to long-term disabilities despite improved survival rates. Patients often face cognitive, sensory, and motor deficits, with incomplete spontaneous recovery. Early intervention is crucial, as significant motor improvements happen within three months, while cognitive enhancements may take months to years. Recently, the periosteal traction (PD) technique has gained traction in treating chronic lower limb ischemia, with speculation that it effectively promotes angiogenesis and tissue regeneration. This paper presents three cases of stroke patients managed with PD technology in the late chronic stage, showing significant functional improvements. PD treatment may restore brain function by enhancing neuroplasticity and improving blood flow in ischemic areas. Although results are promising, limitations include a small sample size and short follow-up, with further research needed to optimize treatment protocols and understand underlying mechanisms. In conclusion, PD shows good potential for functional recovery in stroke patients, warranting further basic and clinical studies to bolster its application.

Due to its heterogenous clinical presentation diagnosis uncertainties are common. In this paper we explore CJD diagnostic challenges focusing on differential diagnosis and diagnostic delays. Methods We report a case of a patient who was misclassified and evaluated by several medical specialties before the CJD suspicion. A systematic review of the literature of the CJD case reports focused on the timely and differential diagnosis was carried out in Medline and Embase until May 2023. Results Patient with diagnosis was made due to the form of presentation and clinical evolution, neuroimaging and the presence of protein 14-3-3. In systematic review, fifteen articles were selected, who reported 31 cases of CJD with problems in the timely diagnosis and incorrect initial diagnosis, the main initial differential diagnoses were psychiatry exacerbation, myelopathy, epilepsy, stroke, parkinsonism, cerebellar ataxia and autoimmune encephalitis. The most common clinical onset was psychobehavioral disturbances (apathy, confusion and sleep disturbance), extrapyramidal signs and cognitive impairment. The diagnosis delay was from one to eighteen months. Conclusion A discussion of the case report and the diagnostic challenges reported in the literature was made. Patients can present a wide range of symptoms. It is recommended to consider CJD for the differential diagnosis in patients with behavioral symptoms, and cognitive impairment.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-505/v2?src=rss">A phenomenological analysis of the emotional experiences of graduate preservice student teachers in Indonesia [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Addressing preservice teachers' emotions can help them develop the emotional connections necessary for successful teaching practicums and professional learning experiences. To understand preservice teachers’ emotions towards their surroundings, the researchers used an emotional geography framework to map out the source of their negative and positive emotions and how those feelings affect their beliefs, teaching style, and paradigms. Emotional geographies were divided into two categories (i.e., emotional distance and emotional closeness), which were further mapped into five major themes (i.e., sociocultural, moral, professional, physical, and political). This study aims to investigate the emotional geographies of graduate preservice teachers during their teaching practicums in Indonesia by adapting Hargreaves’ (2001) theoretical model, thereby identifying key dimensions and validating the adapted framework. Methods This study examined emotional geographies of 15 graduate preservice student teachers of Teacher Training and Education Faculty of Mulawarman University during their teaching practicums. Moreover, this study used a qualitative design involving semi-structured interviews with 15 graduate students who completed their teaching practicums. Results The participants experienced all emotional geographies (sociocultural, moral, professional, physical, and political) that reshaped their beliefs and teaching styles, especially related to teaching undergraduate students. These emotions are generally experienced when the participants deal with the students and cooperating teachers. Conclusions It was found that teachers needed to be strict when instilling discipline in their students, develop friendships with their students to maintain classroom control, and require comprehensive preparation to create teacher's confidence and answer their students' questions. In effect, the theoretical framework of emotional geography when teaching undergraduates during practicums gave student teachers valuable experience to cope with all common teaching challenges and professional growth.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-1183/v3?src=rss">The influence of the fourth industrial revolution in teaching and learning: the COVID-19 context [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background The aim of this paper was to explore how the Fourth Industrial Revolution shapes teaching and learning during COVID-19 in some of the schools located in the Gauteng and Mpumalanga provinces, South Africa. This paper employed qualitative interpretative multiple case study design. Purposive sampling was used to sample our participants. Methods We selected four teachers who taught at the early childhood development stage, intermediate phase, senior phase, and further education and training phases. Data was collected telephonically through semi-structured interviews with teachers from Limpopo, Gauteng and Mpumalanga provinces of South Africa. Data was collected from their experiences of COVID-19 from 2019 to 2021. Collected data was analysed using a typology approach whereby themes that derived from the literature reviewed and research questions were used. Results We inferred from the results of the paper that teachers had challenges with teaching and the availability of learning resources, such as limited access to the internet and socio-economic backgrounds, which hindered the integration of the Fourth Industrial Revolution in the teaching and learning process. There were also challenges related to teachers’ background on the usage of the Fourth Industrial Revolution and the lack of school management teams. The paper revealed that the integration of the Fourth Industrial Revolution in teaching and learning was affected negatively by the existence of the above-mentioned challenges, which need to be addressed. Conclusions Therefore, we recommended that the government and stakeholders within the education sector provide resources such as smart-boards, computers, and network access in schools lacking such facilities, as well as providing professional development interventions and training teachers to have an in-depth understanding of the Fourth Industrial Revolution within the teaching and learning context.

     alt="Quantitative MRI of the Spinal Cord and Brain in Chronic Traumatic Spinal Cord Injury: In Vivo Assessment of Structural Changes"/>
<p>The importance of precision rehabilitation plans for traumatic spinal cord injury (TSCI) patients is emphasized by their need for long-term survival strategies. Quantitative MRI assessments have shown that patients with chronic TSCI undergo distinct stages of neural structural changes, providing a basis for precision treatment in healthcare.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The prolonged survival of traumatic spinal cord injury (TSCI) patients underscores the need to customize rehabilitative treatment plans according to patients' characteristics, aiming to restore motor function. We conducted a cross-sectional study of two groups with chronic TSCI (short-term group: 11 patients with an injury time of 1–2 years; long-term group: 10 patients with an injury time &gt; 2 years) and 16 controls. Quantitative MRI was used to evaluate structural changes in the upper spinal cord and brain. Compared to controls, both groups exhibited decreased fractional anisotropy (close relationship of the decreased) in the spinal cord, and the long-term group showed reduced spinal cord cross-sectional areas. The short-term group presented increased gray matter volumes (GMVs) in the paracentral lobule, postcentral gyrus, and supplementary motor area, indicating compensatory neural changes, whereas the long-term group exhibited decreased GMV in cerebellar lobule VI, suggesting weakening of the signal received by the cerebellum. Track-based spatial statistics revealed the close relationship of the decreased FA was with the increased radial diffusivity in the long-term group, indicating that demyelination mainly altered the white matter. Correlation analysis revealed that the increased GMV was negatively correlated with the sensorimotor score (<i>r</i> = −0.725, <i>p</i> = 0.018). Additionally, the GMV of cerebellar lobule VI was positively correlated with the sensorimotor score (<i>r</i> = 0.671, <i>p</i> = 0.024). In summary, quantitative MRI identifies structural changes in the brain and spinal cord of patients with chronic TSCI that vary with the time since injury and provide imaging evidence for the development of precise targeted therapies.</p>

                Background Previous research has shown that popular names have become less popular over time. Simultaneously, accumulated evidence has indicated that names have become more diverse. However, the association between these two phenomena was unclear. This association should be revealed for a better understanding of names and naming practices. Therefore, this study investigated the relationship between the popularity and diversity of names. Methods I analyzed the data provided in a previous study in the U.K., which included complete records of all live births between 1996 and 2016 (N = 12,985,140). Results I found that the correlations between diversity and popularity indicators were highly negative, showing that they are conceptually strongly related. This means that when diversity is high, popularity is low. Conclusions Based on this study, we can predict one indicator from the other indicator. Because raw data on names are generally difficult to collect, this prediction is useful for understanding names and naming practices.

                So et al. investigate TFE3 fusion oncoproteins (FOs) in translocation renal cell carcinoma (tRCC) and find that TFE3 FOs form transcriptional condensates and drive tRCC progression. The structured coiled-coil domain of TFE3 FOs is essential for condensate formation, prolonging TFE3 FOs’ chromatin binding time and enhancing oncogenic transcription.

                Barthez et al. show that SIRT2 and NAD+ boosting protect against aging-associated severe COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2-induced inflammation is mediated by ORF3a, which triggers mtDNA release and cGAS activation. SIRT2 deacetylates cGAS and suppresses aging-associated cGAS activation and inflammation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95618">Diverging roles of TRPV1 and TRPM2 in warm-temperature detection</a></h4>

              
                The perception of innocuous temperatures is crucial for thermoregulation. The TRP ion channels TRPV1 and TRPM2 have been implicated in warmth detection, yet their precise roles remain unclear. A key challenge is the low prevalence of warmth-sensitive sensory neurons, comprising fewer than 10% of rodent dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. Using calcium imaging of &gt;20,000 cultured mouse DRG neurons, we uncovered distinct contributions of TRPV1 and TRPM2 to warmth sensitivity. TRPV1’s absence – and to a lesser extent absence of TRPM2 – reduces the number of neurons responding to warmth. Additionally, TRPV1 mediates the rapid, dynamic response to a warmth challenge. Behavioural tracking in a whole-body thermal preference assay revealed that these cellular differences shape nuanced thermal behaviours. Drift diffusion modelling of decision-making in mice exposed to varying temperatures showed that TRPV1 deletion impairs evidence accumulation, reducing the precision of thermal choice, while TRPM2 deletion increases overall preference for warmer environments that wildtype mice avoid. It remains unclear whether TRPM2 in DRG sensory neurons or elsewhere mediates thermal preference. Our findings suggest that different aspects of thermal information, such as stimulation speed and temperature magnitude, are encoded by distinct TRP channel mechanisms.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97334">Dynamic gamma modulation of hippocampal place cells predominates development of theta sequences</a></h4>

              
                The experience-dependent spatial cognitive process requires sequential organization of hippocampal neural activities by theta rhythm, which develops to represent highly compressed information for rapid learning. However, how the theta sequences were developed in a finer timescale within theta cycles remains unclear. In this study, we found in rats that sweep-ahead structure of theta sequences developing with exploration was predominantly dependent on a relatively large proportion of FG-cells, that is a subset of place cells dominantly phase-locked to fast gamma rhythms. These ensembles integrated compressed spatial information by cells consistently firing at precessing slow gamma phases within the theta cycle. Accordingly, the sweep-ahead structure of FG-cell sequences was positively correlated with the intensity of slow gamma phase precession, in particular during early development of theta sequences. These findings highlight the dynamic network modulation by fast and slow gamma in the development of theta sequences which may further facilitate memory encoding and retrieval.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91245">Developing a crop- wild-reservoir pathogen system to understand pathogen evolution and emergence</a></h4>

              
                Crop pathogens reduce yield and contribute to global malnourishment. Surveillance not only detects presence/absence but also reveals genetic diversity, which can inform our understanding of rapid adaptation and control measures. An often neglected aspect is that pathogens may also use crop wild relatives as alternative hosts. This study develops the beet (<i>Beta vulgaris</i>) rust (<i>Uromyces beticola</i>) system to explore how crop pathogens evolve to evade resistance using a wild reservoir. We test predictions that crop selection will drive virulence gene differentiation and affect rates of sex between crop- and wild-host rust populations. We sequenced, assembled, and annotated the 588 Mb beet rust genome, developed a novel leaf peel pathogen DNA extraction protocol, and analysed genetic diversity in 42 wild and crop isolates. We found evidence for two populations: one containing exclusively wild-host isolates; the other containing all crop-host isolates, plus five wild isolates. Effectors showed greater diversity in the exclusively wild population and greater differentiation between populations. Preliminary evidence suggests the rates of sexual reproduction may differ between populations. This study highlights how differences in pathogen populations might be used to identify genes important for survival on crops and how reproduction might impact adaptation. These findings are relevant to all crop-reservoir systems and will remain unnoticed without comparison to wild reservoirs.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101888">Loss function of tumor suppressor FRMD8 confers resistance to tamoxifen therapy via a dual mechanism</a></h4>

              
                Approximately 40% ERα-positive breast cancer patients suffer from therapeutic resistance to tamoxifen. Although reduced ERα level is the major cause of tamoxifen resistance, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we report that FRMD8 raises the level of ERα at both transcriptional and post-translational layers. FRMD8 deficiency in <i>MMTV-Cre</i><sup>+</sup>; <i>Frmd8<sup>fl/fl</sup></i>; <i>PyMT</i> mice accelerates mammary tumor growth and loss of luminal phenotype, and confers tamoxifen resistance. Single-cell RNA profiling reveals that Frmd8 loss decreases the proportion of hormone-sensing differentiated epithelial cells and downregulates the levels of ERα. Mechanically, on one hand, loss of FRMD8 inhibits <i>ESR1</i> transcription via suppressing the expression of FOXO3A, a transcription factor of <i>ESR1</i>. On the other hand, FRMD8 interacts both with ERα and UBE3A, and disrupts the interaction of UBE3A with ERα, thereby blocking UBE3A-mediated ERα degradation. In breast cancer patients, <i>FRMD8</i> gene promoter is found hypermethylated and low level of FRMD8 predicts poor prognosis. Therefore, FRMD8 is an important regulator of ERα and may control therapeutic sensitivity to tamoxifen in ERα-positive breast cancer patients.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105199">Mechanisms that regulate the C1-C2B mutual inhibition control functional switch of UNC-13</a></h4>

              
                Munc13 plays a crucial role in short-term synaptic plasticity by regulating synaptic vesicle (SV) exocytosis and neurotransmitter release at the presynaptic terminals. However, the intricate mechanisms governing these processes have remained elusive due to the presence of multiple functional domains within Munc13, each playing distinct roles in neurotransmitter release. Here, we report a coordinated mechanism in the <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> Munc13 homolog UNC-13 that controls the functional switch of UNC-13 during synaptic transmission. Mutations disrupting the interactions of C1 and C2B with diacylglycerol (DAG) and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub>) on the plasma membrane induced the gain-of-function state of UNC-13L, the long UNC-13 isoform, resulting in enhanced SV release. Concurrent mutations in both domains counteracted this enhancement, highlighting the functional interdependence of C1 and C2B. Intriguingly, the individual C1 and C2B domains exhibited significantly stronger facilitation of SV release compared to the presence of both domains, supporting a mutual inhibition of C1 and C2B under basal conditions. Moreover, the N-terminal C2A and X domains exhibited opposite regulation on the functional switch of UNC-13L. Furthermore, we identified the polybasic motif in the C2B domain that facilitates SV release. Finally, we found that disruption of C1 and C2B membrane interaction in UNC-13S, the short isoform, leads to functional switch between gain-of-function and loss-of-function. Collectively, our findings provide a novel mechanism for SV exocytosis wherein UNC-13 undergoes functional switches through the coordination of its major domains, thereby regulating synaptic transmission and short-term synaptic plasticity.

">Reduced occurrence of alpha waves during resting state predicts high ADHD traits in young adults</a></h4>

              
                Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental condition with significant cognitive and social impacts. Identifying reliable biomarkers for ADHD is crucial for developing personalized therapies. Electroencephalography (EEG) alpha oscillations (8 -12 Hz) have been suggested as a potential biomarker, but findings have been inconsistent. This study aimed to investigate whether alpha oscillations in young adulthood are associated with high ADHD traits using EEG data from a large twin sample (N = 556) enriched with participants with ADHD and autism. We assessed whether alpha oscillations during rest were associated with high ADHD traits through logistic regression analysis. In addition, we used twin modelling to estimate the heritability of EEG alpha measures and their relationship with ADHD traits. Results showed that relative alpha power was a significant predictor of ADHD traits when controlling for other factors such as age, sex and autistic traits. Specifically, we found that for each unit decrease in relative alpha power, the likelihood of being in the high ADHD trait group increased by approximately 26%. Further analysis suggested that group differences were due to a reduced occurrence (but not amplitude) of oscillatory bursts in the alpha range. Finally, our twin modelling results suggested that although alpha power is heritable, the genetic factors contributing to individual differences in alpha measures and ADHD traits were largely independent. Together, these findings suggest that reduced alpha oscillations, particularly occurrence of alpha bursts, may serve as a potential biomarker for ADHD. Our results may have implications for neuromodulation therapies targeting alpha rhythms in ADHD, such as neurofeedback and transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS).

We hypothesized that this deficit would vary with the severity of Autism related symptoms and assessed this relationship in a behavioral speech in noise task (n = 32) and a functional neuroimaging study (n = 37). We found that Calibrated Symptom Severity Scores (CSS) were associated with poorer audiovisual performance but not performance in the auditory- alone condition indicating that impairments are limited to multisensory information processing. These findings underscore the validity of MS deficits and their potential relevance to the broader symptomatology in ASD. We also found that CSS significantly correlated with the hemodynamic responses to AV stimulation. Here, higher the symptom severity was associated with lower multisensory gain in dorsal speech and language regions. Subsequent exploratory analysis suggested that individuals with ASD may not engage speech motor regions in similar ways to TD individuals. These results differed from findings in our previous study (Ross et al., 2024) where a direct comparison between TD and ASD BOLD effect revealed differences in activation in mostly frontal regions, not associated with the task.

">Systematic modulation of sensorimotor learning by domain-specific working memory</a></h4>

              
                People differ in how quickly they learn and adapt sensorimotor skills, and these differences have been linked to individual variation in working memory capacity (WMc). In tasks that can be supported by cognitive strategies, visuospatial WMc has been proposed as a key contributor. However, it remains unclear whether this association reflects domain-specific mechanisms or domain-general executive resources, and whether it extends beyond spatial memory to other visual features. Here, we systematically tested whether domain-specific or domain-general WMc predicts adaptation across three visuomotor adaptation (VMA) tasks known to differentially engage explicit and implicit learning systems. After obtaining independent measures of spatial and feature-based WMc, healthy subjects completed (1) a standard VMA task, which engages both explicit and implicit learning systems; (2) a delayed feedback VMA task, which isolates explicit learning; and (3) a clamped feedback VMA task, which isolates implicit learning. Our results provide converging evidence in support of a domain-specific association between spatial WMc and individual differences in learning. In Experiments 1 and 2, greater spatial WMc was associated with robust increases in explicit learning whereas featured-based WMc was not associated with learning outcomes. Surprisingly, in Experiment 3, greater spatial WMc was associated with reduced implicit learning, suggesting an interaction between latent cognitive capacities and implicit learning not accounted for by traditional models. These results shed light on the precise cognitive capacties underlying sensorimotor adaptation and provide novel insight into domain-specific links between spatial WM and motor learning.

">Vowel-like patterns modulate auditory P100m response but not its association with language abilities in children with ASD</a></h4>

              
                Background The P100/P100m component of auditory event-related potentials/fields is considered a potential biomarker of atypical arousal and language abnormalities in children with ASD. When elicited by complex speech-like sounds with regular temporal or frequency structure, P100/P100m may be influenced by sustained negativity (SN), which can reduce its amplitude due to opposing current polarity. Methods Using MEG, we investigated how acoustic regularities affect P100m latency and amplitude differences between TD children and those with ASD. MEG was recorded in 35 ASD and 39 TD boys (7-12 years) in response to control sounds (non-periodic, non-vowels) and stimuli with temporal regularity (periodic non-vowels), frequency regularity (non-periodic vowels), or both (periodic vowels). P100m was estimated using distributed source localization. Results In both groups, P100m amplitude and latency decreased in response to acoustic regularities, accompanied by a proportional increase in SN. No group differences were observed in P100m latency, amplitude, or their modulation by stimulus characteristics. In ASD, P100m latency variability was increased, and higher P100m amplitudes in the left auditory cortex were negatively associated with cumulative language and intellectual abilities. Conclusions In children, changes in P100m in response to acoustic regularities are most parsimoniously explained by an enhancement of SN with opposite polarity. No consistent relationship was found between P100m parameters or their modulation by acoustic regularities and ASD diagnosis. However, variations in cortical maturation and/or habituation processes, which affect the left-hemispheric P100m, may be relevant to cognitive and language functioning in children with ASD.

">A common framework for semantic memory and semantic composition</a></h4>

              
                How the brain constructs meaning from individual words and phrases is a fundamental question for research in semantic cognition, language and their disorders. These two aspects of meaning are traditionally studied separately, resulting in two large, multi-method literatures, which we sought to bring together in this study. Not only would this address basic cognitive questions of how semantic cognition operates but also because, despite their distinct focuses, both literatures ascribe a critical role to the anterior temporal lobe (ATL) in each aspect of semantics. Given these considerations, we explored the notion that these systems rely on common underlying computational principles when activating conceptual semantic representations via single words, vs. building a coherent semantic representation across sequences of words. The present study used magnetoencephalography and electroencephalography to track brain activity in participants reading nouns and adjective-noun phrases, whilst integrating conceptual variables from both literatures: the concreteness of nouns (e.g., "lettuce" vs. "fiction") and the denotational semantics of adjectives (subsective vs. privative; e.g., "bad" vs. "fake"). Region-of-interest analyses show that the left, and to a lesser extent the right, ATLs responded more strongly to phrases at different timepoints, irrespective of concreteness, suggesting a unified ATL function for semantic memory and composition. Decoding analyses further revealed a time-varying representational format for adjective semantics, whereas representations of noun concreteness were more stable and maintained for around 300 ms. Further, the neural representation of noun concreteness was modulated by the preceding adjectives: decoders learning concreteness signals in single words generalized better to subsective relative to privative phrases.

">The molecular and cellular underpinnings of human brain lateralization</a></h4>

              
                Hemispheric specialization is a fundamental characteristic of human brain organization, where most individuals exhibit left-hemisphere dominance for language and right-hemisphere dominance for visuospatial attention. While some lateralized functions are evident in other species, the human brain displays a strong, species-wide bias. Despite the evolutionary and functional significance of these asymmetries, their molecular and cellular foundations remain poorly understood. Here, we identify key neurochemical and cellular asymmetries that underpin cortical lateralization. Specifically, we demonstrate lateralized gradients in neurotransmitter receptor densities, particularly along the acetylcholine-norepinephrine axis, as well as asymmetries in mitochondrial distribution and the spatial prevalence of microglia and glutamatergic excitatory neurons. Using a multimodal approach that integrates in vivo functional MRI, PET imaging, and post-mortem transcriptomic and cellular data, we delineate two distinct cortical clusters: a left-lateralized network centered on language processing and a right-lateralized network supporting visuospatial attention. These results highlight a biologically embedded substrate for lateralized cognition that may inform both evolutionary theory and our mechanistic understanding of neuropsychiatric illnesses characterized by disrupted lateralization.

">Rapid prey capture learning drives a slow resetting of network activity in rodent binocular visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                Neocortical neurons possess stable firing rate set points to which they faithfully return when perturbed. These set points are established early and are stable through adulthood, suggesting they are immutable. Here we challenge this idea using an ethological vision-dependent prey capture learning paradigm in juvenile rats. This learning required visual cortex (V1), and enhanced tuning of V1 neurons to specific behavioral epochs. Chronic recordings revealed a slow, state-dependent increase in V1 firing that began after learning was complete and persisted for days. This upward firing rate plasticity was gradual, gated by wake states, and in L2/3 was driven by a TNF-dependent increase in excitatory synapses onto pyramidal neurons, all features of homeostatic plasticity within V1. Finally, TNF inhibition after learning reduced retention of hunting skills. Thus, naturalistic learning in juvenile animals co-opts homeostatic forms of plasticity to reset firing rate setpoints within V1, in a process that facilitates skill consolidation.

">Vascular endothelial-specific loss of TGF-beta signaling as a model for choroidal neovascularization and central nervous system vascular inflammation</a></h4>

              
                In mice, postnatal endothelial cell (EC)-specific knockout of the genes coding for Transforming Growth Factor-Beta Receptor (TGFBR)1 and/or TGFBR2 eliminates TGF-beta signaling in vascular ECs and leads to distinctive central nervous system (CNS) vascular phenotypes. Knockout mice exhibit (1) reduced intra-retinal vascularization, (2) choroidal neovascularization with occasional anastomoses connecting choroidal and intraretinal vasculatures, (3) infiltration of diverse immune cells into the retina, including macrophages, T-cells, B-cells, NK cells, and dendritic cells, (4) a close physical association between immune cells and retinal vasculature, (5) a pro-inflammatory transcriptional state in CNS ECs, with increased ICAM1 immunoreactivity, and (6) increased Smooth Muscle Actin immunostaining in CNS pericytes. Comparisons of the retinal phenotype with two other genetic models of retinal hypovascularization - loss of Norrin/Fzd4 signaling and loss of VEGF signaling - shows that the immune cell infiltrate is greatest with loss of TGF-beta signaling, more modest with loss of Norrin/Fzd4 signaling, and undetectable with loss of VEGF signaling. The phenotypes caused by loss of TGF-beta signaling in ECs recapitulate some of the cardinal features of retinal and neurologic diseases associated with vascular inflammation. These observations suggest that therapies that promote TGF-beta-dependent anti-inflammatory responses in ECs could represent a promising strategy for disease modulation.

">Prevention of Transgene Silencing During Human PluripotentStem Cell Differentiation</a></h4>

              
                While high and stable transgene expression can be achieved in undifferentiated pluripotent stem cells, conventional transgene expression systems are often silenced upon differentiation. Silencing occurs with both randomly integrated transgenes, introduced via transposase or lentiviral methods, and with transgenes targeted to specific genomic sites, including at commonly used safe harbor loci. The challenge to robustly express experimental transgenes in differentiated pluripotent stem cells is a major bottleneck in the field for applications such as CRISPR screening. Here, we conducted a comparative analysis to systematically evaluate the impact of various promoters, transcriptional regulatory elements, insulators, and genomic integration sites on transgene silencing during neuronal differentiation. Our findings reveal that specific combinations of promoters and transcriptional stability elements are able to prevent transgene silencing during differentiation, whereas chromatin insulators had less impact on silencing and three novel safe harbor integration sites performed similarly to the CLYBL locus. Guided by these insights we developed the PiggyBac vector TK4, which showed complete resistance to transgene silencing across various neuronal and microglial differentiation protocols from six different pluripotent stem cell lines, as independently confirmed by seven different laboratories. This construct will be highly useful for assays requiring stable transgene expression during differentiation, and holds the potential for broad applications in various research fields.

">Conjugated GLP-1 and Estradiol Treatment as a Novel Treatment for Age-related Cognitive Decline in Males and Females</a></h4>

              
                Middle age represents a critical window for metabolic and cognitive health, particularly in the context of rising obesity and diabetes rates. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1)-based therapies, which regulate blood glucose and body weight, show sex-specific effects, with estradiol potentiating their metabolic benefits. However, research on GLP-1s cognitive and neuroprotective roles has largely been conducted in males. Here, we investigated the effects of GLP-1 conjugated to estradiol (GE2) on metabolism, cognition, inflammation and neurogenesis in the hippocampus of middle-aged male and female rats fed a standard (SD) or Western (WD) diet. In both sexes, WD increased body weight, and plasma leptin levels. Furthermore, GE2 treatment led to weight loss, enhanced cued and contextual fear memory, reduced inflammation in the hippocampus in SD rats and increased neurogenesis in the dorsal hippocampus. Sex-specific differences were observed in fat distribution, glucose regulation, central inflammation and neuroplasticity after WD and GE2 treatment. In females only, GE2 reduced visceral (gonadal) fat, reduced inflammation in the dorsal hippocampus and improved basal blood glucose in response to a WD. In males only, GE2 normalised reduced hippocampal neurogenesis after a WD and reduced inflammation in the amygdala. These findings suggest that although WD increased body weight and GE2 improved associative learning in both sexes, both WD and GE2 had differential affects on metabolic hormones, insulin regulation, inflammation and neuroplasticity. Our findings underscore the importance of sex-specific approaches in metabolic and neuroprotective therapeutics in middle-age.

                Cryopreservation at ultra-low temperatures is a valuable tool for preserving cells and tissues used in research. However, few protocols exist for the preservation of brain organoid models. Current methods for preserving human cortical organoids (hCOs) rely on conventional slow cooling approaches with organoids suspended in a medium containing a cocktail of cryoprotectants. In contrast, we have optimized a vitrification technique previously used to cryopreserve human embryos and oocytes for application to hCOs. We have successfully cryopreserved hCOs that were generated by two different protocols. The vitrified organoids demonstrate a growth rate, cytoarchitecture, cell type composition and electrical activity comparable to non-vitrified controls. Our hCO cryopreservation method provides a useful alternative approach for bio-banking and cross-institutional collaboration using cortical organoids as their model system.

">Optical activation of midbrain dopamine neurons: do high and low stimulation frequencies produce functionally different effects?</a></h4>

              
                Millard et al. propose that 20- and 50-Hz stimulation of optically excitable, midbrain dopamine neurons triggers functionally distinct effects: The "physiological" firing elicited by a 20-Hz train mimics a reward-prediction error (RPE) whereas the "supra-physiological" firing induced by a 50-Hz train creates "a sensory event that acts as a reward in its own right." Only the 50-Hz trains supported vigorous responding in the face of elevated response costs and sufficed to produce reward-specific Pavlovian-Instrumental Transfer (PIT). Nonetheless, the 20-Hz trains did produce unblocking. Here, we propose a more parsimonious account of these findings that is consistent with the results of prior experiments on operant responding for rewarding optical or electrical stimulation and with a new theory of the role of dopamine signaling in associative conditioning: 1) The effects of the 20- and 50-Hz trains differ quantitatively rather than qualitatively. They are mapped onto a single dimension, reward intensity, which reflects the aggregate release of dopamine in the critical terminal field(s). 2) The non-linear dependence of operant responding on both the aggregate dopamine release and the response cost can explain why responding for the 20- and 50 Hz trains diverged as response cost grew and predicts that this divergence can be eliminated by increasing the number of dopamine neurons stimulated. 3) Terminal-field dopamine concentration provides no information about pulse frequency per se. 4) Operant responding, PIT, and unblocking all depend on reward intensity, but the form and parameters of this dependence can differ, thus generating the observed contrasts in the impact of the 20- and 50-Hz trains. 5) The tested range of experimental conditions is too narrow to specify what constitutes "physiological" firing.

">Putting causality into context: Causal capture escapes the visual adaptation of causality</a></h4>

              
                Results from psychophysical studies using visual adaptation suggest that launch detectors in the visual system underlie the perception of causality in simple visual events. These detectors respond to events in which one stimulus collides with another stimulus (i.e., a launch), and do not respond to events where one stimulus passes over another (i.e., a pass). Prolonged visual adaptation to launches significantly reduces observers' propensity to see causal launches at the same retinotopic location. This finding could be taken to indicate that launch detectors are necessary for the local detection of causal launches. However, contextual events that are spatially separated from the test event location shift observers' perception of a causal relation in the direction of the type of contextual event (Scholl & Nakayama, 2002), providing evidence for spatial integration beyond a specific retinotopic location. Here, we used visual adaptation as a tool to investigate whether the contextual influence on causal perception relies on local launch detectors. Before and after adaptation, we determined the proportion of reported launches in ambiguous test events in the presence of no context, launch context, and pass context events. We hypothesized that if the contextual influence relies on (unadapted) local launch detectors, then visual adaptation should affect the contextual influence on causal perception. Before adaptation, a launch-context event increased the proportion of reported launches (while a pass context event decreased it). Visual adaptation to launches significantly decreased the proportion of reported launches in no-context trials, but did not affect perceptual reports in no-context trials. In fact, contextual influences, expressed relative to no-context trials, emerged strongly after adaptation. This result suggests that context effects override strong negative aftereffects from adaptation, indicating that contextual influences operate at a level that bypasses the local launch detector at the adapted location.

">Candidate NAMPT modulators from traditional African, Chinese, and Russian medicinal plants</a></h4>

              
                The mitochondrial bioenergetics hypothesis postulates a critical role of mitochondrial activity in aging, which leads to the development of age-related diseases if disturbed. NAD+ and NADH generate a powerful oxidoreductive system driving ATP production in mitochondria, therefore, the maintenance of the NAD+/NADH ratio is crucial for the metabolic homeostasis in cells. The activation of nicotinamide phosphoribosyl transferase (NAMPT) is a superior approach to increase cellular levels of NAD+ since it is a rate-limiting enzyme of NAD+ salvage pathway producing NAD+ precursor nicotinamide mononucleotide. NAMPT inhibitors are, however, also desired by pharmaceutical applications due to their potency in limiting the growth of cancer cells. The present work demonstrates an in-silico approach for screening NAMPT activity modulators using compound libraries from traditional African, Chinese, and Russian medicinal plants. The compounds predicted to pass the blood-brain barrier, with low predicted toxicity and desirable pharmacokinetic and drug-likeness characteristics, were subjected to further selection by molecular docking using CB-Dock2. A panel of 21 compounds, including known NAMPT activators, inhibitors, negative controls, and randomly chosen compounds, was used to validate the docking method. The selection yielded 17 compounds with increased docking scores when tested against 6 co-crystallized structures of NAMPT. Their 2D protein-ligand interactions were critically evaluated and correlated with known interactions of the NAMPT activators and inhibitors with the active and allosteric sites of the enzyme. The selected compounds are suitable for the experimental pharmaceutical developments of drugs for aging, neurological diseases, and cancer treatments.

Participants performed a reaction time task in a magnetic resonance scanner while being exposed to face and place stimuli with a distinct probabilistic distribution resulting in unexpected omissions and unexpected presentations of those stimuli. Participants’ responses were significantly faster for expected as compared to neutral or unexpected trials, showing that they learned the statistical regularities inherent to the task. Moreover, the region of interest analysis of beta estimates extracted from the fusiform face area and the parahippocampal place area revealed co-occurring negative and positive prediction error signals. This was evidenced by increases in brain activation for unexpected omissions and unexpected presentations of visual stimuli when compared to expected stimuli. Our results also underlined that these effects occur independently of stimulus repetition effects.

However, these studies often involved small samples, applied just a few graph theory measures in each study, and yielded inconsistent results, making it challenging to identify the architectural underpinnings of GCA.

                <p>Human motor skill acquisition is improved by performance feedback, and coupling such feedback with extrinsic reward (such as money) can enhance skill learning. However, the neurophysiology underlying such behavioral effect is unclear. To bridge this gap, we assessed the effects of reward on multiple forms of motor plasticity during skill learning. Sixty-five healthy participants divided into three groups performed a pinch-grip skill task with sensory feedback only, sensory and reinforcement feedback, or both feedback coupled with an extrinsic monetary reward during skill training. To probe motor plasticity, we applied transcranial magnetic stimulation at rest, on the left primary motor cortex before, at an early-training time point, and after training in the three groups and measured motor-evoked potentials from task-relevant muscle of the right arm. This allowed us to evaluate the amplitude and variability of corticospinal output, GABAergic short-intracortical inhibition, and use-dependent plasticity before training and at two additional time points (early and end training). At the behavioral level, monetary reward accelerated skill learning. In parallel, corticospinal output became less variable early on during training in the presence of extrinsic reward. Interestingly, this effect was particularly pronounced for participants who were more sensitive to reward, as evaluated in an independent questionnaire. Other measures of motor excitability remained comparable across groups. These findings highlight that a mechanism underlying the benefit of reward on motor skill learning is the fine-tuning of early-training resting-state corticospinal variability.</p>

                <p>Perceptual decision-making describes the process of selecting an appropriate action based on the sensory information present in the immediate environment and is hence an omnipresent factor in the life of animals. In preclinical research, a widespread approach to study the neuronal correlates of perceptual decision-making is to record (and manipulate) neuronal activity in head-fixed mice performing behavioral tasks. In contrast to the technologies used to record/manipulate neuronal activity, standardization of the behavioral training of mice is generally neglected, a circumstance that is particularly true for behavioral tasks involving auditory stimuli. Here, we present the DMC-Behavior Platform, an open-source, cost-efficient framework for training head-fixed mice in perceptual decision-making tasks involving auditory stimuli. Combining the DMC-Behavior Platform with strategies to record and manipulate neuronal activity offers many opportunities to test hypotheses on the neuronal underpinnings of cognitive processes. We demonstrate the utility of the platform by training mice on auditory variants of three behavioral tasks commonly used to study perceptual decision-making: a detection, a Go/NoGo, and a two-alternative forced choice task. The presented work establishes the seamless integration and synchronization of external devices to record neuronal activity, task-related, and nontask-related behavioral variables. Our platform provides a valuable tool for more standardized and reproducible investigations into the neuronal circuits underlying auditory-guided decision-making.</p>

                <p>Humans can adapt their movements in response to expected and unexpected perturbations. The speed and accuracy of these movement corrections may depend on the type of sensory information driving the perception of these perturbations. While previous research has indicated that corrections based on somatosensory information, comprised of proprioceptive and tactile inputs, are faster than corrections based on visual information, other studies have found comparable correction speeds in response to visual and tactile inputs. The purpose of this study was to systematically investigate the latencies (how fast) and magnitudes (how large) of movement corrections in response to perturbations of external visual targets, as well as somatosensory (proprioceptive and tactile) and tactile targets on the non-reaching limb. Participants performed reaching movements to a light-emitting diode (i.e., visual target), the felt position of a brush touching the index finger of the non-reaching hand (i.e., a tactile target), and the index finger of their non-reaching hand (somatosensory target). During some trials, the target was displaced 3&nbsp;cm away or toward the participant either before or after the movement onset. Participants demonstrated faster and larger corrections to somatosensory target perturbations than to visual or tactile target perturbations. However, corrections to visual targets were more accurate than corrections to tactile targets. These findings support the hypothesis that distinct sensorimotor processes may underlie the adjustments made in response to somatosensory information versus those made in response to visual and tactile information.</p>

                Background Metastatic dissemination is critically reliant on the formation of a receptive niche, a process which is thought to rely on signals derived from the primary tumor. Lymph nodes are continuously exposed to such signals through the flow of afferent lymph, allowing the potential reprograming of lymphoid tissue stroma in support of metastases or immunosuppression. The objective of this study was therefore to better characterize tumor-driven transcriptomic changes occurring to specific stromal populations within the tumor-draining lymph node. Methods We utilize single cell RNA sequencing of dissociated LN tissue extracted from tumor-bearing and naïve mice to profile the reprograming of tissue stroma within the pre-metastatic lymph node. Results Resulting data provides transcriptomic evidence of tumor-induced imprinting on marginal reticular cells (MRCs) and floor lymphatic endothelial cells (fLECs) populating the subcapsular sinus. These alterations appear to be unique to the tumor-draining LN and are not observed during inflammatory antigenic challenge. Notably, MRCs exhibit characteristics reminiscent of early desmoplastic CAF differentiation, fLECs engage distinct chemoattractant pathways thought to facilitate recruitment of circulating cancer cells, and both stromal populations exhibit signs of metabolic reprograming and immune-modulating potential. Conclusions Cumulatively, these findings build upon existing literature describing pre-metastatic niche formation and offer several promising avenues for future exploration.

                Background The number of overweight people (BMI 25–29.9kg.m-2) in the world is increasing, which increases the risk of health problems and psychological difficulties. To reduce these risks, it is imperative to address unhealthy habits including food and exercise. This qualitative study aimed to explore the needs, perceptions, and preferences of overweight individuals on tailored exercise programs that incorporate educational videos. Methodology Forty Individuals between the age of 18-30 years with a BMI of 25-29.9kg.m-2 were included in the study using Purposive sampling from October 2023 to November 2023. Semi-structured in-depth interview was conducted for 45-60 minutes approximately among both active and inactive overweight individuals by a researcher trained in qualitative research. These interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Thematic analysis was performed using inductive and deductive approaches to identify the recurrent patterns, themes, and insights in the transcribed interviews. Results 8 themes, such as lifestyle factors, exercise explorations, holistic wellbeing and 44 subthemes emerged from the analysis, helping to shed light on the needs, perceptions, and preferences that overweight individuals experience when it comes to their preference for a customized exercise program provided through educational video. The participants wanted personalized regimens that catered to their requirements and levels of fitness. Conclusion In summary, the findings emphasize the value of educational videos that are easy to use, visually appealing, and supported by science. These videos should emphasize technique, varying levels of difficulty, and brief sessions.

                <p>by Sorenza P. Bastiaens, Davide Momi, John D. Griffiths</p>

The electroencephalographic alpha rhythm is one of the most robustly observed and widely studied empirical phenomena in all of neuroscience. However, despite its extensive implication in a wide range of cognitive processes and clinical pathologies, the mechanisms underlying alpha generation in neural circuits remain poorly understood. In this paper we offer a renewed foundation for research on this question, by undertaking a systematic comparison and synthesis of the most prominent theoretical models of alpha rhythmogenesis in the published literature. We focus on four models, each studied intensively by multiple authors over the past three decades: (i) Jansen-Rit, (ii) Moran-David-Friston, (iii) Robinson-Rennie-Wright, and (iv) Liley-Wright. Several common elements are identified, such as the use of second-order differential equations and sigmoidal potential-to-rate operators to represent population-level neural activity. Major differences are seen in other features such as wiring topologies and conduction delays. Through a series of mathematical analyses and numerical simulations, we nevertheless demonstrate that the selected models can be meaningfully compared, by associating parameters and circuit motifs of analogous biological significance. With this established, we conduct explorations of rate constant and synaptic connectivity parameter spaces, with the aim of identifying common patterns in key behaviours, such as the role of excitatory-inhibitory interactions in the generation of oscillations. Finally, using linear stability analysis we identify two qualitatively different alpha-generating dynamical regimes across the models: (i) noise-driven fluctuations and (ii) self-sustained limit-cycle oscillations, emerging due to an Andronov-Hopf bifurcation. The comprehensive survey and synthesis developed here can, we suggest, be used to help guide future theoretical and experimental work aimed at disambiguating these and other candidate theories of alpha rhythmogenesis.

                <p>by James B. Grotberg, Francesco Romanò, John C. Grotberg</p>

The air-blood barrier protects the lung from blood/serum entering the air spaces, i.e., from “drowning in your own fluids”. Failure leads to pulmonary edema, a regularly fatal complication during the Covid-19 pandemic which claimed 7 million lives worldwide. Finding no mathematical models for the underlying fluid mechanics, we created the first. Governing flow equations for alveolar capillary, interstitium, and alveolus are coupled by crossflows at the capillary and epithelial membranes and end-exit flows to the lymphatics. Case examples include normal/recovery, cardiogenic pulmonary edema, acute respiratory distress syndrome, effects of positive end expiratory pressure, and a wide range of parameter values for permeability of the membranes and interstitial matrix. Previously unknown membrane fluid shear stresses calculate to values that affect cell function in many systems. We add active epithelial reabsorption which has two effects: shifting streamlines to favor alveolar-lymphatic clearance and adding to the direct alveolar-capillary clearance. Simple algebraic equations are derived for the interstitial fluid pressure, p<sub>i</sub>, membrane crossflow velocities and the critical capillary pressure, p<sub>crit</sub>, above which edema occurs. For validation, the p<sub>crit</sub> predictions fit clinical definitions and flow calculations of lymphatic vs capillary clearance match animal experimental data. For decades the value of p<sub>i</sub> has been imposed as an input, whereas we calculate the value as an output. They don’t agree. Since the space is too small for measurements, the ability to calculate p<sub>i</sub> and p<sub>crit</sub> offers new insights, questions long-held beliefs, and opens applications from physiological studies to personalized clinical care.

Despite hosting some of the highest concentrations of biodiversity and providing invaluable goods and services in the oceans, coral reefs are under threat from global change and other local human impacts. Changes in living ecosystems often induce changes in their acoustic characteristics, but despite recent efforts in passive acoustic monitoring of coral reefs, rapid measurement and identification of changes in their soundscapes remains a challenge. Here we present the new open-source software <i>CoralSoundExplorer</i>, which is designed to study and monitor coral reef soundscapes. <i>CoralSoundExplorer</i> uses machine learning approaches and is designed to eliminate the need to extract conventional acoustic indices. To demonstrate <i>CoralSoundExplorer</i>’s functionalities, we use and analyze a set of recordings from three coral reef sites, each with different purposes (undisturbed site, tourist site and boat site), located on the island of Bora-Bora in French Polynesia. We explain the <i>CoralSoundExplorer</i> analysis workflow, from raw sounds to ecological results, detailing and justifying each processing step. We detail the software settings, the graphical representations used for visual exploration of soundscapes and their temporal dynamics, along with the analysis methods and metrics proposed. We demonstrate that <i>CoralSoundExplorer</i> is a powerful tool for identifying disturbances affecting coral reef soundscapes, combining visualizations of the spatio-temporal distribution of sound recordings with new quantification methods to characterize soundscapes at different temporal scales.

                <p>by Jan Felix, Steven De Munck, J. Fernando Bazan, Savvas N. Savvides</p>

Activation of Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) and leukocyte tyrosine kinase (LTK) by their cognate cytokines ALKAL2 and ALKAL1 plays important roles in development, metabolism, and cancer. Recent structural studies revealed ALK/LTK-cytokine assemblies with distinct stoichiometries. Structures of ALK-ALKAL2 and LTK-ALKAL1 complexes with 2:1 stoichiometry determined by X-ray crystallography contrasted the 2:2 ALK-ALKAL2 complexes determined by cryo-EM and X-ray crystallography. Here, we show based on reanalysis of the cryo-EM data deposited in EMPIAR-10930 that over half of the ALK-ALKAL2 particles in the dataset are classified into 2D and 3D classes obeying a 2:1 stoichiometry besides the originally reported structure displaying 2:2 stoichiometry. Unlike particles representing the 2:2 ALK-ALKAL2 complex, particles for the 2:1 ALK-ALKAL2 complex suffer severely from preferred orientations that resulted in cryo-EM maps displaying strong anisotropy. Here, we show that extensive particle orientation rebalancing in cryoSPARC followed by 3D refinement with Blush regularization in RELION constitutes an effective strategy for avoiding map artifacts relating to preferred particle orientations and report a 3D reconstruction of the 2:1 ALK-ALKAL2 complex to 3.2 Å resolution from EMPIAR-10930. This new cryo-EM structure together with the crystal structures of ALK-ALKAL2 and LTK-ALKAL1 complexes with 2:1 stoichiometry reconciles a common receptor dimerization mode for ALK and LTK and provides direct evidence for the presence of an ALK-ALKAL2 complex with 2:1 stoichiometry next to the reported 2:2 stoichiometric assembly in the EMPIAR-10930 dataset. Finally, our analysis emphasizes the importance of public deposition of raw cryo-EM data to allow reanalysis and interpretation.

                <p>by Masak Takaine, Rikuri Morita, Yuto Yoshinari, Takashi Nishimura</p>

De novo purine synthesis (DPS) is up-regulated under conditions of high purine demand to ensure the production of genetic materials and chemical energy, thereby supporting cell proliferation. However, the regulatory mechanisms governing DPS remain unclear. We herein show that PRPP amidotransferase (PPAT), the rate-limiting enzyme in DPS, forms dynamic and motile condensates in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> cells under a purine-depleted environment. The formation and maintenance of condensates requires phase separation, which is driven by target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1)-induced ribosome biosynthesis. The self-assembly of PPAT molecules facilitates condensate formation, with intracellular PRPP and purine nucleotides both regulating this self-assembly. Moreover, molecular dynamics simulations suggest that clustering-mediated PPAT activation occurs through intermolecular substrate channeling. Cells unable to form PPAT condensates exhibit growth defects, highlighting the physiological importance of condensation. These results indicate that PPAT condensation is an adaptive mechanism that regulates DPS in response to both TORC1 activity and cellular purine demands.

                <p>by Paul Hage, Mohammad Amin Fakharian, Alden M. Shoup, Jay S. Pi, Ehsan Sedaghat-Nejad, Simon P. Orozco, In Kyu Jang, Vivian Looi, Hisham Y. Elseweifi, Nazanin Mohammadrezaei, Alexander N. Vasserman, Toren Arginteanu, Reza Shadmehr</p>

We use our tongue much like our hands: to interact with objects and transport them. For example, we use our hands to sense properties of objects and transport them in the nearby space, and we use our tongue to sense properties of food morsels and transport them through the oral cavity. But what does the cerebellum contribute to control of tongue movements? Here, we trained head-fixed marmosets to make skillful tongue movements to harvest food from small tubes that were placed at sharp angles to their mouth. We identified the lingual regions of the cerebellar vermis and then measured the contribution of each Purkinje cell (P-cell) to control of the tongue by relying on the brief but complete suppression that they experienced following an input from the inferior olive. When a P-cell was suppressed during protraction, the tongue’s trajectory became hypermetric, and when the suppression took place during retraction, the tongue’s return to the mouth was slowed. Both effects were amplified when two P-cells were simultaneously suppressed. Moreover, these effects were present even when the pauses were not due to the climbing fiber input. Therefore, suppression of P-cells in the lingual vermis disrupted the forces that would normally decelerate the tongue as it approached the target. Notably, the population simple spike activity peaked near deceleration onset when the movement required precision (aiming for a tube), but not when the movement was for the purpose of grooming. Thus, the P-cells appeared to signal when to stop protrusion as the tongue approached its target.

Understanding how specific secretory cargoes are targeted to distinct domains of the plasma membrane in epithelial cells requires analyzing the trafficking of post-Golgi vesicles to their sites of secretion. We used the RUSH (retention using selective hooks) system to synchronously release an apical cargo, Cadherin 99C (Cad99C), and a basolateral cargo, the ECM protein Nidogen, from the endoplasmic reticulum and follow their movements to the plasma membrane. We also developed an interactive vesicle tracking framework, MSP-tracker and viewer, that exploits developments in computer vision and deep learning to determine vesicle trajectories in a noisy environment without the need for extensive training data. MSP-tracker outperformed other tracking software in detecting and tracking post-Golgi vesicles, revealing that Cad99c vesicles predominantly move apically with a mean speed of 1.1µm/sec. This is reduced to 0.85 µm/sec by a dominant slow dynein mutant, demonstrating that dynein transports Cad99C vesicles to the apical cortex. Furthermore, both the dynein mutant and microtubule depolymerization cause lateral Cad99C secretion. Thus, microtubule organization plays a central role in targeting apical secretion, suggesting that <i>Drosophila</i> does not have distinct apical versus basolateral vesicle fusion machinery. Nidogen vesicles undergo planar-polarized transport to the leading edge of follicle cells as they migrate over the ECM, whereas most Collagen is secreted at trailing edges. The follicle cells therefore bias secretion of different ECM components to opposite sides of the cell, revealing that the secretory pathway is more spatially organized than previously thought.

DeWitt, Pekka Kujala, Suzanne van Dijk, Judith Klumperman, Avi Ashkenazi</p>

Endoplasmic-reticulum resident inositol-requiring enzyme 1α (IRE1) supports protein homeostasis via its cytoplasmic kinase-RNase module. Known cancer dependency on IRE1 entails its enzymatic activation of the transcription factor XBP1s and regulated RNA decay. We discovered that some cancer cells surprisingly require IRE1 but not its enzymatic activity. IRE1 knockdown but not enzymatic IRE1 inhibition or XBP1 disruption attenuated cell cycle progression and tumor growth. IRE1 silencing led to activation of TP53 and CDKN1A/p21 in conjunction with increased DNA damage and chromosome instability, while decreasing heterochromatin as well as DNA and histone H3K9me3 methylation. Immunoelectron microscopy detected endogenous IRE1 at the nuclear envelope. Thus, cancer cells co-opt IRE1 either enzymatically or nonenzymatically, which has significant implications for IRE1’s biological role and therapeutic targeting.

                <p>by Jelena Trajkovic, Domenica Veniero, Simon Hanslmayr, Satu Palva, Gabriela Cruz, Vincenzo Romei, Gregor Thut</p>

Adaptive visual processing is enabled through the dynamic interplay between top-down and bottom-up (feedback/feedforward) information exchange, presumably propagated through brain oscillations. Here, we causally tested for the oscillatory mechanisms governing this interaction in the human visual system. Using concurrent transcranial magnetic stimulation-electroencephalography (TMS-EEG), we emulated top-down signals by a single TMS pulse over the frontal eye field (right FEF), while manipulating the strength of sensory input through the presentation of moving concentric gratings (compared to a control-TMS site). FEF-TMS without sensory input led to a top-down modulated occipital phase realignment, alongside higher fronto-occipital phase connectivity, in the alpha/beta band. Sensory input in the absence of FEF-TMS increased occipital gamma activity. Crucially, testing the interaction between top-down and bottom-up processes (FEF-TMS during sensory input) revealed an increased nesting of the bottom-up gamma activity in the alpha/beta-band cycles. This establishes a causal link between phase-to-power coupling and top-down modulation of feedforward signals, providing novel mechanistic insights into how attention interacts with sensory input at the neural level, shaping rhythmic sampling.

<i>SLC13A5</i> encodes a citrate transporter highly expressed in the brain and is important for regulating intra- and extracellular citrate levels. Mutations in this gene cause rare infantile epilepsy characterized by lifelong seizures, developmental delays, behavioral deficits, poor motor progression, and language impairments. SLC13A5 individuals respond poorly to treatment options; yet drug discovery programs are limited due to a paucity of animal models that phenocopy human symptoms. Here, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to create loss-of-function mutations in <i>slc13a5a</i> and <i>slc13a5b</i>, the zebrafish paralogs to human <i>SLC13A5</i>. <i>slc13a5</i> mutant larvae showed cognitive dysfunction and sleep disturbances, consistent with SLC13A5 individuals. These mutants also exhibited fewer neurons and a concomitant increase in apoptosis across the optic tectum, a region important for sensory processing. Further, <i>slc13a5</i> mutants displayed hallmark features of epilepsy, including an imbalance in glutamatergic and GABAergic excitatory-inhibitory gene expression, increased <i>fosab</i> expression, disrupted neurometabolism, and neuronal hyperexcitation as measured in vivo by extracellular field recordings and live calcium imaging. Mechanistically, we tested the involvement of NMDA signaling and zinc chelation in <i>slc13a5</i> mutant epilepsy-like phenotypes. Slc13a5 protein co-localizes with excitatory NMDA receptors in wild-type zebrafish and NMDA receptor expression is upregulated in the brain of <i>slc13a5</i> mutant larvae. Additionally, low levels of zinc are found in the plasma membrane of <i>slc13a5</i> mutants. NMDA receptor suppression and ZnCl<sub>2</sub> treatment in <i>slc13a5</i> mutant larvae rescued neurometabolic and hyperexcitable calcium events, as well as behavioral defects. These data provide empirical evidence in support of the hypothesis that excess extracellular citrate over-chelates the zinc ions needed to regulate NMDA receptor function, leading to sustained channel opening and an exaggerated excitatory response that manifests as seizures. These data show the utility of <i>slc13a5</i> mutant zebrafish for studying SLC13A5 epilepsy and open new avenues for drug discovery.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-423/v1?src=rss">NAD: Noise-augmented direct sequencing of target nucleic acids by augmenting with noise and selective sampling [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Next-generation sequencing necessitates a minimum quantity and concentration of DNA/RNA samples, typically achieved through amplification using the PCR technique. However, this amplification step introduces several drawbacks to biological insights, including PCR bias and the loss of epigenetic information. The advent of long-read sequencing technologies facilitates direct sequencing, with the primary constraint being the limited amount of DNA/RNA present in biological samples. Methods Here, we present a novel method called Noise-Augmented Direct (NAD) sequencing that enables the direct sequencing of target DNA even when it falls below the minimum quantity and concentration required for long-read sequencing by augmenting with noise DNA and adaptive sampling. Adaptive sampling is an emerging technology of nanopore sequencing, allowing the enhanced sequencing of target DNA by selectively depleting noise DNA. In this study, we use the DNA standard of the Lambda phage genome as the noise DNA to augment samples containing low amounts of bacterial genomes (1 ng to 300 ng). Results The results with cost-effective flow cells indicate that NAD sequencing successfully detects the target DNA with an input quantity as low as 1 ng, and the bacterial genome of Salmonella enterica can be assembled to 30% completion at an accuracy of 98% with an input quantity of 3 ng. With high throughput flow cells, the bacterial genome of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was assembled to near completion (99.9%) at an accuracy of 99.97% with an input quantity of 300 ng. Conclusions This proof-of-concept study demonstrates the potential of NAD sequencing in enhancing the robustness of long-read sequencing for small input DNA/RNA samples with noise augmentation and adaptive sampling.

                Background This study explores the pivotal role of women entrepreneurs in fostering economic growth and social transformation, focusing on micro and small enterprises (MSEs). Despite the significant rise in women entrepreneurship, challenges persist, including gender-based barriers, limited access to capital, and regional disparities. Understanding these dynamics is essential for formulating policies that support and empower women entrepreneurs. Method The present study employed a systematic literature review (SLR) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), an advanced topic modeling technique, to identify prevalent themes within the literature. Data was extracted from Scopus-indexed journals (2000–2024), systematically filtered, and analyzed to uncover key patterns in women entrepreneurship research. Results The analysis identifies four central themes: (1) Women in Entrepreneurship and Gender Roles, (2) Small Business and Women Enterprises, (3) Social Impact of Women Entrepreneurs, and (4) Challenges Faced by Female Entrepreneurs. The findings highlight the transformative potential of digital platforms in enhancing business opportunities for women and addressing traditional constraints, such as mobility and market access. Conclusion This study highlights the need for targeted interventions to enhance digital literacy, bridge socio-cultural disparities, and establishing inclusive policies that foster a supportive entrepreneurial ecosystem. By synthesizing existing literature, this research provides actionable recommendations for policymakers, financial institutions, and stakeholders to strengthen women-led enterprises and drive gender-equitable growth.

                Background Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) has improved diagnosis and treatment planning in paediatric dentistry, but no bibliometric studies have examined the research landscape. This study provides an overview regarding the role of CBCT in paediatric dentistry. Methods A bibliometric review was conducted using articles from the Web of Science database. The search was performed on 22 February 2024, including publications up to that date. Conference papers and editorials were excluded. Data extracted included citation counts, publication dates, journals, impact factors, study designs, topics, geographical and institutional affiliations, authors, and keywords. Collaborative networks were visualised using VOSviewer, and Spearman’s correlation assessed the relationship between citation counts and other variables. Results The review analysed 517 articles, with the most cited receiving 557 citations. Publication dates ranged from 2005 to 2024, with a peak in 2023. Observational studies were the most common, particularly on maxillary expansion. The American Journal of Orthodontics and Dentofacial Orthopedics was the most cited journal, and the USA was a major contributor. Jacobs R authored the most articles (n=19), and the University of Alberta led in institutional output. Spearman’s correlation showed a weak positive correlation between citation count and journal impact factor (rho=0.272, p<0.001) and a strong negative correlation with publication year (rho=-0.762, p<0.001). Conclusions This bibliometric review provides an overview of the use of CBCT in paediatric dentistry, particularly in maxillary expansion. The findings suggest that more specific imaging protocols may improve safety and clinical outcomes, and that further investigation of long-term outcomes may provide valuable insights.

                Background Breast cancer remains a significant global health concern, with over 7.8 million cases reported in the last five years. Early detection and accurate classification are crucial for reducing mortality rates and improving outcomes. Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a transformative tool in medical imaging, enabling more efficient and accurate diagnostic processes. Objective This study aims to develop a machine learning-based predictive model for early detection and classification of breast cancer using the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Diagnostic dataset. Methods The dataset, comprising 569 samples and 32 features derived from fine needle aspirate biopsy images, was pre-processed through data cleaning, normalization using the Robust Scaler, and feature selection. Five supervised ML algorithms—Logistic Regression, Support Vector Classification (SVC) with linear and radial basis function (RBF) kernels, Decision Tree, and Random Forest—were implemented. Models were evaluated using performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity, and F1 scores. Results The SVC-RBF model demonstrated the highest accuracy (98.68%) and balanced performance across other metrics, making it the most effective classifier for distinguishing between benign and malignant tumors. Key features such as texture mean and area (worst) significantly contributed to classification accuracy. Conclusions This study highlights the potential of ML algorithms, particularly SVC-RBF, to revolutionize breast cancer diagnostics through improved accuracy and efficiency. Future research should validate these findings with diverse datasets and explore their integration into clinical workflows to enhance decision-making and patient care.

     alt="Label-Free Multiphoton Imaging Reveals Volumetric Shifts Across Development in Sensory-Related Brain Regions of a Miniature Transparent Vertebrate"/>
<p>Third harmonic generation microscopy, a multiphoton imaging modality, reveals the relative volume or investment (RI) in sensory-related brain regions across development in <i>Danionella dracula</i>, a miniature teleost fish with a body and brain that remains transparent throughout life. RI in higher-order, multimodal integration centers such as the telencephalon increases as juveniles transition to adulthood. By contrast, RI in modality-dominant regions is essentially stable over development, as in the olfactory bulb, or is greatest prior to the juvenile–adult transition, as in the optic tectum.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Animals integrate information from different sensory modalities as they mature and perform increasingly complex behaviors. This may parallel differential investment in specific brain regions depending on the changing demands of sensory inputs. To investigate developmental changes in the volume of canonical sensory regions, we used third harmonic generation imaging for morphometric analysis of forebrain and midbrain regions from larval through juvenile and adult stages in <i>Danionella dracula</i>, a transparent, miniature teleost fish whose brain is optically accessible throughout its lifespan. Relative to whole-brain volume, increased volume or investment in the telencephalon, a higher order sensory integration center, shows the most dramatic increases between 30–60 days postfertilization (dpf) and again at 90 dpf as animals reach adulthood. The torus longitudinalis (TL), a midbrain visuomotor integration center, also significantly increases between 60 and 90 dpf. In contrast, investment in the midbrain optic tectum (TeO), a retinal-recipient target, progressively decreases from 30 to 90 dpf, whereas investment is relatively consistent across all stages for the midbrain torus semicircularis (TS), a secondary auditory and mechanosensory lateral line center, and the olfactory bulb (OB), a direct target of the olfactory epithelium. In sum, increased investment in higher-order integration centers (telencephalon, TL) occurs as juveniles reach adulthood (60–90 dpf) and exhibit more complex cognitive tasks, whereas investment in modality-dominant regions occurs earlier (TeO) or is relatively consistent across development (TS, OB). Complete optical access throughout <i>Danionella</i>’s lifespan provides a unique opportunity to investigate how changing brain structure over development correlates with changes in connectivity, microcircuitry, or behavior.</p>

                Han et al. show that subtle differences in the flexible outer layer of misfolded α-synuclein fibrils influence their capacity to spread pathology in the brain. This study uncovers the unrecognized critical role of fibrils’ fuzzy outer region in pathological transmission, suggesting a new therapeutic target for neurodegenerative disorders.

                Glogowska et al. show that pressure-induced opening of the mechanosensitive Piezo1 cationic channel in macrophages is potentiated by a chronic treatment with oxLDL or 7-ketocholesterol, while acutely inhibited by DHA. The differential modulation by pro- and anti-atherogenic lipids points to the importance of macrophage Piezo1 in atherosclerosis development and progression.

                Harrington et al. identified that the ribosomal factor EMG1 is involved in formation of specialized ribosomes during KSHV lytic replication. Its methyltransferase activity is responsible for preferential translation of KSHV ORFs. Depletion of EMG1 results in enhanced translation of KSHV uORFs, resulting in reduced viral late protein production.
